=Episode 9=

3
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:42,880
Did you lose anything?

4
00:01:43,362 --> 00:01:44,422
No, I didn't lose anything.

5
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:48,231
Rao Zhi.

6
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:49,513
Nothing suspicious is detected.

7
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:52,186
You guys are neglecting
what is right under your nose.

8
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:56,912
Could it be that before you left,

9
00:01:57,269 --> 00:01:59,170
you opened the window
but you forgot about it?

10
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:00,767
Could it someone else in the house
have opened the window...

11
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:01,868
but didn't inform you?

12
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:04,203
There's no way I could've forgotten
that I opened the window.

13
00:02:04,397 --> 00:02:07,373
I'm not sure
if anyone else opened the window.

14
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,650
I think it's better to be cautious.

15
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,400
Please investigate for me, Mr. Rao.

16
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,311
How about this?

17
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:14,501
I'll get someone to check the surveillance
of the surrounding streets.

18
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:16,691
I'll contact you if anything.

19
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:17,801
Sure.

20
00:02:18,327 --> 00:02:19,227
Let's go back.

21
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,171
-It's my...
-Stop moving. Sit down and watch.

22
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:53,491
It's Er Miao.

23
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:55,466
Did it lose weight?

24
00:02:58,521 --> 00:02:59,830
Do you have any other videos?

25
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:01,771
No.
That's the only video.

26
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:03,682
Please send it to me.

27
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,001
Xia Chu.

28
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:17,990
When you left home,

29
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,771
did you open the window
in the master room?

30
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:21,633
I can't remember.

31
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:23,854
Did I? I don't think so.

32
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:30,031
What's wrong?

33
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:31,271
Nothing.

34
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,190
It's my darling Er Miao.

35
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,171
I really miss it.

36
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:44,181
-You call it Er...
-Miao.

37
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:49,491
Why are you laughing?

38
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:50,681
Nothing.

39
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:55,531
Where are you going?

40
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:57,052
I'm going to get changed and wash my hair.

41
00:03:57,643 --> 00:03:58,501
Don't be dramatic.

42
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:00,282
You can barely stand.
How do you wash your hair?

43
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:02,611
My hair stinks!

44
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:04,230
Do you want to recover soon?

45
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:06,451
Of course, but I have to wash my hair.

46
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,211
Why don't...

47
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:11,261
you lend me a hand?

48
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:15,490
Do you expect me
to wait on you like a servant?

49
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,011
Isn't a soldier meant to serve the people?

50
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:25,271
Dream on!

51
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:36,571
♪Romance makes little things feel warm♪

52
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:46,339
♪Warmth softens even a stubborn heart♪

53
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:55,935
♪Heart is filled
with your little company everyday♪

54
00:04:58,591 --> 00:04:59,524
Slow down!

55
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,065
The water is going into my ears!

56
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:05,275
It's burning!
It's burning!

57
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:09,461
You're so troublesome.

58
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:11,221
Why don't you do it on your own?

59
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:18,011
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:21,571
I forgot that
this is Captain Liang's place.

61
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:23,885
If I won't stop talking,

62
00:05:24,154 --> 00:05:25,484
I'll be chased out of the place.

63
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,001
What are you doing?

64
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,567
I'm going to get a towel.

65
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:39,013
Don't move. Let me get it for you.

66
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:40,160
I can do it.

67
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,080
Let me do it.

68
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:48,040
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:52,560
Don't move.

70
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:03,491
There's a piece of hair on your face.

71
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,320
What's wrong with you?

72
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:30,441
I enjoy having a strand of hair
sticking on my face.

73
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:31,621
It's none of your business!

74
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,269
Stop moving. It's to reduce the swelling.

75
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:48,604
My mom is calling.

76
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:50,829
What does it have to do with me?

77
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:52,106
Of course it has something to do with you.

78
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:53,596
Have you forgotten that
you're my girlfriend?

79
00:06:58,034 --> 00:06:59,710
-Mom.
-Son.

80
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,429
Why didn't you reply to
my text messages on WeChat?

81
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:03,731
I just came back to the camp yesterday.
I've been busy at work.

82
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:05,051
What are you doing?

83
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,870
Xia Chu injured herself.

84
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:09,230
Xia Chu?
She's moved out, hasn't she?

85
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:10,571
She didn't move out. She decided to stay.

86
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:12,051
I brought her back to the military camp.

87
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,851
I have to take care of her.

88
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:16,251
Why would I lie to you? She's here.

89
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:17,661
I'll let her talk to you.

90
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:24,431
Hello.

91
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,840
Hello, Xia Chu.

92
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,160
It's me.

93
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:32,301
I heard
from Mu Ze that you injured yourself.

94
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:33,682
What happened?

95
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,110
It's nothing.
I injured my ankle.

96
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:39,451
I feel so much better today.

97
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:41,673
You must rest well.

98
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:45,061
Don't worry.
I'll take care of myself.

99
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:48,331
Does Liang Mu Ze treat you well?

100
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:50,691
Liang Mu Ze...

101
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:52,931
He...

102
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:56,621
treats me quite well.

103
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:58,830
Good to hear that.

104
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:00,741
When I'm free, I'll pay you a visit.

105
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,520
Sure. Please take care.

106
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:03,731
That's all for now.

107
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:06,832
Mom.

108
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:09,005
Are you at ease now?

109
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,780
Moving forward, stop sending
ridiculous photos to the camp.

110
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:13,960
I have to go. Bye.

111
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:18,323
Good acting.

112
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:20,651
As long as you're happy.

113
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:23,561
Otherwise, you will chase me out again.

114
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:24,635
Xia Chu.

115
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:25,555
What?

116
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,430
I have apologized to you, haven't I?

117
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:35,341
Put it on until the swelling is gone.

118
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,350
Listen.

119
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:40,331
Starting from next week,

120
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:41,967
it will rain every day.

121
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:44,027
Don't go anywhere.

122
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,150
If you're bored...

123
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:47,651
and intrigued to check out
our training process,

124
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:50,520
you may use this.

125
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:52,031
No one wants to see it.

126
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:55,623
All right, take a nap
after you blow dry your hair.

127
00:08:55,664 --> 00:08:56,544
Don't get a cold.

128
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:06,491
Health documentary?

129
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,449
It sounds great.

130
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:09,830
Now,

131
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,611
the relationship between doctors
and patients has become strained.

132
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,230
We can provide them a channel...

133
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:14,421
so that they can understand
each other better.

134
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:16,150
I think it's quite meaningful.

135
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:17,071
I support the idea.

136
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:19,889
However, in order to execute the idea,

137
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,781
we need to get approval from the
management department of the hospital.

138
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:23,831
How about this?

139
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:26,131
You should come out
with a specific proposal.

140
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:28,902
Let me deal with the hospital.

141
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:30,581
I think it shouldn't be a problem.

142
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,780
It helps with digestion.

143
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:45,831
Thank you.

144
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:48,828
What is bothering you?

145
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:55,208
Dr. Zhang.

146
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,491
I would like to
ask an irrelevant question.

147
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:00,004
What is it?

148
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:03,932
Is Zhuo Ran terminally ill?

149
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:08,171
How should I put it?

150
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:10,483
When the disease is under control,

151
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:11,994
he can live like a normal person.

152
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:13,515
Once the disease is at its onset,

153
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:16,291
it can be dangerous.

154
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,660
Is there any way to cure it?

155
00:10:22,065 --> 00:10:23,915
Reduce his stress reaction.

156
00:10:24,432 --> 00:10:25,532
For example,

157
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:27,427
who called him the other day?

158
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:29,411
What was the conversation about?

159
00:10:29,783 --> 00:10:32,163
Try to avoid the same
from happening again.

160
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:37,006
It's quite impossible
to cure it once and for all.

161
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,478
What's wrong?

162
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:43,221
Something urgent came up.

163
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:44,992
Now?

164
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:47,691
I'm sorry, Dr. Zhang.

165
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:50,011
Do you want to add on?

166
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:52,550
No need, I can't finish everything.

167
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:55,051
I'm so sorry. I'll pay for the bill.

168
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:56,022
No need.

169
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,137
Hello, sir.

170
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:06,190
Since your friend has left,

171
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:08,293
we purposely bring you a toy bear.

172
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,572
Can we place it here?

173
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,931
You're being so considerate.

174
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,310
Thank you.

175
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,491
Sure, enjoy the food.

176
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:27,623
Sure.

177
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,421
Let's finish the meal together.

178
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:35,091
Zhuo Ran.

179
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:37,893
Mi Gu?

180
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:41,787
Why are you here?

181
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:44,501
I'm here to check on you.

182
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:49,406
You were discharged
from the hospital so suddenly.

183
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:50,637
I couldn't reach you.

184
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:52,661
I'm a little worried.

185
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:58,971
How do you feel?

186
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:00,414
Have you recovered?

187
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:02,913
I've recovered.

188
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:04,471
Good to hear that.

189
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,355
Since you're ill,

190
00:12:07,682 --> 00:12:09,052
you have to rest well.

191
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:11,005
Take good care of yourself.

192
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,643
I'm leaving.

193
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:26,992
Mi Gu.

194
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,931
Thank you for checking on me.

195
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:38,120
What on earth were you doing?

196
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,800
We almost got caught!

197
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:42,451
Why were you dilly-dallying?

198
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:45,049
Nothing happened, right?

199
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,080
Why are you scared?

200
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:47,691
Why am I scared?

201
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,799
We've been in China for so long.

202
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,240
You've been running around after Xia Chu.

203
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:55,511
I thought you're something,

204
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:57,922
but we haven't even seen
her dad for once.

205
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:01,291
I'm talking to you!

206
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:05,064
Why did you go to his house
and install bugs?

207
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:06,335
Are you crazy?

208
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,221
Do you really think that
by wearing earphones all the time,

209
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:10,292
you can accomplish the mission
assigned to us by Old Master?

210
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:12,181
I know what I am doing.

211
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:13,602
Like hell you do!

212
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:16,320
Listen, don't put me in trouble.

213
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:20,741
I'll report everything that happened today
to Old Master.

214
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:23,202
You'll have to
bear the consequences alone.

215
00:13:25,775 --> 00:13:27,925
Based on the analysis
of a jewellery expert,

216
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,270
the sapphire
on the deceased's walking stick...

217
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:36,201
is the Cornflower Blue Sapphire
originated from Kashmir.

218
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:39,150
The mining activities
only went on for 28 years.

219
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:42,181
Therefore, Kashmir Sapphires
that are available in the world...

220
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,122
are really rare.

221
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:46,560
The last time this sapphire
appeared in public was two years ago,

222
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,131
at the world renowned
Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong.

223
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:54,805
A China Mainland merchant
by the name Liu Zheng Ming...

224
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:58,106
won the bid with 9,210,000 HKD.

225
00:13:58,344 --> 00:14:02,531
Liu Zheng Ming is the sugar-daddy
of the deceased, Zhou Lan...

226
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:05,768
who killed herself
in the Jiao Tong University district.

227
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,109
His nickname is Xiong.

228
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,540
How much do we know about him?

229
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:12,341
In the early 90s,

230
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:13,878
he started off his business
by smuggling imported cigarettes.

231
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,499
He was arrested and sentenced
to prison for seven years.

232
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,080
After he's released, he ventured
into Chinese herbal medicine business.

233
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:19,730
Now, he's dominated
the herbal medicine market...

234
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:21,070
in the five provinces of Southeast China.

235
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,190
He also has business
in Thailand, Vietnam and so on.

236
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,630
Besides the sapphire
which was recorded two years ago,

237
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:28,791
we don't have any other records
about his gem collection.

238
00:14:28,832 --> 00:14:30,481
It appears that
he is not a major gem collector.

239
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:34,310
As for how and why the sapphire
fell into the male deceased's hand,

240
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:36,171
we don't have any clue as for now.

241
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:44,051
A Chinese medicine merchant
is involved in two murders simultaneously.

242
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:46,181
It's not a coincidence for sure.

243
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,830
Judging from the situation,

244
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:51,171
to find out the identity
of the male deceased in the bungalow,

245
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:54,347
the breakthrough is Xiong.

246
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:02,804
Put up with it.

247
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:05,371
Slow down.

248
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:08,055
All right.

249
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:10,036
You may move around.

250
00:15:12,848 --> 00:15:14,001
That's great!

251
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,471
You're recovering fast.

252
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:17,917
Like I said,
I can remove the cast on my own.

253
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,258
But you insisted on coming here.

254
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:20,964
I have to do so.

255
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,996
I'm entrusted by someone.

256
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,236
Please thank
Brigade Commander Dong for me.

257
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,820
Brigade Commander didn't send me here.

258
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:34,211
It's been raining for a week.

259
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:35,996
It's not going to stop any sooner.

260
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:37,629
Yes, it'll rain non stop.

261
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,670
Therefore, every year, at this period,

262
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:40,851
we'll get ready for war.

263
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,891
Did you receive a new mission?

264
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,790
As the Buddha said, it's a secret.

265
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:50,291
All right, I have to go.

266
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:51,411
How about this?

267
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:53,531
I'll leave some medicine for you.

268
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:55,921
If I have to go on a mission,

269
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,661
you can apply the medicine on your own.

270
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:00,387
Okay, thank you.

271
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,731
I'm leaving.

272
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:07,710
Is the entire Special Forces Brigade
getting ready for war?

273
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:09,591
Yes, we're preparing for war.

274
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:11,211
Team Lightning is getting ready too.

275
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:14,852
Captain Liang is included.

276
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:19,091
I'm leaving.

277
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,671
Brigade Commander!

278
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,500
I propose to pass through
the highland side.

279
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:48,061
It's pouring. I worry that
we might get struck by lightning.

280
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:51,572
What if we run into a mudslide?

281
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:53,517
We go through field battle training
on a daily basis.

282
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:54,578
It's okay.

283
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:56,590
No doubt it's safer
but how about the speed?

284
00:16:56,631 --> 00:17:00,651
You might be okay with the route
but can the other units catch up with you?

285
00:17:01,594 --> 00:17:02,474
Let's go!

286
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:06,861
Attention.

287
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:08,670
Speed up!

288
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:12,310
Let's take the lead
to pave the way for the other units.

289
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:14,310
Make sure all of you
take safeguard measures along the way.

290
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:15,941
Make sure all the units pass safely.

291
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:17,290
Reply if you receive my message.

292
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:19,181
Noted!

293
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:20,122
Noted!

294
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:24,705
Hurry up. Stay safe. Hurry!

295
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:29,451
This is Team Lightning speaking.

296
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:33,491
Attention, all units.
Speed up and stay safe!

297
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:35,070
Before 5:00,

298
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:37,211
all of you must reach the assembly point!

299
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:45,411
Go!

300
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:47,251
Be safe.

301
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,181
-Squad leader.
-Liang.

302
00:17:54,232 --> 00:17:55,791
-Are the stewed ribs ready?
-It's ready.

303
00:17:55,832 --> 00:17:57,127
As per the Brigade Commander's
instruction,

304
00:17:57,168 --> 00:17:59,038
it's braised on low heat.

305
00:17:59,151 --> 00:18:00,621
Take a sniff.

306
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:02,879
-It smells good.
-It smells good.

307
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:04,531
-It smells good, right?
-Yes.

308
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:06,022
I'll take it with me.

309
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:07,150
Slow down. Don't burn yourself.

310
00:18:07,191 --> 00:18:08,190
I haven't added salt in it.

311
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:09,693
It's okay. It's good.
It's all right.

312
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:10,581
-Slow down.
-I'm leaving.

313
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,932
-Don't burn yourself.
-Thank you.

314
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:12,993
Great. Slow down.

315
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:43,938
Let me check on...

316
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,210
my savior.

317
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:52,812
Are you okay?

318
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:56,203
You're so cool, Liang Mu Ze.

319
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,819
Of course.

320
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:04,131
Let's get ready for dinner.

321
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:05,652
Yes!

322
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,164
Our captain is really something.

323
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,670
Listen, besides catching you,

324
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:17,591
he's also good at other things.

325
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:23,230
Not only is he good at diving,
parachuting, rock climbing, and skiing,

326
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:26,080
he's also good at close quarters combat
and emergency rescue communication.

327
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,381
He can speak three languages
and handle all kinds of vehicles.

328
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:30,882
He's the top soldier in the army.

329
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:33,032
He can do things that others cannot.

330
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:34,043
For example,

331
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:37,935
metamorphosing and lip reading.

332
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:41,331
No one in the army is his match.

333
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,021
Nobody can better him.

334
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:44,261
In that aspect,

335
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:46,440
he's definitely the best.

336
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:47,491
Are you writing a novel?

337
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,460
You're even more interesting
than a novel.

338
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,092
I didn't know that you can read lips.

339
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:55,987
Just a bit.

340
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:02,291
Anyone can mistake us for a couple
except for you.

341
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,371
For a long time,

342
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,473
I couldn't even stand it when
someone mentioned the phrase,

343
00:20:06,513 --> 00:20:07,644
"special forces soldier."

344
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:08,840
Let alone start dating again.

345
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:10,614
Can you teach me?

346
00:20:10,655 --> 00:20:11,535
No.

347
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:16,464
Dr. Xia.

348
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,741
There's a long way to go.
There's a long way to go.

349
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,020
Finish the soup.

350
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:21,941
Yes.

351
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:23,723
You too.
Finish it while it's still warm.

352
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:33,885
-It's quite flavorful.
-It's so bland.

353
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:45,615
It's so delicious, captain.

354
00:20:45,656 --> 00:20:47,681
I've never had such
delicious soup, captain.

355
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:49,041
Well done.

356
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,310
I was being impatient.

357
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:03,703
Why did you bring out the case?

358
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:05,503
I'm leaving tomorrow.

359
00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:09,121
My leg has recovered.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

360
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:17,558
Has it been a week?

361
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:18,894
Yes.

362
00:21:25,796 --> 00:21:26,976
Are you sure you've recovered?

363
00:21:28,546 --> 00:21:29,426
Yes.

364
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:38,434
Report!

365
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,119
Captain, I suddenly recall...

366
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,970
I have to attend to something urgent.
I have to go.

367
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,420
Don't leave yet.
You haven't finished eating.

368
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:48,408
Dr. Xia, it's quite urgent.

369
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:49,533
I have to leave now.

370
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,114
Continue eating.
You don't have to send me off.

371
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:55,666
I'm leaving, captain.

372
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:00,994
Continue eating.

373
00:22:01,763 --> 00:22:06,400
Is Lieutenant Tian trying to make space
for us to spend time alone?

374
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:10,576
Thank you for taking care of me
for the past few days.

375
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:12,079
I'll replace wine with soup.

376
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,130
Cheers!

377
00:22:13,774 --> 00:22:14,834
That's all?

378
00:22:15,623 --> 00:22:16,643
Don't you have anything else to say?

379
00:22:17,576 --> 00:22:18,996
Like what?

380
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,180
You bought a bouquet in my name
and you haven't apologized to me.

381
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:26,363
Well,

382
00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:28,916
I was being nosy.

383
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:31,319
However, I still don't get it.

384
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,180
Why did you get so angry?

385
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,660
Just because Xiao Jun's mom
doesn't like flowers?

386
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,279
She likes flowers.

387
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,620
However, it has nothing to do with me.

388
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,200
Both of you...

389
00:22:42,453 --> 00:22:43,913
It's been so many years.

390
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:46,251
You've been taking care of them.

391
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,039
So what?

392
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,260
Does it have to involve a love affair?

393
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:54,730
Do I have to date her and marry her?

394
00:22:55,128 --> 00:22:58,028
What if I'm taking care of them
as Luo Liang's comrade?

395
00:22:59,165 --> 00:23:01,665
I'm just pretending to be Xiao Jun's dad.

396
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,694
I'll take care of them and protect them
until Xiao Jun grows up,

397
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:07,242
until he's grown into
an independent adult,

398
00:23:07,293 --> 00:23:09,399
until they don't need
my protection anymore,

399
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,820
until he can protect his own mom.

400
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,890
Is that not allowed?

401
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,660
I'm not avoiding it.

402
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,159
It's to the contrary.

403
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,490
I'm facing it.

404
00:23:25,688 --> 00:23:26,708
I got it now.

405
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,170
Liang Mu Ze.

406
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:33,780
I didn't mean to
embarrass you on purpose.

407
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,159
Firstly,

408
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,399
as Xiao Jun's doctor in charge,

409
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,469
I don't want him to get
emotionally agitated.

410
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,100
It will affect his recovery.

411
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,250
More importantly,

412
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,620
I don't want you two to let
each other slip by.

413
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,650
I know the feeling.

414
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:56,826
I mean, letting each other slip
by when the feeling is mutual.

415
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,210
It's quite disheartening.

416
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:06,100
Therefore, I promised Xiao Jun
to buy a bouquet in your name.

417
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,420
However, I didn't expect
it would bother you that much.

418
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,100
I'm sorry.

419
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:15,301
I was full of myself.

420
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,340
That's why I misunderstood you two.

421
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,620
Have you experienced it?

422
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,627
Pick up the call.

423
00:24:34,176 --> 00:24:35,566
Pick up the call.

424
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,547
Pick up the call.

425
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,140
I think so.

426
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,201
How about you, Liang Mu Ze?

427
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,700
Have you ever let anyone slip by?

428
00:24:45,326 --> 00:24:46,506
Do you feel regret?

429
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,040
No.

430
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,260
I never let anything slip by.

431
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,780
That's why I don't have any regrets.

432
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:01,104
Eat up.

433
00:25:01,421 --> 00:25:02,561
Have some pork ribs.

434
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,060
You are what you eat.

435
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:19,011
Listen.

436
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:22,987
I...

437
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:25,138
In that situation,

438
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:29,019
I felt as if
there was a huge bulb on my head.

439
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,639
Did you feel awkward?

440
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,000
It's so awkward.

441
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:32,941
Lieutenant Tian.

442
00:25:32,982 --> 00:25:36,722
What is the relationship between
Captain Liang and Dr. Xia?

443
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,740
What do you think?

444
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:42,639
If they are really a couple,

445
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,700
she seemed upset
when we called her Mrs. Liang.

446
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:47,478
If there is nothing between them,

447
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,798
why did Captain Liang
bring her back to camp?

448
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,219
She stayed here for so many days.

449
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,800
Xiang Yang.

450
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:57,322
"The west is veiled in rain
while the east enjoys sunshine."

451
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,820
"My gallant is as deep in love
as the day is fine."

452
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,719
Xia Chu.

453
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,860
My mom wants to see our photo.

454
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,399
What are you doing?

455
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,399
Give it to me!

456
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,390
It's not going to work!

457
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,701
You promised me before.

458
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:41,880
No doubt I promised you before
but...

459
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:45,562
Look, this photo is so ugly.

460
00:26:45,831 --> 00:26:47,367
You took the photo from the bottom.

461
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:48,646
That's the most tricky angle.

462
00:26:48,687 --> 00:26:50,088
Furthermore,
my face looks huge in the photo.

463
00:26:50,129 --> 00:26:52,417
It's also taken against the light!
I look at least three shades darker.

464
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:53,613
Captain Liang, look at yourself.

465
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,789
Would you smile?
What kind of expression is that?

466
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,399
We are so far apart.

467
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,518
We don't look like
a couple who are crazily in love.

468
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,279
If you send the photo to your mom,

469
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,580
she won't believe in us.

470
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:04,963
What should we do?

471
00:27:06,782 --> 00:27:09,082
Let me teach you a lesson, Captain Liang.

472
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:24,360
Liang Mu Ze, come forward.

473
00:27:24,401 --> 00:27:26,221
My face looks huge. Hurry up.

474
00:27:26,832 --> 00:27:29,412
One, two, three, cheese!

475
00:27:34,894 --> 00:27:36,954
Captain Liang, can you put on a smile?

476
00:27:39,055 --> 00:27:40,959
Stay still, don't move.

477
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,300
One, two...

478
00:27:43,084 --> 00:27:45,944
Close your eyes and enjoy life.

479
00:27:49,322 --> 00:27:51,888
This is not okay.
I look silly in this photo.

480
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:54,400
Be happy, okay?
You look happy.

481
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:56,141
My mom will think that I've gone crazy
if she sees this.

482
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,260
Do I look crazy?

483
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,359
Taking a photo is so tiring.

484
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,140
It's even more tiring
than going for training.

485
00:28:14,853 --> 00:28:16,446
It's not that tiring.

486
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:19,150
Since we're pretending,

487
00:28:19,191 --> 00:28:21,291
we have to put in more effort
to look real.

488
00:28:26,566 --> 00:28:27,666
All right, it's done.

489
00:28:28,263 --> 00:28:29,883

00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,479
Of course.

499
00:29:33,255 --> 00:29:34,136
Just wait.

500
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:38,118
I'm so busy with training.

501
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,102
We need to get ready for war too.

502
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:40,280
I don't have the time to fetch you.

503
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,799
I have legs.

504
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,970
You mean, your broken leg?

505
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,648
I'm a military officer too!

506
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:48,101
I won't fall behind
even when I lose my flesh and skin.

507
00:29:48,142 --> 00:29:49,842
I'm not as fragile as you think.

508
00:29:52,172 --> 00:29:53,302
Here, let me show you something.

509
00:29:53,343 --> 00:29:54,603
Come here.

510
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,187
See for yourself.

511
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:57,899
It's pouring.

512
00:29:58,111 --> 00:29:59,841
It's difficult to travel.
How do you plan to go back?

513
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,130
I...

514
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:02,479
I can drive.

515
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,580
I have a driving license.

516
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:05,480
Drive?

517
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:08,491
What are you doing?

518
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:11,000
How do you drive?

519
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:12,680
It's for the sake of your safety.

520
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,481
Be good, Da Miao.

521
00:30:14,911 --> 00:30:15,791
Good girl.

522
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,069
Liang Mu Ze!
If you ever pinch my face again,

523
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,620
I'll chop the 27 bones in your hand
into pieces!

524
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,700
Brigade Commander.

525
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:04,211
Yes, I'm Liang Mu Ze.

526
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,740
I would like to get your permission
on something.

527
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,820
I'm coming. Stop knocking the door.

528
00:31:17,535 --> 00:31:18,458
Change into the military uniform.

529
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:20,359
Ten minutes later,
go to the assembly point.

530
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,340
Why?

531
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:32,852
One, two, three, four.

532
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:34,907
What's wrong?

533
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,699
You have to run.

534
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,720
What?

535
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:42,680
Either you run
or you train with them.

536
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:48,779
Me?

537
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,700
Yes.

538
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:52,399
Liang Mu Ze, are you crazy?

539
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,533
Hurry up. Do it.

540
00:31:53,574 --> 00:31:54,634
Why?

541
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,220
It's for your own good.

542
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,599
You're not my leader.

543
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,860
Why should I listen to you?

544
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,799
Brigade Commander said
it's just a minor accident,

545
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,030
but you injured your leg.

546
00:32:04,071 --> 00:32:06,341
That means you lack training.

547
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,959
Hence, he applied to your superior...

548
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,770
to include you
in the training as a non-staff.

549
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,820
What?

550
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,660
It's to strengthen your stamina.

551
00:32:14,086 --> 00:32:15,706
He doesn't want you to get into danger.

552
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,240
But...

553
00:32:17,911 --> 00:32:18,811
Let's go.

554
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:21,571
I'm an injured person.

555
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:23,194
You've fully recovered, right?

556
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:24,479
Let's go.

557
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:28,787
I can walk on my own.

558
00:32:29,688 --> 00:32:30,868
Here, run now.

559
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:35,759
-Keep running.
-Let go of me. I can run on my own.

560
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,980
Run on your own.

561
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,190
Keep running.

562
00:32:40,231 --> 00:32:42,840
One, two, three, four.

563
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,920
Xia Chu, I'll beat you up if I catch you.

564
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,100
-I'm coming.
-I can run on my own!

565
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:53,679
Stop following me!

566
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,999
When you're in danger,

567
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,780
you should run at first instance, got it?

568
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,679
Watch your arms. Swing your arms.

569
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,820
Keep it low.

570
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,319
Don't stop. Keep running.

571
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,140
I can run on my own!

572
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,960
Try it.

573
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:34,563
I have to practice shooting too?

574
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,440
It's an order from Brigade Commander.

575
00:33:37,454 --> 00:33:39,554
I've only used a rifle before
when I was in recruit company.

576
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,652
Stand here.

577
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:45,313
Hit the humanoid target at the front.

578
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,080
Here.

579
00:33:59,343 --> 00:34:00,323
Aim carefully.

580
00:34:00,364 --> 00:34:02,424
Liang Mu Ze, I've never used a gun before.

581
00:34:03,282 --> 00:34:05,142
A gun is not much different from a rifle.

582
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:07,280
Adjust your breathing and relax.

592
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:54,021
Liang Mu Ze, look!

593
00:34:54,062 --> 00:34:55,359
If you connect the bullet holes,

594

00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,119
He trained me as if I'm a soldier.

601
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,440

Assemble!

605
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,700
One, two, one!

606
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:27,986
Comrades.

607
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,460
Lately,

608
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,940
the Southeast region of our country...

609
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:37,291
has been experiencing
heavy rain and flood disaster.

610
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:41,879
In order to protect
the people and their property,

611
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,220
we've been instructed
to aid the disaster areas.

612
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,980
The fighting is going to begin soon.

613
00:36:48,814 --> 00:36:50,474
I only have one requirement.

614
00:36:51,798 --> 00:36:53,378
Confront the danger.

615
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,160
Help and protect the dyke.

616
00:36:57,711 --> 00:37:00,891
Before the rain stops, we won't give up!

617
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,119
Got it?

618
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,060
Yes!

619
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:05,507
Let's go!

620
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:07,681
Turn to the rear.

621
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:11,787
Start marching!

622
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:16,674
Captain!

623
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:33,329
Take care!

624
00:40:12,597 --> 00:40:15,017
Take care, Liang Mu Ze.

625
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:27,053
I'm back.

626
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:29,834
-You're back.
-Come here.

627
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:31,599
-Has your leg recovered?
-Are you okay?

628
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,959
I'm okay. I've fully recovered.

629
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,628
-You've recovered.
-What are you doing?

630
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:36,885
-Reading the flood fighting news.
-Look.

631
00:40:36,926 --> 00:40:40,412
They've been immersed
in the water for many days.

632
00:40:41,498 --> 00:40:44,280
It's stated in the news that
many troops are rushing to the areas.

633
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:45,747
Xia Chu.

634
00:40:46,553 --> 00:40:47,412
Dr. Zhang.

635
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:48,433
You're back.

636
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,469
How do you feel?

637
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,570
I've recovered.
I can start working anytime.

638
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,760
That's great.

639
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,387
Is my hairstyle all right?

640
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,980
Dr. Zhang, you're...

641
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,060
I'm filming a show.

642
00:41:06,432 --> 00:41:10,252
There is a lady by the name of Mi Gu
from the life channel.

643
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:11,518
Do you know her?

644
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:13,092
I know her. She's my best friend.

645
00:41:13,495 --> 00:41:16,600
She wants to produce
a medicine related documentary.

646
00:41:17,038 --> 00:41:18,658
I'll be the main character
in the documentary.

647
00:41:18,871 --> 00:41:20,680
Please work with her.

648
00:41:20,721 --> 00:41:21,601
Don't worry.

649
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,380
Is she single?

650
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,199
Dr. Zhang!

651
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:38,790
Dean.

652
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:40,507
Allow me to introduce someone to you.

653
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,458
He is Deputy Dean Zhou.

654
00:41:43,743 --> 00:41:44,683
Hello, Deputy Dean Zhou.

655
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:48,075
Thank you for
being interested in the hospital.

656
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:49,439
You're so kind, Dean.

657
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,940
We would like to thank you
for supporting our show.

658
00:41:52,445 --> 00:41:53,621
That's our duty.

659
00:41:55,328 --> 00:41:56,413
This is...

660
00:41:56,454 --> 00:41:57,660
I don't think
there's a need to introduce him.

661
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,680
Hello.

662
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,020
Hello.

663
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:04,293
We decided to film the signing ceremony
at the eleventh hour.

664
00:42:04,334 --> 00:42:05,234
Sorry to have...

665
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,159
I'm sorry. I need to answer a phone call.

666
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,870
Xiao Wen, please communicate
with the other leaders and Mr. Zhuo...

667
00:42:11,911 --> 00:42:13,350
regarding the filming details.

668
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:14,451
Okay, Ms. Gu.

669
00:42:18,976 --> 00:42:19,876
Thank you.

670
00:42:23,064 --> 00:42:25,314
(Xia Chu)

671
00:42:46,663 --> 00:42:48,414
I changed Xiao Jun's dressing for you...

672
00:42:48,455 --> 00:42:51,395
and you promised to prepare
two weeks worth of medical orders.

673
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:53,099
Please honor your words.

674
00:43:17,663 --> 00:43:21,763
It's an honor to set up a special fund
with the hospital.

675
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,940
We will develop 3D medicine production,

676
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,300
organ printing,

677
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:30,140
auxiliary instrument printing and so on
in full swing.

678
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,380
We believe that following
the rapid development of 3D printing,

679
00:43:34,793 --> 00:43:38,580
we will welcome
the new era of personalized medicine.

680
00:43:44,486 --> 00:43:47,026
Take some scenery shots
in the hospital later.

681
00:43:47,473 --> 00:43:49,293
-Sure.
-I hope everything goes according to plan.

682
00:43:51,311 --> 00:43:52,871
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye. I'll see you off.

683
00:43:55,368 --> 00:43:56,968
How long will the filming take?

684
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,359
Let's go for dinner tonight.

685
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,100
Should I wait for you?

686
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,580
Are you not going to join
the photography session?

687
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,140
Why should I join?

688
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,800
He's young and talented.

689
00:44:21,321 --> 00:44:22,201
I'm sorry.

690
00:44:22,689 --> 00:44:23,789
Please hold on.

691
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:25,169
Mi Gu.

692
00:44:27,191 --> 00:44:28,241
Let's go for dinner tonight.

693
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:29,739
I'll invite Xia Chu too.

694
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,300
Dr. Zhang, please join us.

695
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,280
Sure.

696
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,639
I have something to do at night.

697
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,560
Well...

698
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,100
Dr. Zhang, don't we have a date?

699
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,140
I'm sorry. I forgot that.

700
00:44:47,533 --> 00:44:49,043
We have a discussion.

701
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,890
I'll not take up your time then.

702
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,020
I'm leaving.

703
00:45:01,182 --> 00:45:02,442
Why did you do that?
