=Episode 20=

3
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:36,045
You hugged Liang Mu Ze?

4
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:37,711
Why?

5
00:01:37,752 --> 00:01:39,000
It's to show my appreciation for him.

6
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,016
I borrowed money from him.

7
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:41,649
He paid for Liu Ran's medical fees.

8
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:42,757
He didn't say no?

9
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:44,320
He gave me his bank card.

10
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:46,187
I mean,

11
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:47,920
he let you hug him?

12
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:49,784
I did it in a blink of an eye.

13
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:51,144
He didn't have the time to react.

14
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:52,720
He just didn't want to react.

15
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:54,753
If he didn't want you to hug him,

16
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:57,120
I'm sure
you couldn't even get to touch his finger.

17
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:58,251
Really?

18
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,040
Of course, he's a Special Forces soldier.

19
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:08,890
Is it delicious?

20
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:10,495
Where did you get it?

21
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:11,640
He made it.

22
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,880
Here, have some water.

23
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:23,676
What's wrong?

24
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:25,320
Xia Chu.

25
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:28,360
Liang Mu Ze is in love with you.

26
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:33,200
But he didn't say anything.

27
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,723
This man let you hug him...

28
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:37,974
though you didn't wash your hair
for three days.

29
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:38,856
When you asked for a loan,

30
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:40,829
he gave you his bank card.

31
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,930
When you worked over time,

32
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:44,470
he delivered home-made cake
to your office.

33
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:46,134
Isn't it very obvious?

34
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:47,309
Does he really have to say anything?

35
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:48,840
Of course he has to say something.

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,100
We need to have a sense of ritual in life.

37
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:52,641
In romance,

38
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:54,952
confession and promise
are part of the ritual.

39
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:57,840
Therefore,

40
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,500
you admit that you're
romantically involved with him?

41
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,412
Actually,

42
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:06,307
the sense of ritual
doesn't have to come from men.

43
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:07,713
If you really like him,

44
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,480
you can confess to him
if he doesn't do so.

45
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:11,553
It's just one step away.

46
00:03:11,594 --> 00:03:12,800
Anyone can make the first move, right?

47
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,223
Between you and Zhuo Ran,

48
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:23,960
did you confess first?

49
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,280
It was me.

50
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:29,640
You're so brave, Mi Gu.

51
00:03:33,168 --> 00:03:34,720
After confessing to him, I realized...

52
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:37,920
between me and him,

53
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:41,436
it's more than just one step away.

54
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:46,960
As per your instruction,

55
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:48,352
I've contacted the purchaser.

56
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,814
The remaining goods
will be sold out soon.

57
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:52,800
Is everything all right with the police?

58
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:54,566
They came here before.

59
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:55,503
That's quick.

60
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:57,884
Someone might have
provided information to the police.

61
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,520
Why are you so careless?

62
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,855
We could have killed everyone
at the scene.

63
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:05,013
However, Ling Mu Ze
appeared all of a sudden.

64
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:06,600
He messed up our plan.

65
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:08,120
Liang Mu Ze?

66
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:10,961
It's the military officer again.

67
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,504
Yes. It's him.

68
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:17,320
In comparison to those witnesses
who didn't even see our face,

69
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:20,920
Liang Mu Ze is the greatest obstacle
in our operation moving forward.

70
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:22,793
If you can send someone...

71
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:26,600
The murder in Willick
has alarmed the Chinese Embassy.

72
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:28,640
I don't want to bring up
unnecessary issues.

73
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,044
If Gui's murder case
is not supported by any evidence,

74
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:35,960
we shall leave it aside.

75
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:39,383
Xia Guang Yuan is our priority.

76
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:41,600
We need to win his heart
as soon as possible, got it?

77
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:44,732
I'm trying
to befriend his assistant, Tang Lin.

78
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:47,292
He was the one
who prepared all the experimental reports.

79
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,600
He can expedite the process
of extracting the relevant information.

80
00:04:52,054 --> 00:04:54,034
You can't approach him
through his daughter anymore?

81
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:56,120
Isn't it better
to do both at the same time?

82
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:00,000
Be immaculate.

83
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,080
Don't get into trouble again, got it?

84
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,440
Got it.

85
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:06,760
Old Master.

86
00:05:09,244 --> 00:05:10,200
Anything?

87
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:12,760
I...

88
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:13,760
Don't worry.

89
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:16,600
Your mum is doing well.

90
00:05:16,975 --> 00:05:17,880
I know.

91
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:19,602
You sent someone to take care of her.

92
00:05:19,643 --> 00:05:20,602
I'm not worried at all.

93
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:21,639
Do you have any other question?

94
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,320
It's about my dad.

95
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,724
How did he die?

96
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:30,320
I've told you about it long time ago.

97
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:32,481
Once, when we were collecting the goods,

98
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:34,623
the Police Force
barged in out of the blue.

99
00:05:34,732 --> 00:05:37,480
Your dad refused to leave
insisting to guard the goods.

100
00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:39,960
In the end, he was shot to death.

101
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,239
I see.

102
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,680
That's your version.

103
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:44,891
However, before Gui died, he said...

104
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:45,960
Gui?

105
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:48,728
Have you forgotten how Gui always behaved?

106
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:50,079
How could you believe in him?

107
00:05:50,193 --> 00:05:51,396
In order to survive,

108
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:52,680
he would say anything.

109
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:54,480
Tell me.

110
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,600
Do you trust him or me?

111
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:57,880
I trust you.

112
00:05:58,654 --> 00:05:59,754
I'm glad to hear that.

113
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:00,880
That's all.

114
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:10,500
Her particulars...
(Emergency Intensive Care Unit)

115
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,411
have been uploaded to OPO.

116
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:14,334
If we can find a suitable lung,

117
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,075
the system
will automatically assign it to her.

118
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:17,800
Thank you, Dr Zhang.

119
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:19,791
But you need to know that...

120
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:23,203
organ donation is full of uncertainties.

121
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:26,464
That's why I objected
installing ECMO in her.

122
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:29,240
It's torturous.

123
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,920
Since it's been installed,

124
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:33,640
we can only wait.

125
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,894
Otherwise, all the effort will be in vain.

126
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:37,640
Be it to the patient,

127
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:39,764
the family or the doctor,

128
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:41,080
it is a test.

129
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:43,680
I got it.

130
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:45,000
All right.

131
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,560
Let's take a rest.

132
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:48,360
We'll fight again after taking a nap.

133
00:06:59,422 --> 00:07:01,520
Xia Chu, are you done with work?

134
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:04,400
I'm at the supermarket next door.

135
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:05,791
Come now.

136
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:21,720
Guan Guan.

137
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:23,880
Do you have perfume?

138
00:07:24,464 --> 00:07:25,654
I only have intravenous sugar solution.

139
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,640
Do you want it?

140
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:29,824
Thank you.

141
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:31,383
Enjoy it.

142
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:32,333
I'm off.

143
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:33,600
Bye.

144
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:52,920
Do I look good?

145
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,583
It's on-trend.

146
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:04,280
Fine.

147
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,108
It's to cover up the ugly side of me.

148
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:08,800
I haven't washed my hair
for four days.

149
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:11,183
You're not ugly at all.

150
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,071
You're fair.

151
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:13,842
Fair complexion covers up
90 percent of the ugliness.

152
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,200
Really?

153
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:17,280
What about the remaining
10 percent of the ugliness?

154
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,713
As for the remaining 10 percent,

155
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:21,640
you need to leave a way out
for the other ladies.

156
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:25,783
Liang Mu Ze, you're abnormal lately.

157
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:27,443
You've become a sweet talker.

158
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:30,240
You used to be proud and aloof.

159
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,440
I guess it's because
I made too many desserts.

160
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,040
Hold on.

161
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:44,880
Take this.

162
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:46,592
Is there any difference?

163
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:48,174
Of course. Look.

164
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:50,375
After being shaken up,
the bubbles are fine and dense.

165
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,393
Furthermore,
the bubbles stay for a long time.

166
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:52,884
Do you know what that means?

167
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:54,922
What does it mean?

168
00:08:54,963 --> 00:08:56,903
It means it's high in amino acid.

169
00:08:56,944 --> 00:08:59,383
It's also more nutritious.

170
00:08:59,424 --> 00:09:00,953
Better yet, it's on sale.

171
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:02,360
It's cheaper by three bucks.

172
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,113
We're out of oranges, right?

173
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:09,360
Let's get some fruits.

174
00:09:09,671 --> 00:09:10,640
Sure, I'll listen to you.

175
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,480
What are you looking at?

176
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:23,920
I'm trying to tell its gender.

177
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:25,454
What?

178
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:26,560
Its gender.

179
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:29,743
Look.
If the pedicel is small, it's male.

180
00:09:29,784 --> 00:09:31,089
If the pedicel is big, it's female.

181
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,520
Female orange
is tastier than the male orange.

182
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:34,160
Ridiculous.

183
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:39,240
It's not as ridiculous as
reciting poem to a wound, right?

184
00:09:40,604 --> 00:09:41,520
Xia Chu.

185
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:42,880
Yes?

186
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:46,327
Your scarf is gone.

187
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:54,400
What did you smell?

188
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:56,800
The smell...

189
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,200
is a combination
of sanitizer and Formalin.

190
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:04,799
You've forgotten it.

191
00:10:15,903 --> 00:10:17,556
Are you coming, Liang Mu Ze?

192
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:18,640
I'm starving!

193
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,480
I'm coming.

194
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:31,803
By the way,

195
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,120
take back your card.

196
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:39,404
I'll pay you back during weekends
when I get the money.

197
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:40,922
It's okay.

198
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:42,463
You can count me in for the donation.

199
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:43,543
No way.

200
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:45,258
I borrowed the money from you.

201
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:46,608
If you really want to donate,

202
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:48,579
you should donate it by yourself
when I pay you back.

203
00:10:52,064 --> 00:10:52,960
Okay.

204
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:54,720
Let me know if you need money.

205
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:00,200
Thank you, Liang Mu Ze.

206
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:01,720
"Thank you"?

207
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:05,795
If you replace "thank you"
with three other words,

208
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:07,520
I'll be more happy.

209
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:11,080
Which three words?

210
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:26,560
I love you.

211
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:42,989
Let's eat together.

212
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:47,520
It's been a while since you said
"let's eat together".

213
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:50,620
It's been a long time
since I had home-cooked food.

214
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,400
No problem.

215
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:55,782
In exchange,

216
00:11:55,823 --> 00:12:00,040
you have to tell me how did you find out
the reason Liu Ran committed suicide,

217
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:01,621
since you have never met her before?

218
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,808
I'm really curious.

219
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:06,302
Which novel gave you the inspiration?

220
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:08,874
Or was it the instinct of
a special forces soldier?

221
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:10,880
Neither.

222
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,080
It happened to one of my relatives before.

223
00:12:18,344 --> 00:12:20,440
Do you still remember what I told you?

224
00:12:20,803 --> 00:12:22,913
If you knew her from the past,

225
00:12:22,954 --> 00:12:24,639
you would forgive the present her.

226
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:26,560
Kindergarten?

227
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,000
Those encounters are imprinted on her.

228
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,360
All her oddness and sensitivity...

229
00:12:33,914 --> 00:12:36,934
are the edges and corners
cut out of pain and suffering.

230
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:38,520
When did you come back?

231
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,320
Aren't you having night shift today?

232
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:43,422
Mu Ze went to pick you up.

233
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,640
Did you see him?

234
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:48,640
He's at the parking.

235
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:49,680
He'll come up soon.

236
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:56,573
OK.

237
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:58,684
I want to pay OK a visit
at Special Forces Brigade.

238
00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:02,280
The clothes that I have
are all too fashionable.

239
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:04,143
I bet they won't let me in.

240
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:06,658
That's why I decided
to borrow a few clothes from you.

241
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:09,769
No doubt your taste is no match for me,

242
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,640
but I have to put up with it
because of OK.

243
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:17,673
You just want to see OK?

244
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,280
I also want to see Tian Yong.

245
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:27,322
I think this attire is not appropriate.

246
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:28,512
It's too thick.

247
00:13:28,553 --> 00:13:29,583
You're just a young lady.

248
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:32,924
I think you should put on something light
so that you look cute and lively.

249
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,824
I'm not a young lady.

250
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:37,404
I'm already 21 years old.
I'm a mature lady.

251
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,893
I want to look mysterious and sexy.

252
00:13:39,934 --> 00:13:40,802
Also,

253
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,313
don't put on too much make up.

254
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,544
Eye shadow, fake eyelashes and ear rings
should be removed.

255
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:46,543
Keep the eyeliners thin and delicate.

256
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:47,743
As for your lips,

257
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:49,553
go for a nude color.

258
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:51,622
Keep your make up
natural and refreshing.

259
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:53,120
Make it look
as if you haven't put on any make up.

260
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:54,560
Wear a nude look, okay?

261
00:13:56,463 --> 00:13:57,352
You don't have a choice.

262
00:13:57,393 --> 00:13:59,063
That's the preference of a straight guy.

263
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,033
I don't want to do that.

264
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:01,023
I don't care about
the preference of a straight guy.

265
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:02,494
I want to be me.

266
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:04,080
Well, suits yourself.

267
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:14,840
Which one do you prefer?

268
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:17,734
You didn't tell us what the occasion is.

269
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:19,040
If you ask me,

270
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:21,141
the previous photo
that you sent us looks better.

271
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:23,029
Did you really have to ask?

272
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,042
Obviously she's going on a date.

273
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,223
My suggestion is
straight guys are simple-minded.

274
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:28,614
It's the best
to look natural and refreshing.

275
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:30,120
Don't make useless effort.

276
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:35,227
Why do they share the same view
as Xia Chu?

277
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,160
That's what happened to the parrot.

278
00:14:44,473 --> 00:14:45,710
According to the organization,

279
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,166
in order to ensure its peace of mind,

280
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:49,077
we must not go against
the will of the adopter.

281
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:50,258
We can only slowly communicate
with the adopter.

282
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:51,894
Otherwise, things will backfire.

283
00:14:52,114 --> 00:14:52,980
Therefore,

284
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:54,621
before she volunteers
to take the parrot with her,

285
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:57,280
we can take care of the parrot
and ensure its quality of life.

286
00:14:59,204 --> 00:15:00,864
It seems that's the only way.

287
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:03,724
You'll have to take charge of it.

288
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,543
Work together with the organization
to convince her.

289
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:07,492
Yes, sir!

290
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:09,342
You may leave now.

291
00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:25,124
(Soldiers are sacred and inviolable)

292
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:33,760
Can't you recognise me?

293
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:36,440
No.

294
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:38,080
It's just that...

295
00:15:39,993 --> 00:15:41,840
you're a little different
from the last time I saw you.

296
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:44,533
(Soldiers are sacred and inviolable)

297
00:15:44,574 --> 00:15:45,520
Do I look good?

298
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:47,320
Your skin is
as fair as congealed ointment.

299
00:15:47,724 --> 00:15:48,960
Your neck is long and fair
like a tree grub.

300
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:50,600
Your teeth are like melon seeds.

301
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:52,888
Your eyebrows are like
the antennae of the silkworm moth.

302
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:54,160
When you smile, your dimples look artful.

303
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,480
Your eyes are so lovely.

304
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:02,928
Ex...cuse me?

305
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,680
You look very nice.

306
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:09,840
Thank you.

307
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,400
Let's go register.

308
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:15,240
Then, we'll pay Master Le Tian a visit.

309
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,020
Who is that?

310
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:21,760
Look,

311
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,160
who is here?

312
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:27,084
How are you doing, dude?

313
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:32,241
Now you know why it's known as
Master Le Tian.

314
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,720
Did it eat something wrong by mistake?

315
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,589
No.

316
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:39,400
Is its brain working?

317
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:43,920
Yes.

318
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:45,083
Don't worry.

319
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:46,612
It's just too good in imitating.

320
00:16:46,653 --> 00:16:48,173
It stayed with Brigade Commander
for some time...

321
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:50,964
and mastered the art of sardonic laugh.

322
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:52,480
It just can't stop laughing sardonically.

323
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:55,600
That's a weird way to laugh.

324
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,640
How scary.

325
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,960
How do you guys put up with it?

326
00:17:02,425 --> 00:17:05,800
If only those who are good looking
are allowed to laugh,

327
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:09,360
then this world would be a boring place.

328
00:17:19,944 --> 00:17:20,960
What's wrong?

329
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,480
What's wrong?

330
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:26,800
You're nothing like a soldier.

331
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:28,880
What do I look like?

332
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:31,103
You're like a poet.

333
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:32,360
From what aspect?

334
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:34,360
That's because you're ugly.

335
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:37,760
I see.

336
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:41,463
But you're glowing
despite of your ugliness.

337
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:43,880
You're shining out with great brilliancy.

338
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:45,684
Mr. Tian.

339
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:47,040
I want to be your friend.

340
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:53,269
Will you please move your hands?

341
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,320
Our posture...

342
00:17:55,953 --> 00:17:57,440
is not decent at all.

343
00:17:59,984 --> 00:18:01,360
Not decent at all.

344
00:18:02,532 --> 00:18:03,760
Not decent at all.

345
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,200
Okay.

346
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:09,000
So, are you going to scan the code?

347
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:11,313
-Scan what?
-I mean the code on WeChat.

348
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:12,240
Don't you have it?

349
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:18,480
I don't mind adding you
on Facebook or Weibo.

350
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:22,319
How about QQ?

351
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,520
You have an account on QQ, right?

352
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,854
So, you don't even send emails?

353
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:33,960
What is the point of having
a mobile phone?

354
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:41,320
It's to make calls.

355
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:49,352
What's wrong?

356
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:50,832
Isn't it meant to make phone calls?

357
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:53,444
Yes.
Yes, it's meant to make phone calls.

358
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,503
This is my mobile number.

359
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:58,720
Keep it.

360
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:01,160
Don't forget to call me.

361
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:05,124
If...

362
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:06,560
I mean if...

363
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:09,542
If you missed a phone call,

364
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,600
what would you do?

365
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,120
It's okay.

366
00:19:14,024 --> 00:19:15,040
You can write to me.

367
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:17,080
What's wrong with you?

368
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:20,131
What a boring life you're living!

369
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:21,840
That's not right.

370
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,400
I have my own favourite pastimes.

371
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:29,881
(Three Hundred Tang Poems)

372
00:19:41,704 --> 00:19:44,080
(Three Hundred Tang Poems)

373
00:19:55,006 --> 00:19:58,400
How did you convince Xue
to change her quirky costumes?

374
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:00,960
It's a secret.

375
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:06,427
If Uncle Rao saw her now,

376
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,840
he'd be happy for sure.

377
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:11,304
Girls should have the freedom
to choose their own outfit,

378
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:12,703
their make up,

379
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,503
and their lifestyle.

380
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:18,974
Their mindset is ever changing constantly.

381
00:20:19,103 --> 00:20:20,181
Don't push her too hard.

382
00:20:20,222 --> 00:20:21,680
Let her grow freely.

383
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:24,440
How about you?

384
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:28,783
What kind of outfit do you like?

385
00:20:28,824 --> 00:20:29,920
What kind of make up do you enjoy?

386
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:31,080
What kind of life do you want to live?

387
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:33,492
Now?

388
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,480
Yes.

389
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:45,760
I like the doctor's robe.

390
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,770
I'm fine with
either light or heavy make up.

391
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:51,160
Heal the wounded and rescue the dying.

392
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,320
I want to be with my lover.

393
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:57,920
Have you realised all of them?

394
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:04,440
I think...

395
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,520
I'm almost there.

396
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm going to do laundry.

397
00:21:45,654 --> 00:21:47,764
Who is going to do the dishes?

398
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:49,072
It's you for sure.

399
00:21:49,113 --> 00:21:49,983
I cooked the noodles.

400
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:51,000
You should do the dishes.

401
00:21:51,422 --> 00:21:52,503
I'm your landlord.

402
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:53,821
I have the immunity.

403
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:55,160
I'm your girlfriend.

404
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:01,440
Though...

405
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:03,240
It's only in name.

406
00:22:06,378 --> 00:22:09,262
How about this?
Let's play a pushing game.

407
00:22:09,303 --> 00:22:11,092
The loser
will have to do the dishes, okay?

408
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:12,751
That's not fair!
It's literally an imparity clause!

409
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:14,142
No way I can defeat you.

410
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:15,440
Then, just leave it there.

411
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:16,438
Well...

412
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,714
It'll stink!

413
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:18,733
I don't care.

414
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:19,800
Hold on.

415
00:22:22,096 --> 00:22:23,040
Fine, let's do it.

416
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:24,200
I'm not afraid of you.

417
00:22:24,682 --> 00:22:25,535
Come on.

418
00:22:35,102 --> 00:22:36,160
It's a game between two gentlemen.

419
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,289
Don't play dirty.

420
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:45,964
Be steady.

I won, Liang Mu Ze.

428
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,154
Hurry, do the dishes!

429
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,664
I'll do the dishes.

430
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,233
Fine.

431
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:50,374

436
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,600
Fool, those are tricks.

437
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:38,000
Thank you for taking care of OK.

438
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:41,240
I was worried that you would think
that I brought negative impact on it.

439
00:24:44,397 --> 00:24:45,920
What if it were a human?

440
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:49,360
What do you mean?

441
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,414
If there is a lady
who has a broken heart...

442
00:24:54,774 --> 00:24:56,714
and looks ugly when she laughs,

443
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,440
is she allowed to laugh?

444
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:00,280
Why not?

445
00:25:00,652 --> 00:25:03,192
Others think that she asked to be hurt.

446
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:05,255
They even attacked her.

447
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,324
All the mishaps were caused by herself.

448
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:12,460
The criminal gets away unpunished,

449
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:14,120
but the victim
still suffers from the torment.

450
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,000
She's not even allowed to laugh.

451
00:25:21,764 --> 00:25:22,840
Who are "the others"?

452
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,440
No matter who they are,

453
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,854
they don't have
the right to judge and condemn,

454
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,480
because they've never
gone through the suffering.

455
00:25:33,613 --> 00:25:34,680
Don't mind them.

456
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,920
Let them be.

457
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:38,680
Make yourself happy.

458
00:25:40,712 --> 00:25:41,640
You don't have to prove
anything to anyone...

459
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,274
when you're genuinely happy.

460
00:25:45,743 --> 00:25:47,240
Furthermore,
those who genuinely care for you...

461
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,720
only care about your happiness.

462
00:25:59,443 --> 00:26:01,317
You love it with all your heart.

463
00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:02,200
Am I right?

464
00:26:04,073 --> 00:26:04,942
Who?

465
00:26:04,983 --> 00:26:06,080
Master Le Tian.

466
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,840
Who else?

467
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,520
Yes.

468
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:18,493
I like it.

469
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
Ever since it came into my life,

470
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:23,160
I haven't had to recite poems to myself.

471
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:24,640
You have me.

472
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,160
You can recite poems to me every day.

473
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:29,252
You like ancient poems too?

474
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:30,440
I like you...

475
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,044
and the poem that you recite.

476
00:26:39,154 --> 00:26:40,544
My ride's here.

477
00:26:40,757 --> 00:26:42,000
Bye, Mr. Tian.

478
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,120
Why don't you sit at the back?

479
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:45,800
It's safer.

480
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,000
Thank you.

481
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:51,640
Give me a call when you reach.

482
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:54,251
Goodbye.

483
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:18,800
Mister.

484
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:20,880
The weather is so nice today.

485
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:23,280
Dr Zhang.

486
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:24,480
Where are you?

487
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,724
I'm at home. I just had lunch.

488
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:28,460
We've found a lung for Liu Ran.

489
00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:30,960
That's quick!

490
00:28:31,518 --> 00:28:33,640
The donor is a brain-dead patient.

491
00:28:34,314 --> 00:28:36,579
The matched patient who was waiting
for organ donation...

492
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,416
passed away 20 minutes ago
all of a sudden.

493
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:40,000
Liang Mu Ze!

494
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:42,902
In order not to let the lung
go to waste,

495
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:44,503
the system conducted
another matching session...

496
00:28:44,544 --> 00:28:46,804
based on proximity
and has chosen Liu Ran.

497
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:48,783
The operation room is being prepared.

498
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:50,882
I'm going to conduct
a pre-surgery examination on her.

499
00:28:50,923 --> 00:28:51,976
However, we're short-handed.

500
00:28:52,017 --> 00:28:53,703
-Are you free?
-Yes.

501
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:55,640
Please get the lung from the airport.

502
00:28:56,356 --> 00:28:57,760
I'll be the coordinator.

503
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,983
Inform me immediately
after you have obtained the lung.

504
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:01,393
Sure.
Send me the flight number...

505
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:03,152
and the information
of the doctor from the other side.

506
00:29:03,193 --> 00:29:04,522
No problem.
Be safe.

507
00:29:04,563 --> 00:29:05,759
I'll be waiting for you in the OR.

508
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,640
Sure.

509
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,724
Hold on!

510
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,800
Let's go.

511
00:29:39,624 --> 00:29:44,224
(SUV no. C55400, reward...)

512
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:55,720
Isn't Zhang Yi Chi a cardiac surgeon?

513
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:57,800
Why is he in charge
in the lung transplant surgery?

514
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:02,264
Many cardiac surgeons
know how to conduct thoracic surgery.

515
00:30:02,513 --> 00:30:05,143
Dr Zhang
transferred from cardiothoracic surgery...

516
00:30:05,184 --> 00:30:07,064
to cardiac surgery
which is even more challenging.

517
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:09,352
He stands out because...

518
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:11,473
it's rare to find someone
who can handle cardiac surgery...

519
00:30:11,514 --> 00:30:13,673
and cardiothoracic surgery
at the same time.

520
00:30:13,714 --> 00:30:16,181
It's not achievable with
ordinary effort and experience.

521
00:30:16,222 --> 00:30:18,000
One has to be really talented
to achieve that.

522
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:21,702
What's wrong?

523
00:30:21,743 --> 00:30:23,568
The lung was removed
from the body at 10:00 AM.

524
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:25,612
The lung arrived
at the airport at 11:30 AM...

525
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:27,270
and the flight took off at 12:00 PM.

526
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:29,484
If the flight took two hours,

527
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:31,375
four hours
have been wasted on journey alone.

528
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:32,640
How long can the lung be kept?

529
00:30:33,263 --> 00:30:36,585
From removal to implantation
and to hemoperfusion,

530
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,312
there is
a safe cold ischemia time interval.

531
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,799
The optimal time is six hours.

532
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,393
The maximum can go up to 12 hours.

533
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:43,960
Ruling out the procedure
which will take more than five hours,

534
00:30:44,913 --> 00:30:47,444
the transportation of the lung
has to be limited within six hours.

535
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:52,388
Therefore, we're only left with
a maximum of two hours.

536
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,956
We must deliver the lung to the OR
before 4:00 PM.

537
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:56,960
Can we make it?

538
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:00,900
Send a text message
to the doctor from the other side.

539
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:02,712
Tell him after he alights,

540
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:03,672
he should go to
the departure floor right away.

541
00:31:03,713 --> 00:31:04,632
We'll leave right after we get the lung.

542
00:31:04,673 --> 00:31:05,798
It's to save time.

543
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,720
Sure.

544
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:44,884
Thank you.

545
00:31:44,925 --> 00:31:45,880
Goodbye.

546
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:56,115
Dr Zhang, we have received the lung.

547
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:57,403
We have just left the airport.

548
00:31:57,444 --> 00:31:58,594
The estimated time of arrival is...

549
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,960
An hour.

550
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:03,557
We'll reach the hospital in an hour.

551
00:32:03,598 --> 00:32:04,680
Okay, got it.

552
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:10,880
Let's begin.

553
00:32:11,856 --> 00:32:13,415
The air capacity of the right lung
is weaker.

554
00:32:13,456 --> 00:32:14,523
We should remove the right lung first.

555
00:32:14,564 --> 00:32:15,412
Yes.

556
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,440
Chest expander.

557
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:37,040
Tighten it.

558
00:32:55,482 --> 00:32:57,053
It's going to be rush hour soon.

559
00:32:57,094 --> 00:32:58,280
We may get trapped in traffic.

560
00:32:58,778 --> 00:32:59,894
Hold the safe tight.

561
00:33:48,147 --> 00:33:49,120
Be careful!

562
00:34:01,593 --> 00:34:02,783
Call Rao Feng now. Hurry!

563
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:03,760
Sure.

564
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,193
Rao Zhi!

565
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:11,418
Got it.
I'll bring my people there.

566
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:13,052
The nearby traffic police
will be there soon.

567
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:13,960
Stay safe.

568
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:11,263
The first branch of pulmonary artery
is cut off.

569
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,840
Xiao Wang.

570
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,240
Dr Zhang.

571
00:35:14,743 --> 00:35:16,040
Ask Chu Xia where she is.

572
00:35:16,754 --> 00:35:17,640
Sure.

573
00:35:30,484 --> 00:35:31,552
We're at the coastal road.

574
00:35:31,593 --> 00:35:32,661
Something unexpected happened.

575
00:35:32,702 --> 00:35:33,720
We're trying our best to rush back.

576
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:44,360
Liang Mu Ze.

577
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:46,501
I can't take it anymore.

578
00:37:02,405 --> 00:37:03,400
Watch out!

579
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,604
Watch out!

580
00:39:57,915 --> 00:39:58,910
Are you okay?

581
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:01,046
What is the time now?

582
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:02,398
Can we summon a taxi?

583
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:03,800
We need to rush back to the hospital.

584
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:06,060
We'll talk about it later.

585
00:40:07,923 --> 00:40:08,800
Come on.

586
00:40:26,094 --> 00:40:27,000
Hello.

587
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,744
This is my military identity card.

588
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:31,200
We're executing an urgent mission.

589
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:35,118
We need to deliver the lung to
109 Hospital within half an hour.

590
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,626
Let me send you there.

591
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,800
We're running out of time.
We can't afford to be trapped in traffic.

592
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:40,072
Is this your motorcycle?

593
00:40:40,113 --> 00:40:41,814
-Can I borrow it?
-Sure, no problem.

594
00:40:41,855 --> 00:40:43,273
I'll come back within half an hour.

595
00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:44,292
I'll give a statement when I'm back.

596
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,240
Okay.

597
00:40:57,944 --> 00:41:00,384
(Mission failed)

598
00:41:09,492 --> 00:41:11,632
Getting ready to cut off pulmonary vein.

599
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,043
Is Xia Chu here yet?

600
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:08,080
Not yet.

601
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,913
Call her.

602
00:42:10,054 --> 00:42:12,534
We tried to call her
but we couldn't reach her.

603
00:42:31,828 --> 00:42:35,698
(Outpatient Department)

604
00:42:42,304 --> 00:42:44,080
I'm sorry.

605
00:43:00,468 --> 00:43:02,688
Thank goodness you're here.

606
00:43:11,643 --> 00:43:12,600
Xia Chu.

607
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:30,680
Why are you here?

608
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,400
I have something to give you.

609
00:43:41,037 --> 00:43:43,947
If the 3D gun belongs to Zhuo Ran,

610
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:46,160
it's not difficult
to solve your problem.

611
00:43:54,747 --> 00:43:55,927
I heard that
you're raising a surgery fund...

612
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:57,738
for a patient of yours on the Internet.

613
00:43:58,238 --> 00:43:59,538
I would like to donate some money.

614
00:44:00,561 --> 00:44:01,600
Please pass it to them.

615
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:18,920
Thank you.

616
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:22,920
I just went through an episode.

617
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:24,941
That's why I'm shaking.

618
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:27,342
Xia Chu.

619
00:44:27,383 --> 00:44:29,183
Dr Zhang wants you
to come in and observe the surgery.

620
00:44:29,224 --> 00:44:30,200
Hurry up.

621
00:44:35,459 --> 00:44:36,440
I'm sorry.

622
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:38,400
I need to get changed.

623
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:39,760
Go on.

624
00:44:58,636 --> 00:44:59,560
Dr Zhang.

625
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:00,840
What took you so long?

626
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,320
I fell into the sea.

627
00:45:10,138 --> 00:45:11,120
You've worked hard.

628
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,760
That's my duty.

629
00:45:18,123 --> 00:45:19,040
All right.

630
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:20,633
Get ready for the lung implantation.

631
00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:21,640
Yes.

632
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,462
I'm going to leave the office soon.

633
00:45:39,825 --> 00:45:40,760
How about you?

634
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,988
Have you forgotten?

635
00:45:45,029 --> 00:45:46,463
"The Penalty Zone"
will be premiered tonight.

636
00:45:46,504 --> 00:45:47,880
We're going for the movie, aren't we?

637
00:45:48,443 --> 00:45:49,440
I'm sorry.

638
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:50,999
Something came up.

639
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,000
I have to work on it.

640
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:54,360
I shall skip the movie too.

641
00:45:54,803 --> 00:45:56,960
I'll bring supper to your company
and I'll wait for you.

642
00:45:57,243 --> 00:45:58,280
What do you want to eat?

643
00:45:58,493 --> 00:45:59,413
It's okay.

644
00:45:59,558 --> 00:46:01,640
I prefer to work alone.

645
00:46:02,075 --> 00:46:03,035
That's all.

646
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,240
I have to go.
