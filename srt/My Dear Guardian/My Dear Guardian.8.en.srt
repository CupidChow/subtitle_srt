=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,990
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:39,875
Xiao Jun.

4
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:43,281
Do you still like
Xuan Xuan from your school?

5
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:46,084
What do you like about her?

6
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:47,631
I like everything about her.

7
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:49,216
Why?

8
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,440
Is she the prettiest girl in your school?

9
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:54,360
I don't think so.

10
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:56,837
Then why do you like her?

11
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:04,353
Why did you suddenly ask me this?

12
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:10,869
Luo Xiao Jun.

13
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,800
How do you feel?

14
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,379
What say you?

15
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:17,965
I think you're doing really well.

16
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:21,015
Xia Chu.

17
00:02:21,544 --> 00:02:23,054
Change his dressing.

18
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:24,045
Yes.

19
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:28,682
What are you doing?

20
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:31,485
We're discussing about the next step.

21
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:33,237
You're really in the mood.

22
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,680
All right. Let's go to Room 3.

23
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:42,843
Is it so difficult to see a doctor?

24
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:45,634
Let's go.

25
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:51,157
Let's go.
It's time to see the psychiatrist.

26
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:55,068
Don't mess with me.

27
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:58,075
I'm not messing with you.

28
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,661
-It's your turn.
-It's my turn.

29
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:02,440
Liang Mu Ze.

30
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:09,757
The white blood cell count
of patient no. 18 is still low.

31
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:11,684
Pay attention to him.

32
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,340
If your family like it, just let me know.

33
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,815
I can bring more for you.

34
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:16,956
Don't be shy.

35
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:18,651
What are you doing?

36
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:20,672
Dr. Zhang.

37
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:22,692
Don't sell it too hard.

38
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:25,490
You're going to make our nurses
go bankrupt soon.

39
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:27,115
That's impossible.

40
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:29,757
These handmade reusable bag
are designed by me.

41
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:31,672
-It's a present for the nurses.
-Is it?

42
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,560
It's to thank them
for taking care of my son.

43
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:35,148
Thank you so much.

44
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:36,368
We're getting back to work.

45
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:37,399
Thank you for the present.

46
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,259
You should get back to work. By the way,

47
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:41,103
-it's for everyone.
-Thank you, Ms. Meng Zhen.

48
00:03:41,144 --> 00:03:43,194
The patterns and designs are my ideas.

49
00:03:43,235 --> 00:03:44,389
You won't find it anywhere else.

50
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,708
I hope you like it.

51
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:46,859
Thank you.

52
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,000
You're welcome.

53
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:50,508
I don't get one?

54
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,977
It's rare to see men buying reusable bag.

55
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:55,040
Hence, I didn't make one for you.

56
00:03:56,592 --> 00:03:57,782
However,

57
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,139
I know that doctors are hygienic.

58
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:02,929
Therefore, I made you a soap.

59
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:04,211
I hope you like it.

60
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:06,541
You made a soap for me?

61
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,891
Look, my surname is carved on the soap.

62
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:17,378
Thank you so much.

63
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:18,529
You're welcome.

64
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,399
It's personally customized
and it's the only and only in the world.

65
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,409
-I'll keep it well.
-Sure.

66
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,798
By the way, we just checked on Xiao Jun.

67
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,008
He's recovering well.

68
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,439
We changed his dressing today.

69
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29,839
If everything goes well,
he can be discharged on Monday.

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,820
Really?

71
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:32,799
Thank you so much!

72
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:40,756
Okay, got it.

73
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,307
I'll come now.

74
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,828
There's a patient in the emergency ward.

75
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,375
A metal pierced through his chest.

76
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,461
I'm going down to have a look.

77
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:48,903
Take care of your respective patients.

78
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:51,154
-Call me if anything.
-Yes.

79
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:52,510
Okay, you go ahead.

80
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:54,128
Ms. Meng Zhen, we're getting back to work.

81
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,640
Okay, go now.

82
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:02,319
Have you fallen in love with someone?

83
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:03,388
No.

84
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:04,655
Say it.

85
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:05,696
It's a secret between us.

86
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:07,040
I won't tell Ms. Zhen.

87
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,979
I'm not you. I'm not scared of your mom.

88
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,116
Who are you scared of?

89
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:12,187
I'm scared of you the most.

90
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:15,904
Xiao Jun.

91
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:17,689
It's time to change dressing.

92
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:20,889
Here.

93
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:22,193
Pull your shirt up.

94
00:05:24,982 --> 00:05:25,862
Let me help you.

95
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:27,007
Go away!

96
00:05:27,048 --> 00:05:28,418
Don't touch me. Get out now!

97
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:33,023
I'll leave after changing the dressing.
Here, be good.

98
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:35,399
I don't want you to do it.
I don't want you to do it.

99
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,977
Get out!

100
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:39,400
Get out!

101
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:40,413
Xiao Jun.

102
00:05:40,454 --> 00:05:41,567
Xiao Jun, what's wrong?

103
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,788
Dr. Xia, what's going on?

104
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,190
Nothing.

105
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:48,610
Dr. Xia, you need to learn
how to respect your patient.

106
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:55,440
What if the patient is wrong?

107
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,399
If he stays stubborn,

108
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,180
he will bear greater pain in the end.

109
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:01,855
Dr. Xia, it's just changing the dressing.

110
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,916
Why would he suffer from greater pain?

111
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:07,568
Nothing.

112
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:08,749
I'll come again later.

113
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,970
Sure.

114
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:13,877
Why hasn't medical order
for patient no. 17 here yet?

115
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:15,739
You're the slowest. Speed up.

116
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,068
No...

117
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,916
My desktop went dead just now.

118
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:20,087
I just got it repaired.

119
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:21,400
Explain to the patient!

120
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:41,388
Can you please change dressing
for Luo Xiao Jun on behalf of me?

121
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,062
No, I'm occupied.

122
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,996
I'll prepare the medical order for you.

123
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,421
You can leave all the medical orders that
has to be done within this week to me.

124
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,120
Two weeks worth of medical orders.

125
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:56,536
It's a deal.

126
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,200
It's done.

127
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,840
-Thank you, Dr. Xiao.
-No problem.

128
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,710
Thank you.

129
00:07:09,036 --> 00:07:10,466
By the way, Xiao Jun,

130
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
tell me the truth.

131
00:07:12,977 --> 00:07:15,227
Why won't you let Dr. Xia
to change your dressing?

132
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:16,800
It's none of your business.

133
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,485
It's none of your business too.

134
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,352
Luo Xiao Jun!

135
00:07:21,393 --> 00:07:22,393
What's wrong with you?

136
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:23,904
You're being rude.

137
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:28,211
Liang Mu Ze.

138
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:30,268
Will you take care of Ms. Zhen forever?

139
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:33,151
It's none of your business.

140
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:34,483
Xiao Jun.

141
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:37,543
You haven't told me
what you want for lunch.

142
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,338
Will you, Liang Mu Ze?

143
00:07:39,857 --> 00:07:41,800
Of course. Do you have to ask?

144
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,696
I want braised pork ribs.
Two portions please.

145
00:07:45,737 --> 00:07:47,640
Ms. Zhen, go with Liang Mu Ze.

146
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:00,240
Why are you so happy?

147
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,480
Liang Mu Ze promised
to take care of Ms. Zhen forever.

148
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,480
What does that mean?

149
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:10,640
That means I took note of it.

150
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:15,461
I know why you hate me.

151
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:18,120
It's because of Liang Mu Ze, right?

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,040
Listen.

153
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,935
Ever since we met each other
for the first time,

154
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:26,516
I've always been your doctor.

155
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:28,186
Now, I'm still your doctor.

156
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:31,668
I'll be responsible of your health
until you're discharged.

157
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:33,684
Please don't hate me.

158
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,569
It's nothing to do with Liang Mu Ze.

159
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,059
It's for your own good.

160
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:40,507
If...

161
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,759
You hold grudges against me for nothing,

162
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,900
you may hurt yourself in the end.

163
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,009
Please buy me a bouquet of flowers.

164
00:08:48,284 --> 00:08:49,160
What?

165
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,065
In the name of Liang Mu Ze.

166
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:53,493
Send a bouquet of flowers to my mom.

167
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:56,084
That way, I'll believe in you.

168
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,421
Will you behave and receive treatment?

169
00:08:58,462 --> 00:08:59,342
Yes.

170
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:02,194
That's a deal.

171
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,476
That's a deal.

172
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,660
-Are you going back to the camp later?
-Yes.

173
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,780
Xiao Jun becomes more sensitive
after falling sick.

174
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,310
Don't take what he said just now
to heart.

175
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,403
Meng Zhen.

176
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:19,125
Xiao Jun is a kid but I'm not.

177
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:20,893
I'll honor my words.

178
00:09:22,058 --> 00:09:23,598
You don't have to do that, Mu Ze.

179
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:28,116
It's been eight years.
It's more than enough.

180
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:31,498
I can take care of myself.

181
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,128
Xiao Jun has grown up.

182
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:34,789
I can take care of him by myself.

183
00:09:35,377 --> 00:09:36,277
As for you,

184
00:09:36,863 --> 00:09:38,043
you should move on.

185
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:39,879
You should go on with dating,
getting married...

186
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,820
and have your own children.

187
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:43,241
You should find your own life purpose.

188
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,942
Taking care of you is my life purpose.

189
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:47,879
Do you plan to live like this
for the rest of your life?

190
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:53,482
Both of us know that
it shouldn't be like this.

191
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:55,229
Sometimes,

192
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,690
inappropriate promises
could be a form of disturbance...

193
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,733
to a kid.

194
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:03,178
Mom.

195
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:04,315
Xiao Jun.

196
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:06,099
Xiao Jun, why are you here?

197
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,710
Didn't I tell you to wait in the ward?

198
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,250
It's for you.

199
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:12,339
Where did you get the flowers?

200
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:14,035
Liang Mu Ze got it in secret.

201
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,540
He wants to give you a surprise. Look.

202
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:18,891
It's a card with his name on it.

203
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:25,040
Hurry up, Liang Mu Ze.

204
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,560
Aren't you going to propose?

205
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:35,267
The flowers are so beautiful.

206
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:36,462
I like it.

207
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,203
I like it no matter who the sender is.

208
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,678
However...

209
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:41,748
We can't get married.

210
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:47,673
Why?

211
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,580
You promised
you will take care of her forever.

212
00:10:49,843 --> 00:10:51,353
I'll take care of both of you forever.

213
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:53,054
However,
it's different from getting married.

214
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,160
Why?

215
00:10:58,167 --> 00:10:59,360
Is it because you don't like my mom?

216
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,060
Here, come here.

217
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:04,294
Listen.

218
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:05,200
Come here.

219
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,320
Sit down.

220
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,209
Let me tell you.

221
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,670
Marriage is something important.

222
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,488
It's not as simple as you imagine.

223
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:24,899
It's not just about liking someone or not.

224
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:27,994
There are more elements to it.

225
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,480
Therefore,

226
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,520
I can't marry Liang Mu Ze.

227
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:35,469
It's not going to happen.

228
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:36,680
Can you understand?

229
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,770
He promised to take care of you forever.

230
00:11:42,592 --> 00:11:44,602
He said that out of kindness.

231
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,420
However, taking care of us
is not his responsibility.

232
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,330
It's a success!

233
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:04,769
Stop crying, Xiao Jun.

234
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,480
Stop crying.

235
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:07,943
Xiao Jun.

236
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:13,026
What's wrong?

237
00:12:13,788 --> 00:12:14,768
What's wrong?

238
00:12:15,238 --> 00:12:16,280
Was it you?

239
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:18,127
Yes.

240
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:19,068
Are you crazy?

241
00:12:19,553 --> 00:12:20,613
Ridiculous.

242
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:25,936
Yes.

243
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,263
I'm crazy.

244
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:29,291
Dr. Xia.

245
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:31,000
You should apologise to her.

246
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:34,707
Dr. Xia.

247
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,705
Dr. Xia, sorry to have taken up
so much of your time.

248
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:40,552
It's okay. I'm going to meet a friend
at the emergency department.

249
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,870
Be careful!

250
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:45,152
Dr. Xia, are you okay?

251
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:48,026
Put up with it.

252
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:51,812
Your bone is fine
but the ligament is injured.

253
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:54,432
If it's not fixed, it won't recover.

254
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,574
You're a doctor.
You should know the consequences.

255
00:12:57,768 --> 00:12:59,208
How long will it take to recover?

256
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,619
It will take about a week.

257
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:02,666
Don't walk too much and rest well.

258
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:05,016
Can I go to work tomorrow?

259
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:06,162
Go to work?

260
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,780
Do you plan to give up
on conducting surgery?

261
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,153
We'll talk about it
when your leg has fully recovered.

262
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,690
You may get back to work.

263
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:18,000
I can handle it.

264
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,162
I'm going back to the unit at 6:00.

265
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:21,303
You should come back with me.

266
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:22,724
Why?

267
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:23,690
You'll be staying there for a few days.

268
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:24,829
Why?

269
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:27,259
Why? He's worried about you.

270
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,790
No.

271
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:33,415
I promised Zhang Yi Chi
to take good care of you.

272
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,084
It's done.

273
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,265
Go get a wheelchair.

274
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:38,271
It's not needed.

275
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:44,480
Liang Mu Ze!

276
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,080
Military officers have great stamina.

277
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,359
Liang Mu Ze, let me down!

278
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,300
Put me down!

279
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:55,418
Stop moving.
I won't be responsible if you fall.

280
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,259
Put me down!
We're in the hospital.

281
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,880
You're creating a scene.

282
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,241
Stop looking around.

283
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,281
-Look at them.
-You...

284
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:02,801
Let me down!

285
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,681
Stop moving.

286
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:49,203
I...

287
00:14:50,478 --> 00:14:53,048
Let go of me! I want to get down!

288
00:14:53,587 --> 00:14:54,918
You're abducting me.

289
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,949
I'm going to scream for help.

290
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,276
If you don't mind embarrassing yourself,
you may do so.

291
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,197
I don't mind.

292
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,350
Should we follow them?

293
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:24,972
Go back to the office.

294
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,769
Mi Gu?

295
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,759
Mi Gu!

296
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:46,766
Mi Gu!

297
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,093
Mi Gu!

298
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,910
I'll be there in half an hour.

299
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,572
Roll down the car window.

300
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,626
Mi Gu!

301
00:15:58,104 --> 00:15:59,284
Mi Gu!

302
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:12,064
-He's gone?
-Yes.

303
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,874
He requested to be discharged.

304
00:16:13,915 --> 00:16:15,015
Didn't you know?

305
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:16,749
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

306
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,279
One, two, three, four!

307
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,834
One, two, three, four!

308
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,560
One, two, three, four!

309
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:28,491
One, two, three, four!

310
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:32,143
I think I just saw Captain Liang's car.

311
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,790
Stand still!

312
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:39,371
Tian Yong.

313
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:42,372
Tian Yong.

314
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,046
Captain.

315
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:48,458
Dr. Xia?

316
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:51,301
Yes.

317
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,620
Good day, Mrs. Liang.

318
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:55,670
Good day, Mrs. Liang.

319
00:16:55,711 --> 00:16:57,001
Good day, Mrs. Liang.

320
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:58,289
Good day, Mrs. Liang.

321
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,530
Good day, Mrs. Liang!

322
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:00,612
Good day, Mrs. Liang.

323
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:01,833
Good day, Mrs. Liang.

324
00:17:01,874 --> 00:17:03,719
What are you doing?

325
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:05,361
Who is Mrs. Liang?

326
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:08,392
Brigade Commander.

327
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:10,336
Good day, Brigade Commander!

328
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,589
I told you to come back at 6:00.

329
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,507
You're late 20 minutes.

330
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:18,612
-What happened?
-Reporting.

331
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:19,552
Chief.

332
00:17:22,395 --> 00:17:23,455
Chief.

333
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:25,356
He was late because
he kept me company at the hospital.

334
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:26,643
Who are you?

335
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:28,863
Reporting to Brigade Commander.

336
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:31,324
She is a cardiac surgeon
from 109 Hospital.

337
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:33,429
Reporting.

338
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:35,814
Dr. Xia was my savior.

339
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,880
She saved me when we were in Isaia.

340
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,548
It's you, Dr. Xia.
Hello.

341
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:45,147
I have been wanting
to thank you face to face.

342
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:46,998
I didn't expect to see you today.

343
00:17:48,076 --> 00:17:49,736
Chief, don't mention it.

344
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:51,077
You may call me Xia Chu.

345
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:52,320
Sure, Xia Chu.

346
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:56,049
What happened?

347
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:01,236
I accidentally fell down.

348
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:03,941
Captain Liang ran into me
in the hospital and hence,

349
00:18:05,342 --> 00:18:06,442
he took me in.

350
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,150
Took you...

351
00:18:11,184 --> 00:18:12,379
Look at me.

352
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,710
I got it now.

353
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:14,800
Xia Chu.

354
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:17,449
You're going to stay here
for a while, right?

355
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:18,880
-Yes.
-No.

356
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,710
She'll stay.

357
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:25,432
Chief.

358
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:27,275
The military camp
is full of confidential information.

359
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,247
I'm an outsider.

360
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:30,148
You're not an outsider.

361
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:31,408
Xia Chu.

362
00:18:31,754 --> 00:18:33,764
You're Tian Yong's savior, right?

363
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:36,160
That means you're the savior
of Special Forces Brigade too.

364
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:37,800
-Am I right?
-Yes!

365
00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:39,608
-Liang Mu Ze.
-Yes!

366
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:41,979
-Take care of Xia Chu.
-Yes!

367
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:43,431
Chief.

368
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,888
I need to get back to the hospital.
I didn't apply for leave.

369
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:47,669
You don't have to worry about that.

370
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,607
Just stay here, relax
and nurse your wound.

371
00:18:50,648 --> 00:18:52,548
I'll talk to your boss later.

372
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:54,476
-Liang Mu Ze!
-Yes!

373
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:56,796
Send Xia Chu to the guest house.

374
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:57,680
Yes!

375
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,501
-I'll send her there now.
-Go.

376
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:06,157
-Thank you, Chief.
-Goodbye, Xia Chu.

377
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm leaving, Brigade Commander.

378
00:19:10,723 --> 00:19:11,703
-Tian Yong.
-Yes!

379
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,381
I've a meeting
at the Brigade Headquarters.

380
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:16,680
So, please send dinner and
daily necessities to Dr. Xia.

381
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:19,364
Get her a few pair of clothes too.

382
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:20,355
Will do, sir.

383
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,200
-Tian Yong!
-Yes!

384
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:34,181
Sing the cadence while marching.

385
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:35,731
Yes!

386
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,698
Turn to the rear and march!

387
00:19:43,218 --> 00:19:45,839
♪Unity is strength♪

388
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,278
Ready, sing!

389
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:53,000
♪Unity is strength♪

390
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:55,763
Liang Mu Ze, I don't want to stay here!

391
00:19:56,268 --> 00:19:57,488
You're not going to stay here.

392
00:19:57,893 --> 00:19:58,938
I want to go home.

393
00:19:58,979 --> 00:20:00,109
You'd better not do that.

394
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:01,402
Why?

395
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,050
Because I took you in.

396
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,453
I was giving you face.

397
00:20:08,494 --> 00:20:10,324
I said that because he's your boss.

398
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:12,019
In fact, I'm kidnapped by you.

399
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,080
Don't act innocent.

400
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:15,216
Fine, no matter what,

401
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,885
you can only leave after you've recovered.

402
00:20:16,926 --> 00:20:17,946
Liang Mu Ze.

403
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:21,354
Are you worried it'd be difficult
to explain to Mr. Zhang Yi Chi?

404
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:23,654
It's okay.
You don't have to take it to heart.

405
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:25,121
I can explain for you.

406
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:26,192
Just let me go, okay?

407
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,013
Let me survive on my own, okay?

408
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,591
What does that mean?

409
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,720
Just how much do you loathe
military camp and Special Forces soldiers?

410
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,390
No matter how much you loathe us,

411
00:20:39,311 --> 00:20:40,381
you have to put up with us.

412
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,590
It's nothing to do with military camp
and the Special Forces!

413
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,680
I just want to stay alone!

414
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:46,128
I just want to go home!

415
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:48,290
I don't want to stand in your way
and being called crazy.

416
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,200
Can't you just let me go?

417
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,150
-No.
-Why?

418
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:53,074
That's my house.

419
00:20:53,526 --> 00:20:56,356
I have the final say on
whether you can go back.

420
00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:11,555
Attention! At ease.

421
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,437
Xia Chu.

422
00:21:36,073 --> 00:21:37,083
Stop crying.

423
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,800
Xia Chu.

424
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,693
Stop crying.

425
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:13,167
Stop crying.

426
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,433
Xia Chu.

427
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:43,424
Is the medicine not working?

428
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:45,359
Yes, she's been crying.

429
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:46,573
Where are you?

430
00:22:46,614 --> 00:22:47,884
I'll check on her.

431
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:49,124
We're in the military camp.

432
00:22:51,575 --> 00:22:53,400
Are you sure that her bone is fine?

433
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:54,520
Don't worry.

434
00:22:54,758 --> 00:22:57,488
The diagnosis by Orthopedic Department
is surely accurate.

435
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:00,288
Furthermore, even if she injured
her bone,

436
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:02,549
a minor outpatient treatment
wouldn't make her cry.

437
00:23:02,754 --> 00:23:03,837
Be honest.

438
00:23:03,878 --> 00:23:05,298
Did you bully her?

439
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,554
How is Xiao Jun doing?

440
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:09,832
I've just done with my work.

441
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:10,800
I'm going to check on him.

442
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:13,367
All right, give me a call if anything.

443
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:17,746
You should take care of yourself.

444
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:19,331
Since you brought her back,

445
00:23:19,372 --> 00:23:20,472
you should take care of her.

446
00:23:21,811 --> 00:23:23,111
When you're dealing with a lady,

447
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,412
you have to be gentle, okay?

448
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:29,079
She's injured
but her parents are not around.

449
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,344
She must be fragile at the moment.

450
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:32,160
She can't take your cold treatment.

451
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:33,621
All right, I've to go.

452
00:23:37,296 --> 00:23:38,306
He brought her back.

453
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,050
(Outpatient Department)

454
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:07,320
Have some food.

455
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:09,569
Is it sweet?

456
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:17,341
Did I scare Liang Mu Ze away?

457
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:20,756
He's not made of paper.

458
00:24:20,797 --> 00:24:22,107
He's gone back to the military camp.

459
00:24:23,654 --> 00:24:24,534
No.

460
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:33,988
I almost died...

461
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:36,966
from the illness.

462
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,280
I had two surgeries.

463
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:43,561
My heart is problematic.

464
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:45,273
You're all right.

465
00:24:45,314 --> 00:24:46,840
You've recovered, okay?

466
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,099
Nothing will happen to you.

467
00:24:49,263 --> 00:24:50,843
No one can predict the future.

468
00:24:55,186 --> 00:24:56,416
If one day...

469
00:24:57,568 --> 00:24:59,138
I leave this world just like dad,

470
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:01,800
I hope...

471
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:06,930
someone can keep you company
and take care of you.

472
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,860
Otherwise, you'll be lonely.

473
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,740
You'll be sad for sure.

474
00:25:23,514 --> 00:25:24,800
That's why I lied to you...

475
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:28,388
and claimed that the flower
was from Liang Mu Ze.

476
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:31,709
I like him.

477
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:35,147
I thought you liked him too.

478
00:25:37,582 --> 00:25:38,962
I didn't lie on purpose.

479
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,002
I know.

480
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,080
You will be fine.

481
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:51,040
You will be fine.

482
00:25:53,454 --> 00:25:54,954
You'll always be by my side.

483
00:25:56,185 --> 00:25:58,095
Don't think too much, okay?

484
00:25:59,694 --> 00:26:00,664
I know.

485
00:26:01,262 --> 00:26:02,562
You will be fine.

486
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:20,812
Are you doing laundry?

487
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:23,468
Dr. Zhang.

488
00:26:27,677 --> 00:26:28,737
Done with work?

489
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:37,189
What's wrong?

490
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:39,824
Nothing.

491
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:42,753
The laundry detergent
accidentally got into my eyes.

492
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:45,959
That's a little far-fetched.

493
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:48,101
Did you cry?

494
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:58,141
Xiao Jun bought me a bouquet of flower
in the afternoon.

495
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:01,939
He told Liang Mu Ze to propose to me.

496
00:27:02,502 --> 00:27:03,722
Propose to you?

497
00:27:09,164 --> 00:27:10,594
Were you touched?

498
00:27:11,873 --> 00:27:15,714
It's never crossed my mind that
my son would be the match-maker for me.

499
00:27:16,617 --> 00:27:17,680
He said,

500
00:27:20,024 --> 00:27:21,644
he's worried that if he left the world,

501
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:23,804
I would be lonely.

502
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:32,440
Actually that's a good idea.

503
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,100
Liang Mu Ze is a nice man.

504
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,019
I think you should consider him.

505
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:40,869
What? Liang Mu Ze?

506
00:27:41,183 --> 00:27:42,073
Yes.

507
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:46,388
How is that possible?

508
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:49,235
Listen.

509
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:53,371
I embroidered a piece of table cloth
a few years back.

510
00:27:54,487 --> 00:27:56,177
It's a blue bird.

511
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:57,920
I really liked it.

512
00:27:58,432 --> 00:28:00,030
However, one day,
I accidentally spilled juice on it.

513
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,082
It's tainted.

514
00:28:01,123 --> 00:28:03,180
I couldn't get rid of the stain
no matter how hard I tried.

515
00:28:03,221 --> 00:28:07,080
I thought I could produce another one,

516
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:09,943
but I couldn't do it.

517
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,334
When the patterns are similar,

518
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,623
I can't help but keep comparing the both.

519
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:17,087
Even if the new one is more delicate,

520
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,188
I would always miss the old one.

521
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,442
Mu Ze seems so familiar to me.

522
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:26,631
When he stood before me
in the army uniform...

523
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,292
that I'm especially familiar with,

524
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,234
it's as if I could see the shadow
of Xiao Jun's dad.

525
00:28:33,785 --> 00:28:34,880
Therefore,

526
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,160
I trust him.

527
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,038
I even relied heavily on him once.

528
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:45,720
However, I know that
I can't bring my feelings forward.

529
00:28:46,632 --> 00:28:47,680
He won't do that.

530
00:28:48,804 --> 00:28:49,834
I won't do that either.

531
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:54,100
There are many patterns I can do.

532
00:28:54,141 --> 00:28:55,681
However, there is only one blue bird.

533
00:28:58,813 --> 00:28:59,943
I get it.

534
00:28:59,984 --> 00:29:02,004
I can totally understand that.

535
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:07,511
Stop thinking so much.

536
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,279
Xiao Jun will slowly grow up.

537
00:29:11,337 --> 00:29:12,997
He won't let you live a lonely life.

538
00:29:18,185 --> 00:29:19,685
Thank you, Dr. Zhang.

539
00:29:20,837 --> 00:29:21,717
See you.

540
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,320
Goodbye.

541
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,750
Xia Chu.

542
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,020
Have some water.

543
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:47,375
Listen.

544
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,680
I'm sorry.

545
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:58,026
I shouldn't have had scolded you.

546
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:01,740
However, bringing you back to the camp
is for your own good.

547
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,930
Am I right?

548
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,049
Someone will take care of your meals.

549
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,240
You'll recover faster.

550
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:14,961
Just stay here with ease.

551
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:16,151
I'll always be in the camp.

552
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,680
You can reach me anytime for anything.

553
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,780
Okay?

554
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:21,531
Xia Chu.

555
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,590
I'm hungry.

556
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,300
No problem.

557
00:30:48,992 --> 00:30:49,922
Reporting!

558
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:52,542
Come in.

559
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,040
Captain Liang.

560
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:02,108
Why do you look troubled?

561
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:04,881
Look at the operational requirement
suggested by the sixth team.

562
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:06,022
How can I not be troubled?

563
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:10,269
I'm not talking about
operational requirement.

564
00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:14,257
I'm talking about Dr. Xia.

565
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:16,369
She's a lady after all.

566
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,850
She's staying at the guest house alone.

567
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:19,111
Do you think it's appropriate?

568
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,590
Dr. Xia is a doctor.

569
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:23,341
She knows how to take care of herself.

570
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,560
Why are you doing this to her?

571
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:26,231
You're used to staying with her.

572
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,800
-Lieutenant Tian.
-Yes!

573
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:33,170
I think our platoon
is lacking vigor lately.

574
00:31:34,318 --> 00:31:35,198
Is it?

575
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,160
I was receiving training elsewhere.

576
00:31:39,112 --> 00:31:40,449
As the vice captain,

577
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,320
aren't you supposed to lead by example...

578
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,837
and make sure everyone in the platoon...

579
00:31:44,878 --> 00:31:46,610
including yourself
to be disciplined in physical training?

580
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,051
Look at your
physical fitness test results.

581
00:31:48,092 --> 00:31:49,072
What happened to you?

582
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
However, the overall performance
of our platoon has improved.

583
00:31:52,189 --> 00:31:54,600
Xiao Teng won the second runner-up
in 800m obstacle race.

584
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:55,731
-Is that good enough?
-No.

585
00:31:55,772 --> 00:31:57,312
-Is that good enough?
-No!

586
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,930
From tomorrow onward,
train yourself to death.

587
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:02,961
Make sure you get number one
in the next assessment.

588
00:32:03,002 --> 00:32:04,362
-Do you hear me?
-Yes!

589
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,789
Leave.

590
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,055

00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,460
He's showing off.

613
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,870
So?

614
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,950
Have you gotten any the idea
for the coming shoot?

615
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,800
Let me know if you have any ideas.

616
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,860
Boss, why don't we film
about internet entrepreneurship?

617
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:04,488
How about acting agencies?

618
00:34:04,892 --> 00:34:06,142
Why don't we go for food column?

619
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:10,927
Mi Gu!

620
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,619
Are you okay?

621
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,118
What do you think?

622
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,349
I didn't mean it.

623
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,900
Something went wrong with your guest.

624
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:21,691
Not only did you not solve the issue,

625
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,369
you dozed off during the meeting.

626
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,710
Do you still want the job?

627
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:26,589
Boss.

628
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,490
I've completed the new proposal.

629
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,000
Please take a look.

630
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,849
Filming a doctor's daily life?

631
00:34:41,808 --> 00:34:43,308
Filming a doctor's daily life...

632
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:45,729
to present the doctor-patient relationship
which is a public concern.

633
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,490
We can also make the show stands out...

634
00:34:47,531 --> 00:34:48,860
by including all kinds
of eye catching rare diseases.

635
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:49,935
At the same time, we can instil...

636
00:34:49,976 --> 00:34:52,110
the correct values on health and death
in the public.

637
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:55,069
Not only is it evergreen,
it's also interesting to watch.

638
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,777
More importantly,
I have a good subject to feature.

639
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,250
What do you think?

640
00:34:58,605 --> 00:34:59,915
Do you think it's doable?

641
00:35:02,627 --> 00:35:03,507
Yes.

642
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,030
Lad.

643
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:08,290
Your mom is exhausted
from taking care of you.

644
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:10,037
Now that you're discharged,

645
00:35:10,078 --> 00:35:11,691
you must listen to your mom.

646
00:35:11,732 --> 00:35:12,619
Got it?

647
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,540
Yes.

648
00:35:14,066 --> 00:35:14,986
All right, Dr. Zhang.

649
00:35:15,027 --> 00:35:16,247
You don't have to send us off.

650
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,170
Send me a message
after you've reached home.

651
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,572
Sure.

652
00:35:19,613 --> 00:35:21,233
Xiao Jun, say goodbye to Dr. Zhang.

653
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,840
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

654
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:24,518
Let's go.

655
00:35:32,525 --> 00:35:35,705
Dr. Zhang, you're indeed not picky at all.

656
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,380
My patient is discharged today.

657
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,050
Am I not allowed to send him off?

658
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,880
Why didn't you come that weekend?

659
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:46,995
You went there?

660
00:35:47,036 --> 00:35:47,997
Of course.

661
00:35:48,038 --> 00:35:49,508
I waited for you for the whole night.

662
00:35:50,326 --> 00:35:51,666
No way.

663
00:35:51,707 --> 00:35:53,367
I'm serious. Why would I lie?

664
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,040
I know you well.

665
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,440
Li Juan.

666
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,569
You...

667
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,820
You're anything but stubborn.

668
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,489
Even if you waited at the pub
for the whole night,

669
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,540
you're not just waiting for me, right?

670
00:36:06,741 --> 00:36:07,669
We had a date.

671
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,560
Who else would I wait for
if it weren't for you?

672
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,490
Are you crazy?

673
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,960
Are you free tonight? Let's go together.

674
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,470
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:25,107 --> 00:36:26,487
I already have a date.

676
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,979
Sure, can't wait to eat it.

677
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,110
See you tonight.

678
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,490
See?

679
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,740
I have everything in the world.

680
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,010
I took care of the surveillance system.

681
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,722
I'm ready.

682
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:40,796
Do you really want to do that?

683
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:04,774
("The Tokyo Zodiac Murders"
by Soji Shimada)

684
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,740
Listen.

685
00:39:11,353 --> 00:39:12,983
I have a bad hunch.

686
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:14,760
You'd better be fast.

687
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:28,960
Are you done?

688
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:51,389
Can you hear me?

689
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,013
Will you answer me?

690
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:58,375
Can you hear me, Zhuo Ran?

691
00:39:58,416 --> 00:39:59,994
Can you hear me?

692
00:40:00,035 --> 00:40:01,960
Can you hear me?

693
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,550
Are you Xia Chu's pet?

694
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,010
What is your name?

695
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,040
Don't touch me.

696
00:40:42,468 --> 00:40:44,008
I didn't know that you had a cat.

697
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:16,993
Can you hear me? Yang Mu Ze is back.

698
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:18,409
Zhuo Ran, can you hear me?
Liang Mu Ze...

699
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,670
Liang Mu Ze is back!

700
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,920
Can you hear me? Liang Mu Ze is back!

701
00:43:19,689 --> 00:43:21,227
-What's wrong?
-Help!

702
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:22,847
A bad guy wanted to hurt me.

703
00:43:22,887 --> 00:43:24,787
A bad guy is after me!

704
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,550
Are you missing your owner?

705
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,160
She'll be back soon.

706
00:43:31,298 --> 00:43:33,288
That's enough. Go watch the door.

707
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:34,601
I don't care if she's coming back soon.

708
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:37,061
I want you to take me away from here.

709
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,810
Can we rewind to the earlier time?

710
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:29,001
Usually it works that way.

711
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,161
However, something is wrong
with the surveillance system.

712
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,861
There is no video signal.

713
00:44:33,677 --> 00:44:34,678
No signal?

714
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:36,370
Yes.
We just got it repaired.

715
00:44:36,411 --> 00:44:38,041
Hence,
the earlier recording is not available.

716
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:39,011
Sorry about that.
