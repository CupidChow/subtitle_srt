=Episode 31=

3
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:44,576
Just let me go in.

4
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,266
I'm Liang Mu Ze's sister.

5
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,210
Sorry. We have a rule here.
No visitors are allowed these few days.

6
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,770
Liang Mu Ze is really my brother!

7
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,496
Don't you have a phone there?

8
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,930
Just call him.

9
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,130
Xiao Teng!

10
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:05,650
Xiang Yang!

11
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,786
Where are they going?
Is there a mission?

12
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,650
Could you say something, brother?

13
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,730
Hi, the number you have dialed
is not reachable.

14
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,250
Xue.

15
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,290
I'm here to see Tian Yong.

16
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,586
I know.

17
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,690
Where is he?

18
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,130
Xue, take this parrot home.

19
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,866
I'm busy recently,
I don't have time to look after it.

20
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,610
Who told you to do so?

21
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,890
Our OK will be looked
after by Tian Yong, right?

22
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,986
He left our team.

23
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,906
Who?

24
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,870
Tian Yong.

25
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,660
Where did he go?

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,786
No idea.

27
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,176
But Xiao Teng and Xiang Yang
were inside those cars which passed by.

28
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,280
He wasn't in the vehicle.

29
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,986
Where is he?

30
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,090
I don't know.

31
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,440
Did something happen to him?

32
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,480
No.

33
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,640
Where should I find him?

34
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,130
Xue,

35
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,420
right now,

36
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,450
some people stay,

37
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,040
some have been transferred,

38
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,010
some have left the unit.

39
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,570
As to where Tian Yong has gone to,
I really have no idea.

40
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,530
Bring it home.

41
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,090
I gave this parrot
to Tian Yong to look after it.

42
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,890
If he wants to return it to me,
ask him to see me.

43
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,330
It won't be so fast.

44
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,770
They have to ask the boss
behind the scene.

45
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,930
Here.

46
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,450
How do you feel
about your new identity?

47
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,770
It feels like living another life.

48
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,930
I don't know where the destination is,

49
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,610
nor do I know how to get there.

50
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,570
I'm scared.

51
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,250
Scared that you won't get the hang of it?

52
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,130
I'm scared there's no going back.

53
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,770
They took the bait.

54
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,330
They'll meet us
at the cruise ship nightclub tonight.

55
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:16,586
According to the information we got,

56
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,666
Scary Pirate will enter our country
through secret channels.

57
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,320
They might be there too.

58
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,610
The cruise is divided into three levels
with six exits.

59
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:25,010
Our men will disguise as tourists
and stand guard at different spots.

60
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,490
The action team
is on standby on nearby ships,

61
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:29,299
and is responsible
of tracking and assisting.

62
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,330
Tian Yong.

63
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,130
Sir,

64
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,050
follow that car.

65
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,250
Sorry, the number you have dialed
is not reachable.

66
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,330
Sir, please speed up,
follow that car in front of us.

67
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,746
I'll try my best.

68
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,130
The price of that car
is equal to two of my car.

69
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,730
A car seems to be following us.

70
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,370
It might be them.

71
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,000
Just ignore it.

72
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,387
My friend is there.
Let me get in.

73
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:23,502
Friends are not allowed either.

74
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,212
You need a ticket to enter.
Please get a ticket.

75
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,490
They've boarded the cruise.

76
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,620
Jiu, we meet again.

77
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,190
Come. Please.

78
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,890
I told you,
I'd come to see you again.

79
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,576
By the way, let me introduce
my associate to you.

80
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,540
He's Jiu.

81
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,080
Jiu.

82
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,990
Take a seat.

83
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,070
-Where's the owner?
-Hang on.

84
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,650
Jiu,

85
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,500
I keep thinking
that you are very familiar.

86
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,810
I just came out from the police station,
309 Xingfu Road.

87
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,040
What's wrong?

88
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,670
Were you there too?

89
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,210
No.

90
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,260
I know.

91
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,410
He's here.

92
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,850
He's in the private room.
Let's go down.

93
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,770
Please forgive us,
rumours have been flying about recently.

94
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,850
It is better if we're more mindful.

95
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,610
Jiu, please.

96
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,970
Rao Zhi, they're coming down.

97
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,930
I finally found you.

98
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,880
I finally found you.

99
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,370
You got the wrong person.

100
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,540
Do you know her?

101
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,670
Attention to all units,
there is an unexpected situation.

102
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,530
Maybe I met her in some club.

103
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,820
Is that so?

104
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,330
Not bad, Hai.

105
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,306
I know you.

106
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,610
It was you!

107
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,560
Qiang, find a way to take Rao Zhi's
daughter away from there.

108
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,130
Tian Yong, make her leave!

109
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,616
It was you, wasn't it?

110
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,456
I've been searching for you for so long!

111
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,916
You're a jerk!

112
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,340
I know you!

113
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,880
Jerk!

114
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,530
It might hurt a little.

115
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,460
I'm here to see Tian Yong.

116
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,670
Where is he?

117
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,020
He left our team.

118
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,050
Where did he go?

119
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,056
No idea.

120
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,676
Did something happen to him?

121
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,730
As to where Tian Yong has gone to,
I really have no idea.

122
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,720
I have a gift for you.

123
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,010
What is it?

124
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,260
I made you another bulletproof vest.

125
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,420
Promise me,

126
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,440
put it on whenever you go out, all right?

127
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,490
Jiu,

128
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,330
what is this?

129
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,630
How dare you carry a gun
when you're making a deal with me?

130
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,250
What do you want?

131
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,930
Jiu,

132
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,160
I'm doing this for our safety.

133
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,520
Hai, call off the deal.

134
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,200
Take care of it yourself.

135
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,640
Jiu, I'm really sorry.

136
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,330
We've come to the final step.

137
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,770
Let's go.

138
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,250
Jiu, I'm sorry.

139
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,330
Okay, I got it.

140
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,610
I'll see to it immediately.

141
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,346
Go to the hospital now and support
the doctor for emergency rescue.

142
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,066
Report the progress to me at all times.

143
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,030
Yes.

144
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,020
Xia Chu, meeting in the conference room.

145
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:55,456
Patient Liang Shao Xue was injured
and fell into the sea.

146
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,080
The police rescued her.

147
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,636
She's being sent here.

148
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,596
According to the instructions
of the superior,

149
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,906
all medical staff involved
in this rescue...

150
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,426
must sign an individual
non-disclosure agreement.

151
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,210
Then, please sign your name.

152
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,090
Don't worry, just leave it to us.

153
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,660
(Rescue Room)

154
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,520
Old Master.

155
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,250
Got it.

156
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,320
When is he coming?

157
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,390
The owner won't be here today.

158
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,870
By tomorrow afternoon,

159
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,180
transfer the payment
to the owner's overseas account.

160
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,890
Once he gets the money,
your stock will be shipped right away.

161
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,130
What will happen after that?

162
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,040
If this deal goes well,

163
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,410
you will meet the owner very soon.

164
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,390
Tell him.

165
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,400
Stop fooling us around...

166
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,150
or you will not be able
to leave Ningjiang City.

167
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,026
They left.

168
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,180
Follow them closely.

169

-Uncle Rao.

185
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,810
Xue is still under treatment.

Chief,

187
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,356
Xue's stuff is at the nurse's station.

188
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,860
Please collect them.

189
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,030
Okay, I'll take care of it.

190
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,330
Doctor, how is the patient?

191
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,640
Has the patient
had any external impact before?

192
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,356
Luckily there's no fatal injury.

193
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,430
We gave her a closed chest drainage,

194
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,310
and the Trauma Center also relocated
and fixed her injured ribs.

195
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,050
Her condition is more stable now.

196
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,336
We'll let her take anti-inflammatory drugs
and observe her condition.

197
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,040
If she can recover,
she doesn't need to undergo surgery.

198
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,576
Can I go in and see her?

199
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,210
Please wait, we'll transfer her
into Intensive Care Unit first.

200
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,630
Thank you.

201
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,000
She's still in coma.

202
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,170
Yes. Judging from her condition,
she's no longer in danger.

203
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,090
Rao Zhi has arrived just now.

204
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,190
Yes.

205
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,720
Yes.

206
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,510
Thank you, sir.

207
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,760
She was shot, wasn't she?

208
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,460
Luckily the vest saved her.

209
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,160
It was an accident.

210
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,710
If it was just an accident, you wouldn't
have asked all the medical staff,

211
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,750
to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

212
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,370
Since you've signed the agreement,

213
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,880
just lay this matter to rest.

214
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,730
Don't tell anyone.

215
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,730
I know.

216
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,140
I'm a doctor,

217
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,680
and also a soldier.

218
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,890
I have the courage
to bear the whole truth.

219
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,470
I trust you.

220
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,530

However, Liang Mu Ze,

224
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,690
promise me.

225
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,840
Don't make me
perform emergency rescue on you,

226
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,690
okay?

227
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,920
I promise you.

228
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,430
It definitely won't happen.

229
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,170
Will you stay here to take care of Xue?

230
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,000
I'll leave after her mother gets here.

231
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,680
Before redeployment,

232
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,940
how many more times can we meet?

233
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,210
I don't know.

234
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,390
I have to go back to work.

235
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:06,865
Observe the patient's ECG monitor
at all times.

236
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,836
If the alarm goes off,
inform the doctor immediately.

237
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,876
Got it. Thank you, doctor.

238
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,840
You're welcome.

239
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,486
Miss Bai, pay attention
to the patient's temperature.

240
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,676
If it exceeds 39 degrees Celsius,
inform me right away.

241
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,910
Dr. Xia.

242
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,406
The drip is finished,
but there are rashes on her hands.

243
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,030
There's no chest tightness.
What should we do now?

244
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,446
Inject 5mg of Dexamethasone.

245
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,686
-Pay close attention.
-Okay.

246
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,856
If you feel unwell,
tell me immediately.

247
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,920
I will.

248
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,963
Dr. Xia, I have a question.

249
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,466
When can my father get admitted?

250
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,460
Calm down.

251
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,903
A doctor from the respiratory department
will be here for consultation in a while.

252
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:41,906
Alright, thank you, doctor.

253
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,870
Xia Chu.

254
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,080
Director Song.

255
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,060
Xia Chu, Director Chen of Cardiac
Surgery asked you to report to him.

256
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,366
Do I go there now?

257
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,440
Go on.

258
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,160
Thank you, Director Song.

259
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:13,960
Dr. Xia.

260
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,280
Dr. Zhang,

261
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,770
what's the matter?

262
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,296
Allow me to introduce to you, Dr. Xia.

263
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,540
Nice to meet you, Dr. Xia.

264
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,140
Nice to meet you.

265
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,690
What is going on?

266
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,196
Didn't the pregnant woman
who had a haemorrhage pass away?

267
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,986
None of the babies' family
came to pick them up.

268
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,876
Then, the welfare home just
notified two adoptive families.

269
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,500
They're here to pick up the babies.

270
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,086
They learned that you're the doctor
of the babies,

271
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,356
so they insisted to thank you
for saving their lives before leaving.

272
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,666
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Dr. Xia.

273
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,666
You're welcome.

274
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,810
This is my duty as a doctor.

275
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,690
Have the children passed
all the evaluations?

276
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,210
Yes, they have.

277
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,726
Although this twins
look exactly the same,

278
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,350
their personalities are very different.

279
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,200
One of them cries a lot,
another one is quiet.

280
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,470
Do both of you live near each other?

281
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,880
We'll migrate very soon.

282
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,730
It's about time.
Let's pick up the babies.

283
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,466
We'll get going now.

284
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,250
Sure, take care.

285
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,236
Although this twins
look exactly the same,

286
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,940
their personalities are very different.

287
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,860
One of them cries a lot,
another one is quiet.

288
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,551
When I was sorting out the old videotapes
in the data room today,

289
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,970
I noticed that the son of a drug dealer
looked exactly like Zhuo Ran.

290
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,020
Based on your current condition,

291
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,906
I can conclude
that your light-headedness,

292
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,896
and chest pain are caused
by stress cardiomyopathy.

293
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,440
Stress cardiomyopathy?

294
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,883
You have always been very healthy.

295
00:27:41,968 --> 00:27:43,506
You even planned
to join the military academy.

296
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,410
Why would you have
stress cardiomyopathy?

297
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,550
Xia Chu,

298
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,666
you're living under the same roof
with this kind of man.

299
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,630
Aren't you scared?

300
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,700
How did you know?

301
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,540
What?

302
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,620
I have never told you
that I'm staying in Liang Mu Ze's house.

303
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,170
How did you know that?

304
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,356
It was Mi Gu.

305
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,580
She told me everything.

306
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,730
The test result of that medicine came out.

307
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,760
I know.

308
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,650
It was
a 3D printed traditional Chinese medicine.

309
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,576
-Did Zhang Yi Chi tell you that?
-No, it was Zhuo Ran.

310
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,800
Zhuo Ran told you that?

311
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,170
He asked his assistant
to get the pills for him,

312
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,586
but his assistant made a mistake.

313
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,010
Let me show you something.

314
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,060
This...

315
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,940
I realized my pills had been swapped,

316
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,606
so I took it for a test.

317
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,960
That's normal, right?

318
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,220
Dr. Zhang, something is wrong
with the pills you gave me.

319
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,566
Our initial investigation suggests
that the death of the deceased,

320
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,506
could be accomplished by himself.

321
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,970
This is a plastic gun.

322
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,640
It's 3D printed.

323
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,780
Hey, girl.

324
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,210
Mi Gu,

325
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,850
regarding the videotape
you mentioned last time,

326
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,480
do you still have it?

327
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,720
Yes.

328
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,020
Could you take a picture of the son
of the drug dealer for me?

329
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,226
I just want to take a look.

330
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,410
Hang on, I'll search for it.

331
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,730
Sure.

332
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,050
Why do you need it all of a sudden?

333
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,570
I'm just curious.

334
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,610
They do look similar.

335
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,970
I'd buy it if you told me they were twins.

336
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,920
Did you ask Zhuo Ran?

337
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,850
About what?

338
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,650
Whether he has a twin brother?

339
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,840
How is that possible?

340
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,790
He's the only child.

341
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,430
Did you find it, Mi Gu?

342
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,080
It's gone.

343
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,720
It's really gone.

344
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,540
Could you have gotten the wrong person?

345
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,490
It's possible.

346
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,320
Say something, Rao Feng.

347
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,210
Can you...

348
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,610
Can you come back?

349
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,590
What's up?

350
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,210
It's about Xiao Xue.

351
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,720
Xiao Xue? What happened to her?

352
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,370
She's injured.

353
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,540
You might need to take care of her.

354
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,910
Okay, I'll buy the ticket now.

355
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,580
Sorry, I...

356
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,430
Uncle Rao,

357
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,490
did you collect Xue's stuff?

358
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,960
Yes.

359
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:05,206
By the way, Mu Ze, your aunt
bought the earliest flight ticket today.

360
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,710
She'll fly from Los Angeles to Beijing.

361
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,130
She should be here at noon tomorrow.

362
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,920
As for the exact schedule,
she didn't tell me.

363
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,646
Sure, I'll contact her.

364
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,610
Thank you.

365
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,810
Uncle Rao.

366
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,650
Don't worry, Mu Ze.

367
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,170
I'm fine.

368
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,960
How is she doing?

369
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,520
Do you know what this is?

370
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,380
Dyneema bulletproof vest.

371
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,340
The bullet did not penetrate it.

372
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,700
The bullet did not penetrate it.

373
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,886
I gave it for her.

374
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,240
You knew her?

375
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,210
Why are you so sure that she'd wear this?

376
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,130
When I pushed her away,

377
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:29,820
she gave me a hint.

378
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,520
Besides, I told her that she must...

379
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,130
always put this on.

380
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,130
Were you so sure
that it'd block your bullet?

381
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,540
I deal with them all the time.

382
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,650
Bulletproof vests and bullets,

383
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,450
spears and shields.

384
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,580
What if you missed?

385
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,960
I have never missed.

386
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:22,976
I'm sorry, Rao Zhi.

387
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,159
Don't apologize.

388
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,489
What you did today was not wrong.

389
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,679
The only problem is...

390
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,010
she's my daughter.

391
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,540
I understand.

392
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,870
Go take a rest.

393
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,740
When did you find out
that he wouldn't come?

394
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,950
When I received that phone call,

395
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,740
I learned about it
the same time you did.

396
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,760
Haven't you heard of anything before that?

397
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,026
If I wanted to deceive you,

398
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,536
I wouldn't have agreed
to meet you at this time.

399
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,880
Do you think you can run away?

400
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,100
Why did he bail on us?

401
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,620
He has doubts.

402
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,270
Even if he has only one percent doubt,
he still won't meet you.

403
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,380
Has he entered the country?

404
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,450
No.

405
00:35:34,893 --> 00:35:38,753
What channel will you guys use
to process the money you got yesterday?

406
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,120
You mean "they".

407
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:48,380
Antique auctions, illegal insurance,
online gambling and finance,

408
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,730
anything that you can think of.

409
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,300
Make an appointment for me to meet him.

410
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,570
When are you going to save my mother?

411
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,996
Are you trying to bargain with me?

412
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,850
Give me an exact time.

413
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,190
We have no rights to enforce law overseas.

414
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,356
We can only request the support
of Interpol and local police.

415
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,036
-When?
-We're contacting them.

416
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,290
Tell me when!

417
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,126
Once we get solid proof,
they will take action.

418
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,280
But my mother can't wait any more!

419
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,600
Then you'd better behave yourself.

420
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,240
Give us full cooperation.

421
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,930
Wait for my update.

422
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,900
Don't worry about it, chief.

423
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,940
I must attend Ke Wei's funeral.

424
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,380
I'm almost there.

425
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,740
See you later.

426
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,980
Demon!

427
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,590
Who's there?

428
00:37:16,043 --> 00:37:17,103
Who's there?

429
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,420
Who's over there?

430
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,440
Show yourself!

431
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,530
Director Mi!

432
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,410
Director Mi!

433
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,980
Director Mi!

434
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,326
Demon!

435
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,470
Demon!

436
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,916
I'll kill you!

437
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,076
I'll kill you!

438
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,140
Go to hell!

439
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,376
Give me back my husband!

440
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,420
Give me back my husband!

441
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,010
Give me back my husband!

442
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,196
I'll kill you!

443
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,340
I'll kill you!

444
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,770
Help!

445
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,680
Help!

446
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,786
-Help!
-I'll kill you!

447
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,460
Kill you! Kill you!

448
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:24,790
Go to hell!

449
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,430
Director Mi!

450
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,550
Help!

451
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,736
Help!

452
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,060
I'll kill you!

453
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,070
Go to hell!

454
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,996
Stop!

455
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,926
She's up there!

456
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,000
Hurry, hurry up!

457
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,010
Hurry up!

458
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,170
Go to hell, demon!

459
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,930
Stop it!

460
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,746
-Pull them apart!
-Let me go!

461
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,856
Ms. Mi.

462
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,490
Ms. Mi, are you all right?

463
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,340
Take her away!

464
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,860
Director Mi.

465
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,330
Ms. Mi, drink some tea.

466
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,330
She's quite pitiful.

467
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,770
Eight years ago,
she married into our village.

468
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,430
Few days after the wedding,

469
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,716
something bad happened in our village.

470
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,926
What's wrong with you?

471
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,760
Director Mi finally came here.

472
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,120
Your illness hadn't relapsed for so long.
Why today?

473
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:18,090
The entire family of her husband died.
She's the only one alive.

474
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,580
She survived,
but something's wrong with her brain.

475
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,460
Even her own family won't take her in.

476
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,690
Eight years ago?

477
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,346
By something bad,

478
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,336
do you mean
the military and police joint drug bust?

479
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,300
Yes.

480
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:41,010
She was shocked by the gunshot
and lost her mind.

481
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,480
All these years, she still can't move on.

482
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,170
Whenever she sees anyone or anything
related to the drug bust,

483
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,550
her illness will relapse.

484
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,690
Anyway, it's strange.
You have nothing to do with it at all.

485
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,140
Why would her illness relapse
as soon as she saw you?

486
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,576
Wan, everything is fine now.
You can leave now.

487
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,560
Sure, sure.

488
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,180
It's over now. Don't be scared.

489
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,700
It wasn't me.

490
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,920
It wasn't me.

491
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,390
I really didn't mean it.

492
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,100
I didn't mean it.

493
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,670
It was that jinx.

494
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,450
It was that jinx.

495
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,270
He dragged my husband into that.

496
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,830
He said it was just one puff,

497
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,170
but it tore our family apart.

498
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,150
I told him
not to go to that stupid factory any more,

499
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,680
but he wouldn't listen.

500
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,090
He wanted to go,
and dragged my in-laws with him.

501
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,730
He said he'd earn all the money
he spent on drugs.

502
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,170
It was that jinx.

503
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,020
That jinx brought disaster upon us.

504
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,570
He brought disaster upon us.

505
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,340
The jinx is...

506
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,186
It was the man
who ran the drug factory in our village,

507
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,440
Pei Yong Yan.

508
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,556
He's a demon.

509
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,950
He's a sinner!

510
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,146
I won't let him off.

511
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,540
I won't let him off!

512
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,860
Calm down.

513
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,656
Demon!

514
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,746
You're a demon!

515
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,106
Why did you come back here?

516
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,210
Our village is miserable because of you!

517
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,930
Does Pei Yong Yan have a child?

518
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,810
Yes.

519
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,996
How does he look like?

520
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,956
Well...

521
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,510
I don't know how to describe him.

522
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,600
Is that him?

523
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,630
He looks like him.

524
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,790
Is that him?

525
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,010
He looks like him,

526
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,596
but it can't be.

527
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,706
This is impossible.

528
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,810
Why not?

529
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,410
Did you notice that nameless tomb?

530
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,570
Pei Yu and his father are buried in there.

531
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,580
They're dead?

532
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,700
Yes.

533
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,510
After the drug bust,

534
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,100
it was our previous chief
who took care of their bodies.

535
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,960
There's no one else in the Pei family.

536
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,590
We dared not set up any tomb for them.

537
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,860
Judging from the timeline,
if he's still alive,

538
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,420
he should be about this age and look.

539
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,666
Jinx!

540
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,626
Calm down!

541
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,226
Jinx! That's him!

542
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,450
Calm down, don't be agitated!

543
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,986
That jinx is back.

544
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,466
We'll all die!

545
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,416
Calm down! Don't run!

546
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,336
-Don't run!
-The jinx is back!

547
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,560
Don't run!

548
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,240
The jinx is back!

549
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,880
Director Mi,

550
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,096
you hardly come here.

551
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,480
I'm sorry to upset you like this.

552
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,650
Does Pei Yu have a brother?

553
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,910
Not that I know of.

554
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,340
What about his mother?

555
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,090
I only know his mother
is from another city.

556
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,120
She met Pei Yu's father
when they were working in the south.

557
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,650
After they had the child,
they broke up.

558
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,976
Pei Yong Yan brought his son here alone.

559
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,910
In this village,
no one has ever seen his wife.

560
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,560
Director Mi,

561
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,090
you are really interested
in his family affairs.

562
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,580
Is this for your show?

563
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,430
No,

564
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,310
I was just asking.

565
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,770
That's all I know.

566
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,880
It's too bad
that our previous chief is gone.

567
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,490
After that drug bust,

568
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,320
many of them left.

569
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,130
It will be difficult to find out more.

570
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,500
It's getting late,
I should go back now.

571
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,540
Director Mi,

572
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,600
drive slowly!

573
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,290
Xia Chu,

574
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,510
I just encountered something
really strange.

575
00:44:18,976 --> 00:44:19,887
Tell the patient's family,

576
00:44:19,972 --> 00:44:21,960
he shouldn't drink water for eight hours
before the surgery.

577
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,416
If there's no other question,

578
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,416
ask his family
to sign the informed consent.

579
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,550
Alright, Dr. Xia.

580
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,429
Xia Chu, it's time to eat.
Let's go and eat.

581
00:44:36,514 --> 00:44:38,806
-Come on.
-I'm not hungry. You should go ahead.

582
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:39,776
I have something to do.

583
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,066
Then we'll leave now.

584
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,250
Go ahead.

585
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,240
Xia Chu,

586
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,376
I just encountered
something really strange.

587
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,180
It could be really serious
or maybe I'm overthinking it.

588
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:03,930
But I think I should let you know.

589
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,510
Forget it.

590
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,340
I'll talk to you when you're free.

591
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,520
Xiao Chu.

592
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,286
Why didn't you finish
what you were saying?

593
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:33,380
What is it about?

594
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,420
It is about...

595
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,020
Zhuo Ran,

596
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,680
do you love me?

597
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,020
It slipped my mind.

598
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:51,670
It slipped your mind?

599
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,430
Are you okay?

600
00:45:58,129 --> 00:45:59,369
Are you all right, Mi Gu?

601
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,640
I'm fine.

602
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:05,880
I have something to say.

603
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,360
What is it?

604
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:09,520
I...

605
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,420
Liang Mu Ze and I
are officially dating now.

606
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,890
I know this might catch you off guard,
my dad hasn't approved of us yet.

607
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,880
But I just have to...

608
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,610
I get it.

609
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,920
Both of us have chosen a hard way.

610
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,890
But hard doesn't mean it's wrong.

611
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:34,650
Maybe it's because everyone
is afraid of it.

612
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,450
And we just happen...

613
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,250
to be the minority who have guts.

614
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,940
It's green light.

615
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,750
Then you drive first. We'll talk later.

616
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,470
-Sure.
-See you.

617
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:51,720
Bye.

618
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,490
Pei Yu?

619
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,480
Zhuo Ran?

620
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,090
How is that possible?

621
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,280
Mi Gu, something must be wrong with you.
