1
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,770
=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 35=

3
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,335
So, we're going to
enter the exercise ground.

4
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:21,826
We're just to bring someone back.

5
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:24,214
If you're scared,
you can go home to your mum.

6
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:25,520
Of course not.

7
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:26,962
Come on.

8
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,246
Did you find anything?

9
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:32,864
Shrapnel.

10
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:40,277
Here's the minefield...

11
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:43,340
where China and X Nation
went through war ten years ago.

12
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,304
After this,
we will walk past the Chinese border.

13
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:47,839
Then, we'll reach the drill site.

14
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,955
Be careful.

15
00:04:51,217 --> 00:04:52,303
Let's go.

16
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:02,817
Just place it there.

17
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:04,643
Be careful.

18
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:08,189
These medicines
are for wounds and dysentery.

19
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:10,366
The soldiers stay outdoors
most of the time.

20
00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:12,667
Please handle it with care.

21
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:14,648
Dong.

22
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:16,056
You can't do that.

23
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:17,793
You have to take a break now.

24
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:19,793
My soldiers are not back yet.

25
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:21,648
-Dong!
-Brigade Commander!

26
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:23,252
Inform the control room now.

27
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:24,810
Hurry up, inform them.

28
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,934
The Brigade Commander is not feeling well.

29
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:27,221
He can't conduct the drill anymore.

30
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:28,625
No one is allowed to contact him.

31
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:29,910
I'm okay.

32
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:31,359
Dong!

33
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,097
Brigade Commander!

34
00:05:35,177 --> 00:05:36,272
-What's wrong?
-Dong!

35
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:37,374
What's wrong?

36
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:38,618
-Dong!
-Brigade Commander!

37
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:40,579
Stay away, don't surround
the Brigade Commander.

38
00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:57,457
-Do you have a torchlight?
-I have it.

39
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,407
Brigade Commander, open your mouth.

40
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:07,874
The Brigade Commander
is having an allergy.

41
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:13,451
What did the Brigade Commander eat?

42
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:15,482
Or did he get bitten by anything?

43
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:16,551
Bitten?

44
00:06:19,014 --> 00:06:20,334
Now I remember.

45
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:21,811
He was bitten by a bug before.

46
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:26,416
What happened?

47
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:28,039
He's having chest tightness,
dizziness, breathing difficulty,

48
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:29,217
and allergy symptoms.

49
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:31,072
I suspect he's suffering from anaphylaxis
after being bitten by bugs.

50
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:33,308
He's also having laryngeal edema.
Get ready for emergency treatment.

51
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:34,436
Sure.

52
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:35,595
Let's go.

53
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:36,898
Hurry up.

54
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:38,026
-Bring the safe here.
-Yes.

55
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,165
Put him down.

56
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:42,513
Contingency Plan No. 1 is activated.

57
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:45,772
I'll contact the control room
to report the unexpected situation.

58
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:49,278
The head of staff will take over
the Blue Team for the moment.

59
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:50,393
Yes!

60
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:02,859
Don't let me die in this minefield.

61
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:05,021
I swear if we make it out of here,

62
00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:07,415
then I'm going to kill everyone
on the field.

63
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:10,221
We're here to kidnap a person.

64
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:11,716
There are so many people in China.

65
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:13,083
How are you going to kill them all?

66
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:14,746
There are so many of them.

67
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:16,184
So you can miss.

68
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:32,543
Chief. An explosion took place
at the minefield near the border.

69
00:07:32,623 --> 00:07:34,982
Send some people there
to find out what had happened.

70
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:50,077
Brigade Commander.

71
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:51,266
How do you feel?

72
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:53,510
I'm feeling so much better.

73
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:56,678
Xia Chu, I'm all right.

74
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:00,985
-Head of staff.
-I'm here.

75
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:02,234
Where are our people?

76
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:03,608
Liang Mu Ze...

77
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:04,988
They're already at the base.

78
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,973
There's some emergencies.

79
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:09,218
What happened?

80
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:11,454
Brigade Commander, take a rest.

81
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:12,639
Brigade Commander, please lie down.

82
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:14,025
-Brigade Commander.
-Please calm down.

83
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:15,132
Brigade Commander.

84
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,704
That won't do.
The blood pressure is too low.

85
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:22,793
Brigade Commander
is not in an ideal condition.

86
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:25,862
It'd be better to send him to the nearest
hospital for further treatment.

87
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:27,242
-Get the car ready.
-Yes.

88
00:08:27,614 --> 00:08:28,912
No, I don't want to go.

89
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:30,082
-I don't want to go!
-Brigade Commander.

90
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:31,794
This is an order from the
Political Commissar!

91
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:34,104
-Brigade Commander!
-Please calm down, Brigade Commander!

92
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:35,097
Take a rest.

93
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:37,115
-This is an order!
-I'm not going.

94
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:39,585
Brigade Commander.

95
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:43,041
Captain.

96
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:46,163
We've completely put down
Red Team's trump card.

97
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:48,662
It's safe to say that
we make Brigade Commander proud, right?

98
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:50,973
We'll make him treat us to a meal.

99
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:52,316
Make him get each of us a wife too.

100
00:08:52,396 --> 00:08:54,630
Yes, get a wife!

101
00:08:55,021 --> 00:08:56,074
Captain!

102
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:57,623
We just received orders
from the command centre.

103
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,530
We're instructed to
head towards border number six now.

104
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,707
Border number six?

105
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:02,106
Why do we have to go there again?

106
00:09:02,186 --> 00:09:03,540
We just came back from there.

107
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,127
That place is full of Red Team members.

108
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:06,109
It's okay.

109
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:08,586
Let me report to Brigade Commander
about the situation in the past two days.

110
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,694
Captain. It's quite urgent.

111
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:12,881
An explosion took place at the border.
The command centre has ruled out...

112
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,991
the possibility of accidental bombing
during the drill.

113
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,991
Therefore,
you guys need to check on the situation...

114
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:19,129
and see if it's caused by
the participating soldiers.

115
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:20,323
Besides that,

116
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:22,629
something went wrong
with Brigade Commander Dong's health.

117
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,976
He's been sent to the district hospital
for emergency treatment.

118
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:26,301
We'll check on Dong later.

119
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:27,766
-Xiao Teng!
-Yes.

120
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:30,297
Gear up for battle
and gather here in five minutes.

121
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:31,440
Yes!

122
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:35,893
As the exercise ground is too close
to the border,

123
00:09:35,973 --> 00:09:39,037
the commander in chief worries that
if any soldiers lost their way...

124
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:40,857
or crossed the border
to another country by mistake...

125
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:43,758
it'll likely bring negative impact
to our country and the military.

126
00:09:43,838 --> 00:09:45,307
Therefore, we're instructed
to gear up for combat...

127
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:46,918
and check out the border.

128
00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:51,013
Pay attention, everyone.

129
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:52,365
This is the real deal.

130
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:04,543
500-metre high ground up ahead.

131
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:05,721
Split up and observe the area.

132
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,291
Report to me once you
detect any drill soldiers.

133
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:08,437
Yes.

134
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,613
Platoon leader.

135
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:18,112
We're next to the border.

136
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:21,478
I guess the noise came from here.

137
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:25,299
It could be some wild animals...

138
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:27,623
stepping on landmines
left over from the war era.

139
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,420
Don't go near that area.

140
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,140
We should head north along the border.

141
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,517
The Blue Team's territory
is about three kilometres away.

142
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:36,278
That time,
we'll catch Blue Team by surprise.

143
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:48,073
Hold on, man.

144
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:50,444
Everyone, come here!

145
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:58,869
I have a way to keep you alive.

146
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,099
Okay?

147
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,217
Help!

148
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,299
Help!

149
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,845
Hello, 001.

150
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:11,402
I'm 011.

151
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:13,059
Please respond.

152
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,129
You two, come with me.

153
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,183
The rest of you,
stay here and be vigilant.

154
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,310
Let's go.

155
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,551
Are you okay?

156
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,506
Don't fire the gun!

157
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:40,468
We're not on a drill.
We're on a mission.

158
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:46,425
What was the noise?

159
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,301
Where is your leader?

160
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:52,368
He's at the minefield.

161
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:53,975
It seems that someone got injured.

162
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:56,176
Our platoon leader
went there with two other soldiers.

163
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:58,552
Contact the command centre.
You two come with me.

164
00:11:58,632 --> 00:12:00,289
The rest of you stay here
and wait for further instructions.

165
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:01,486
Yes!

166
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:37,410
Go get a car.

167
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,188
We need to go there.

168
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:41,683
Follow the clues
and we'll find the doctor.

169
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:42,866
Let's go.

170
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:28,101
Continue the drill.

171
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,669
We won't expose your whereabouts.

172
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:33,507
When I'm back to the camp, I'll report
to the superiors about your situation.

173
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:35,797
Saving a foreigner
is sort of a big deal.

174
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,892
That person sneaked into the border
without any reason.

175
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:41,520
However, he's lucky.

176
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,903
If you didn't reach there in time,
he would have died from bleeding.

177
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:47,818
He put on the tourniquet on his own.

178
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:50,056
The tourniquet was already there
when we found him.

179
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:54,824
Does the command centre know that
the injured person is a foreigner?

180
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:55,836
Yes.

181
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:58,075
The command centre has informed
the Public Security Bureau.

182
00:13:58,155 --> 00:14:00,032
The head of the PSB instructed us
to send him to the hospital.

183
00:14:00,112 --> 00:14:01,889
Interrogation will start
after he has received treatment.

184
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:03,030
Let's go back to the base.

185
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:22,146
Can I hitch a ride?

186
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:23,331
Sure.

187
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:26,941
Get into the car!

188
00:14:45,637 --> 00:14:47,216
He was alone when we found him.
He's a foreigner.

189
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:48,734
As we're having a drill,
the Chief commanded us...

190
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:49,995
to send him to the local hospital.

191
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:51,634
-Do you know his situation?
-What?

192
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:52,875
How did he injure himself?

193
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:54,927
He stepped on the landmine at the border.
It's about 45 minutes ago.

194
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:56,881
He used a bandage to stop the bleeding.

195
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:59,022
The drill has just started
but many accidents have taken place.

196
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:00,708
It's normal to have accidents
during the drill.

197
00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:01,966
This way.

198
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,366
What happened to him?

199
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:10,190
He's bitten by bugs
which leads to anaphylaxis.

200
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,169
His blood pressure is low.
He needs further treatment.

201
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:13,322
Okay.

202
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:24,322
Captain and I
will go to the district hospital.

203
00:15:24,402 --> 00:15:26,457
Bring the rest back to the camp.
Clean up the equipment and take a break.

204
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:27,777
Got it.

205
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:30,063
If anyone asks about us,

206
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,312
tell them
we're reporting to the Brigade Commander.

207
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,445
Yes.

208
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:45,532
Brigade Commander Dong.

209
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,645
Rest well.

210
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,966
Leave the military exercise to the
Head of Staff and the Political Commissar.

211
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:52,425
Don't worry too much.

212
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:54,674
Rest well and have a speedy recovery.

213
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,721
Xia Chu, thank you.

214
00:15:56,801 --> 00:15:58,136
You're welcome.

215
00:15:58,216 --> 00:16:00,518
Please take care of
Brigade Commander Dong.

216
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:02,749
I'll get going then.

217
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,272
Okay, you may get back to work.

218
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:20,053
(She's heading back to the site.)

219
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:23,053
(They've left. On the way back
to the drill site.)

220
00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:26,063
Monitor!

221
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:38,348
What are
the Emergency Response Units we have?

222
00:17:38,428 --> 00:17:40,772
We have a troop
to ensure the safety of the site,

223
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,837
a border brigade
and a Special Forces Brigade.

224
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,032
Besides that,

225
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:46,007
about ten members of
Commandos Team Thunder...

226
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:47,866
which is Blue Team in the drill
are also with us.

227
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:49,666
The team is led by the captain,
Liang Mu Ze.

228
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:53,097
Tell the Emergency Response Units
to be ready.

229
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:54,581
The medical team and Liang Mu Ze...

230
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:56,660
will go to the scene of the accident
with Commandos Team Thunder.

231
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,555
Contact the local police.

232
00:17:58,635 --> 00:18:00,393
Find out the culprit and the vehicle.

233
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:01,517
Yes!

234
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:23,736

235
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:27,423

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,234
Tian Yong.

238
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:35,654
Get up.

00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:47,858

Are you okay?

255
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:25,743
I'm okay.

256
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:27,560
Xia Chu was abducted.

257
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,676
They were in a yellow truck.

258
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:31,209
Each of them was holding a weapon.

259
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:32,312
Where did they go?

260
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:33,797
They headed towards the town.

261
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:36,489
Koala, pass me the locator.

262
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:45,745
Are they heading towards the border?

263
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:48,114
They're going to the beach.
I think they're going to the open sea.

264
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:50,505
Inform the command centre
and request for helicopters.

265
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:51,558
Yes!

266

269
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:19,505
I pledge...

to be loyal to the authority
of the Constitution,

271
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,334
to serve the people with integrity,

00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:27,991

00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:33,219

00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,181

to master the military skills,

00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,476

to defend the Motherland to the death...

00:21:43,411 --> 00:21:45,621
Never betray the military.

280
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:49,327
Defend the Motherland to the death.

281
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:53,715
Never betray the military.

282

Salute!

283
00:22:08,496 --> 00:22:11,613
Never betray the military.

284
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,036
Defend the Motherland to the death.

285
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:21,737
Never...

286
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:25,611
betray...

287
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:31,716
the military.

288
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:13,585
What do you want to say?

289
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,297
What?

290
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,596
When all hares are killed,

291
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:39,940
the hounds will be stewed and eaten.

292
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:15,183
You...

293
00:24:16,785 --> 00:24:18,111
Who are you?

294
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:28,581
Who am I?

295
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,773
Don't you know Zhuo Ran?

296
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:38,756
Both of you attended classes together,
went home together after school,

297
00:24:38,836 --> 00:24:41,494
wandered around on bicycle,
and read detective novels.

298
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:43,818
Have you forgotten?

299
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:47,471
No.

300
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:49,937
You're not him.

301
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:52,593
He won't treat me like this.

302
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,226
Who are you?

303
00:24:58,014 --> 00:25:00,243
You gave up on him first!

304
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:01,819
You chose Liang Mu Ze.

305
00:25:02,374 --> 00:25:04,170
Zhuo Ran was so kind to you.

306
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,739
You're his dream.

307
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:09,017
However, you betrayed him
for a person who murdered him!

308
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:10,725
You deserve to die.

309
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:12,825
Easy.

310
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:14,509
Let me tell you.

311
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:18,323
You people owe him
everything that's happened today!

312
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:30,421
We don't have time for this.

313
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:31,908
We have to withdraw immediately.

314
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,093
Our boss is waiting for us
in the open sea.

315
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:41,805
Let's go.

316
00:25:48,343 --> 00:25:49,438
No problem.

317
00:25:49,518 --> 00:25:50,619
You have my permission.

318
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:53,925
Tell Liang Mu Ze to spare no expense.

319
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:57,522
Rescue the hostage
before they flee to the open sea!

320
00:26:44,487 --> 00:26:45,929
Attention!

321
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:48,550
This is the People's Liberation
Army of China.

322
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,449
Stop the boat now for inspection.

323
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:52,591
Reporting to the control room.

324
00:26:52,671 --> 00:26:54,644
Two speedboats are heading towards
an isolated island at region number five.

325
00:26:54,724 --> 00:26:56,850
They might enter the deserted resort
on the island.

326
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,029
We're seeking permission
to go on the island.

327
00:26:58,109 --> 00:26:59,229
Got it.

328
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,893
Inform Team Thunder
to be careful on the island.

329
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:09,432
Inform the public security bureau
to provide assistance.

330
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:10,656
Follow up now.

331
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:11,723
Yes!

332
00:28:00,006 --> 00:28:02,536
We should be leaving here
as soon as possible.

333
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:07,292
Without evidence, the Chinese police
won't act rashly.

334
00:28:07,372 --> 00:28:08,639
Do you want to bet?

335
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:30,248
Just give me a little more time
to finish with this deal.

336
00:28:35,726 --> 00:28:38,154
We have a lot of pressure
from the Chinese.

337
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:39,995
They're asking us to hand
over their people.

338
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:41,624
I need an answer to everything.

339
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:43,994
Now, I can't wait any longer.

340
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:46,679
Answer what?

341
00:28:47,274 --> 00:28:49,204
They destroyed our goods,

342
00:28:49,284 --> 00:28:52,784
ruined my business
and dared to make trouble in my place.

343
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:56,877
If they really want to play like this,
I'll play with them.

344
00:28:56,957 --> 00:28:58,405
You're an outsider here.

345
00:28:59,057 --> 00:29:00,273
You're a guest.

346
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:03,969
Next month,

347
00:29:04,337 --> 00:29:07,004
Ba Ye will stand for re-election.

348
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:11,564
In the event that the Chinese Police
is involved and getting international,

349
00:29:11,644 --> 00:29:13,490
who would protect you?

350
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,574
Old Master.

351
00:29:25,707 --> 00:29:26,847
Tian Yong escaped.

352
00:29:35,126 --> 00:29:36,243
Old Master!

353
00:29:37,582 --> 00:29:40,329
We've checked the CCTV recording.
Tian Yong didn't leave the mansion.

354
00:29:43,412 --> 00:29:44,586
Go to the study room.

355
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:02,045
Master.

356
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:03,554
Master.

357
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:04,792
Please.

358
00:30:05,606 --> 00:30:07,328
Please give me some.

359
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:08,604
Please.

360
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:10,986
Let me have a sip.

361
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:12,383
Go away!

362
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:38,620
Look at me.

363
00:30:43,492 --> 00:30:45,391
How could I forget that...

364
00:30:50,664 --> 00:30:53,189
he serves no purpose anymore?

365
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:42,840
Come on!

366
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:37,056
This is the Chinese People's
Liberation Army.

367
00:33:37,136 --> 00:33:38,624
You've been surrounded.

368
00:33:38,704 --> 00:33:40,348
Surrender now!

369
00:33:46,562 --> 00:33:47,448
Let's go.

370
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:49,594
I'll cover you. Go to the rooftop.

371
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:51,042
-Meeting point.
-Okay.

372
00:33:51,122 --> 00:33:54,040
-Move. Come on!
-Come on!

373
00:34:00,592 --> 00:34:02,297
We're not going to surrender.

374
00:34:02,377 --> 00:34:04,426
Backup is on the way.

375
00:34:04,506 --> 00:34:06,348
You'll never catch us.

376
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:40,061
Come on!

377
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:44,232
I'm on the meeting place, the rooftop.

378
00:37:44,312 --> 00:37:46,615
We need to hurry to get me out of here.

379
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,498
Don't move! Put the gun down!

380
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:52,567
Stay away or I'll kill her!

381
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,308
I said, put the gun down.

382
00:37:58,388 --> 00:37:59,690
I'll shoot you!

383
00:38:00,148 --> 00:38:01,879
Put your gun down!

384
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:03,084
Come on!

385
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:05,001
Don't move!

386
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:07,719
Stay away!

387
00:38:16,286 --> 00:38:17,745
Go!

388
00:38:19,953 --> 00:38:21,493
Come on!

389
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:33,520
Xia Chu.

390
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,522
Liang Mu Ze.

391
00:39:37,896 --> 00:39:39,062
Xia Chu.

392
00:39:39,142 --> 00:39:40,579
Hang in there. I'm coming.

393
00:39:41,508 --> 00:39:44,001
Liang Mu Ze.

394
00:39:44,732 --> 00:39:45,953
Liang Mu Ze.

395
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:47,231
Hang in there.

396
00:39:51,744 --> 00:39:54,496
Liang Mu Ze, I can't take it anymore.

397
00:39:54,982 --> 00:39:57,423
Don't be scared. Hang in there.

398
00:39:57,503 --> 00:40:00,144
I'll count to three
and I'll come to you.

399
00:40:00,646 --> 00:40:04,038
One, two, three!

400
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:25,949
You're safe.

401
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:58,433
Don't be scared.

402
00:41:00,615 --> 00:41:01,596
Xia Chu.

403
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:02,906
We need to get up.

404
00:41:02,986 --> 00:41:04,045
Okay?

405
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:05,618
Hold me tightly.

406
00:41:05,698 --> 00:41:07,218
Hold me tightly and get up.

407
00:41:21,234 --> 00:41:23,507
The steel wire is going to break.
Hold me tightly.

408
00:41:23,587 --> 00:41:24,856
Let's jump to the other side.

409
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:27,200
Liang Mu Ze.

410
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,125
I can't do it.

411
00:41:30,205 --> 00:41:31,344
You can do it.

412
00:41:31,712 --> 00:41:32,839
Trust me.

413
00:41:33,176 --> 00:41:35,300
-I can't do it.
-We don't have the time.

414
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:37,624
Do you trust me?

415
00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:42,302
I'll catch you.

416
00:41:42,382 --> 00:41:44,306

Please take a look.

445
00:43:22,616 --> 00:43:24,342
This is the entrance to Liang Village.

446
00:43:24,422 --> 00:43:25,868
It's recorded by CCTV.

447
00:43:30,486 --> 00:43:31,653
Pei Yu?

448
00:44:00,526 --> 00:44:01,614
Is it okay?

449
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:18,004
Xia Chu.

450
00:45:18,704 --> 00:45:19,742
It's me.

451
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:22,645
You're so beautiful.

452
00:45:29,344 --> 00:45:30,513
Really?

453
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,360
I'm not as pretty as your tutor.

454
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:35,480
You're prettier than her.

455
00:45:36,248 --> 00:45:39,709
Who is prettier,
me or the nurse in Isaia?

456
00:45:40,193 --> 00:45:41,586
You're the prettiest.

457
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:43,196
You're pretty.

458
00:45:43,276 --> 00:45:46,495
Of all the beauty in the world,
you're the 99 percent.

459
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:50,489
The remaining ladies
share the remaining one percent.

460
00:45:50,569 --> 00:45:52,544
Can you imagine how pretty you are?

461
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:57,581
Liang Mu Ze.

462
00:45:58,378 --> 00:45:59,883
How did you find me?

463
00:46:01,686 --> 00:46:02,805
Take a guess.

464
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,958
In general, men who speak rhetorically
are experienced in love.

465
00:46:10,038 --> 00:46:12,454
To be honest,
how many girlfriends did you have?

466
00:46:13,528 --> 00:46:15,321
Where did you hear that theory?

467
00:46:15,401 --> 00:46:16,860
Please answer my question.

468
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,714
Have you ever cooked spare rib soup?

469
00:46:24,216 --> 00:46:25,391
Let me tell you.

470
00:46:26,087 --> 00:46:27,577
Spare rib soup...

471
00:46:28,944 --> 00:46:31,868
has to be boiled on high heat first.

472
00:46:32,808 --> 00:46:35,758
Then, cook it on low heat.

473
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:38,301
It'll take a few hours.

474
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:40,233
The longer it's cooked,
the better the taste.

475
00:46:40,313 --> 00:46:42,804
You'll meet many people on the journey.

476
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:49,024
When a huge pot of soup
boils down to a small bowl,

477
00:46:51,526 --> 00:46:54,296
the colour, the taste,

478
00:46:54,376 --> 00:46:57,428
and the nutrition value of the soup
are at their richest.

479
00:46:59,555 --> 00:47:01,719
That bowl of soup is only for one person.

480
00:47:02,204 --> 00:47:04,288
It's for you, Xia Chu.

481
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:06,592
Got it?

482
00:47:07,937 --> 00:47:10,032
I'm that bowl of soup.

483
00:47:12,827 --> 00:47:14,572
Just drink the soup.

484
00:47:15,097 --> 00:47:17,354
Don't ask about the cooking process.

485
00:47:21,929 --> 00:47:23,004
Captain Liang.

486
00:47:23,084 --> 00:47:26,457
Why didn't I realise you're so good
at saying cheesy pick up lines?

487
00:47:26,807 --> 00:47:28,897
Who is the bewitcher between us?

488
00:47:30,217 --> 00:47:32,394
It makes no difference.

489
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:35,147
No matter what, it's between us.

490
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,488
Listen.

491
00:47:38,853 --> 00:47:40,361
Ever since...

492
00:47:41,497 --> 00:47:44,154
I fell asleep beside you defencelessly,

493
00:47:44,607 --> 00:47:46,192
I knew that I'm doomed.

494
00:47:48,142 --> 00:47:49,391
I'm doomed.

495
00:47:49,471 --> 00:47:52,280
I, Liang Mu Ze,
will always belong to Xia Chu.
