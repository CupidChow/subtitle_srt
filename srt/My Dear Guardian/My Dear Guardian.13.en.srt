1
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,770
=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,550
She has her own reason.

4
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:39,960
The medicine she replaced...

5
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:42,381
did not cause major harm
to the person who took it.

6
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,439
It is not poisonous,

7
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,501
but it's not completely safe either.

8
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:50,300
The most important thing
is there's an overdose of adjuvant,

9
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:52,209
called Aristolochia.

10
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,861
Long-term use of this medicine
will increase the risk of liver cancer.

11
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:58,471
The inside of the tablet is porous,

12
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,080
it dissolves easily in water...

13
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,655
and is convenient
for patients to swallow.

14
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:03,796
This is the characteristic
of a medicine produced by 3D printing.

15
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:06,331
Medicine produced by 3D printing?

16
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:10,232
In 12th grade,

17
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:12,350
there was a transfer student
in our school.

18
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:13,920
He was sitting beside me.

19
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:15,520
One day,

20
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:17,300
he disappeared from our school.

21
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:20,091
I couldn't find him anywhere.

22
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:22,080
All I could do...

23
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:24,300
was reading all the detective novels
he gave to me.

24
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,111
I even hoped that one day,

25
00:02:28,152 --> 00:02:31,701
I'd see his name
on the cover of a detective novel,

26
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:34,440
Zhuo Ran.

27
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,027
He's neither a writer nor a soldier now,

28
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:40,463
but running a 3D printing company.

29
00:02:40,504 --> 00:02:41,600
He's a boss now.

30
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:50,381
Is this man from your hospital?

31
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:51,347
No.

32
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:53,651
Their company set up a foundation...

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,351
called Public Interest Research Fund
in our hospital.

34
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:57,520
That day,

35
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:59,341
Xia Chu's friend wanted to interview me.

36
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:00,664
So she filmed some stuff.

37
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:02,195
I didn't know
that she'd use all the contents.

38
00:03:03,673 --> 00:03:05,403
Xia Chu's friend?

39
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:06,781
Mi Gu?

40
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:07,981
Yes.

41
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:36,034
We have an answer
regarding the medicine swap.

42
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,440
There's a problem with the medicine,

43
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:39,821
but it is not fatal
in a short period of time.

44
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,780
So right now,

45
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,721
we can't determine
the nature of this matter.

46
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:46,581
I need you
to investigate someone for me.

47
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:48,331
Is it related to the medicine swap?

48
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:49,252
Yes.

49
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:51,240
Okay.

50
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:52,911
Send me his basic information.

51
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:53,832
Okay.

52
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:06,600
Brigade Commander, this is the summary
report of the previous anti-flood rescue,

53
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:07,861
please have a look.

54
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:09,320
Leave it here.

55
00:04:10,648 --> 00:04:12,840
This is an urgent task
the superior has just assigned.

56
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,171
Security at a medical conference?

57
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:21,101
Isn't the Public Security Bureau
in charge of security?

58
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:23,181
This is a special case.

59
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:25,270
It's related to the international
terrorist organization, T4...

60
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:27,861
which you and Tian Yong
met in Isaia.

61
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:32,221
Attention!

62
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,240
Commandos Team Thunder is ordered
by the superior...

63
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:37,901
to send elite personnel
to the hotel to facilitate their security.

64
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:40,476
Liang Mu Ze will be the captain.

65
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:06,920
With the anti-terrorism experience we have
over the years,

66
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:11,720
we will assist the police's deployment
by supplying technology and workforce,

67
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:14,221
to ensure the safety of the guests.

68
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,071
If you find
any suspicious situation or person,

69
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:22,061
you can take action before reporting.

70
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,880
I'm Liang Mu Ze,
captain of Commandos Team Thunder,

71
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:27,200
Code name, Whale.

72
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,322
I'm in charge...

73
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,512
of the command and operations
in this operation.

74
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:34,864
Lieutenant of Thunder, Tian Yong
will assist the police...

75
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:36,230
in monitoring the vehicles

76
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:38,280
entering and exiting
the hotel and parking areas.

77
00:05:40,626 --> 00:05:42,936
Our team members, Xiao Teng
and Xiang Yang...

78
00:05:42,977 --> 00:05:48,180
will work with the security personnel
and watch the people in the hotel.

79
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:54,487
All teams of Thunder 99
will stay at their current positions.

80
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:56,415
Two people will take lunch break
at a time.

81
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,676
Take turns
and eat in the in-house restaurant.

82
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:53,181
Mu Ze,

83
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,420
I've sent someone
to check with the front desk.

84
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:59,400
This man has booked a long-term stay
in a suite in this hotel.

85
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:00,760
Every week,

86
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:02,400
he'd stay here for three to four nights.

87
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:08,895
Is this the man you asked me
to investigate?

88
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:10,079
Yes.

89
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,180
What a coincidence.

90
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:14,360
He's also here today.

91
00:07:15,646 --> 00:07:17,120
If you're concerned about him,

92
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,621
we can go on the intranet
and look for his information again.

93
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:21,840
Okay.

94
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:50,861
Zhuo Ran, where are you?

95
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:52,480
I'm at the door of the hotel,

96
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:53,686
I'll go through the security check
in a while.

97
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,080
Wait for me at the lobby.

98
00:07:55,763 --> 00:07:56,654
Sure.

99
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:04,994
Let's start.

100
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:26,681
Wen.

101
00:08:27,602 --> 00:08:29,175
Qin, film the cars first.

102
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:31,190
Go to the banquet hall
and secure a good position for us.

103
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,301
Alright, got it.

104
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:36,920
Zhuo Ran!

105
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,200
You will be the press too for today,

106
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:44,381
but just an intern.

107
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:45,760
I'll be learning from you.

108
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:55,880
Fox here,

109
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:59,640
target met someone
and got a press pass.

110
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:01,720
Copy that.

111
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:06,887
In the database,

112
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:08,887
there is not much information
about Zhuo Ran.

113
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:10,560
From what we found,

114
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:14,011
he appears to be
an average Vitalik businessman.

115
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,959
He studied industrial design in Germany.

116
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,898
After he graduated,

117
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:19,169
he started his own 3D printing company.

118
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:21,760
The headquarters
is also based in Vitalik.

119
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,000
Recently, he's expanded his business
in Chinese mainland.

120
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:28,200
Why would he need a press pass
for a summit meeting?

121
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,529
Judging from this,

122
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,620
he sure has some motive.

123
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,497
However,

124
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:37,280
he might share the same motive
with all the other businessmen,

125
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:41,429
that is to take this opportunity
to get more insights and information.

126
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,877
At the same time,

127
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:45,480
expanding his network and social circle.

128
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:56,080
What's wrong?

129
00:09:56,384 --> 00:09:57,494
Xiao Xue has landed.

130
00:09:57,535 --> 00:09:59,195
Don't worry. I've got it covered.

131
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,680
Okay.

132
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:22,006
Dad.

133
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:23,351
Cheeky girl,

134
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:24,932
why is it so noisy over there?

135
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:26,399
I'm at the airport.

136
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,950
I'm picking someone up for my friend.

137
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:29,331
You're at the airport?

138
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:31,440
I've just left the airport.

139
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,061
Was it Ningjiang Airport?

140
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:36,440
Yes,
I came to Ningjiang for a business trip.

141
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:40,480
Do you have time
to have dinner with me?

142
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:42,449
I'm afraid I can't.

143
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,080
I have to be on duty today.

144
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:45,718
On duty again?

145
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,509
Staying up late is bad for your health.

146
00:10:47,944 --> 00:10:49,438
I'm fine. Don't worry.

147
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,480
How long will you be here?

148
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:51,929
Over a week.

149
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,880
I'm here for a conference...

150
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:54,960
and giving speeches
at several partner universities.

151
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,000
So I'm not in a hurry.

152
00:10:57,165 --> 00:11:01,600
Perhaps I could make time
and visit you in the hospital.

153
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:02,880
Sure.

154
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:04,936
Dad, I need to hang up.

155
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:06,360
The person I'm picking up
should come out anytime soon.

156
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:07,415
See you.

157
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:08,386
Alright.

158
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,409
Don't always stay up late,
and drink more water.

159
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:13,280
Got it. Bye-bye.

160
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,080
Cheeky girl.

161
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:16,560
She's even busier than I am.

162
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,146
(Liang Shao Xue)

163
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:39,550
Liang Mu Ze,

164
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:41,080
has Liang Shao Xue contacted you?

165
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:44,275
(Liang Shao Xue)

166
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,566
Is this Liang Shao Xue?

167
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:52,760
Where are you?

168
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:57,000
What?

169
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:58,983
You know what?

170
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:00,910
I came in to clean this cubicle,

171
00:12:00,951 --> 00:12:03,320
but who knows
she's sleeping on the toilet seat.

172
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,160
She didn't even close the door.

173
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,320
She never reacted.

174
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:07,551
If you hadn't called,

175
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,240
I would've called the police.

176
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:11,731
Thank you.

177
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:14,040
However,

178
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,310
now I'm not sure...

179
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:19,240
if she's the person
I'm supposed to pick up.

180
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:21,181
Aren't you picking up Liang Shao Xue?

181
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:22,640
Yeah.

182
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,600
She is Liang Shao Xue. Look.

183
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:40,011
This is unbelievable.

184
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,335
She's had work done, hasn't she?

185
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,640
Why are you staring at me?
What are you doing here?

186
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:09,200
Where is my cellphone?

187
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:13,560
It's here. Give me.

188
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:16,145
Thank you.

189
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:31,880
Are you Xia Chu?

190
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:37,046
What took you so long?
I've waited forever.

191
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,082
I'm the one who waited forever.

192
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:43,160
You fell asleep on the toilet seat.

193
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:44,081
Really?

194
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:47,680
Fine. I forgive you.

195
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,040
Hang on.

196
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:56,181
Are you really Liang Shao Xue?

197
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:59,040
Otherwise,
who would want to be this unlucky girl?

198
00:13:59,697 --> 00:14:00,800
Don't get me wrong.

199
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:02,640
I just think...

200
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,829
that you look different from the photo.

201
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,997
I'm afraid I might pick up
the wrong person,

202
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:08,600
so I need to confirm.

203
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:10,751
Don't worry, you're not wrong.

204
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:12,120
People grow up.

205
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:14,480
You don't look like the fertilized egg
you used to be now.

206
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:20,743
That's me.

207
00:14:20,784 --> 00:14:22,554
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

208
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:31,120
-Have a pleasant trip.
-Sure.

209
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,508
Hi, I'm Liang Shao Xue.

210
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:38,365
It's the one
that Dr. Letney asked me to adopt.

211
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:41,781
Its quarantine should have ended today,
right?

212
00:14:42,603 --> 00:14:44,040
I have arrived in Ningjiang.

213
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:45,280
I can pick it up now.

214
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:49,623
What?

215
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,075
It's lost?

216
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:53,738
How could you lose such a big parrot?

217
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,839
Are you not
a professional pet care agency?

218
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:57,400
When did this happen?

219
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:01,071
Did you look for it?

220
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:03,040
Send more people to look for it!

221
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,360
Where is it now?

222
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:07,708
Hold on! Your luggage!

223
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:09,080
You guys are unreliable!

224
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:13,085
Your luggage!

225
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:17,440
Come back! Where are you going?

226
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,040
Come back!

227
00:15:21,698 --> 00:15:23,040
Your luggage!

228
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,542
(Liang Shao Xue)

229
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:35,661
The number you have dialled
is not available.

230
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:40,467
(Braised Egg)

231
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:50,673
(Mr. Zhang)

232
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:52,821
Mr. Zhang.

233
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,960
Okay, I'll be right there.

234
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:01,920
Liang Shao Xue has left.

235
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,461
There's definitely
something wrong with her.

236
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:05,172
But I'm out of my mind as well.

237
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:06,710
I was on a night shift
and I haven't even slept a wink.

238
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:08,063
But I came to the airport
to pick up your sister.

239
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:09,960
Now I have to go back to the hospital.

240
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:11,360
Clean up the mess yourself.

241
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,920
Are you okay?

242
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:13,166
Okay, okay.

243
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,200
Call the police.

244
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,680
Okay, okay.

245
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:19,602
Okay, I'm fine.

246
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:21,680
Okay? I'm asking you to call the police.

247
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,701
My phone is dead,
and you should make the call.

248
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:30,272
It's okay. Don't call the police
because it was nothing.

249
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:31,280
Just go, Miss. Go.

250
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:32,920
No way! My car is rented.

251
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:34,400
I must file a report with the police.

252
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,511
No.
What are you doing?

253
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:42,002
I told you to call the police!

254
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:46,288
No, Miss.

255
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:47,559
You hit me,

256
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,066
so you should take full responsibility.

257
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:50,271
Why should I call the police?

258
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:51,520
I know I should take full responsibility,

259
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:53,560
but you still need to call the police.

260
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:55,461
This is the rule, do you know that?

261
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:03,777
Mr. Policeman!

262
00:18:05,656 --> 00:18:06,680
Where is he?

263
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:11,480
Jerk, stop the car!

264
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:54,861
Attention to all units.

265
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,317
Five minutes later,

266
00:18:57,361 --> 00:18:58,920
the cars will reach the hotel entrance.

267
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:00,880
After they get here,

268
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,520
all the guests will get off the car
one by one for photographs.

269
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:04,831
It takes about three minutes.

270
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,680
I'm ready.

271
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:25,574
Why don't you go up first?

272
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:27,040
It's fine.

273
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:27,961
I'll wait for you.

274
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,320
Professor Xia is here.

275
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:02,720
You should know
that he's the father of Xia Chu, right?

276
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:03,640
I know.

277
00:20:08,352 --> 00:20:09,340
He has entered the hall.

278
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:11,160
Play it by ear.

279
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:27,743
WIT120 is a new technology.

280
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:32,511
In this era,

281
00:20:32,552 --> 00:20:34,182
this is a product which we were expecting.

282
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:47,336
Fox here,

283
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:50,197
the target
is staring at one of the guests.

284
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:52,465
Calling Fox.

285
00:20:52,506 --> 00:20:53,879
Before the guest enters the halls,

286
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,100
follow the main target closely.

287
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:56,440
Roger.

288
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:59,410
Send the photo of target number one
to Koala.

289
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:00,992
Calling Koala,

290
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:02,733
receive the photo of target number one.

291
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Keep a close watch on him.

292
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:05,000
Copy that.

293
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:13,601
That's him.

294
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:33,279
That's a VIP lane.

295
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,570
The press lane is over here.

296
00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:36,880
Let's go, then.

297
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:12,901
Yes.
I'm at the door of the hotel now.

298
00:22:13,521 --> 00:22:15,181
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

299
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,959
Back off. You can't enter without a pass.

300
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:39,920
What's going on?

301
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:41,280
What is she doing here?

302
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:00,000
Gopher, Gopher.

303
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:02,909
Bring me the girl in the parking lot
to the command room.

304
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:03,960
Copy that.

305
00:23:39,704 --> 00:23:40,584
Don't move!

306
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:57,621
Right now,

307
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:02,387
an unprecedented profound change
is taking place in this world.

308
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,151
I am a professor at a university,

309
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:06,320
at the same time,

310
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,781
I am also...

311
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,800
a researcher
who performs scientific research.

312
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:12,240
I know...

313
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:14,880
I am responsible
for meeting new challenges

314
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:19,312
and encouraging mankind
to take the next giant leap.

315
00:24:19,353 --> 00:24:20,800
In the next two days,

316
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:24,880
we will carry out a multi-disciplinary
and effective conference...

317
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,927
which covers medical and health,
education and finance,

318
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,360
and also other fields.

319
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:33,513
I believe
that the discussion between experts...

320
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:37,320
will give us a broader vision
and a clearer understanding...

321
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:42,280
of the development pattern
of the entire world.

322
00:25:13,321 --> 00:25:14,581
Stand right there!

323
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:47,001
Are you alright?

324
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:48,880
-Watch her.
-Yes!

325
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:53,110
Go over there to stop him!

326
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:02,640
He's so cool.

327
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:37,357
Freeze!

328
00:26:39,274 --> 00:26:40,200
Calling, calling.

329
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,291
Found a gunman in parking lot B2.

330
00:26:42,552 --> 00:26:43,760
A lone armed man.

331
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:44,901
We have him under control.

332
00:26:46,031 --> 00:26:47,261
SWAT Team 1,

333
00:26:47,302 --> 00:26:49,172
assist the team
in the basement parking lot.

334
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:52,320
SWAT Team 2 and Team 3
outside the hotel,

335
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,171
go inside the hotel
and wait for my order.

336
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:55,760
All the other units,

337
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:57,621
block all passages including
the basement,

338
00:26:57,662 --> 00:27:00,032
ensure the safety of the conference.

339
00:27:00,207 --> 00:27:01,680
Attention to Team Thunder,

340
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:02,861
this is a Code Red situation.

341
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:04,421
Koala, keep an eye on the conference.

342
00:27:04,462 --> 00:27:05,960
Fox, watch target number one closely.

343
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:10,280
I hereby propose...

344
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:12,011
for a toast together,

345
00:27:12,282 --> 00:27:14,640
for the success of the summit,

346
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:17,978
and also the well-being
of you and your family.

347
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:20,720
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

348
00:27:24,114 --> 00:27:25,960
Professor Xia is quite a visionary.

349
00:27:27,683 --> 00:27:29,680
Are you still interested
in attending such forums in the future?

350
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:31,640
Sure. Thank you.

351
00:28:10,326 --> 00:28:11,480
Gopher, please answer.

352
00:28:12,495 --> 00:28:14,160
Gopher, Gopher, answer if you hear me.

353
00:28:48,595 --> 00:28:51,745
Professor Xia, regarding the
progress of new tranquillizers...

354
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:53,717
Sorry, Professor Xia needs some rest.

355
00:28:53,758 --> 00:28:54,680
Sorry, sorry.

356
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:55,601
Please make room.

357
00:28:57,271 --> 00:28:58,192
Professor Xia.

358
00:28:58,233 --> 00:28:59,800
Congratulations. Here's to you.

359
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,369
Thank you.

360
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:24,600
Professor, Mi Gu,

361
00:30:25,354 --> 00:30:27,854
she's Xia Chu's best friend.

362
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,200
She'd like to interview you.

363
00:30:30,241 --> 00:30:31,671
-Do you have time?
-Sure, sure.

364
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:32,882
-I'll call her over here.
-Okay.

365
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:34,271
Mi Gu.

366
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:36,840
-I'll go over there.
-Okay.

367
00:30:39,577 --> 00:30:40,520
Uncle Xia, nice to meet you.

368
00:30:40,561 --> 00:30:41,840
I am Mi Gu.

369
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:42,840
Nice to meet you.

370
00:30:51,746 --> 00:30:52,960
Fox's here.

371
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:56,680
I suspect target number one
is hiding something in his pocket.

372
00:31:11,146 --> 00:31:12,566
Calling Whale.

373
00:31:13,052 --> 00:31:14,320
We've tied down the target.

374
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:16,440
Preliminary assessment suggests...

375
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:20,000
a drug deal.

376
00:31:20,718 --> 00:31:21,807
Copy that.

377
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:25,542
As for the girl,

378
00:31:26,115 --> 00:31:27,200
we've got her under control.

379
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:30,120
I'll take her to you
after she comes round.

380
00:31:32,087 --> 00:31:33,160
Copy that.

381
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:34,920
Thank you.

382
00:31:37,425 --> 00:31:38,405
Xiao Xue is fine.

383
00:31:40,337 --> 00:31:42,654
Gopher, the driver committed suicide
by taking poison.

384
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:43,760
I'll be right there.

385
00:31:44,056 --> 00:31:45,080
Watch him.

386
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:00,541
Gopher's here.

387
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,925
The driver committed suicide
by taking poison.

388
00:32:03,711 --> 00:32:05,600
Rescue him immediately.

389
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:07,120
I won't let him die so easily.

390
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,120
Should we terminate the conference
and evacuate the crowd?

391
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:13,520
As I see it,

392
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:15,911
the drug dealer wanted
to slip through the cracks...

393
00:32:15,952 --> 00:32:17,102
and sneak in under our nose.

394
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:19,148
Don't terminate the conference first.

395
00:32:28,562 --> 00:32:30,062
Xia Chu always talked about you.

396
00:32:30,506 --> 00:32:31,686
Thank you for taking care of her.

397
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:33,827
No, we're just helping each other out.

398
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:35,141
I appreciate it.

399
00:32:35,617 --> 00:32:36,524
Uncle Xia,

400
00:32:36,565 --> 00:32:39,188
I would like to conduct an exclusive
interview with you on this forum.

401
00:32:39,229 --> 00:32:40,359
Is it convenient for you?

402
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:41,640
No problem.

403
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,501
It's noisy in here, isn't it?

404
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,370
Let's talk over there.

405
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:50,480
Wen.

406
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,560
That cheeky girl,

407
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,240
I can hardly see her these days.

408
00:33:04,531 --> 00:33:05,760
Xia Chu got her good qualities from...

409
00:33:06,871 --> 00:33:07,720
Why?

410
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:09,061
Why do you never talk to me?

411
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:16,360
Go to hell!

412
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:18,441
Professor Xia!

413
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:21,124
You toy boy!

414
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,600
Put down the knife!

415
00:33:31,882 --> 00:33:32,880
Li Lei, Li Lei,

416
00:33:33,618 --> 00:33:35,076
there's an attack on the corridor

417
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:36,774
outside the banquet hall,

418
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:37,840
bring some men and check on it.

419
00:33:38,496 --> 00:33:39,476
Copy that, Rao Zhi.

420
00:33:54,977 --> 00:33:56,047
Something is wrong with this man.

421
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:57,120
I'll go check on him.

422
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:11,129
Are you okay?

423
00:34:11,512 --> 00:34:12,520
Professor, easy.

424
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:15,940
Uncle Xia.

425
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:18,876
I'll kill all of you!

426
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:20,000
What's going on over there?

427
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,160
The target has escaped. Execute Plan B.

428
00:34:26,201 --> 00:34:27,120
Got it.

429
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:30,441
I'm just a waiter,

430
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:31,870
you can't sue me!

431
00:34:32,591 --> 00:34:33,800
Who are you?

432
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:36,200
You can't sue me!

433
00:34:40,017 --> 00:34:41,400
Ren hasn't texted me yet,

434
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:42,680
the deal has probably failed.

435
00:34:43,201 --> 00:34:44,581
Drive the car to the meeting point,

436
00:34:44,622 --> 00:34:45,640
I'm coming down.

437
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:06,905
Hi,

438
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:07,826
please hold on.

439
00:37:26,017 --> 00:37:27,720
There's a sniper.

440
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:29,288
Inside a high-rise building
on the west side of the hotel,

441
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:30,981
about ten stories high. Go get him.

442
00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:32,040
Copy that.

443
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,792
Attention to all units.

444
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:58,720
Target number four
is in a black Chevrolet,

445
00:37:58,761 --> 00:37:59,927
license plate number unknown.

446
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:01,758
Located on the south of the hotel,
heading towards the east.

447
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:55,920
Whale, the target has escaped.

448
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:01,985
-Captain.
-Where is Rao Zhi?

449
00:39:02,026 --> 00:39:02,896
He's inside.

450
00:39:02,937 --> 00:39:05,037
It's none of your business!
Just leave me alone!

451
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:12,378
Rao Zhi.

452
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:15,920
Send her home for me.

453
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,360
Yes.

454
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:20,671
-What about you?
-The conference hasn't ended.

455
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:22,040
There is still a lot of work to be done.

456
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,501
Rao Zhi,

457
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:27,398
I've gone through
the hotel's surveillance cameras,

458
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:29,800
I still find Zhuo Ran suspicious.

459
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:31,440
He had been following the man.

460
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:32,720
It was the man I fought with.

461
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:35,705
Plus the sniper opposite the hotel,

462
00:39:35,746 --> 00:39:37,080
I think it is not as simple as it seems.

463
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,775
I knew these.

464
00:39:40,354 --> 00:39:42,440
I've sent someone
to find out Zhuo Ran's real intention.

465
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,318
As to Xiao Xue...

466
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:48,080
I'll take care of her.
It'll be fine.

467
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,580
Thanks.

468
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:56,480
I'll check it out.

469
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:03,800
How dare he throw my phone?

470
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,080
How dare he!

471
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:08,565
You should be glad
that he didn't throw you out.

472
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,200
Tyrant.

473
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:13,575
You almost ruined their whole plan,
you know?

474
00:40:13,616 --> 00:40:15,440
So what?
What's so great about solving a case?

475
00:40:16,453 --> 00:40:19,338
He kept asking me
why I came to this hotel,

476
00:40:19,379 --> 00:40:21,760
or if I knew that driver.

477
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:25,269
I'm like a disaster to him
after I came back.

478
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,680
You couldn't find the suspect,

479
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:28,089
so it's my fault now, isn't it?

480
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,099
This is not what he meant.

481
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,498
This is exactly what he meant!

482
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:33,000
I lost my best friend!

483
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:35,762
That jerk almost ran over me,

484
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:38,720
but I still have to compensate
that car dealer.

485
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:41,897
I'm the most unlucky one!

486
00:40:42,904 --> 00:40:45,174
But you still interrogate me like that.

487
00:40:45,215 --> 00:40:48,622
I'm already unlucky enough, Mu Ze.

488
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:51,520
How could you do this to me?

489
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:55,679
If you
want him to care more about you,

490
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,600
you should do something else.

491
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:58,941
Yelling is useless.

492
00:40:59,335 --> 00:41:00,859
There's nothing else I can do.

493
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,440
He's a robot.

494
00:41:02,923 --> 00:41:04,240
That robot is your father.

495
00:41:05,216 --> 00:41:06,966
He is not my father!

496
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:08,480
He's a complete stranger!

497
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:15,279
He's not my father!

498
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,790
He's not my father!

499
00:41:16,831 --> 00:41:18,621
He's a stranger!

500
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,440
No, he is not!

501
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:38,670
Are you done?

502
00:41:40,173 --> 00:41:41,063
No.

503
00:41:41,517 --> 00:41:42,617
I'm taking a break.

504
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:49,809
I'm done.

505
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,675
Did you say you lost your best friend?

506
00:41:51,716 --> 00:41:52,906
Do I know him?

507
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,501
Of course you don't.

508
00:41:56,622 --> 00:41:58,040
It is an animal therapist...

509
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:01,284
introduced to me
by my friend who is a doctor.

510
00:42:01,758 --> 00:42:03,360
We've been together for a few years.

511
00:42:04,006 --> 00:42:06,306
I asked them to deliver it here,

512
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,125
but the agency lost it...

513
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,636
before it even left
the quarantine center.

514
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,625
Animal therapist?

515
00:42:12,857 --> 00:42:13,729
Just adopt another one.

516
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,705
I can't adopt another one!

517
00:42:15,746 --> 00:42:18,209
It is my one and only!

518
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,731
Do you even know what is one and only?

519
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:22,080
I'm sure you don't know.

520
00:42:23,543 --> 00:42:24,423
In that case,

521
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,021
regarding the compensation
for your rental car,

522
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,210
take care of it yourself.

523
00:42:46,532 --> 00:42:48,112
Mu Ze.

524
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,061
I have my phone here.

525
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:55,819
Either Wechat or Alipay is fine.

526
00:42:56,181 --> 00:42:57,800
That'll be 2,300 yuan.

527
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:00,840
Thank you, Mu Ze.

528
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:03,880
We can also go home and get the cash.

529
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:11,160
-Tian Yong.
-Yes!

530
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:14,329
-Here's a task for you.
-Yes.

531
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:15,525
Send her to my house.

532
00:43:15,566 --> 00:43:18,411
You were that guy who flung me
in the basement parking, weren't you?

533
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:20,687
Yes.

534
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,960
I'll remember you.

535
00:43:28,095 --> 00:43:29,515
It's too risky. I'll take her home.

536
00:43:29,879 --> 00:43:30,740
Thank you, captain.

537
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,244
Attention to all units,

538
00:43:36,285 --> 00:43:37,305
this is Whale.

539
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,804
Gopher will be in charge of site command.

540
00:43:40,845 --> 00:43:41,750
Over.

541
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,680
I will complete the mission!

542
00:43:47,129 --> 00:43:47,983
I'll leave now.

543
00:43:50,201 --> 00:43:52,169
-Captain, Zhuo Ran has been taken...
-He's the captain now.

544
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,400
by the police...

545
00:44:00,044 --> 00:44:01,144
Not bad, lieutenant.

546
00:44:01,304 --> 00:44:02,680
When did you take over his position?

547
00:44:05,675 --> 00:44:07,640
What are you staring at?

548
00:44:09,993 --> 00:44:11,160
This girl is dangerous.

549
00:44:16,366 --> 00:44:17,400
Slow down.

550
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:22,651
Dad!

551
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,638
Dad.

552
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:27,939
Tang Lin called me and said
you were injured.

553
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,760
How are you? Is it serious?

554
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:30,960
I'm fine.

555
00:44:31,459 --> 00:44:33,111
I hurt my back.

556
00:44:33,325 --> 00:44:34,240
It's nothing major.

557
00:44:35,772 --> 00:44:36,652
Is it true?

558
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,971
It is.

559
00:44:38,624 --> 00:44:39,535
It's true.

560
00:44:39,808 --> 00:44:40,920
After that, Mr. Zhuo...

561
00:44:42,734 --> 00:44:43,745
Mr. Zhuo?
