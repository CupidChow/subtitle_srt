00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,070
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:39,770
A good young man is wooing.

4
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,410
A fair maiden he loves.

5
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,930
Who am I?

6
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,970
Who am I?

7
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,790
Xue.

8
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,640
Fortunately, you didn't bump your head.

9
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,560
Why are you here?

10
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,600
Are you here to visit Master Le Tian?

11
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,990
I want to hear you read poetry.

12
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,910
I tried to call you
but couldn't get through.

13
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,630
And I don't have any other form
of contact.

14
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,210
I didn't want to write you a letter,
so I could only come here in person.

15
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,329
What do you want to listen to?

16
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,680
I'll read it for you.

17
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,370
Actually,

18
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,490
after meeting you,

19
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,930
I find that I don't want you
to read me poetry.

20
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,930
Then what do you want?

21
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,210
I want to date you.

22
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,930
The... My... Where are my shoes?

23
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,660
They are here.

24
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,810
Where are my shoes?

25
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,740
Thank you.

26
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,470
Right.

27
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,830
Where are the others?

28
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,990
They're in training.

29
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,300
They're in training, right?

30
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,570
Where are they training?

31
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,970
I guess they're on the field.

32
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,300
Tian Yong, wait for me!

33
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,130
Why do you do this again?

34
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,410
The suspect had evacuated when the police
and I reached the scene.

35
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,620
The police are currently searching
for him.

36
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,100
Why is your cousin the only one here?

37
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,090
What about Xia Chu?

38
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,070
She couldn't come.

39
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,550
I'll call her hospital.

40
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,300
She is not used to living
in the military camp.

41
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,480
Moreover, she can't leave her work behind.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,070
What should we do?

43
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,570
She's alone out there.

44
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,440
Aren't you worried?

45
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,970
I asked Rao Zhi to send someone
to look after her.

46
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,830
And she should be fine as she's staying
in the hospital in these days.

47
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,860
Okay, then.

48
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,990
Right.

49
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,160
Have you told Xia Chu
about her first love...

50
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,300
visiting the police station?

51
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,509
No.

52
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:15,040
I don't want to stress her out.

53
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,480
Okay.

54
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,070
Don't go so fast.

55
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,910
I just confessed to you.

56
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,320
Why are you so vulnerable to confessions?

57
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,730
Just walk slowly,
it's not like I'm going to eat you.

58
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,120
Liang Shao Xue!

59
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,220
Brigade Commander, Captain!

60
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,480
Mu Ze, persuade him for me.

61
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,520
Persuade him on what?

62
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,050
She wants to persuade me
to get some rest.

63
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,450
No! Persuade him to date me.

64
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,750
What?

65
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,690
Who are you?

66
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,870
Who am I?

67
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm the Brigade Commander.

68
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,220
Is his rank higher than yours?

69
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,270
Don't embarrass yourself, okay?

70
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,530
Brigade Commander,
help me in persuading him.

71
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,970
You want me to persuade him to date you?

72
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,730
What's the reason?

73
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,230
I'm outstanding!

74
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,450
Liang Shao Xue!

75
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,270
Let her continue.

76
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,930
I'm starting to wonder
how outstanding this young lady is.

77
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:19,890
Say it.

78
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,550
Actually, about being outstanding,

79
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,350
most of the time,
it's a kind of self-perception.

80
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,620
More like a delusion.

81
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,310
Are you really my brother?

82
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,270
Tian Yong,

83
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,220
do you like this kind of feeling?

84
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,250
Comrade Liang Shao Xue,

85
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,470
stop messing around.

86
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,910
I'm not messing with you.

87
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,990
I really do like you.
I want to be with you.

88
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,210
Are you not going to stop?

89
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,470
-Report!
-Speak.

90
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,680
I want to take half an hour off!

91
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,170
Where are you going?

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,280
I'm going to the Martyrs Cemetery...

93
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,370
with comrade Liang Shao Xue.

94
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,730
They...

95
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,360
This is the Martyrs Cemetery.

96
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,240
They are the predecessors
and comrades of our army...

97
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,270
who had sacrificed
over the past few decades.

98
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,920
(Martyr Luo Liang)

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,440
This mine
and your brother's former captain,

100
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,909
Luo Liang.

101
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,190
He was born in 1986.

102
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,340
He was young.

103
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,320
Was he married?

104
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,610
He had a child that lost his father
before he was born.

105
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,290
My sister-in-law has been...

106
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,290
raising him all these years.

107
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,450
She runs a book store.

108
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,350
It's hard for her.

109
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,810
But this is her own choice.

110
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,530
At the moment she chose this man,

111
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,830
she had already prepared for the worst.

112
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,010
Xue,

113
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,310
you don't understand.

114
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,360
I understand.

115
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,490
Are you not trying to tell me
that you have a dangerous job...

116
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,180
so that I can give up on you?

117
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,050
Aren't you afraid
after seeing these tombstones?

118
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,409
I'm not afraid.

119
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,060
When I was studying in Paris,

120
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,890
there was a graveyard
beside the neighbourhood.

121
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,480
People will have a walk there
after having dinner...

122
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,450
and chat with their deceased relatives.

123
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,210
The graveyard at sunset
is the most beautiful moment in a day.

124
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,450
Just like now.

125
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,670
Why me?

126
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,750
Because you admire soldiers?

127
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,410
I've hated men in uniforms...

128
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,890
before I met you.

129
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,120
They could be someone's son,

130
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,650
husband...

131
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,090
and father.

132
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,710
But after putting on the uniform,

133
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,720
all that is left is the role
behind the uniform.

134
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,550
They didn't look
like themselves anymore.

135
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,490
Then you shouldn't like me.

136
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,450
I have nothing left...

137
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,720
except this military uniform.

138
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,210
But you care about my loneliness,

139
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,950
happiness and safety.

140
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:47,390
You care about my vulnerability
that others couldn't see.

141
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,490
That meant more
than everything put together.

142
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,190
Tian Yong,

143
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,350
death can't confine our affection,

144
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,450
it can't scare me away either.

145
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,650
Death can't scare you, right?

146
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,610
Right.

147
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay.

148
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,030
(Three Hundred Tang poems)

149
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,250
What about this?

150
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,260
What do you mean?

151
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,320
You're back.

152
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,090
What is this?

153
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,450
You rejected my little sister?

154
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,410
No.

155
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,970
I just told her to understand
my spiritual world...

156
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,980
if she memorized
Three Hundred Tang Poems...

157
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,990
before deciding
whether she likes me or not.

158
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,160
You ask her to memorize
Three Hundred Tang Poems?

159
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,000
You asked a classic literature illiterate
who can't tell Li Bai from Du Fu...

160
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,640
to memorize Three Hundred Tang Poems.

161
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,540
You're not rejecting her,
but humiliating her!

162
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,630
I don't believe
that I'm worse than a parrot!

163
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,090
Is that your book?

164
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,150
The book you sleep with?

165
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,940
Yes.

166
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,900
You gave it to her?

167
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,480
I had no choice.

168
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,280
How did she force you?

169
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,560
She didn't force me.

170
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,870
Just that,
something strange would happen...

171
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,161
every time I came across character
with radical of female...

172
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:31,021
when I recently read this book.

173
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,870
Every radical of female...

174
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,680
would turn into her
what her face looks like.

175
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,830
Captain,

176
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,070
if I have no strange disease,

177
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,080
this only shows that...

178
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,600
she is fated with that book.

179
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,610
Tian Yong.

180
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,930
Tian Yong.

181
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,190
Captain!

182
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,810
I can't control my feelings.

183
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,330
But I guarantee that...

184
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,240
my every thought...

185
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,460
begins with affection,
and ends with virtue.

186
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,450
It's definitely pure.

187
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,120
Tian Yong.

188
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,180
Tian Yong!

189
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,690
Take care.

190
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,090
Take care?

191
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,290
You can stay here,

192
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,200
but we need to have an agreement.

193
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,500
You need to follow the rules.

194
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,540
Like what? What are the rules?

195
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,380
For example,
you must not mess with Tian Yong.

196
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,930
Why?

197
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,600
What do you mean why? Sit down!

198
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,780
You're back for vacation, right?

199
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,921
You'll return to the United States
after your vacation.

200
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:00,861
Is it appropriate to date Tian Yong
at this point?

201
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,330
It will work if he likes me.

202
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,310
-And then?
-And then we'll be together.

203
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,570
How can you guys be together?

204
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,680
The Pacific Ocean separates you two,
and you're 12 hours apart.

205
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,470
Then I can stay in China,
or take him back to the United States.

206
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,040
He's on active duty.

207
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,180
What do you mean back
to the United States?

208
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,510
Won't he be discharged?

209
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,890
I can wait for him.

210
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,170
You'll wait for him?

211
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,130
How many times have you guys met?

212
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,570
Three times.

213
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,740
You just met him three times
and you want to wait for him?

214
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,160
It's normal to have love at first sight.

215
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,281
Why is it abnormal to wait for him
after meeting him three times?

216
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:38,811
Can you sit down?

217
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,190
Xue, let me tell you.

218
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,960
Tian Yong has been reading...

219
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,700
that Three Hundred Tang poems
every day...

220
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,660
since I first met him.

221
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,500
I asked him if he'd get tired of it.

222
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,440
He said he could read this book
for his entire life.

223
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,920
Look at you!

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,060
You had no fewer than 50 interest classes
since childhood.

225
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,160
How many times
have you changed your major...

226
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,520
through your four years of college?

227
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,510
You always act first, think later.

228
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,830
You only have a three-minute passion
for everything.

229
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,350
You said you like Tian Yong.

230
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,790
I think you're just being impulsive.

231
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,910
You even want to wait for him?

232
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't believe that.

233
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,290
So that's how you see me?

234
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,340
Tell you what.

235
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,750
Lacking self-awareness
is the biggest obstacle in growing up.

236
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,810
I say that applies to you too.

237
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,820
Don't disagree with me.

238
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,270
Liang Mu Ze, tell you what.

239
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,370
I'm being serious with you.

240
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,550
You don't think it's love
because we've only met a few times.

241
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,630
You think the geography and time
difference are the obstacles of love.

242
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,830
You think love only exists
when it's on the same land.

243
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,050
You're wrong!

244
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,590
Tell you what.

245
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,710
Your biggest mistake
is you foisting your cognition on me.

246
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,490
Just like how Aunt
foists her cognition on you.

247
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,580
Congratulations, brother!

248
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,320
You eventually turned into the kind
of adult you used to hate...

249
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,650
when you were little.

250
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,890
But it's your business, not mine.

251
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,860
Based on my cognition as a 21-year-old,

252
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,290
love is just love.

253
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,350
Everything else means nothing.

254
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,870
So...

255
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,570
Just because you wouldn't
doesn't mean I wouldn't.

256
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,930
Nothing is immutable.

257
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,320
Not love, nor my personality.

258
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,310
As for the variables,

259
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,690
you don't have a say in it,

260
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,100
neither do I.

261
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,970
But...

262
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,920
right now, I want to date him.

263
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,290
Xue,

264
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,190
listen to me.

265
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,590
Tian Yong is not as happy
as he looks on the surface.

266
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,860
Get it?

267
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,110
You are not as strong as you seem.

268
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,370
So you have be more discreet about this.

269
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,960
You have to reconsider it.

270
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,290
This is very important.

271
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,760
Tian Yong is not someone
you can flirt with.

272
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,070
Right?

273
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,250
It's unacceptable to me for either side.

274
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,770
What's that sound?
I'm talking to you.

275
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,990
You're just jealous of me!

276
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,210
Why would I be jealous you?

277
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,620
Of course you'd envy me.

278
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,190
You're envious that me and Tian Yong...

279
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,390
are determined to stay together
throughout all eternity.

280
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,880
But your Dr Xia...

281
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,180
only puts her heart and soul
in her medical career.

282
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,100
You're no match to even a pinky finger.

283
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,390
Okay.

284
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,900
If Tian Yong still likes you
after wrapping his head around that,

285
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,310
I'll read my name backward.

286
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,630
What's wrong with that?

287
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,550
He'll like me.

288
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,710
He should like me.

289
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,950
I'm so cute.

290
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,450
Moreover, we...

291
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,340
We...

292
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,880
Can you stay by her side
for 24 hours a day?

293
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,710
When I show up on her side,

294
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,120
what can you do for her...

295
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,880
as you're in the military camp?

296
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,980
-Hello.
-Hello, Uncle Rao.

297
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,260
Xue came to my unit.

298
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,250
You don't have to worry.

299
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,760
I know.

300
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,170
How did you know?

301
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,140
I installed a tracking program
on her phone.

302
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,100
Really?

303
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,670
Here's the thing.

304
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,840
Peng Fei and Xiao Qiang
are guarding the hospital.

305
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,710
Xia Chu is currently fine.

306
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,670
You can rest assured.

307
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,740
And we found
through street surveillance...

308
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,160
that Long Yi had fled to the border.

309
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,420
We already informed
the frontier armed police...

310
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,450
to cooperate in the manhunt.

311
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,140
But so far, we've got nothing.

312
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,220
What about Zhuo Ran?
Is he still at the police station?

313
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,230
No, he's in the detention centre.

314
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,100
We'll take him to the police station
when we need to talk to him.

315
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,849
Uncle Rao, did he explain
why Long Yi came after Xia Chu?

316
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,670
He said he didn't know why.

317
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:19,580
Do you believe that he's innocent
in the T4 criminal chain?

318
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,540
Of course I don't.

319
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
This is not my first day
as a police officer.

320
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,760
I've seen many deceptive criminals
with antisocial personality disorder.

321
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,550
They will go to every lengths
to achieve their objectives.

322
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,760
There must be a deeper reason
why that man named Old Master...

323
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,770
went to such lengths for Xia Chu.

324
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,110
One thing's for certain.

325
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,360
The division within T4
is getting deeper as Zhuo Ran...

326
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,160
chose to cooperate with us at this point.

327
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,880
That Old Master behind this organization
must be related...

328
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,510
to the murders of Sang Kun and Gui.

329
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,330
We don't care about Zhuo Ran's intention.

330
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,350
Our intention is to find...

331
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,600
the murderer and establish the truth.

332
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,570
Since he wants to use the police,

333
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,790
in return, we can use him as well.

334
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,210
Okay,
as long as you know what you're doing.

335
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,930
Uncle Rao,

336
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,570
I want to ask for a favour.

337
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,270
Go ahead.

338
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,350
Can you get me a tracker that you...

339
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,270
installed for Xue?

340
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,680
(Outpatient Department)

341
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
We should just eat out.

342
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,860
Never mind.

343
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,620
Just eat at the canteen.

344
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,610
There's no much left in the canteen
at this time.

345
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,410
We shouldn't eat so full at dinner.

346
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,430
People used to say,

347
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,690
it's better to dine
like a pauper for dinner.

348
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,910
Okay, you guys
have been very tense these days.

349
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,390
That's all for me, you guys can go.

350
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,750
Okay, go ahead.

351
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,700
Okay.

352
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,750
-Yi Chi.
-Yes.

353
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,390
Keep the former company leader for us.

354
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,570
Rest assured.

355
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,350
Okay, then we'll leave first.

356
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,820
Okay.

357
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,650
Thank you.

358
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,410
You've worked hard.

359
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,940
Take care.

360
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,950
Well, sir, this way, please.

361
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,150
Okay.

362
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,070
You brat.

363
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,490
Enough, let's go.

364
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,550
The resuscitation of this patient with
paraquat poisoning is a valuable case.

365
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,390
You have to summarize
the problems encountered...

366
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,250
in the operation
and treatment procedures.

367
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,920
It would be nice
to write them up after that.

368
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,790
I have no time to write papers.

369
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,630
Moreover, my theoretical level is limited.

370
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,720
That's why I leave it to Xia Chu,
and another resident.

371
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,910
Please recommend it
when the paper is completed.

372
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,870
Okay.

373
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,760
Xia Chu is a sweet girl.

374
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,860
You're right.

375
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,860
She is not only pretty, but smart too.

376
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,320
What's most important is her ability.

377
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,930
-Do you like her?
-Of course I do.

378
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,960
I like a smart
and hardworking residents like her.

379
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,190
I mean outside the professional realm.

380
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,500
Don't make a crazy match.

381
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,370
I just cherish Xia Chu's talent.

382
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,680
There's no love sentiment.

383
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,790
Mainly, she is not my cup of tea.

384
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,190
I think you've tried many types,

385
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,961
but still haven't found the one
that fits your taste.

386
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,740
Dad, to be honest with you.

387
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,850
I already found one.

388
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,630
Uncle, it's been a long time.

389
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,650
Li Juan.

390
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,610
I wouldn't even know you were here...

391
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,230
if I didn't run
into Xiao Zhai down the hall.

392
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,630
I happen to bring you lunch.

393
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,430
Okay. Thank you.

394
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,230
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

395
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,210
You're welcome.

396
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,270
Right, Zhang Yi Chi,

397
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,150
what did you say just now?

398
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,580
Right, you said...

399
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,050
I already found a suitable partner.

400
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,600
Really?

401
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,190
You didn't tell me that.

402
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,390
I didn't get a chance.

403
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,560
This is your fault.

404
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,710
You knew that uncle and aunt
are worried about your marriage.

405
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,990
Why didn't you notify them
as soon as you found one?

406
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,360
We just met.

407
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,610
That's perfect.

408
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,750
You should bring her
to uncle and aunt sooner.

409
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,200
So that you won't have to waste time
and effort like we did before.

410
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,010
Right, uncle?

411
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,510
All experience is a lesson in life.

412
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,920
It won't be wasted.

413
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,000
But it would be best if I could meet her.

414
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,030
Let's make it on weekend.
My friend is opening a restaurant.

415
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,630
The environment is good,
the food taste delicious.

416
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,270
I'll ask him to reserve a room for you.

417
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,470
-We wouldn't want to trouble you.
-Not at all.

418
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,050
It's his pleasure
to have you as his guest.

419
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,500
Please help him promote his restaurant
among your friends.

420
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,510
Okay. His mother and I are okay with that.

421
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,590
But Dr Zhang is busy,

422
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,050
it's all up to him.

423
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,340
Okay.

424
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,780
Then I'll leave you here.

425
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,120
I'm going to check my schedule
this weekend.

426
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,690
Uncle, I'll go check on him.

427
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,490
This brat is already 38 years old,
but still can't act serious.

428
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,670
Zhang Yi Chi, why are you mad?

429
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,810
I'm helping you.

430
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,030
I have no idea
why you have to make all this ruckus.

431
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,330
I'm jealous.

432
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,310
I wonder what kind of woman she is...

433
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,090
if it could make you protect her
this well.

434
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,300
-Is that funny?
-No.

435
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,010
I have to make myself give up on you.

436
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,380
Otherwise, I would be tired to leave
with your bond to me.

437
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,380
Don't act like you love sincerely, okay?

438
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,990
We've known each other for years.
We know each other well.

439
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,280
What's with your attitude?

440
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,240
Enough.

441
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,310
Dr Zhang, Liu Ran isn't doing good.

442
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,690
Come and check on her!

443
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,530
Okay, I'll be right over.

444
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,410
Mr Zhang.

445
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,780
How's Liu Ran doing?

446
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,670
Her fever is up to 39.8 degrees
and is severely dehydrated.

447
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,570
Dr Zhang, this is Liu Ran's blood results
from three days ago.

448
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,330
Acinetobacter Baumannii.

449
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,500
Based on previous experience
of anti-infective treatment...

450
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,920
and some survivors' cases,

451
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,210
I suggest we use polymyxin E
for treatment.

452
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,050
This is the oldest top antibiotics.

453
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,360
There's no turning back once we use it.

454
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,210
I know.

455
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,710
Just use it.

456
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,960
Monitor the usage and the drug reaction.

457
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,270
Use it as soon as possible.

458
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,770
Old Master.

459
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,910
You're not in the office?

460
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,850
I went out to contact the business.

461
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,200
No problem with the buyers, right?

462
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,160
We have a deal.

463
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,190
No problem.

464
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,490
I already arranged the delivery guys.

465
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,280
What about the drop spot?

466
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,740
It's in Black Maplewood.

467
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,210
We'll use the T4 logo as a mark.

468
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,880
Tell those villagers
that I'll wait for their return...

469
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,140
with their families.

470
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,100
Yes.

471
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,320
Old Master, he's here.

472
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,110
-Send him in.
-Yes.

473
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,790
Captain Rao, we lost him.

474
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,490
(Somewhere in South-East Asia Willick,
T4's headquarters)

475
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,670
Many people recommend you to me.

476
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,170
I've seen your profile.

477
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,790
You're good.

478
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,230
Tell me your requirements.

479
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,480
I only want money.

480
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,460
You're straightforward.

481
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,990
I got plenty of money.

482
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,290
The amount you get
depends on your ability.

483
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,060
Deal.

484
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,810
Are you sure Long Yi
is going to that place?

485
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,690
We agreed to meet there.

486
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,090
I have to go help them.
Or else, Old Master will get suspicious.

487
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,030
He already has his guard up against me.

488
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,860
If I don't show up this time,

489
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,220
he'll quickly assume I've betrayed him.

490
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,870
He still has my mother.

491
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,580
I'll do whatever you want
as long as you can save my mother.

492
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,860
I'll cooperate fully with the police.

493
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,040
Please believe me.

494
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,050
Chief, we can't hesitate.

495
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,410
This is the best time to infiltrate T4.

496
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,430
If we let him leave the country,

497
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:06,290
we'll lose our only lead
if he doesn't return.

498
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,470
I have a plan to contain him.

499
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,830
Furthermore,
after a few days of observation,

500
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,110
I found that, for whatever reason,

501
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,100
there must be some conflict
between him and Old Master.

502
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,690
So we are on the same page
regarding Old Master.

503
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,650
Chief,

504
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,170
he is our only way to get in.

505
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,380
Okay, then.
Send someone to follow him.

506
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,950
I'll ask for instructions
from the superiors.

507
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,450
Inform Interpol for assistance.

508
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,400
Conduct an immediate capture
if things go wrong.

509
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,360
Yes.

510
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,770
Based on the information provided
by the source and armed police,

511
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,390
a group of well-trained
cross-border drug dealers...

512
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,530
with mercenary-related background,

513
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,830
is using the border population
as cover for drug trafficking...

514
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,790
to bring in a major shipment of drugs.

515
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,630
This morning,

516
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,780
the frontier armed police has captured
a few villagers who carried drugs.

517
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,410
But they found no traces of T4.

518
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,150
Based on the comprehensive information,

519
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,630
T4 should be hiding in the jungle
near boundary pillar number 17,

520
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,030
waiting for opportunities.

521
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,790
The superiors ordered us
to dispatch Team Thunder...

522
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,270
to assist in searching
and catching the criminals.

523
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,610
Take action now!

524
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,190
Are you sure...

525
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,780
it's safe?

526
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,590
Safe?

527
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,110
In this world, there's no such thing.

528
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,780
This is the Chinese People's
Liberation Army.

529
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,980
You have illegally entered
the territory of China.

530
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,480
Put your weapons down
and prepare to be inspected.

531
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,410
Open fire!

532
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,300
Go, go, go!

533
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,560
We have been exposed!

534
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,300
Repeat, we have been exposed!
Team B, evacuate!

535
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,240
Be careful! They have snipers!

536
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,310
The target is...

537
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,530
at 10 o'clock.

538
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,320
He's out of effective range.

539
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,210
Give me covering fire!
I'll take the guy down!

540
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,210
What are you doing?

541
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,330
Who will lead us if you're dead?

542
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,290
It's fine.

543
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,670
I'll go.

544
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,180
I'll go.

545
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,140
Cover me.

546
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,090
All units, lay down suppressing fire
at 10 o'clock!

547
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:05,409
Follow me!

548
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,680
Songpaisarn!

549
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,790
Medic! Medic!

550
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,890
I need a medic!

551
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,260
Songpaisarn!

552
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,040
Songpaisarn!

553
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,520
Hands up!

554
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,310
It's a bomb!

555
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,090
Is everyone all right?

556
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,120
I'm fine!

557
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,260
I'm fine!

558
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,830
Tian Yong, control the villagers!

559
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,820
-Keep searching!
-Yes!

560
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,330
Turn around!

561
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,870
What are you doing?

562
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,460
Why did you run?

563
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,840
I...

564
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,880
Are you Long Yi?

565
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,230
It's me, why?

566
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,210
Take him!

567
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,370
No.

568
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,730
I...

569
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,070
What did I do?

570
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,320
What's going on?

571
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,180
Someone shot at me just now.

572
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,330
I chased him down here.

573
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,600
But it seems like it wasn't him.

574
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,710
We found this in the jungle.

575
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,890
A 3D-printed mask?

576
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,340
Captain Liang, thank you.

577
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,180
Just leave the rest to us.

578
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,390
Thank you.

579
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,300
Let's go.

580
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,960
Long Yi is arrested.

581
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,220
I understand.

582
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,820
I'm going to Old Master now.

583
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,780
Keep in touch.

584
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,380
(Somewhere in South-East Asia Willick,
T4's headquarters)

585
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
Based on the latest information
our reporter received,

586
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,240
our national army had recently conducted
a joint operation...

587
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,840
and took down a group
of armed drug dealers...

588
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,920
who entered our country illegally
at the border.

589
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,260
They confiscated a large quantity
of firearms and drugs.

590
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,410
When I reached the jungle
near Black Maplewood,

591
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,730
I found that our people
and goods were gone.

592
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,020
What about Long Yi?

593
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,980
I haven't heard from him.

594
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,730
I'm thinking if his disappearance...

595
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,990
is related to what happened today.

596
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,650
Whether it's related or not,

597
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,360
China's military police
have to pay for the price...

598
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,820
as they touched my goods.

599
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,170
It's a shame that we lost him in Willick.

600
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,790
He's, again, the leader.

601
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,410
We must find a way to mess with him.

602
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,690
Instead of messing with him,

603
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,240
let's go after those around him.

604
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,710
He has a sister.

605
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,140
That Xia...

606
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,470
What is the doctor's name?

607
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,530
Xia Chu.

608
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,350
Is she still staying with him?

609
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,310
Yes.

610
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,690
Get her.

611
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,080
Old Master.

612
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,020
Xia Guang Yuan adores his daughter.

613
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,040
Isn't that perfect?

614
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,700
We can punish Liang Mu Ze...

615
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,600
and crush Xia Guang Yuan
into submission...

616
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,710
by kidnapping Xia Chu.

617
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,540
It's not hard to do this job
with the effort you've put...

618
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,050
into the father and daughter, right?

619
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,400
It's not hard.

620
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,650
Do you recognise this?

621
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,490
A 3D-printed mask.

622
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,140
If I'm not wrong,

623
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,770
your company provides 3D printing service.

624
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,710
You should be...

625
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,760
familiar with its function.

626
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,680
This mask was thrown
at the river beach...

627
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,700
near Black Maplewood.

628
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,660
And you happened
to appear at that place.

629
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,840
What were you doing there?

630
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,400
Did you throw away this mask?

631
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,910
On the afternoon on the 23rd of January,

632
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:13,870
it was you...

633
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,160
who appeared again...

634
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,220
at the underground garage
of Jianqiaolan Bay, and followed...

635
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,990
a female named Xia Chu
to the building...

636
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,210
and intended to kidnap her.

637
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,330
Where were you and what were you doing
on the night of January 2?

638
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,590
Don't think that you'll be fine
just because you say nothing.

639
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,500
Tell you what.

640
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,110
We can still sentence you
without a statement.

641
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,560
I want to see my lawyer.

642
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:57,750
Rao Zhi.

643
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,281
We'll talk about it after getting
the report from the laboratory.

644
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:02,241
I understand.

645
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,210
We used every antibiotics we had.

646
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,560
The Acinetobacter Baumannii
in the patient's body...

647
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,590
has become
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

648
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,070
It's hard to redress the septic shock
that it causes.

649
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,720
It's meaningless to keep reviving her.

650
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,440
Is her family here?

651
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,400
Not yet.

652
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:39,910
Xia Chu!

653
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,090
Where are you going?

654
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,290
I have to search the prior cases.

655
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,560
Perhaps there are other ways.

656
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,740
Calm down.

657
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,100
Sir, I want to give it a try.

658
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,430
You are a professional doctor.
How can you be this irrational?

659
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,840
I want to try again.

660
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,160
There's got to be another way.

661
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,441
It's impossible,
there's got to be another way.

662
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:02,940
-Xia Chu!
-Mr Zhang!

663
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,300
-Enough!
-Dr Xia, Liu Ran is calling for you.

664
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,210
Liu Ran, I'm here.

665
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,510
Don't be afraid.

666
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,420
We just got news from the police.

667
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,870
The criminal has been arrested.

668
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,610
You're amazing.

669
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,380
You're doing great.

670
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,790
Hang in there.

671
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,090
Fight.

672
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,530
Fight.

673
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,740
Thank... you.

674
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,820
There's a letter I wrote for you...

675
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,860
under the pillow.

676
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,540
Make sure to read it.

677
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,010
Okay, I'll read it for sure.

678
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,860
Liu Ran.

679
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,400
Hold still.

680
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,360
You'll be fine.

681
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,950
Hang in there.

682
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,820
Sister...

683
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,250
Thank you.

684
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,430
Thank you.

685
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,660
I'll go inform her family.

686
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,490
Have you reached them?

687
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,950
No one answered.

688
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,370
Then just send him a message.

689
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,210
Tell him that Liu Ran has passed away.

690
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,750
He'll call us back.

691
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,160
Why is that?

692
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,980
The operation went well,
and every index was normal.

693
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:17,910
What's with the sudden...?

694
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:19,430
Don't forget about the dinner appointment.

695
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,290
My friend has reserved a room for you.

696
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,760
Can you not talk about the appointment
at this time?

697
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,880
What's with this time?

698
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,110
My patient passed away!

699
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,140
Zhang Yi Chi.

700
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,460
This is not your first day as a doctor.

701
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,710
From the moment
you took over this patient,

702
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,180
you should've visualized the worst result.

703
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,740
The relationship between you two
should be limited at this consulting room,

704
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,070
operation room and the ward.

705
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,550
These three dimensions.

706
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,880
After you leave these dimensions,
you should have your life,

707
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,640
your friends and family.

708
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,750
Your emotions shouldn't be affected
by a patient.

709
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:54,530
If you were to be affected
by every death of your patient,

710
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,780
you would soon be knocked over.

711
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,500
Enough.

712
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,790
I'm here to remind you not to forget
about the serious matter.
