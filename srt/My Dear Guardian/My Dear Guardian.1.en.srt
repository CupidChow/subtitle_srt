Help him.

Are you okay?

167
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,390
He was shot in the chest.

My hand hurts.

180
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,910
Where's the anaesthetist?

181
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,070
There are many wounded people today.
We don't have enough manpower.

182
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,270
Dr Zhang.

183
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,950
Let me try.

184
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,230
You?

185
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,900
I did an anaesthesia training.

186
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,740
Hurry up.

187
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,830
Yes.

188
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,030
Here.

189
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,310
Thanks.

190
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,030
He's going to be okay, buddy.

191
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,910
He's a Chinese soldier.

192
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,990
20mcg of noradrenaline intravenous
every minute.

193
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,510
-Prepare the blood.
-Yes.

194
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,150
-Xia Chu.
-I know.

195
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,710
Draw out the blood.

196
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,220
Pump it back

197
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,190
through the jugular vein.

198
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,100
Very good.

199
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,070
Open the chest.

200
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,510
It's here, I found it.

201
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,230
The bullet pierced

202
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,150
through the pericardium
and visceral layers from the edge

203
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,150
and embedded in the myocardium.

204
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,390
Luckily,

205
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,510
it didn't pierce the heart.

206
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,150
There's only a thin crack

207
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,580
in between.

208
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,550
This guy is very lucky.

209
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,070
Tweezers.

210
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,020
No wonder the blood

211
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,990
is not gushing.

212
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,540
It slowly seeps in instead.

213
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,910
It gives us ample time to rescue him.

214
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,950
-We are lucky.
-Haemostat.

215
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,630
What's wrong? Feeling dizzy?

216
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,510
No.

217
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,830
I'm just a little scared.

218
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,070
Relax.

219
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,710
Let me tell you.

220
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,150
There was an officer who suffered

221
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,070
a more serious injury than him.

222
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,110
He was shot twice and had stab wounds.

223
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,950
Fractures too.

224
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,430
After the surgery,

225
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,990
he recovered in half a year.

226
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,350
And

227
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,710
without any side effects.

228
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,190
Good, hold it.

229
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,430
Good, hold it.

230
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,990
Okay.

231
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,910
We've done it.

232
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,910
Okay.

233
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,430
Needle.

234
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,150
Good. It's completed.

235
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,060
Fifteen minutes faster

236
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,180
than estimated.

237
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,870
What do you think?

238
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,630
Do you think I'm good?

239
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,550
You are my idol.

240
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,670
Okay.

241
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,470
When you go back, don't forget

242
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,950
to introduce

243
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,070
a girlfriend to me.

244
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,670
Okay.

245
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,030
How was it?

246
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,990
The operation was very successful.

247
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,830
After the observation period,

248
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,550
I'll send him to ICU.

249
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,910
If he gets through today,

250
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,510
he shouldn't have any big problem.

251
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,180
He still needs to endure today?

252
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,350
I drank it.

253
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,710
I am dying of thirst.

254
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,950
Captain Liang.

255
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,550
When he stabilises,

256
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,550
I suggest

257
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,190
you send him back immediately.

258
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,830
The conditions here aren't ideal.

259
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,350
Okay.

260
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,060
We've sent

261
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,470
your comrade to the ICU.

262
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,350
Wait.

263
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,830
Listen to me first.

264
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,150
I don't have time to listen to a fool.

265
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,750
What?

266
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,460
Because of your crazy action,

267
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,900
my friend was shot.

268
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,510
I'm very sorry

269
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,030
about your friend.

270
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,460
But you know exactly

271
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,510
what happened.

272
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,950
When that terrorist

273
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,900
tried to shoot,

274
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,740
I was really worried

275
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,220
more people would get hurt.

276
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,060
That's why

277
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:34,940
I tried to stop him.

278
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,820
We were carrying out a rescue mission.

279
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,900
As a hostage, you just stay where you are.

280
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,070
I know.

281
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,190
But the situation was changing rapidly.

282
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,790
I was trying to help.

283
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,190
We don't need your help.

284
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,750
We are trained soldiers.

285
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,300
This is our battlefield.

286
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,940
As a hostage, you only need

287
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,340
to stay calm and cooperate.

288
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,590
What were you thinking?

289
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,660
You are a professional soldier.

290
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,980
I am a professional doctor.

291
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,070
I'm a soldier too.

292
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,790
I knew that terrorist was injured.

293
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,430
I made a judgement call.

294
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,980
I thought I could stop him.

295
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,310
What was the result?

296
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,150
A bullet pierced his heart.

297
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,630
I'll take care of him in ICU.

298
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,910
I'll make sure he is all right.

299
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,350
Maybe I didn't keep my cool.

300
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,390
I didn't do well.

301
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,220
Once again, I'm sorry.

302
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,190
But I want to let you know.

303
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,460
It's your battlefield

304
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,670
and mine too.

305
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,870
I always try my best to help.

306
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,030
Did you bandage the terrorist's wound?

307
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,620
Yes.

308
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,990
You did your utmost to save the terrorist,

309
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,380
they tried their best to kill us.

310
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,300
I've already told you.

311
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,550
This wasn't my intention.

312
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,830
At that moment,

313
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,740
he was an injured man

314
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,870
who needed help.

315
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,980
I'm telling you, this is a battlefield.

316
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,180
An enemy on the battlefield
is an enemy indeed.

317
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,420
The Geneva Conventions

318
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,340
must be obeyed.

319
00:25:59,430 --> 00:25:59,860
I've taken

320
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,260
the Hippocratic Oath.

321
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,180
Unless I get an order from my superior,

322
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,030
my specialization

323
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,030
requires me to save
who is in mortal danger.

324
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,350
I don't care about that.

325
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,180
You are

326
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,900
not qualified to be a soldier

327
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,870
nor a doctor.

328
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,670
What?

329
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,710
Apologise to me.

330
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,510
Are you crazy?

331
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,030
You must apologise to me.

332
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,230
You can't insult my specialization.

333
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,990
You can't question...

334
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,030
What're you doing?

335
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,030
Release me.

336
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,190
You're a crazy man!

337
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,390
Come back.

338
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,470
Let go of me.

339
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,830
Come back.

340
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,510
Which unit are you from, 2467?

341
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,150
Come back, let go of me.

342
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,910
I'll make a complaint.

343
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:23,170
[One week later.

Brigade Commander.

345
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,550
Brigade Commander.

346
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,030
So?

347
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,070
Have you reflected on your problem?

348
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,500
Yes.

349
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,140
Then tell me.

350
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,110
I represent China mainland's

00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,470
who have completed all subjects,

354
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,190
but I'm ranked number two.

355
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,380
My grades are poor.

356
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,990
-That's all?
-That's all.

357
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,350
Fine, you can continue to stay.

358
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,270
Yes, there is more.

359
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,180
Say it.

360
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,190
There's also that doctor's complaint
about me.

361
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,710
What about?

362
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,990
It has spread throughout the war zone.

363
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,750
You tied up a doctor

364
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,550
from the medical team in Isaia.

365
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,630
What have you done, Liang Mu Ze?

366
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,670
No, Sir.

367
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,060
Tian Yong almost died

368
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,140
because of her.

369
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,110
She's a hostage you must protect.

370
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,150
Brigade Commander.

371
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,630
As a joint operations commander,

372
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,060
I must ensure

373
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,350
the safety of the hostages

374
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,420
and

375
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,590
of my comrades.

376
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,860
So, you mean you are right?

377
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,710
You did nothing wrong, correct?

378
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:01,420
No, Sir.

379
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,150
Calm down.

380
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,750
Watch your blood pressure.

381
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,230
Don't make excuses.

382
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,470
Watch your behaviour.

383
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,550
I've completed my self-reflection report,
Brigade Commander.

384
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,150
Liang Mu Ze.

385
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,990
Do you really

386
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,430
admit your mistake this time?

387
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,110
Yes, I do.

388
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,110
-If I do it again...
-It's fine.

389
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,420
Do 500 push-ups.

390
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:28,860
Go home

391
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,300
after you have completed them.

392
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,310
Continue to reflect.

393
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,790
-Yes.
-And

394
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,870
after completing

395
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,390
Tian Yong's hospitalisation,

396
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,260
-return to the unit.
-Yes.

397
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,470
[My son.]

398
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,670
[Mr Dong said he approved your leave.]

399
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,630
[That's great.]

400
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,260
[You should think about]

401
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,830
[your personal issues.]

402
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,460
[By the way,]

403
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,510
[we found you a housemate.]

404
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,750
[It's my friend's child.]

405
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,830
[I hope
you can get along with each other.]

406
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,220
How are you?

407
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,790
I'll visit you one day.

408
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,750
Can you share the table?

409
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,230
I have no choice.

410
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,070
Don't worry about me.

411
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,710
I never hear anything.

412
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,550
I don't know.

413
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,270
He can share the table.

414
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,590
I don't know.

415
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:23,910
Thank you.

416
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,470
Can I take your order?

417
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,950
Let me have a look.

418
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,270
Talk to you later.

419
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,630
Goodbye.

420
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,110
Don't pretend.

421
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,620
If you want to apologise,
wait till I'm done.

422
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,590
Apologise?

423
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,830
Are you apologising to me?

424
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,750
Were you punished?

425
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,190
Are you upset?

426
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,510
It's fine.

427
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,470
Men grow up in blows.

428
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,550
I don't want to share the table.

429
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,630
You can leave.

430
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,710
This is my table.

431
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,270
Then leave with your table.

432
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,470
Are you ready to order?

433
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,580
-Yes.
-Okra.

434
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,550
Chicken.

435
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,550
Tofu.

436
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,900
Salted egg yolk bun.

437
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,710
Okay.

438
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,540
I'm sorry.

439
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,740
We have one bun left.

440
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,230
He ordered it first.

441
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,950
Put it here.

442
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,420
What's wrong?

443
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,260
What's wrong?

444
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:55,940
It's my boyfriend.

445
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,990
My boyfriend choked on the beef.

446
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,870
Put him over the back of the chair.

447
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,380
No.

448
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,380
Punch him.

449
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,340
A hollow punch.

450
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:14,950
Punch where?

451
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,910
In the stomach.

452
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,870
How are you?

453
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,870
Thank you.

454
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,150
It feels good.

455
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,389
What a poor kitten.

456
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,070
Why are you here?

457
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,909
Were you abandoned?

458
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,949
Do you want me to bring you home?

459
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,230
[Bring me home, miss.]

460
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,350
I don't have my own place.

461
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,750
I'm sorry.

462
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,429
Goodbye.

463
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,110
I don't care.

464
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,230
Let's take a bath.

465
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,540
It's very cute, for real.

466
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,710
[No, it's not.]

467
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,460
[Do you know how many parasites]

468
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,430
[a cat has?]

469
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,270
I have de-wormed it.

470
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,070
No.

471
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,030
That house was lent to you

472
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,190
by Mu Min.

473
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,340
I know, I know.

474
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,590
I'll be very careful.

475
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,990
I remember locking it.

476
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,670
[What did you say?]

477
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,830
I'll talk to you later, Mum.

478
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,750
Xia Chu.

479
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,190
[Oh my, what a handsome man.]

480
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,150
It's you.

481
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,310
Why are you here?

482
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,180
This is my house.

483
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,270
Are you Mu Min's son?

484
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,350
Yes.

485
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,420
Didn't you say

486
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,100
the house was vacant?

487
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,140
Liang Mu Ze appeared

488
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,590
when I moved in.

489
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,710
[Isn't that normal?]

490
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,870
[He is the actual owner.]

491
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,550
If you aren't willing,

492
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,950
you can move out.

493
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,340
[Move again?]

494
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,870
[I just moved in.]

495
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,270
I've moved multiple times

496
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,870
since I graduated.

497
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,420
Xia Chu is a girl.

498
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,340
Of course,

499
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,310
she's a girl.

500
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,870
Didn't I tell you?

501
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,910
You said he's a guy.

502
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,460
[When did I tell you he's a guy?]

503
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,140
[I don't care.]

504
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,270
[She already stopped
renting her old place.]

505
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,540
[Furthermore,]

506
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,870
[do you want to see her
live on the street?]

507
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,950
They have a hostel in the hospital.

508
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,910
The application time is already over.

509
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,710
Or

510
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,150
you can come home.

511
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,940
You can be a doctor here.

512
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,270
Why would you go to such a faraway place?

513
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,630
You should know.

514
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,660
When I married your dad,

515
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,110
her mum came to help me

516
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,230
in Dong'an.

517
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,710
What does it have to do with me?

518
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,940
You can take care

519
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,470
of each other.

520
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,750
It's a complicated society outside.

521
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,220
[You have two choices.]

522
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,980
[You can choose to stay,]

523
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,180
[or you can come back to Dong'an.]

524
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,180
[Mom...]

525
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,550
[It's no use.]

526
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,740
When I bought the house,

527
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,510
I wanted you to get married soon.

528
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,030
I heard

529
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,350
her son

530
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,750
is an officer.

531
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,270
How does she look like?

532
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,350
Is she pretty?

533
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,950
What are you thinking, Mum?

534
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,750
What do you think?

535
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,390
Or...

536
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,670
[I can get your grandfather
to inquire about him]

537
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,470
[in his unit.]

538
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:43,380
Miss Lan.

539
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,110
Don't create problems for me.

540
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,740
It's my problem.

541
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,670
I can solve it myself.

542
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,380
Do you want some noodles?

543
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,550
Yes, I do.

544
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,990
You forgot to add salt.

545
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,950
I did add it. A little bit.

546
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,740
Too much salt is not healthy.

547
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,830
Not more than 5g per person every day.

548
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,190
Xia Chu.

549
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,230
I must talk to you.

550
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,430
Wait until I'm done.

551
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,230
This is my lunch.

552
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,590
I'm going to the hospital.

553
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,070
What do you want to discuss?

554
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,830
First of all, which room do you stay in?

555
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,270
This one.

556
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,670
Are you sure?

557
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,270
Mu Min told me I can use

558
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,310
the bathroom in the master bedroom.

559
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,180
So, when you are not home,

560
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,150
occasionally,

561
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,260
only once in a while,

562
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,940
I can use your bathtub.

563
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,070
Secondly.

564
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,540
What's this?

565
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,150
[Don't be so rough.]

566
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,550
[You are hurting me.]

567
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,500
Don't hold it this way.

568
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,820
It'll be scared.

569
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,590
It's a cat that I picked up.

570
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,670
You can keep the cat,

571
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,700
but I don't want to see

572
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,180
any faeces in the room.

573
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,470
No fur and no smell.

574
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,700
Don't worry,

575
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,100
cats are cleaner than humans.

576
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,390
Thirdly,

577
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,190
you can use my bathroom.

578
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,630
But you must pack things up.

579
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,190
Is this yours?

580
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,820
My memory padded bra.

581
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,310
I thought I lost it.

582
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,430
Where was it?

583
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,830
In my dryer.

584
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,590
It's so dirty.

585
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:21,990
Okay.

586
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,150
Lastly, number four, which is also

587
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:25,740
the most important.

588
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,710
Listen clearly.

589
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,790
Move out from here

590
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,310
in one week time.

591
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:32,710
What?

592
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:33,790
Move out.

593
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,500
You ate my noodles just now.

594
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,460
Have you forgotten?

595
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,030
I remember. It wasn't tasty.

596
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,950
Do you really want me to move out?

597
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:44,580
Why did you

598
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,140
talk so much just now?

599
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,670
Just go straight to the fourth point.

600
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,460
To see

601
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,670
your shocked look.

602
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,310
It feels good.

603
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,470
I can pay the rent.

604
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,670
I don't need money.

605
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,990
Liang Mu Ze.

606
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,940
If you can't afford one,

607
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,910
tell me.

608
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,950
I'll find you a moving company.

609
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,070
Liang Mu Ze.
