3
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,190
I'm fine.

4
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,170
Don't worry about me.

5
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:42,330
Really, I'm fine.

6
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,210
I didn't expect

7
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,690
I'd be the one

8
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,850
to send him to the police station.

9
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,050
Right after he said

10
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,700
he wanted to take me to his mother.

11
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,010
Why did things end up like this?

12
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,570
Why?

13
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,010
It's not your fault, Mi Gu.

14
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,220
I know.

15
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,180
It's not my fault.

16
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,240
It was him who'd been lying to me.

17
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,100
He's guilty.

18
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,460
He deserves to die.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,050
He should be punished.

20
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,510
But I'm very sad.

21
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,220
Xia Chu,

22
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:51,960
I'm envious that

23
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,780
you met the 18-year-old Zhuo Ran

24
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,450
instead of the current Pei Yu.

25
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,670
But they look alike.

26
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,900
They really do.

27
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,790
I think I'm dying.

28
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,890
You won't die, Mi Gu.

29
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,490
Life always has ways to hurt us

30
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,660
but these wounds

31
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,680
will eventually become
our strongest bit.

32
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,140
I pulled through.

33
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,430

66
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,450
killed himself while

67
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,530
killing others.

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,090
what do you like about me?

92
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,090
I like you

93
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,860
when you sing off-key

94
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,740
but you're comfortable with it.

95
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,270

96
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,580

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,290
I like how you're being fearless.

98
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,620
Actually, I'm afraid.

99
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,410
What are you afraid of?

100
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,460
Take a guess.

101
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,490
Being on a mission?

102
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,810
Getting hurt?

103
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,400
Killing people?

104
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,010
I'm afraid of...

105
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,110
I'm afraid of losing you.

it's great to be alive.

111

Liang Mu Ze, I want to sing a song.

113
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,970
But what if I sing out of tune?

114
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,280

What's the time now?

120
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,370
He keeps asking the time.

121
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,250
We predict that

122
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,250
he might have a deal with Old Master

123
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,180
on when and how they make the drop.

124
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,790
Have anyone contacted him from

125
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,170
last night until now?

126
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,170
No.

127
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,330
But at the scene where we arrested him,

128
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,810
he was logging in to the City of Desire

129
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,410
and had posted on the forum.

130
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,870
What was the content?

131
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,700
"I've got the stuff,"

132
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,060
"waiting for the wind."

133
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,900
The stuff he meant

134
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:54,570
might be the information he
wants to get or the related clues.

135
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,650
What did he mean by

136
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,450
"waiting for the wind"?

137
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,600
Old Master.

138
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,730
Zhuo Ran succeeded.

139
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,290
But

140
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,630
he asked you to hand his mother

141
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,970
and Tian Yong over to him.

142
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,980
We got news from Dong'an,

143
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,410
It's impossible that he got
the information of the project.

144
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,810
The narrative of "he got the stuff"

145
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,960
must be false.

146
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,450
Why did he lie

147
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,940
to Old Master?

148
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,170
For all I know,

149
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,100
his mother disappeared

150
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,460
with him back then.

151
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,690
I'd asked Xia Chu.

152
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,250
It's true that his mother is not well.

153
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,130
Looks like she's got a heart condition.

154
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,490
I'm thinking if it's possible that

155
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,250
Old Master forces him to work for him

156
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,220
by threatening him with his mother.

157
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,630
The reason why he's refused to

158
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,130
denounce Old Master

159
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,630
is probably because

160
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,380
of his mother's safety.

161
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,050
He wants to wait for the wind.

162
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,370
Just let him wait and

163
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,860
send the video of Tian Yong going
through withdrawal to him.

164
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,890
Let's see who lasts longer.

165
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,330
-Yes.
-Let's go.

166
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,080
This is a video on City of Desire

167
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,340

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,770
had seized last night.

169
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,610
Upon initial analysis,

170
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,020
it's a reply to

171
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,810
Pei Yu's post from Old Master.

172
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,840
But it remains unclear

173
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,850
why they filmed Tian Yong.

174
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,610
Based on the image detail capturing

175
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,930
and the manor's floor plan provided

176
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,610
by the local police,

177
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,770
we guess

178
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,750
Tian Yong might be detained in the

179
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,170
basement of the manor

180
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,030
and it's possible

181
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,090
that he's been injected with drugs.

182
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,960
Commander Dong,

183
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,710
listen to me.

184
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,840
We've reported the current situation

185
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,140
to our superiors and

186
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,550
we've intensified the
interrogation of the accomplices.

187
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,330
After we get the statements,

188
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,930
the orders from the superiors

189
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,810
and set up cooperation
with Willick's police,

190
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,090
we'll conduct the

191
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,380
extraction immediately.

192
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,380
I'll apply to my superiors
for joint operations too.

193
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,870
This is a debt

194
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,930
they can't ever repay.

195
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,339
This is

196
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,780
Tian Yong?

197
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,569
What's wrong with him?

198
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,260
He's being controlled
by the drug dealers.

199
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,870
Brigade Commander sent me this video.

200
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,620
The drug dealers drugged him.

201
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,020
Then

202
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,140
what now?

203
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,000
Waiting for the notice of the superiors.

204
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,990
Waiting for the notice of the superiors.

205
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,370
I can't do a thing!

206
00:17:59,030 --> 00:17:59,980
Liang Mu Ze.

207
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,060
Calm down.

208
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,530
Morse code?

209
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,610
I'm wondering

210
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,770
if we should have some

211
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,350
unexpected

212
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,260
methods for communication.

213
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,690
You know, just in case

214
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,420
-you're taken captive someday.
-Get lost.

215
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,560
Why aren't you the one taken captive?

216
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,680
Okay.

217
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,270
Okay.

218
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,490
I understand.

219
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,750
Xiao Qiang,

220
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,520
-contact the expert on telegraph now.
-Yes.

221
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,820
Play it again.

222
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,450
Slow down.

223
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,710
What did he mean?

224
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,230
Three Hundred Tang poems.

225
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,660
Rao Zhi, is the message

226
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,350
related to the Three Hundred Tang poems?

227
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,570
Three Hundred Tang poems.

228
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,650
Tian Yong is back!

229
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,420
What are you doing?
Tian Yong gave me this.

230
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,010
It's going to save Tian Yong's life.

231
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,540
Rao Zhi,

232
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,610
I found the clue that
Tian Yong left in the book.

233
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,570
These might be the
username and password.

234
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,880
Try typing them in.

235
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,770
I got the evidence.

236
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,250
Old Master's records.

237
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,020
He got the evidence.

238
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,610
Old Master,

239
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,650
Tian Yong is dying.

240
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,570
Any word from Zhuo Ran?

241
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,640
No.

242
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,030
Tell him

243
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,670
I'll kill every single one

244
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,670
he wished to protect

245
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,050
when the time comes.

246
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,280
Yes.

247
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,500
You have to go.

248
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,370
No one can cover you.

249
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,060
You sure?

250
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,890
Yes.

251
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,530
They're coming for you.

252
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,090
Understood.

253
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,270
How is it?

254
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,020
It has been decoded.

255
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,560
That's great.

256
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,750
Xia Chu, I'll park my
car at the hospital.

257
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,050
You drive it home after work.

258
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,760
What about you?

259
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,010
I need to return to the unit.

260
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,770
So soon?

261
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,730
You're still recovering.

262
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,050
You have a mission?

263
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,580
Time is running out, Xia Chu.

264
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,840
Just go.

265
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,640
I'll wait for you.

266
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,370
Once again,

267
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,810
I lost track of Liang Mu Ze.

268
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,790
Just like every parting before,

269
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,580
I don't know where he was headed,

270
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,320
and I don't know when

271
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,710
we will meet again.

272
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,130
I don't even have
energy left to feel sad.

273
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,840
While he's fighting for his comrades,

274
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,720
I'm fighting my own battles as well.

275
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,230
The border between China and Willick

276
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,660
How is it going?

277
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,830
When we arrived,

278
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,490
Old Master had already run away.

279
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,660
Lieutenant!

280
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,530
Who did this?

281
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,260
Xiao Teng!

282
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,670
Tell me who did this!

283
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,980
Who did this?

284
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,950
Calm down!

285
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,450
I'd kill him myself

286
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,570
if I know who did this!

287
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,010
Lieutenant!

288
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,650
Willick's police said

289
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,280
Old Master was gone

290
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,050
when they arrived.

291
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,320
What do you think about

292
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,460
this treatment programme?

293
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,450
Sir.

294
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,840
There are two seriously wounded in
the Emergency Department.

295
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,270
We found a tumour on
the heart of one of them.

296
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,550
We need to you check on her.

297
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,510
Xia Chu!

298
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,490
Xia Chu.

299
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,750
Xia Chu!

300
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,970
Patient, Zhuo Mei Qin.

301
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,540
Her electrocardiogram shows

302
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,770
sinus rhythm,

303
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,390
ST-segment elevation

304
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,840
on V4 to V6 leads.

305
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,190
Class II to III on classification
of cardiac functional.

306
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,420
Combining with CT scan,
we found that she has

307
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,140
enlarged heart with
left ventricular aneurysm.

308
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,480
Have you had any treatment before?

309
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,220
Son.

310
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,760
I want to see my son.

311
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,820
Who is her son?

312
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,060
Is he here?

313
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,610
We haven't seen him.

314
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,330
Her son is Zhuo Ran.

315
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,030
Rao Zhi,

316
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,110
am I supposed to tell you

317
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,150
about Zhuo Mei Qin's condition?

318
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:29,790
Yes.

319
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,810
How is she?

320
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,750
The patient

321
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,020
has been diagnosed with

322
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,130
brain death.

323
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,590
What do you mean?

324
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,580
She is currently under
precarious conditions.

325
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,250
The initial diagnosis
might be ischemic cardiomyopathy.

326
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,590
It's the most serious stage

327
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,940
of coronary heart disease.

328
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,750
And she has old myocardial infarction

329
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,580
with left ventricular aneurysm.

330
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,230
She may die anytime.

331
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,790
We've used every

332
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,130
resuscitation methods

333
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,490
we have on him.

334
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,700
But he was

335
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,210
in shock for too long,

336
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,450
so his

337
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,840
advanced neural center

338
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,530
is gradually dying.

339
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,690
Next,

340
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,850
his brain stem function

341
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,170
is going to waste away

342
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,430
until irreversible termination

343
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,400
appears.

344
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,600
There's only one way now.

345
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,170
Heart transplantation.

346
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,080
Heart transplant?

347
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,990
She wants to see her son.

348
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,150
So it's

349
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,290
meaningless to

350
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,670
keep reviving him,

351
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,490
it would only make him suffer.

352
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,210
You need to decide as soon as possible.

353
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,710
I...

354
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,850
I need to ask my leader.

355
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,300
Is there no other way?

356
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,080
Does Tian Yong

357
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,280
have someone he wishes to see

358
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,060
or

359
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,860
does he have an unfulfilled wish?

360
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,100
Mu Ze.

361
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,060
Mu Ze, what's wrong?

362
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,170
Who is that?

363
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,010
Tian Yong.

364
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,800
What's wrong with him?

365
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:49,920
Go in and take a look.

366
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,620
Where are you taking me?

367
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,890
To the hospital

368
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,510
to see your mother.

369
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,530
Tian Yong.

370
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,690
Tian Yong.

371
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,310
His heart is beating.

372
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,930
He is currently on life support.

373
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,010
Then just keep supporting him!

00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,060
Get up.

380
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,670
I'll read you poetry.

381
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,940
I've finished memorizing
three hundred Tang poems

382
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,330
by using the method you taught me.

383
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,630
I memorize one poem each time

384
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,840
the sand in the
hourglass finish flowing.

385
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,210
The time really does pass quickly.

386
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,690
Guess what.

387
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,610
I like Bai Ju Yi the most.

388
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,420
His poems are very simple.

389
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,610
Even I can understand what he wrote.

390
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,430
What about you?

391
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,290
Who do you like the most?

392
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,850
I guess it must be Li Bai.

393
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,540
You are both passionate and sincere.

394
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,909
You're the reason I'm able to know

395
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,780
this many poets.

396
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:18,270
You must be joking with me,

397
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,889
right?

398
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:34,900
Mu Ze,

399
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,449
did I do something wrong?

400
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,050
It shouldn't be.

401
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,670
I did as you said.

402
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,810
I've been staying in the military camp!

403
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,820
Why is he still lying here?

404
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:05,860
♪The embrace I long for♪

405

00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,140
Currently, there has no

409
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,780
beds in the Cardiac Surgery ICU.

410
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,820
So we put the patient in here

411
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,790
to closely

412
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,340
monitor her condition.

413
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,810
Dad.

414
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,660
How could he be like this?

415
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,400
He didn't even say goodbye!

416
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,050
It's okay.

417
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,660
It's okay.

418
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,550
Dr Xia,

419
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,700
please get him changed.

420
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,730
Okay.

421
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,620
Follow me.

422
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,430
Mu Ze,

423
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,190
I'll take Xiao Xue outside.

424
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,590
Let's go.

425
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,790
What did he

426
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,940
experience along the way?

427
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,490
I don't dare to think about it.

428
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,920
Then stop thinking.

429
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,520
I'd rather you know nothing.

430
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,780
I can't do it, Dad.

431
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,900
I can't do it anymore.

432
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,180
You're lucky, Captain Liang.

433
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,500
The one lying in there

434
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,700
is not so lucky.

435
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:17,370
Liang Mu Ze!

436
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,600
Liang Mu Ze!

437
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,330
I'm warning you.

438
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,600
Don't mess with my man

439
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,880
if you want to save your mother!

440
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,260
Sun Xiao Mo.

441
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,470
Are you all right?

442
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,740
Pull yourself together!

443
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,520
He deliberately provoked you

444
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,650
just to see you lose control.

445
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,360
It's a liberation for him

446
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,100
if you beat him to death.

447
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,560
Is it worth to commit a crime for

448
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,650
that kind of person?

449
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,320
I'm going back to the department.

450
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,380
Liang Mu Ze.

451
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,270
Just cry it out

452
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,580
if you're sad.

453
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,410
What does death feel like?

454
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,750
Does it hurt?

455
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,830
Or does it feel cold?

456
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,940
It's like

457
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,140
being sent off by the
people in the world

458
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,240
and picked up by the heavens.

459
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,350
It's a problem that

460
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:01,970
everyone of us has to face.

461
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,040
We've got to face it.

462
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:06,430
Just that we are

463
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,710
destined to face more of it

464
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,010
and be influenced by it

465
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,410
than others.

466
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,630
