1
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,770
=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 39=

3
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,600
From the x-ray,

4
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,016
the bypass inserted into her heart

5
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,175
through the coronary artery bypass graft

6
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,576
is blocked again.

7
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,880
Her cardiac function is weak.

8
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,256
The ventricular wall is thin.

9
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,160
It may rupture at any time.

10
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:47,099
Heart transplant

11
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,650
is her only...

12
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,880
and last resort.

13
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,360
(Forgo treatment)

14
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,390
The donor is Tian Yong.

15
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,960
The available organs include

16
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,960
heart, lungs,

17
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,840
and two corneas.

18
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,240
As for the liver and kidneys,

19
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,640
as he's been injected with Dr.ugs
when he's alive,

20
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,930
it's led to

21
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,480
varying degrees of damage.

22
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,240
The other organs

23
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,770
have been

24
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,120
assigned to

25
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,440
the matching recipients.

26
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,420
Now,

27
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,120
the main issue is

28
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,840
the recipient of the heart.

29
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,520
The registered patients

30
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,136
waiting for heart implants

31
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,440
total seven people.

32
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,616
The most critical patient

33
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,760
is Zhuo Mei Qin who was admitted
on the day before yesterday.

34
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,456
However, based on
the information provided by the police,

35
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,495
she's the mother

36
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:12,456
of the suspect known as Pei Yu.

37
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,480
The latter

38
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,120
was one of the accomplices in the gang

39
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,016
which Tian Yong worked
as an undercover agent in.

40
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,800
Her son committed a crime.

41
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,200
It's nothing to do with the mother.

42
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,536
The police

43
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,770
want us to try our best
to cure his mother.

44
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,560
Organ donation is one thing,

45
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,016
donating the organ
to the mother of a criminal

46
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,376
is another thing.

47
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,456
To Tian Yong and his family,

48
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,560
it's too cruel.

49
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,040
He doesn't have a family.

50
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,656
I think everyone should be rational

51
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,840
when we deal with the issue.

52
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,130
Zhuo Mei Qin is a patient.

53
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,840
I'm her doctor.

54
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,210
I want to save her.

55
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,970
It's as simple as that.

56
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,140
Let's vote.

57
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,290
Those who are in favor

58
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,880
with the heart implant surgery,

59
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,520
please raise your hand.

60
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,600
Dr. Zhang.

61
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,880
I'll serve as an external assistant today.

62
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,260
All the best.

63
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,320
Salute!

64
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,560
Let's pay tribute to Tian Yong.

65
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,200
Get ready to open the chest.
Pass me the scalpel.

66
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,146
First and second assistants,

67
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,110
get ready to hold retractors.

68
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,760
Get ready for the surgery.

69
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,890
Yes.

70
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,120
Do you know

71
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,440
who

72
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,320
will be receiving his heart?

73
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,080
I have no idea.

74
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,840
However, it must be someone
who is in dire need of his heart.

75
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,960
Someone needs his heart.

76
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,920
That's great.

77
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,450
However, he's gone.

78
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,666
In this world,

79
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,880
I can never find anyone else like him.

80
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,360
Be careful, pass it to
Dr. Chen as soon as possible.

81
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,200
Get ready for the heart transplant.

82
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,776
Officer Rao.

83
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,416
We found this

84
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,880
in Tian Yong's body.

85
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,000
We assume
it's something you're looking for.

86
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,920
The surgery has ended.

87
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,320
Thank you for the hard work.

88
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,320
It's been eight hours.

89
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,400
Thank you for the hard work.

90
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,736
Thank you for coming

91
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,920
to show us support.

92
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,440
That's my duty.

93
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,040
You've worked hard.

94
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,600
A lot of knives see blood

95
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,520
when they're used to murder a person.

96
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,640
However, only the scalpel

97
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,880
sees blood when it saves people.

98
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,346
Hi.

99
00:15:41,862 --> 00:15:42,807
Hi.

100
00:15:44,307 --> 00:15:45,003
Hi.

101
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,840
Why do you come to the hospital?

102
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,400
Are you not feeling well?

103
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,500
No.

104
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,520
We're here to send Tian Yong off.

105
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,660
In that case,

106
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,240
where are you going?

107
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,520
Xiao Jun wants to pay Xia Chu a visit.

108
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,070
Okay.

109
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,880
Go ahead.

110
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,576
Well...

111
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,690
Xiao Jun.

112
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,080
You must be hungry, right?

113
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,080
I saw Xia Chu just now.

114
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,176
She's still busy at work.

115
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,640
I think it'll take a long time.

116
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,690
Why don't we find a place

117
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,200
for some food?

118
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,500
Mum.

119
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,480
I'm hungry.

120
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,320
This is the restaurant.

121
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,816
After entering the restaurant,

122
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,079
you guys may get a table first.

123
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,140
Okay.

124
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:03,839
Let me know what you'd like to eat.

125
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,220
I'll get the food.

126
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,306
Let me do it.

127
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,839
You have no idea what I like.

128
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,140
Let's go.

129
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,680
-Let's sit here.
-Sure.

130
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,400
Xiao Jun has grown taller.

131
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,546
Yes.

132
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,240
Kids grow really fast.

133
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,480
I heard from Xia Chu that

134
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,160
you're going to Beijing soon.

135
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,576
The first Dr.aft of my script
has been approved.

136
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,536
I enjoy working with

137
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,160
the company too.

138
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,096
Coincidentally,

139
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,576
a classmate of mine

140
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,850
went to the company.

141
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,920
He's in charge of production.

142
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,506
He wants to take me in.

143
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,520
I think

144
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,080
I can give it a try.

145
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,440
What about your bookstore?

146
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,120
My parents have just retired.

147
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,610
I'll leave the bookstore to them

148
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,120
so that they have something to do.

149
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,600
Will Xiao Jun go along?

150
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,180
Yes.

151
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,610
I've found a boarding school for him.

152
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,200
It's great.

153
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,296
As a script writer,

154
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,530
you'll get more opportunities in Beijing.

155
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,680
Yes.

156
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,720
How about you?

157
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,920
Are you all right?

158
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,506
I mean is your body all right?

159
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,600
I'm all right.

160
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,560
Well,

161
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,120
I won't die any sooner.

162
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,536
I met Dr. Zhang today.

163
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,656
Which Dr. Zhang?

164
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,496
Dr. Zhang Yi Chi

165
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,840
who was initially a heart surgeon.

166
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,920
You mean the one
who contracted Hepatitis B, right?

167
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,960
That's a shame.

168
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,136
I think

169
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,520
he's not as handsome as before.

170
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,880
How about his former girlfriend?

171
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,240
Which girlfriend?

172
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,136
Who else?

173
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,800
I only know Li Juan.

174
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,656
Isn't their relationship

175
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,490
going on and off for a few years?

176
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,976
Then, a married lady with a son

177
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,480
ruined their relationship.

178
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,200
Are you serious?

179
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,986
Let me tell you.

180
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,506
I was under the impression
that they broke up

181
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,840
because Dr. Li went abroad.

182
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,176
It's true.

183
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,536
For a short period of time,

184
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,320
that lady went to the Department
of Cardiothoracic Surgery very frequently.

185
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,016
She claimed that
the son was getting treatment

186
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,920
but she was actually
going after Dr. Zhang.

187
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,536
Later, when she found out Dr. Zhang

188
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,920
contracted Hepatitis B,

189
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,720
she left immediately.

190
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,696
She's so materialistic.

191
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,850
No wonder Dr. Li resigned.

192
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,616
If I were her,

193
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,760
I would leave too.

194
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,960
I think

195
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,690
it's not about falling out of love.

196
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,856
It's absolutely

197
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,600
a humiliation.

198
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,280
I'm sorry.

199
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,480
Sorry to interrupt.

200
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,760
I'm Zhang Yi Chi.

201
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,480
I heard your conversation.

202
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,140
It seems that

203
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,210
all of you are quite concerned
with my love life.

204
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,560
Dr. Zhang.

205
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,240
We...

206
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,840
You have nothing better to do.

207
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,840
If...

208
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,520
your work life is going well

209
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,370
and your love life

210
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,856
is going smoothly,

211
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,200
I'll forget about it.

212
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,160
However, if your own life is a mess,

213
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,320
then please

214
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,496
don't pry into

215
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,000
other people's private lives, okay?

216
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,176
All of you are just my former colleagues.

217
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,346
You're not my mum!

218
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,800
Why are you worried for me?

219
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,320
Xiao Jun.

220
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,660
Here.

221
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,440
You're right.

222
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,360
No doubt she is

223
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,600
married.

224
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,080
Furthermore,

225
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,200
she has a son.

226
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,320
Her lover sacrificed eight years ago.

227
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,320
He's a martyr.

228
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,720
Listen.

229
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,760
It's because of
the sacrifices made by the martyrs,

230
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,360
we get to

231
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,360
live in peace.

232
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,226
That's why you have the privilege

233
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,426
to sit here

234
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,120
and gossip about others.

235
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,640
Compared to those martyrs,

236
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,640
I am nothing.

237
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:55,880
You're

238
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,560
even worse than nothing.

239
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,400
Keep your nose
out of someone else's business!

240
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,240
Let's go, Xiao Jun.

241
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,840
No, I haven't eaten.

242
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,440
I'll buy you a feast.

243
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,370
Xiao Jun, let's go.

244
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,400
Are you not going to wait for Xia Chu?

245
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,970
Send me a text message

246
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,200
when you reach home.

247
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,960
Okay.

248
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,320
Can I ask you a question?

249
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,160
What is it?

250
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,520
Why Dr. Li and you

251
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,080
didn't get together in the end?

252
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,040
How should I put it?

253
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,760
Perhaps both of us

254
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,280
thought that we were too smart.

255
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,440
We thought too much.

256
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,050
We were too cautious.

257
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,250
We were afraid of getting hurt.

258
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,360
We were afraid it might not work out.

259
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,520
And so,

260
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,970
it didn't work out.

261
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,240
I'm not afraid.

262
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,816
Our flight

263
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,760
is next Friday, at 3 p.m.

264
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,090
Have a safe journey.

265
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,360
Sure.

266
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,440
Come here.

267
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,440
Listen.

268
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,960
You're a man.

269
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,280
You should know what you should do.

270
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,770
(Outpatient Department)

271
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,210
Thank you.

272
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,770
Who received Tian Yong's heart?

273
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,776
You're still here.

274
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,200
I've just completed the procedure.

275
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,840
When the military truck is here,

276
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,880
we'll send him back.

277
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,640
Will there be a memorial service?

278
00:25:51,435 --> 00:25:52,695
The organisation is making
arrangements.

279
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,520
Where will he be buried?

280
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,170
The Martyrs' Cemetery.

281
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,400
He will be Luo Liang's neighbour.

282
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,040
You haven't answered my question.

283
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,320
I'm sorry.

284
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,040
I can't answer the question.

285
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,650
Organ donation

286
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,800
has to be carried out
in strict confidence.

287
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,376
The identity
of the donor and the recipient

288
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,320
should not be revealed.

289
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,240
Is it Zhuo Mei Qin?

290
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,736
I saw both of them

291
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,360
go into the theatre together.

292
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,720
All I can say is,

293
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,290
today's the first time

294
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,520
I feel upset

295
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,890
over a successful surgery.

296
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,320
You've worked hard, Dr. Xia.

297
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,586
(We have mastered)

298
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,440
(the evidence of Lu Wen
Long's criminal activities.)

299
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,200
(There's nothing much you can say.)

300
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,080
If you insist on keeping quiet,

301
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,210
then you'll lose the chance.

302
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,360
How is my mum doing?

303
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,560
The surgery was a success.

304
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,786
A week later,

305
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,290
she will be discharged from the ICU.

306
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,240
How did you ascertain my identity?

307
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,440
We found out through
the clips from the TV station.

308
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,800
Later, when you barged
into the Dr.ill site,

309
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,560
a foreign military officer recognized you.

310
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,810
According to him,

311
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,520
when Pei Yu
served as a foreign military officer,

312
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,320
he had a heart attack
for unknown reasons.

313
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,420
It's such a coincidence.

314
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:09,936
When you came back

315
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,016
in Zhuo Ran's name,

316
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,600
you had a heart attack too.

317
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,656
Then, we obtained a report

318
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,760
from the hospital where Pei Yu was born.

319
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,096
We found that one of the pregnant ladies

320
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,360
was Zhuo Mei Qin.

321
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,400
She gave birth to a pair of twins.

322
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,200
Initially, we suspected

323
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,800
you're the twin brother

324
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,136
of the deceased, Pei Yu.

325
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,360
Later,

326
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,680
when we searched through
the basement of your company,

327
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,176
we found that the password to the door

328
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,400
was set as

329
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,400
910218.

330
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,320
That's Pei Yu's birth date.

331
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,456
Compared to Zhuo Ran

332
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,280
who was born at midnight
on February 29,

333
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,880
he was born three minutes earlier.

334
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,000
You can pretend all you want

335
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,546
but your subconscious

336
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,960
has betrayed yourself.

337
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,560
Hence, we assume that

338
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,616
in the crossfire
which happened eight years ago,

339
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,856
Zhuo Ran died

340
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,330
but you survived.

341
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,480
Pei Yu.

342
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,496
(I have told you everything)

343
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,880
(that you want to know.)

344
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,850
Now let me ask you a question.

345
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,440
You are the founder of City of Desire,

346
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,800
Scary Pirate.

347
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,240
Am I right?

348
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,040
Yes.

349
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,960
Why did you build the platform?

350
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,160
It's due to loneliness.

351
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,960
Loneliness?

352
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,890
It's unfair.

353
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,280
(I am the only person in the dark.)

354
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,392
(I'm Dr. Owning.)

355
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,016
The order in the world

356
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,040
ought to be changed.

357
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,680
The Internet

358
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,920
is a fascinating soul.

359
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,880
However, inherent to it

360
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,840
is an ugly flaw.

361
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,136
I'm the person who found the flaw

362
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,160
and made good use of it.

363
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,840
If everyone is a criminal,

364
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,160
then committing crime

365
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,240
is not a lonely journey.

366
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,920
Just like you.

367
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,800
You eliminate sins

368
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,810
to get recognition.

369
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,336
However, once the recognition

370
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,240
ceases to exist,

371
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,880
you will become depraved too.

372
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,440
Becoming depraved together

373
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,920
is a wonderful experience.

374
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,666
Wonderful?

375
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,880
Yes.

376
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,360
Those people who died in the suicide game

377
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,770
must be

378
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,290
really thankful to me.

379
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,616
Turns out this is

380
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,360
how you hypnotise yourself.

381
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,666
I can tell you without hesitation.

382
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,080
To me,

383
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,840
I'm not eliminating sins
to get recognition.

384
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,200
I'm doing it for my wife and daughter.

385
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,776
Even though everyone is against the idea,

386
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,520
even though they don't understand it,

387
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,760
I'll still do the same.

388
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,720
That's because I'm a husband

389
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,256
and a father.

390
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,456
I want them

391
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,656
to live a safe and peaceful life

392
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,960
under the sun.

393
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,320
Even if everyone commits crime,
it doesn't mean you have to do it.

394
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,080
It also doesn't mean that
I will tolerate criminals.

395
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,056
For a scum like you,

396
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,040
I'll arrest you every time I see you.

397
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,680
I won't let go of you.

398
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,840
I'm a scum.

399
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,920
(Have you ever thought about it?)

400
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,336
(One day soon,)

401
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,850
(when your mother wakes up)

402
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,880
(and finds out about the things
that you have done,)

403
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,440
(how would she feel?)

404
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:08,976
You...

405
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,010
Don't agitate her.

406
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,280
Then tell me Lu Wen Long's whereabouts.

407
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,560
I'm not sure of that.

408
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,240
However, I know that

409
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,856
he has a hiding spot in the country.

410
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,960
Where is it?

411
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,770
I can bring you there.

412
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,010
Whale.

413
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,960
The target is approaching the port.

414
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,159
Got it. We're ready.

415
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,400
I don't believe that
he would work with us.

416
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,000
Boss is waiting for you.

417
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,980
Old Master.

418
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,300
I'm here.

419
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,456
What took you so long

420
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,080
since you have obtained the information?

421
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,480
I need to shake off the Chinese armed
forces who have been following me.

422
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,220
Have you done that?

423
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,650
I found a scapegoat.

424
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,960
Where is the thing?

425
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,690
How is my mum doing?

426
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,880
She's doing well.

427
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,210
She's waiting for you to go home.

428
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,200
Hu.

429
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,680
Don't do that.

430
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,816
I thought

431
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,760
you wouldn't give me the chance.

432
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,050
Am I so not reasonable?

433
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,656
As long as you listen to me...

434
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,280
I've always been obedient.

435
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,800
Let me do it.

436
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,640
After my dad died,

437
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,336
I've been treating you

438
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,160
as my spiritual father.

439
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,816
I risked my life for you.

440
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,210
I killed for you.

441
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,496
The list goes on.

442
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,000
I did everything

443
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,120
hoping to live a stable life in exchange.

444
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,880
I want my mum to live well.

445
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,160
The signal is gone.

446
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,376
Something is wrong.

447
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,696
They must have found out about us.

448
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,000
That's why they block the signal.

449
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,056
Attention!

450
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,010
Move!

451
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,120
I've been so careful.

452
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,480
I've been staying low to the ground.

453
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,440
I'm worse than a dog.

454
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,600
However, it's not enough for you.

455
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,800
You hope that I can be like my father

456
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,880
who died without a resting place.

457
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,680
Am I right?

458
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,400
I've told you many times.

459
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,800
Your father

460
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,976
was killed by the Chinese armed forces.

461
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,680
When the accident happened,

462
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,720
to be honest, I was very upset.

463
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,960
However,
the Chinese armed forces told me that

464
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,200
the person who shot my dad to death

465
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,560
was you.

466
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,210
The Chinese armed forces?

467
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,640
They told you that?

468
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,720
Why?

469
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,280
What do you think?

470
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,000
It's to instigate me for sure.

471
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,930
You're already surrounded by them.

472
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,980
Old Master.

473
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,680
You must be crazy.

474
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,090
If you kill me,

475
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,136
your mum won't live any longer.

476
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,320
Where is my mum?

477
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,440
Tell me!

478
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,656
All this while,

479
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,600
you've been controlling me with my mum.

480
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,616
I've had enough of it!

481
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,970
Let me tell you.

482
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,400
Without me,

483
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,416
you and your mum

484
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,720
would have died a hunDr.ed times!

485
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,496
Just like your scum of a father,

486
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,000
you're not being grateful!

487
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,640
Let me tell you.

488
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,250
All these years,

489
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,360
I treated your father like my own brother.

490
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,576
I brought wealth to him.

491
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,360
I shared prosperity with him.

492
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,360
However, behind my back,

493
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,440
he attempted to steal my goods!

494
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,800
I gave him a chance.

495
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,840
However, he refused to return the goods.

496
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,960
I really...

497
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,560
I really gave him a chance.

498
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,096
He pushed me too hard!

499
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,880
He deserved it!

500
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,800
Let me tell you.

501
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,530
If you kill me,

502
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,776
the Chinese armed forces

503
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,520
will not let you off.

504
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,160
So,

505
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,440
it's true that you killed my dad.

506
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,120
Zhuo Ran.

507
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,170
I'm getting old.

508
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,040
You're the only person who I can trust.

509
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,440
You're overly ambitious

510
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,656
but you've never let me down

511
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,240
in any way.

512
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,690
Am I right?

513
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,600
I've decided.

514
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,360
If we ever escape,

515
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,200
I'll pass everything to you.

516
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,720
Okay?

517
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,800
All mine?

518
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,320
Yes.
