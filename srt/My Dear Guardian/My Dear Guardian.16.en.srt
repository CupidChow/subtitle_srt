3
00:01:36,077 --> 00:01:37,517
Madam suddenly fainted this morning.

4
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:39,219
Teacher insists to hurry back to Dong'an.

5
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,019
I had no choice but to call you.

6
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,990
Tang Lin, is the car ready?

7
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:44,426
Professor Xia.

8
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,165
-It's ready.
-Let's get going.

9
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,480
Yes, right away.

10
00:01:48,232 --> 00:01:50,160
Professor Xia,
are you going back to Dong'an tonight?

11
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:51,400
It's a family emergency.

12
00:01:51,873 --> 00:01:52,773
What are you waiting for?

13
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:54,646
Professor Xia, don't worry.

14
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:56,920
I have a way to get you home
quicker and safer.

15
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:58,895
Get me home quicker?

16
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:00,046
Leave it to me.

17
00:02:21,383 --> 00:02:23,532
Which do you like to eat,
cherries or grapes?

18
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:10,680
Liang Shao Xue, what are you doing?

19
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:13,771
This is my latest original composition!

20
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:18,280
It's to commemorate my okay!

21
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:21,614
-I can't find him anymore!
-Give it to me.

22
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:24,560
I'll immortalize him in my song!

23
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:31,116
Liang Shao Xue,

24
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:33,919
are you still having jet lag
or did you leave your brain...

25
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,973
behind at the other side of the Pacific?

26
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:37,159
Believe it or not,

27
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,510
with your unearthly screech,

28
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,098
Okay will not be okay
even if he heard you.

29
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,720
Of course I don't believe it!

30
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:43,984
What's wrong with this tone?

31
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,680
My brother likes it so much.

32
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:47,200
I even made him an album.

33
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:49,560
He listens to it in the car everyday!

34
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:53,522
Play a song.
Whose songs are your favourite?

35
00:03:53,563 --> 00:03:54,813
Mandarin or English?

36
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:02,455
This...

37
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:04,157
Who sang this?

38
00:04:04,198 --> 00:04:05,778
You have some heavy tastes.

39
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:12,800
So it was you.

40
00:04:28,823 --> 00:04:29,960
Liang Shao Xue!

41
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:32,397
I can't do this anymore.

42
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,440
Answer the phone, Liang Mu Ze!

43
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:15,120
I was busy, what's wrong?

44
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:17,640
Why is it so noisy?

45
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,360
Hang on!

46
00:05:25,313 --> 00:05:27,112
Liang Mu Ze, what are you doing?

47
00:05:27,153 --> 00:05:28,760
Why did you tell Xue that...

48
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:43,804
Xia Chu,

49
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:46,517
what's wrong with Xue?

50
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:50,387
Nothing.

51
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:53,211
It's just the music she plays...

52
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,165
I understand.

53
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:57,283
I'll call her later.

54
00:05:58,064 --> 00:05:59,160
Anything else?

55
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:01,040
The...

56
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:06,040
Did you put the cherries
on the balcony?

57
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:07,800
Yes.

58
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:11,833
I went to visit Xiao Jun and stopped by.

59
00:06:12,643 --> 00:06:13,680
Are they doing well?

60
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:14,872
They're great.

61
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:16,863
They'll be at the unit on New Year's Day.

62
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:18,080
I'll go too.

63
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,236
Our hospital organized a medical team...

64
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:22,657
to provide medical
examination for you guys.

65
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:25,223
Okay, then.

66
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,009
I'll see you there.

67
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:28,322

It's old weakness.

00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:24,643
Luckily, I have Yue Hua
to keep me company.

00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:30,492
-Thank you.
-You're welcome, Professor Xia.

00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,326
We've been neighbours for years.

100
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:35,483
I was thinking to accompany her
for the night if you didn't come back.

101
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:36,733
How could I not come back?

102
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:38,320
I'll come back for sure.

103
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:39,813
Then you accompany Zi Yu.

104
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:40,840
I'll leave first.

Madam, how do you feel?

109
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:55,040
Aunty.

110
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:01,518
Didn't you say there's
no flight ticket left?

111
00:10:02,573 --> 00:10:03,760
How did you get back?

112
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:07,840
We didn't get to buy the tickets.

113
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:11,680
He sent me back with his company's
private plane.

114
00:10:15,562 --> 00:10:17,112
Sorry to trouble you.

115
00:10:17,153 --> 00:10:19,413
It's nothing as long as you're fine.

116
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:24,063
Zhuo Ran, let's have a seat and rest.

117
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:26,523
You've worked hard along the way.

118
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:28,560
It's fine, I have to rush back.

119
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:29,640
I have meeting tomorrow morning.

120
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:32,301
I'll come and visit you
after getting this done.

121
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:33,242
Get some rest.

122
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:35,229
Okay.

123
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:36,723
Tang Lin, send him off for me.

124
00:10:36,764 --> 00:10:38,000
Send him off.

125
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:39,920
-Aunt, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

126
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:53,640
Mr. Zhuo, we must still be
on our way if it wasn't you.

127
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:55,160
Thank you.

128
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:57,443
Xia Chu is my former classmate.

129
00:10:57,484 --> 00:10:59,892
It's the least I can do.

130
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:00,953
I think...

131
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,174
it's more than just a former classmate.

132
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:07,733
Teacher even asked
me how I feel about you.

133
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:10,780
I answered him right away
that you're a young talent.

134
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:12,231
-I'm flattered.
-It's true.

135
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:13,903
If I've got what you have,

136
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:15,232
I'll go to the United States
by my private plane...

137
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:17,080
and propose to my girlfriend right away.

138
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,481
But your strategy is correct too.

139
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:20,840
Get the hardest part done first.

140
00:11:21,753 --> 00:11:22,903
Your girlfriend is in the United State?

141
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:23,794
Yes.

142
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:26,109
We've been in a long-distance
relationship for years.

143
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,800
I wonder how long it can last.

144
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:32,760
Are you Mr. Zhuo?

145
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:34,680
This is my ride.

146
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:36,070
I'll drop you off first.

147
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:37,992
Never mind, it's not convenient.

148
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:39,360
-Let's go together.
-No.

149
00:11:39,723 --> 00:11:41,463
-You sit here.
-Okay.

150
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:49,333
Xia,

151
00:11:50,307 --> 00:11:53,293
is the private plane huge?

152
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:54,760
How is it like on the inside?

153
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,856
I didn't pay attention to it.

154
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:00,393
All I thought about was you.

155
00:12:06,263 --> 00:12:07,680
Look at you.

156
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:11,122
You were the one who kicked him out.

157
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,143
And now you're the one
who got on his plane.

158
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:15,308
I don't know what's on your mind.

159
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:17,230
What do you mean?

160
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:18,160
Don't play dumb.

161
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:21,800
Do you think he's here to
send an old man like you back?

162
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:29,209
Things like private planes and
private yachts...

163
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,150
can only appear in a soap opera.

164
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,550
He's here for your daughter.

165
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:39,398
I'm fine with that if he can really
handle that girl.

166
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:42,255
You don't oppose them?

167
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,720
Why would I oppose them?

168
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:47,979
Didn't he break your daughter's heart?

169
00:12:48,743 --> 00:12:50,920
Didn't you always complain that
I broke your heart?

170
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,096
They were just chipping away
when they were at school.

171
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:03,285
People will grow up,

172
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:04,480
especially a man.

173
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:07,035
The point is how they get along.

174
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:09,192
Anyway,

175
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:11,400
as long as it's not the soldier guy.

176
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:12,440
Who is that soldier guy?

177
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:16,963
You don't have to worry.

178
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,023
Get some sleep.

179
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,960
No, who is that soldier guy?

180
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:24,052
I'll go and do some research.

181
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:25,080
Get some sleep.

182
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,200
Did he mean that guy?

183
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:40,187
The scientific name of parrot
is Blue-eyed Cockatoo.

184
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:42,499
Its common name is
Sulphur-crested Cockatoo.

185
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:44,640
And it's called
Australian White Chicken too.

186
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:49,482
It's a rare species
but it has average language skills.

187
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,840
It even speaks English!

188
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,520
Seems like its gene is mutated.

189
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:00,480
Do you know
what the mark on its foot means?

190
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:03,840
It probably belongs to an institution.

191
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,662
I don't know the exact situation too.

192
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,360
I have to look it up.

193
00:14:09,463 --> 00:14:11,400
Then what are you going to do with it?

194
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:13,452
According to the procedure,

195
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:15,193
it would be great if we could
find its original institution.

196
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:16,757
If not,

197
00:14:16,798 --> 00:14:18,378
we'll just find a new institution.

198
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:22,532
But
this little thing is quite fierce...

199
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:24,720
based on my contact with it just now.

200
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:27,760
I didn't succeed in my repeated trials.

201
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:31,320
Seems like that will cause problems
if we forcibly take it away.

202
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:37,283
I feel that
you're getting along with it.

203
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:38,763
Why don't...

204
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:41,680
you take care of it for a few days?

205
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:46,233
I'll take it back after I find its owner.

206
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:47,462
No problem.

207
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:50,283
But can it work
as I don't have the related documents?

208
00:14:51,376 --> 00:14:52,876
It's just temporary.

209
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,900
Look at this little guy,

210
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:56,932
it's energetic and strong.

211
00:14:56,973 --> 00:14:58,740
It might have almost recovered.

212
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:02,132
I'll send you some
matters needing attention when I go back.

213
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:03,360
You just need to follow them.

214
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:06,400
Like the environment,
the food you feed it...

215
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:08,311
and the water supply and so on.

216
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:09,843
Just don't let it fly away.

217
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,573
Okay.

218
00:15:11,614 --> 00:15:12,594
Sorry to bother you.

219
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:14,921
I'm counting on you.

220
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:31,044
Toleration song sings
of numerous tolerances.

221
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:34,026
Being tolerant is the decency
of a great man.

222
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:36,683
Being tolerant is the root of a gentleman.

223
00:15:38,023 --> 00:15:39,762
He could endure the heat of the summer.

224
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:41,320
He could endure the cold of the winter.

225
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:44,623
He could be happy
while enduring the poverty.

226
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:48,108
He could be eternal by enduring life.

227
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:00,713
Hello, can you help me find this bird?
Its name is OK.

228
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:05,873
Hello, can you help me find this bird?
Its name is OK.

229
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:10,062
Hello, can you help
me find this parrot?

230
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,273
Its name is OK.

231
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,343
(Missing pet bird)

232
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:15,793
Hello, can you help me...

233
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,302
Hello,

234
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:22,240
can you help me look for this bird?

235
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,680
Its name is OK.

236
00:16:24,223 --> 00:16:25,733
It is expensive.

237
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:29,686
Help me.

238
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:54,163
Seriously?

239
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:01,680
What are you doing?

240
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:05,427
Can you be more reserved?

241
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,440
Mr. Zhang,

242
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:10,160
I want to ask you a question.

243
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:11,511
What is it?

244
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,360
I heard you laughed until
your jaw joint dislocated...

245
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:15,614
when a young lady from the art troupe...

246
00:17:15,655 --> 00:17:17,520
came to our hospital
for medical check-up.

247
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:18,800
Was that true?

248
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:20,760
It was true.

249
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:23,531
Mr. Zhang, you...

250
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:25,440
Do you still want to operate?

Greetings, Chief!

264
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:27,054
You've worked hard.

265
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,320
You must be tired.

266
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:31,080
Xia Chu, you're here too.

267
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:33,760
Greetings, Chief!

268
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:35,680
I'll watch your performance tonight.

269
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:39,320
Then I can only perform
a live operation for you.

270
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,840
I don't dare to watch that.

271
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:43,240
Dr. Zhang, do you
want to rest for a while?

272
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:44,702
We slept along the way, it's fine.

273
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:46,193
Let's start the work.

274
00:18:46,717 --> 00:18:48,760
How about this?
Notify Liang Mu Ze...

275
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:50,560
-and ask Team Thunder over to help.
-Yes.

276
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:53,160
Hurry up and get prepared!

277
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:54,151
Yes!

278
00:18:54,838 --> 00:18:55,679
This way.

279
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,740
March!

280
00:19:01,982 --> 00:19:03,821
Girl, what are you doing?

281
00:19:03,862 --> 00:19:04,972
I'm in the unit.

282
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:06,516
You're still working
on New Year's Day?

283
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:10,000
You should ask me which day
I'm off in a year.

284
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:14,941
Dr. Xia, you live a busy life every day.

285
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:15,862
You just get a little monthly wage.

286
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:17,083
What's in it for you?

287
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:22,243
Perhaps I was out of my mind
when I filled the application forms.

288
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,680
Indeed, you were.

289
00:19:25,387 --> 00:19:26,252
How about you?

290
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:28,200
Where are you hanging out
on New Year's Day?

291
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:29,981
What do you mean hang out?

292
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:33,812
Didn't I tell you that I had done
an episode on left-behind children?

293
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:35,240
I'm going to visit them today.

294
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:38,062
I was thinking to take you with me,

295
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:39,062
if you have nothing to do...

296
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:41,083
and provide them
medical check-up for free.

297
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,103
But you're on a business trip,
so forget it.

298
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:44,760
Maybe next time.

299
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:46,782
You have to tell me
in advance next time.

300
00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:48,243
So that I can free up time for it.

301
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:52,145
Also, the flu is getting
serious in this season.

302
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:54,680
You need to prepare
some cold medicine for the kids.

303
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,443
I got it.

304
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:57,813
Xia Chu!

305
00:19:57,952 --> 00:20:00,288
Get changed!
The soldiers will be here soon.

306
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:01,320
Okay.

307
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:03,523
I'll go to work first, goodbye.

308
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:04,640
Bye bye.

309
00:20:16,752 --> 00:20:18,606
Done, go in there for one more test.

310
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:19,560
Okay, thank you.

311
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:32,080
Hello, Dr. Xia.

312
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:33,920
Hello, Captain Liang.

313
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:40,560
Give me your hand.

314
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,520
Xue didn't trouble you, right?

315
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,340
Not for the time being.

316
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,411
But...

317
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,640
who knew when the next surprise will be?

318
00:20:57,717 --> 00:20:59,400
Try to understand.

319
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:06,320
Gifts blind the eyes.

320
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,620
Considering you gave me those cherries,

321
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:10,560
I won't quarrel with her.

322
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:12,560
Do you like them?

323
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,810
I do.

324
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,950
But how did the idea of
hanging those cherries up...

325
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:19,800
come into your head?

326
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,100
For water controlling.

327
00:21:25,756 --> 00:21:27,239
Boring,

328
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,749
just like your blood pressure.

329
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,920
It's too normal.

330
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,840
Lift your shirt.

331
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:46,781
Your heartbeat is a bit fast.

332
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,429
Yes.

333
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,760
I'm sick. What should I do, Dr. Xia?

334
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,164
You should go for a check-up
if you're sick.

335
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:58,025
You might need a
thoracotomy if it worsens.

336
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,400
Do you dare?

337
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,440
I dare to let you operate
if you dare to do it.

338
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,540
Dr. Xia,

339
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,839
your stethoscope will be embedded
in my chest,

340
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,320
if you keep pressing it.

341
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,320
Sorry.

342
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,960
I'll see you at night, Dr. Xia.

343
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,030
Hello, Dr. Xia.

344
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:52,970
Hello, sister-in-law.

345
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,160
Sister-in-law, you're so pretty.

346
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,160
Village Chief.

347
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,076
Director Mi, the kids
are really happy when...

348
00:23:08,117 --> 00:23:09,108
they heard you're coming.

349
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:10,415
They waited here early in the morning.

350
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:11,949
They kept asking me...

351
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,480
-if you've reached.
-Sister Gu!

352
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:16,701
You all came. Come on, let's go there.

353
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,630
-Do you miss me?
-Yes!

354
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:20,091
Director Mi, have a seat over here.

355
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,150
Xiao Qiu, this is a toy for you.

356
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:26,921
-Do you like it?
-I do.

357
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,260
Nan Nan, you've grown taller.

358
00:23:30,301 --> 00:23:32,870
Luckily, I bought you a dress
that is one size bigger.

359
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,961
Thank you, sister.

360
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:37,076
Guo Guo, your braid looks nice.

361
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:38,360
Who tied it for you?

362
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:39,280
Mother.

363
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:40,322
Mother tied it for you?

364
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:42,783
Sister Gu, I want to eat that snack.

365
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:44,980
Here.
Go and distribute the snacks.

366
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,653
Thank you, sister!

367
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:30,733
(Long Yi)

368
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,133
The police found a suit and
a pair of shoes under a cover...

369
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:38,640
along the coastal road.

370
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,820
It's similar to Gui's outfit
on the day of forum.

371
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:45,780
This might belong to him
compared to the video.

372
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:48,360
I already sent someone
over to search the area.

373
00:24:49,126 --> 00:24:50,026
I got it.

374
00:24:50,894 --> 00:24:51,989
What do you mean you got it?

375
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,220
What should we do next?

376
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,140
There is blood stains on the clothes.

377
00:24:56,726 --> 00:24:58,116
It means he was seriously injured.

378
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,340
He can't have gone far.

379
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:02,580
Just think about why his stuffs
appeared at the coastal road.

380
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,160
The immigration bureau
has no further information either.

381
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,310
People like him won't go through...

382
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:11,080
proper channels even
if he wants to leave.

383
00:25:12,153 --> 00:25:14,337
You go and ask around the dock nearby.

384
00:25:14,378 --> 00:25:15,520
Tell me if you got any news.

385
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:38,020
I captured you!

386
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:40,041
It doesn't count.

387
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,417
It doesn't count.
Sister Gu, you can do it!

388
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:45,181
You've been wiped out.

389
00:25:46,052 --> 00:25:48,432
You haven't found Xiao Qiu.

390
00:25:48,473 --> 00:25:49,440
Xiao Qiu?

391
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:52,529
Xiao Qiu likes to be in the forest.

392
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,709
After I get her back,

393
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,120
let's distribute the gifts again, okay?

394
00:25:55,229 --> 00:25:57,259
Okay!

395
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,640
You guys wait for me!

396
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,020
Sister Gu, you can do it!

397
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:07,040
Xiao Qiu!

398
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:10,400
I already saw you!

399
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:12,360
Come on out!

400
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,140
Xiao Qiu?

401
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,746
Xiao Qiu! Don't run around, come back!

402
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,440
Xiao Qiu!

403
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,920
Xiao Qiu!

404
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,320
Xiao Qiu! Come on out!

405
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:16,680
Xiao Qiu!

406
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:18,460
Xiao Nan is still waiting for you!

407
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:19,960
Follow me back!

408
00:27:25,662 --> 00:27:26,680
Why are you here?

409
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,059
I'm here to visit the kids.

410
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,400
We were playing hide and seek.

411
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:34,040
I came here while looking for her.

412
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:36,280
What about you?

413
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,840
I'm here to visit an old friend.

414
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:42,360
Here?

415
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,360
Did you drink?

416
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,290
A little.

417
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:53,320
I'll take you down.

418
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:59,911
Devil!

419
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,478
You're a devil!

420
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,000
Why are you back again?

421
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:04,680
You screwed our village.

422
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:07,603
You rot in hell! You rot in hell!

423
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,119
Buzz off! Buzz off!

424
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,679
Why did you come back?

425
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,746
Buzz off! Buzz off!

426
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:13,920
-Let's go.
-Buzz off!

427
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:16,000
I'll beat you to death!

428
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:17,281
Let's go.

429
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:18,720
Buzz off!

430
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:20,427
Buzz off!

431
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,200
Devil!

432
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,559
The Village Chief said
that woman is crazy.

433
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,090
She stays in a small house
beside the mass grave.

434
00:29:19,152 --> 00:29:20,572
She usually won't come out.

435
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:22,200
I wonder what was wrong with her.

436
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:23,720
She suddenly went mad when she saw us.

437
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,796
Don't mind about what she said.

438
00:29:26,837 --> 00:29:28,040
It was all nonsense.

439
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:30,720
Actually it's quite good to be crazy.

440
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,120
What did you say?

441
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,080
If I really am a devil,

442
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,080
a sinner,

443
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:49,000
will I rot in hell?

444
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,520
Every saint has its past.

445
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,840
Every sinner has its future.

446
00:30:09,582 --> 00:30:10,520
It's strange.

447
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,650
What is?

448
00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:18,960
I saw the old Zhuo Ran
in Xia Chu's eyes.

449
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:21,791
In your eyes,

450
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:24,656
I actually see...

451
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,600
What?

452
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
Myself.

453
00:30:37,694 --> 00:30:39,160
It's really amazing!

454
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,240
I want to take a selfie!

455
00:31:00,516 --> 00:31:01,800
You look really nice.

456
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,759
The crepitation of firecrackers
sends off the old year.

457
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,740
Sweet wine and spring wind brings
warmth into thousands of homes.

458
00:31:06,954 --> 00:31:09,200
You... Is it reading a poem?

459
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:10,440
Did you teach it?

460
00:31:12,422 --> 00:31:13,480
Hello.

461
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,120
I need to post it on my Moments.

462
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:28,280
What's wrong?

463
00:31:29,526 --> 00:31:30,400
I'm fine.

464
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,360
I might have eaten
something wrong last night.

465
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,320
I'll go to the washroom again.

466
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,240
Eat some medicine.

467
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,760
Your soldier really does like children.

468
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:30,709
Team Thunder, gather!

469
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,040
Gather!

470
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,300
Dress to the right!

471
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:39,135
Eyes front!

472
00:32:39,574 --> 00:32:42,034
At ease, halt!

473
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:47,919
Comrade Brigade Commander!

474
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,880
Team Thunder are assembled!

475
00:32:50,921 --> 00:32:51,960
Please advise

476
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,270
Fall in!

477
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:54,191
Yes!

478
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,970
We've been informed by the superiors
that the police found a person trapped...

479
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,370
on Island D in waters near us
during their investigation of cases.

480
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:12,909
They need our aid.

481
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,000
The New Year Party is called off.

482
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,040
Liang Mu Ze will lead the team.

483
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:19,760
Commandos Team Thunder,
prepare to depart!

484
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:21,200
Yes!

485
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:26,760
When did you come?

486
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:28,495
Are you going back tomorrow?

487
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,410
I want to go to your store
and pick up some books.

488
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,080
Dr. Zhang,

489
00:33:32,497 --> 00:33:35,117
why do I get the sense
that you're like a bee?

490
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,970
A bee?

491
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,720
It means there's a
very beautiful flower over here.

492
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,940
Right?

493
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,240
Yes!

494
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:50,639
Oh my goodness.

495
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,060
Have you been following me?

496
00:33:55,353 --> 00:33:57,735
Wu, what's wrong?

497
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,439
-Nothing.
-No.

498
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,700
The New Year Party is canceled,
you don't have to go.

499
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,840
I know that.

500
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,590
Our Brigade Commander
asked me over to join the operation.

501
00:34:06,631 --> 00:34:09,229
How can you join
the operation in this state?

502
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,220
I'm fine.

503
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,440
I already ate some medicine.

504
00:34:12,481 --> 00:34:13,491
Now that I feel...

505
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,560
Are you all right?

506
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,860
Mr. Zhang,
what... what should we do?

507
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,340
In this situation,

508
00:34:26,795 --> 00:34:27,880
we can only go in his place.

509
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,279
Thank you, Zhang!

510
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,429
I... I can't hold it!

511
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,470
I need to go to the washroom!

512
00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:33,616
Thank you!

513
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,800
How about this? Xia Chu.

514
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:37,015
Yes.

515
00:34:37,056 --> 00:34:37,956
You go.

516
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,559
Yes!

517
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,570
You are her teacher.
Why don't you go?

518
00:34:44,052 --> 00:34:45,720
I'm afraid of water.

519
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,760
Go.

520
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:56,701
Hello.

521
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,778
I'm the captain of
Commandos Team Thunder,

522
00:34:58,819 --> 00:34:59,759
Liang Mu Ze.

523
00:35:00,237 --> 00:35:01,437
What's the situation?

524
00:35:01,585 --> 00:35:04,038
We found the SOS call
from the trapped victim by kindling...

525
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,359
a fire on the island.

526
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,980
Now, the initial development
of the rescue plan is...

527
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:10,646
to use the zodiac boats
and choose a suitable spot...

528
00:35:10,687 --> 00:35:11,547
to land on the island

529
00:35:11,588 --> 00:35:13,218
with the aid of your
familiarity with this waters.

530
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,909
And considering the condition
of the trapped victim,

531
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,720
it would be better if you could
have an accompanying doctor...

532
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:19,790
to assist the victim at any time
for further transit.

533
00:35:19,831 --> 00:35:21,221
Tighten the zodiac boat!

534
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:22,829
Did you get the life jackets,

535
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,119
rescue ropes and stretchers?

536
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,025
We have everything!

537
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:27,645
Okay, keep this in mind! Be safe!

538
00:35:27,686 --> 00:35:28,666
Yes!

539
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,119
No problem.

540
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,740
Keep me posted.

541
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:32,920
Okay.

542
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,000
Report!

543
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,760
Xia Chu?

544
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,600
Why are you here?

545
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,440
Military Doctor Wu is sick.

546
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,730
I'm here to assist in the rescue
in his place.

547
00:35:58,013 --> 00:36:00,079
You? No way. Go find a male.

548
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,200
I can do it.

549
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:03,270
I have experience of being a frontliner
in the rescue of disaster areas.

550
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:04,661
I'm a strong swimmer,
I have no seasickness.

551
00:36:06,183 --> 00:36:07,419
Brigade Commander,

552
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,720
she can do it.

553
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,340
Okay, then. I'm counting on you.

554
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,980
I'll ensure the
completion of the task!

555
00:36:17,932 --> 00:36:20,269
Attention! Get on the car and depart!

556
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,260
Yes!

557
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:01,758
Make way!

558
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,980
Can you hear me?

559
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,860
I can.

560
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,060
Is the boat yours?

561
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,220
Yes.

562
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,250
What is your job?

563
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,010
I'm a fisherman.

564
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,380
Why did you come to the island?

565
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:29,231
I was kidnapped.

566
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,210
What's your name?

567
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,770
Help me.

568
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:38,280
Help me.

569
00:37:42,487 --> 00:37:43,417
He's in shock.

570
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:45,143
The patient needs a
venous access immediately.

571
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:46,084
Illuminate it for me.

572
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:04,280
The heavy rainstorm is coming.

573
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,940
The patient can't catch a cold now.

574
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,600
-Carry him to the boat!
-Yes.

575
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,760
Done!

576
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,430
How are we supposed to go back
in this downpour?

577
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,630
No, the blood oxygenation
level hasn't increased.

578
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,920
He has hemothorax.

579
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:45,709
I need to perform a
close drainage for him.

580
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,630
Right here?

581
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,410
Does it have the risk of infection?

582
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,020
It does, but it can save his life.

583
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,090
How can we assist you? Come on!

584
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,719
Hold his hands up.

585
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,640
Lift his shirt up.

586
00:38:56,257 --> 00:38:57,137
Give a hand!

587
00:39:41,975 --> 00:39:42,840
Done.

588
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,960
His condition is temporarily stable.

589
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:48,680
Let's hope he can make it
until the rain stops.

590
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,910
Go and get some rest.

591
00:39:58,951 --> 00:40:00,371
Take the shift after midnight.

592
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:12,697
Okay, I understand.

593
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:15,080
Be safe. Keep me posted.

594
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,680
Okay.

595
00:40:24,621 --> 00:40:25,751
When is this rain going to stop?

596
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:27,799
I've searched the information
of the weather bureau.

597
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,440
They predict it'll stop tomorrow morning.

598
00:40:48,592 --> 00:40:49,600
What is this?

599
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,650
Nets.

600
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,320
It's for capturing the birds.

601
00:40:55,142 --> 00:40:56,412
Many rare species have gone extinct...

602
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:58,583
because of being
captured by this thing.

603
00:41:00,562 --> 00:41:01,640
It's so cruel.

604
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:03,920
It's the lure of the money.

605
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,730
You can't think it by
using fact-based logic.

606
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,800
Is there no cure for it?

607
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:12,760
How could you cure the desire?

608
00:41:22,014 --> 00:41:23,240
You're a doctor.

609
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,010
You should know that
this thing is like a lot of diseases.

610
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,890
The prevalence of desire
is the latent sin in humanity.

611
00:41:35,138 --> 00:41:37,118
It can only be controlled.
It can't be cured.

612
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,860
Does it frustrate you?

613
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,560
Some times.

614
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:50,950
I'll feel frustrated when I'm powerless
to save the people.

615
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:53,115
Me too.

616
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,740
Sometimes, I wonder if...

617
00:41:56,417 --> 00:42:01,090
my life would be much easier if I didn't
apply for Military Medical University?

618
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,850
I have many high school friends.

619
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,220
They already worked for a few years.

620
00:42:07,897 --> 00:42:09,797
Some of them are married
and have children.

621
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,020
As for me,

622
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,420
it's like my life just started.

623
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,680
It feels like I got suspended.

624
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,560
Do you regret it?

625
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,510
Not at all.

626
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,960
Let me tell you in secret.

627
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,060
Actually, I have another name.
It's Wan Jiu.

628
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,800
My father came up with it.

629
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:35,029
It means...

630
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,700
A widely nurturing talent.

631
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:39,670
You knew it?

632
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,558
When I was in high school,

633
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,429
I wanted to pursue our representative
of the language course.

634
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:49,330
I memorized the entire poem of "Lisao".

635
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,660
You said you haven't developed a
habit for anyone before.

636
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,200
Didn't you like to read detective novel
because of someone else?

637
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:03,627
I admit that.

638
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,119
Do you admit it?

639
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,200
I don't.

640
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,380
The exact words you asked me was
"will someone's habit"...

641
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,960
"live tenaciously within me?"

642
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,054
Right?

643
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:16,550
No.

644
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:20,769
That lady got married.
I almost forgot "Lisao" too.

645
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,829
I just remember this one line.

646
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,370
And it's related to your name.

647
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,130
This is a coincidence between us.

648
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,710
You talk a good game.

649
00:43:32,357 --> 00:43:35,120
There are not many girls
with such names.

650
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,010
Right, my mum doesn't like it.

651
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,730
She thinks it's tiring
for a girl to have this name.

652
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:44,730
She wishes I could stay by her side
and be her baby.

653
00:43:45,324 --> 00:43:46,480
But my father is different.

654
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,790
He thinks his daughter
should be capable of so much more,

655
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,319
should spare no effort to create,

656
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,800
and change the world
with intelligence and morality.

657
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,760
Just like him.

658
00:44:00,047 --> 00:44:02,980
People who do science in high school
are usually lonely.

659
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,440
Especially the first two years,
which are the hardest time.

660
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,420
Many people will resign.

661
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:12,890
Many companies wanted to hire him
but he didn't leave.

662
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:16,149
He would sit on the cold bench
to calculate and...

663
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,180
conduct experiments every day.

664
00:44:19,513 --> 00:44:21,173
The intellectuals of their generation

665
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,280
have their own boundaries and beliefs.

666
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,040
So you agree with your father?

667
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,120
I respect him for being brave.

668
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:35,210
But I feel bad for my mother.

669
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,200
She has two workaholics.

670
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:39,369
Why?

671
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,790
Are you going to be a superwoman?

672
00:44:41,917 --> 00:44:43,480
I don't know whether I'm strong or not.

673
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:47,500
But I think
now that I've come to this world,

674
00:44:47,939 --> 00:44:50,120
apart from being a wife of a man

675
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,240
and a mother of a child,

676
00:44:53,281 --> 00:44:58,060
I should be the best of me above all
and be the Dr. Xia who saves lives.

677
00:45:06,846 --> 00:45:07,846
What about you?

678
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,400
What type of man do you want to be?

679
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,740
What do you think?

680
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,740
The King of Soldiers.

681
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,640
Don't you?

682
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:24,474
Didn't you get trained
in Hunter Military School...

683
00:45:24,515 --> 00:45:26,765
for the title of
"The King Of Soldiers"?

684
00:45:27,669 --> 00:45:28,839
I went to Hunter Military School,

685
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,700
because I received
the order from the superiors.

686
00:45:30,912 --> 00:45:33,653
And "The King of Soldiers"
is not a personal honor.

687
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,480
It carries the professional image
of the entire Chinese soldiers.

688
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,080
I don't want to be a
superhero as the film shows.

689
00:45:44,233 --> 00:45:47,880
I only want to be a purely
professional soldier.

690
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,400
Do you know what professional is?

691
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,430
Take you, for instance,

692
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,410
you make your rounds,
complete the charts every day.

693
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,210
Right? And do the shift work.

694
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,730
This is your career
and these are what you should do.

695
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:02,349
As for me,

696
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:03,520
what should I do?

697
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,300
I need to train, exercise,
implement simulation tasks everyday.

698
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,160
These are what I should do.

699
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,400
It's not about being a superhero,

700
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:14,800
nor chanting empty slogans.

701
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:17,519
I need to adhere to...

702
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,800
my professional conviction
that comes with this military uniform.

703
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,740
This is my professional aspiration.
