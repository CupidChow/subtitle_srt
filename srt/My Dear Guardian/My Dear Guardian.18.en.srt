=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:44,653 --> 00:01:45,498
I'll do it myself.

4
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,750
Don't move. Let me do it.

5
00:01:50,582 --> 00:01:51,462
Let me see it.

6
00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:03,097
Fortunately,
it's not serious. It's just a scrape.

7
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:04,960
Let me dress your wound.

8
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:08,495
Don't move.

9
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:12,117
I'm covered with dust.

10
00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:13,603
It's okay.

11
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:20,560
Hold it.

12
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,250
Where is Xue?

13
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:26,186
I asked her to go back with Rao Zhi.

14
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,710
Weren't you with her?

15
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:30,942
I had something to do.

16
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:31,883
What was it?

17
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:33,620
To pursue you.

18
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,989
Did you see the plate
number of that car?

19
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,480
No.

20
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:51,791
Did you see what the driver looks like?

21
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:54,520
No.

22
00:02:57,932 --> 00:02:59,552
It was dark.

23
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,230
He flipped on the high beam
and I was scared.

24
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,230
I just kept on running.

25
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:10,854
I didn't even see
if the car was coming for me.

26
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,550
There is a lot going on.

27
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,693
My patient passed away.

28
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm terribly upset.

29
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,238
I don't know...

30
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,990
It's fine.

31
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,600
Everything will be fine.

32
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:31,240
Done. Look.

33
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,800
Good bandaging technique.

34
00:03:43,993 --> 00:03:45,023
Of course.

35
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:47,479
I learned from the best.

36
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:50,463
I'm flattered.

37
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not as good as you in bandaging.

38
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,360
The tutor I said is not you.

39
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:01,961
It's the nurse from Isaia.

40
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:02,920
You've met her.

41
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,119
So she was the lady
who drank in the bar last time.

42
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:13,251
Yes.

43
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:15,880
Your acquaintance is quite extensive.

44
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,979
Do you know...

45
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,240
what the passing rate
of Hunter Military School is?

46
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,760
I heard it's a hell-like training.

47
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:26,709
It's 90 percent.

48
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,750
Only 14 persons in our class passed.

49
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,880
I would've been the first in my class,

50
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,230
if you hadn't reported me.

51
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,289
I always got hurt during training.

52
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,120
I always ended up in the infirmary.

53
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,030
That nurse and I were
nearly the same age.

54
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:46,539
She patched me up
very earnestly every time.

55
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:48,188
The gauze she cut was nice too.

56
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,200
She even read poetry to my wound.

57
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:52,760
Read poetry?

58
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:53,681
Yes.

59
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:55,600
Love is so short.

60
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:57,280
Forgetting is so long.

61
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,870
Acacia ashes, ashes are Acacia.

62
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,310
These were the poem I heard from her.

63
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,160
She liked Neruda.

64
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:09,240
She was clearly flirting with you.

65
00:05:09,714 --> 00:05:10,744
I don't know.

66
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,630
You liked her too.

67
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:15,997
I liked seeing her when
she was bandaging.

68
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:17,989
I liked the gauze she cut.

69
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:21,044
I liked her tone when
she was reading poetry.

70
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,360
She believed that reading poetry
to the wound could speed healing.

71
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:28,223
Nonsense.

72
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,520
Right, no medical grounds at all.

73
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,960
But she had no doubt on that.

74
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:38,800
Every one has their own belief.

75
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,960
It makes no sense to others.

76
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,190
Just like the way you treat Zhuo Ran.

77
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:50,934
You left...

78
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,230
because you were afraid
that I'd say his name.

79
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:56,929
You weren't willing to suspect him.

80
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,200
That's why you escaped, right?

81
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:03,480
I don't want to discuss
about this topic.

82
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:07,195
You're escaping again.

83
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:08,680
Where are you trying to escape?

84
00:06:13,768 --> 00:06:15,158
If that gun on the boat...

85
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,960
really was his,

86
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:20,029
will you still believe in him?

87
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:36,203
Yes, Brigade Commander.

88
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:37,720
That was how it was today.

89
00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:39,645
So you're saying

90
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,431
Xia Chu is home alone.

91
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,510
It's quite worrying.

92
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,780
Yes.

93
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:47,032
Right.

94
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:48,989
Have you taken your annual leave?

95
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:50,057
I haven't.

96
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,680
Why don't you take this opportunity to
take your annual leave?

97
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,750
Thank you, Brigade Commander.

98
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:56,638
Why did you let her go?

99
00:06:57,554 --> 00:06:59,584
Didn't you see the car
behind was following us?

100
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:02,344
The fact that she came
meant she probably already recognized...

101
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:04,520
your back when you took
Gui away from the hospital.

102
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:06,760
It was just a silhouette.

103
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,960
She has no favorable statements.

104
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:13,819
And you hesitated while
you were pointing

105
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,400
the gun at Gui on the boat.

106
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:19,851
Because I wanted to clarify...

107
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,734
whether the police had
interrogated him.

108
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,840
This is more important
than putting a bullet in him.

109
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,670
You wanted to clarify?

110
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:30,021
You delayed our evacuation
just because of this.

111
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,470
We almost encountered
the police and that girl.

112
00:07:34,177 --> 00:07:35,247
Her name is Xia Chu.

113
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:44,560
I know what's on your mind.

114
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,640
Just like what Gui said.

115
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:49,311
You wanted to use him
to pin down Old Master.

116
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,320
I'm warning you.

117
00:07:56,363 --> 00:07:58,663
Do not challenge Old Master's authority.

118
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:01,782
Don't even think about
taking me down with you.

119
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:04,614
You saw what happened to Gui.

120
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,440
And that girl must die too.

121
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,430
I repeat.

122
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:12,459
Her name is Xia Chu.

123
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:14,600
Only Zhuo Ran can decide her fate.

124
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,000
Do you understand?

125
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,320
I'm asking if you understood me!

126
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,160
Get rid of the car.

127
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,040
Zhuo Ran.

128
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,840
I'm back. Where are you?

129
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:35,680
Zhuo Ran?

130
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:37,475
Can you hear me?

131
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:45,400
Zhuo Ran!

132
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:12,160
Bang on it!

133
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,430
Zhuo Ran!

134
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:18,280
Zhuo Ran!

135
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:20,040
Can you hear me?

136
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:30,880
Is it 120?

137
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,480
Liang Mu Ze!

138
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:44,160
Liang Mu Ze!

139
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,640
Liang Mu Ze!

140
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:16,689
What kind of concept is that?

141
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,880
What are you doing?

142
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:24,880
Durian?

143
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:27,080
You bought durian?

144
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Oh my god!

145
00:11:34,385 --> 00:11:36,760
Don't tell me you're
making durian cake.

146
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:38,640
I failed.

147
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:44,760
This isn't right.

148
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:47,568
I followed every step on the website.

149
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:48,520
What went wrong?

150
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:00,962
180 degree average
heating on both sides.

151
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:02,015
Bake it for half an hour.

152
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,040
You chose single side, Captain Liang.

153
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:06,880
No wonder.

154
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:22,240
Aren't you going to return to the unit?

155
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:24,440
I took leave.

156
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:29,990
What's wrong?

157
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,779
I don't want to admit it,

158
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,631
but it's quite reassuring
with your presence...

159
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,640
at a time like this.

160
00:12:42,115 --> 00:12:43,085
I knew that.

161
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,710
But why did you want to make durian cake?

162
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:52,045
I think...

163
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,070
you should eat something sweet
as compensation.

164
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:01,600
Uncle Rao.

165
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:05,552
I'm at home.

166
00:13:07,145 --> 00:13:08,007
Okay.

167
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,080
I'll be right over.

168
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,911
I'm going to pick Xue up
at the police station.

169
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:14,767
I'll go with you.

170
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,600
I need to talk to Rao Zhi.

171
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:18,454
(Case Analysis Room)

172
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:20,468
Forensics extracted
DNA of the deceased...

173
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:23,649
and compared it with the DNA of
Sang Kun, the deceased at the villa.

174
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,400
They found that their gene sequence
closely coincide.

175
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:27,846
Basically, we can conclude...

176
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:31,069
that the deceased in the shipyard
is Gui, Sang Kun's little brother.

177
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,409
And apart from the lethal shot
and the oozing drainage port,

178
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,020
his other wounds
were treated in the hospital.

179
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,040
We didn't discover any new wound
and any signs of struggle.

180
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,120
From the autopsy report alone,

181
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:45,171
basically, there's no
possibility of homicide.

182
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:48,133
What about the boat owner?

183
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:50,161
The boat owner admitted
that he concealed...

184
00:13:50,202 --> 00:13:52,015
the existence of the secret compartment,

185
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:53,849
because he was afraid that the matter
of hunting wildlife would be disclosed.

186
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,608
But he said he didn't
know the deceased.

187
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:57,369
He was unsure when
and what the deceased...

188
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,790
put in the secret compartment.

189
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,139
I looked up the background
of this boat owner in detail.

190
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,080
No problem was found.

191
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:05,049
Xiao Qiang,

192
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,600
any progression in the physical evidences?

193
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:08,619
No usable fingerprints,

194
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,040
footprints and hair at the scene
were found.

195
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,929
By analyzing the fingerprints
on the gun and ballistics,

196
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,126
and from the wound that caused
by the burning of gunpowder,

197
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,477
we can confirm
the deceased shot himself.

198
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,089
After the verification of
the firearm department,

199
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,720
the gun and gunpowder which were found
at the scene had been proven that...

200
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:27,526
they were made by
3D printing technology.

201
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,057
Only the deceased's
fingerprints were on it.

202
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:34,189
What conditions are
needed for 3D printing?

203
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:37,572
There's a download
program on City of Desire.

204
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,408
With a 3D printer
and respective materials,

205
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:41,749
a gun could be manufactured.

206
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:44,722
And the power of this
3D printed gun

207
00:14:44,763 --> 00:14:46,960
isn't as strong as the traditional gun.

208
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:49,889
It has the advantages
such as easy fabrication,

209
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,009
and it can avoid radiation scan.

210
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,680
Which means it can allow the gun holder
to pass security checks.

211
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:06,152
Peng Fei,

212
00:15:06,193 --> 00:15:08,684
can you check the information
of the downloaders?

213
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:11,805
So far, we've found
only one account, named Scary Pirate,

214
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:13,120
had downloaded this program.

215
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,240
But we have not been able to
identify the person.

216
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:18,307
Rao Zhi,

217
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,400
Zhuo Ran started a 3D printing company.

218
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:23,511
Then why did he use a 3D printed gun?

219
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,760
Isn't that causing us to suspect him?

220
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:28,160
I think he's not that stupid.

221
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,800
He might not be stupid.

222
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,240
Perhaps it's a kind of
outrageous provocation.

223
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:38,065
He made it look like suicide.

224
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:39,680
Even if he was caught,

225
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:44,080
he could make us negate his suspicion
by using his sheer exposure.

226
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:47,873
He might have strong
anti-reconnaissance capability.

227
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,520
He knew our state of
mind in handling a case.

228
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:51,674
If it's that case,

229
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:53,935
then this Scary Pirate
is very terrifying.

230
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,620
It's more than being terrifying.

231
00:15:56,242 --> 00:15:58,682
In my view, the previous crimes
he committed...

232
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:03,200
point to him being a sociopath
doing an aimless performance art.

233
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,000
It might be a performance art.

234
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:09,440
It could never be aimless.

235
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,202
But how are we supposed to unmask him?

236
00:16:15,648 --> 00:16:16,558
So,

237
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:20,199
let's go through
every clue we currently have...

238
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,560
after this meeting.

239
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:24,720
Especially the testimony
of the eyewitness.

240
00:16:24,873 --> 00:16:28,280
Go through it again
and see if we missed anything.

241
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,290
Rao Zhi,

242
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,590
it was my negligence
yesterday at the hospital.

243
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,400
I'm willing to accept my punishment.

244
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,240
You won't get away with it.

245
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,240
But this is not the time for you
to make self-criticism.

246
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,569
-Let's go. Follow me to the boat.
-Yes.

247
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,490
Rao Zhi.

248
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:53,812
Rao Zhi,

249
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:55,240
the deceased didn't kill himself.

250
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:02,239
So how did you know?

251
00:17:03,307 --> 00:17:04,160
On first look,

252
00:17:04,795 --> 00:17:07,640
the deceased did indeed use his thumb to
pull the trigger and shot himself.

253
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:13,436
But the deceased's
posterior skull was pierced.

254
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:15,208
So?

255
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,630
I compared lots of suicide cases.

256
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:19,108
In the cases which
the posterior skull was pierced,

257
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:20,890
the trigger was pulled
by the index finger.

258
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:23,830
In the cases which the trigger was pulled
by the thumb,

259
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,720
it should be the neck
which got pierced.

260
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,424
If it wasn't a coincidence,

261
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:29,415
then it means...

262
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,236
Then it means it wasn't suicide.

263
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:35,670
It was made to look like
a suicide scene after he was killed.

264
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:41,137
Immediately conduct a thorough search in
all 3D printing companies in the city.

265
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:42,503
Focus on talking with Mr. Zhuo.

266
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:43,400
Yes.

267
00:17:59,515 --> 00:18:01,380
She really is Officer Rao's daughter?

268
00:18:01,763 --> 00:18:02,631
Yes.

269
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,590
It's surprising.

270
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:08,436
You'll forgive the person
that she's become,

271
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,440
if you knew her before.

272
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,066
Maybe.

273
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:19,949
How did you know
there was a problem with the suicide?

274
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:23,504
Have you forgotten I like
to read detective novels?

275
00:18:23,848 --> 00:18:26,268
Those experiences that
we once thought were useless...

276
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:29,800
will eventually show their value
in an inadvertent moment.

277
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:34,600
And this habit of mine
was influenced by Zhuo Ran.

278
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:39,187
Then?

279
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:44,750
So I think there's no such thing
as your assumption last night.

280
00:18:45,004 --> 00:18:47,173
If he really was the gun holder,

281
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:49,393
he wouldn't have
neglected this lethal flaw...

282
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:51,600
when he falsified the suicide scene.

283
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:55,583
Having said all that,

284
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:57,240
it turned out you did it all for him.

285
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,040
I did it for myself.

286
00:19:01,744 --> 00:19:03,360
I have my past.

287
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,800
But I won't lose my sense
of judgment because of my past.

288
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,339
I wish the police could solve
this case as soon as possible.

289
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,000
To prove with facts that you're wrong.

290
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,270
I hope you could win.

291
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:28,440
I hope this past won't hurt you.

292
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,785
I've told you all I
care about is the people,

293
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:32,756
not about winning or losing.

294
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:44,886
What are you doing?

295
00:19:44,927 --> 00:19:46,147
What happened?

296
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:49,570
I didn't expect to witness public
display affection when I woke up.

297
00:19:49,777 --> 00:19:51,262
I have to go.

298
00:19:56,469 --> 00:20:01,269
(Outpatient Department)

299
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:06,080
Brother,

300
00:20:07,004 --> 00:20:09,584
you're like an embarrassing youth.

301
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:11,440
I've always been a youth.

302
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:16,920
Aunt asked me how the progress
between you and Xia Chu is going.

303
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:17,960
What should I say?

304
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,379
The photo you took just now...

305
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,520
I won't delete it.

306
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,560
You send it to her.

307
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,963
Send it to her and send it to me too.

308
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:36,095
I never thought this day would come.

309
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,506
Yesterday, a patient who
was admitted to our department...

310
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:45,849
was taken away by a man

311
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,750
who was masquerading as a
doctor during treatment.

312
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:49,399
About what happened next,

313
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,160
I believe that everyone already knows.

314
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:53,020
I don't want to talk about...

315
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:56,280
the patient's past and background
or the police investigation.

316
00:20:56,886 --> 00:21:01,030
I wish to emphasize that
our responsibility as medical personnel.

317
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:05,206
Who was arranged to be on duty
on the rota when this happened?

318
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:11,840
It was me, chief.

319
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,809
Were you in the on-call room
or the wards at that time?

320
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:15,839
I...

321
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:18,171
was at home.

322
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:21,618
Why?

323
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:24,640
I exchanged my shift with Xiao Xiao.

324
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,120
Who requested it?

325
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:33,797
I... I wished to rest.

326
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:36,367
Had this been approved
by the superior doctor?

327
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:37,288
No.

328
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:42,058
Do you know the behaviour
of having unauthorized shifts...

329
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:44,620
is violation of the
department's management regulations?

330
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:47,409
I know.

331
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,020
So you knowingly did it!

332
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:56,440
Chief, here's the thing.

333
00:21:56,951 --> 00:22:00,400
Xia Chu was on a mission
with special forces brigade...

334
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:01,720
the night before.

335
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:03,640
She had been up all night.

336
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:08,124
We're talking about
rules and regulations now.

337
00:22:08,165 --> 00:22:09,320
What is regulation?

338
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,740
It's the organizational
discipline beyond individual will.

339
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:16,360
In a huge environment
like the hospital,

340
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:22,969
every trivial regulation
is set at the cost of human lives...

341
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,190
and blood and tears.

342
00:22:24,464 --> 00:22:25,769
You may exchange the shift
after staying up all night.

343
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,640
You can even take your
day off when necessary.

344
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:30,567
But this must be done under the premise of
complying with the rules and regulations.

345
00:22:30,907 --> 00:22:31,807
Or else...

346
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:36,080
whoever violates the regulations
must bear the consequence.

347
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,670
You took them from me, right?

348
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:31,502
You might complete you rotation
at the Emergency Department...

349
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,880
when you lose all these pens.

350
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:34,065
Rest assured.

351
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:37,470
I'll talk to chief
and try to have you back.

352
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,078
It's really the first time I've been
so eager to lose them all.

353
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:48,274
Xia Chu,

354
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:50,923
no matter where you are,

355
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:52,440
no matter what you're doing,

356
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:54,269
you have to remember...

357
00:23:54,918 --> 00:23:57,258
you have the potential
to be a good doctor.

358
00:24:00,436 --> 00:24:01,320
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

359
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:04,800
Only potential.

360
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,670
Dr. Xia will do her best!

361
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,000
Xia Chu.

362
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:30,160
Are you going there now?

363
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,330
I was punished by the chief
to write self reflection paper.

364
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:41,267
Actually...

365
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:44,531
Actually, aren't you close with that
Brigade Commander Dong?

366
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,300
You can ask for his help.

367
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:48,200
It's not necessary.

368
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:54,830
I have no objection about
the result of this matter.

369
00:24:56,168 --> 00:24:58,920
I only have one question to ask you.

370
00:24:59,944 --> 00:25:00,844
What is it?

371
00:25:04,757 --> 00:25:06,017
You were sincere...

372
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:08,886
about taking my shift, right?

373
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:09,800
Of course.

374
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:11,937
That day after you left,

375
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:14,519
I'd been sorting the medical charts
and the laboratory documents.

376
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:18,024
I was thinking to tell teacher
after I finished the works.

377
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:20,414
Who knew such accident
would happen at that time?

378
00:25:20,697 --> 00:25:23,160
I was busy looking for the patient
and checking the footage.

379
00:25:23,784 --> 00:25:26,414
That's why I forgot
to tell teacher about this matter.

380
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:30,360
I admit it was remiss of me.

381
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:32,600
But you can't put all the blame on me.

382
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:35,000
I already took your shift.

383
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,420
It's unreasonable to accept
the punishment for you.

384
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,710
You can call me selfish,
petty or irresponsible.

385
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,380
I don't want to go to the
Emergency Department anyway.

386
00:25:46,423 --> 00:25:48,080
I didn't say a word in the meeting.

387
00:25:48,883 --> 00:25:49,960
Not that I wanted to mess with you,

388
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:51,920
I did it out of self-protection.

389
00:25:55,784 --> 00:25:56,679
Of course.

390
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,860
You don't have to trust me.

391
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,840
I trust you.

392
00:26:00,803 --> 00:26:02,440
You're selfish, petty
and irresponsible.

393
00:26:04,626 --> 00:26:05,760
But you're not a jerk.

394
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:07,468
Xia Chu,

395
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:09,702
you can ask for Brigade Commander's help.

396
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:12,179
It would be useful if he could help you.

397
00:26:12,377 --> 00:26:13,597
It was my fault.

398
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:14,600
I should accept it.

399
00:26:21,097 --> 00:26:22,000
Good luck to you.

400
00:26:22,507 --> 00:26:23,457
You too.

401
00:26:38,155 --> 00:26:40,032
Explain clearly to the family
of the patient in bed number seven.

402
00:26:40,073 --> 00:26:41,200
I understand, Ms. Song.

403
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:50,397
Hello, teacher.

404
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:51,689
I'm the resident from the Cardio Surgery,

405
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,167
I'm here for the rotation.

406
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,160
My name is Xia Chu.

407
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,990
Input these medical
advices into the computer.

408
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,840
These...

409
00:27:19,364 --> 00:27:20,334
Sorry.

410
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:21,565
Look at me.

411
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,886
I forgot you have heart problems.

412
00:27:23,927 --> 00:27:25,600
How could I leave you alone at home?

413
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,080
I'm really sorry.

414
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,671
It's not your fault.

415
00:27:29,712 --> 00:27:30,760
It's my problem.

416
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,360
I understand.

417
00:27:49,072 --> 00:27:50,560
Can you go to my company with me?

418
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:52,120
I have a favour to ask.

419
00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:56,680
Let's go.

420
00:28:17,473 --> 00:28:19,920
Step aside!

421
00:28:22,128 --> 00:28:23,760
Hang in there! Step aside!

422
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:28,920
Family, stop there!

423
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:31,137
No, this is my child!

424
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,830
Child, I'll wait for you out here!

425
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,440
Don't touch me!

426
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:38,747
Don't touch me!

427
00:28:39,192 --> 00:28:40,222
What's wrong with her?

428
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:41,496
It's paraquat intoxication.

429
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,560
Don't touch me!

430
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:46,655
I'm dirty! Don't touch me!

431
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,390
Don't touch me!

432
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:51,760
Be quiet! Listen to me!

433
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:52,901
Be quiet!

434
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:03,840
Hello, sorry to keep you waiting.

435
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:05,966
Can I help you?

436
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,160
There was a homicide
in Xiang Sheng Shipyard last night.

437
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,359
Homicide?

438
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,288
Yes.

439
00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:11,187
Homicide.

440
00:29:11,228 --> 00:29:12,600
Does it have anything to do with me?

441
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:15,680
The gun he used is made with
3D printing technology.

442
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:19,720
I don't think my company is the only
3D printing company in this city.

443
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,319
We know that.

444
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:24,159
That's why we are conducting searches
in the entire city,

445
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,269
including every staff's
computer of your company.

446
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,200
Please cooperate with us.

447
00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:29,998
No problem.

448
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:32,360
-You set it up.
-Okay.

449
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:33,516
Officers, this way please.

450
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:35,000
This way please.

451
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:41,238
Have a seat.

452
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:42,296
It's fine.

453
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,120
Come.

454
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:05,486
I'm sorry to waste your time.

455
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:06,920
It turned out to be of little help.

456
00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:10,749
I heard from your secretary that
you didn't come to the company yesterday.

457
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:12,655
Yes.

458
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,100
Something came up.

459
00:30:14,903 --> 00:30:16,183
He rested at my house.

460
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:19,021
And ended up with
stress cardiomyopathy.

461
00:30:19,612 --> 00:30:20,712
He almost died.

462
00:30:21,678 --> 00:30:23,237
I was in and out of consciousness
for two days at home.

463
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:25,379
Luckily, she came in time
and took me to the hospital.

464
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,200
We just came from the hospital.

465
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:28,914
Okay.

466
00:30:28,955 --> 00:30:30,085
Sorry for bothering you today.

467
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:31,453
Let's go.

468
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:32,742
Take care.

469
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:44,937
The police left?

470
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:47,326
They left.

471
00:30:52,248 --> 00:30:53,298
What did they say?

472
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:56,821
There was a homicide
in Xiang Sheng Shipyard.

473
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,597
They came to check so soon.

474
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:01,335
Yes.

475
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,400
And they said it was homicide not suicide.

476
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,830
The police already got suspicious.

477
00:31:11,492 --> 00:31:12,602
Impossible.

478
00:31:12,824 --> 00:31:14,891
Didn't we falsify the scene?

479
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:16,548
Under that urgent situation,

480
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:19,280
I can't guarantee there was no flaw
even if it was falsified.

481
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:32,771
The police already got
suspicious anyway.

482
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:34,880
You can evacuate first if you're afraid.

483
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:36,356
What about you?

484
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,229
I have to complete my mission.

485
00:31:39,434 --> 00:31:40,314
Have you forgotten

486
00:31:40,593 --> 00:31:43,333
Xia Guang Yuan is the final
target of this operation.

487
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:46,675
Perhaps...

488
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,640
we can go after another person.

489
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:54,491
From the first day you joined the project,

490
00:31:54,532 --> 00:31:56,539
the first thing I emphasized was
information security!

491
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,000
The information security!

492
00:31:58,466 --> 00:31:59,876
You're experienced too.

493
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,869
It's not that you don't
know how rampant...

494
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,290
those economic espionages are!

495
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:06,058
Do not use the Internet if it's a secret!

496
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:07,699
This is the basic working principle!

497
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,310
How could you violate it?

498
00:32:11,164 --> 00:32:12,144
I'm sorry, sir.

499
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:14,400
The email was indeed yours.

500
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:16,280
You should reconfirm
it with me as well!

501
00:32:16,321 --> 00:32:18,280
Moreover, when did I ever ask you...

502
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:20,371
to send the data of the project
to my personal email?

503
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,675
Sorry, sir. It's my fault.

504
00:32:23,785 --> 00:32:25,055
That was when we were in Ningjiang.

505
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:26,129
I thought it was urgent,

506
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,360
so I sent it to you.

507
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,700
You...

508
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,450
Get out.

509
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,500
Surprise.

510
00:34:14,528 --> 00:34:16,288
I went to Mi Gu's
neighbourhood to verify.

511
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:18,577
According to the property staff,

512
00:34:18,618 --> 00:34:22,216
he saw a man like Zhuo Ran
appeared at Mi Gu's door...

513
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:23,627
at the night of the case.

514
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,660
So he has an alibi
on the night of the case.

515
00:34:28,924 --> 00:34:29,804
Yes.

516
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:31,436
Rao Zhi,

517
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:33,000
do we have to bring
him over to interrogate?

518
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:41,800
This person
keep popping up in the case,

519
00:34:42,225 --> 00:34:44,799
but there has been no direct evidence
pointing to him.

520
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:45,928
Either...

521
00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:48,390
it's true that he is innocent...

522
00:34:48,431 --> 00:34:50,371
or he is an expert of
avoiding detection.

523
00:34:51,496 --> 00:34:54,880
There's nothing we can get
if we question him now.

524
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,200
Then what should we do now?

525
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,840
Just keep an eye on him
and see what his next move is.

526
00:35:01,153 --> 00:35:02,023
Understood!

527
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,040
Are you free?

528
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,250
Tang, here's another toast for you.

529
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:24,040
Mr. Zhuo, taste this.

530
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:30,240
Mr. Zhuo,

531
00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:32,040
it's true.

532
00:35:32,744 --> 00:35:34,240
I really appreciate
that you could come.

533
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,279
I'm really upset today.

534
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,200
It's true.

535
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,680
I really appreciate

536
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:42,240
you could come and accompany me.

537
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:43,735
Here,

538
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:45,440
I drink to you.

539
00:35:53,748 --> 00:35:54,680
Is this 110?

540
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:56,320
I want to file a report.

541
00:36:20,956 --> 00:36:22,800
Mr. Zhuo, I am Tang Lin.

542
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,579
I'm at Xia Guang Police Station.

543
00:36:25,674 --> 00:36:27,184
Can you come and pick me up?

544
00:36:27,508 --> 00:36:28,388
Okay.

545
00:36:45,075 --> 00:36:46,135
Mr. Zhuo,

546
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:47,538
yesterday after you left,

547
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:49,800
I shouldn't have gone up to sing.

548
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:52,078
I had a few drinks after that.

549
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:54,280
Then I didn't remember
what happened after that.

550
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:55,803
When I woke up,

551
00:36:56,552 --> 00:37:00,000
I was on the bed in a hotel
and there was a lady sleeping beside me.

552
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,488
After that, the police came and said

553
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:05,693
I was suspected of prostitution.

554
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,222
I didn't even remember
how I went to the hotel...

555
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:10,480
and how I checked in.

556
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,405
Why did you drink that much?

557
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:18,640
Didn't I tell you to wait for me?

558
00:37:20,192 --> 00:37:21,533
I shouldn't have drunk that much.

559
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:25,650
I'm doomed if the institute finds out.

560
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:27,499
How could the institute know it?

561
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:28,799
But if teacher knew it...

562
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,110
Rest assured.
I won't say a word to Professor Xia.

563
00:37:33,943 --> 00:37:35,403
It's not what I meant.

564
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:40,212
I know what you're afraid of.

565
00:37:40,898 --> 00:37:42,720
Dr. Tang, actually, you can take it easy.

566
00:37:43,448 --> 00:37:45,028
With your qualifications,

567
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,100
you won't run out of options
even if you leave the institute.

568
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:50,960
Instead,

569
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:54,398
you might have more room
for development if you leave,

570
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,370
comparing to the fixed
wage you currently get.

571
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,120
I would never even think of this.

572
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:04,261
Think about it.

573
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,703
If you own a private jet,

574
00:38:06,753 --> 00:38:09,897
you could date your girlfriend
at any place in the world and enjoy...

575
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:12,318
the fun of scientific research
and financial freedom.

576
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:15,594
You will have the means
to make a bolder choice.

577
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:21,440
Mr. Zhuo,

578
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:23,680
do you have connections?

579
00:38:30,674 --> 00:38:34,538
For a person who burnt seven cakes
in one night,

580
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:37,430
the success just now was destined
to be an unforgettable moment.

581
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:40,857
Do you have anything
to tell me and Er Miao?

582
00:38:41,274 --> 00:38:43,167
The ninth wonder of humanity!

583
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:45,960
Put me down.
There's some crumbs on the table.

584
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:47,640
Where are you going?

585
00:38:49,836 --> 00:38:51,306
Put me down!

586
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:53,986
He left us behind.

587
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:58,748
Put me down.
There's some crumbs on the table!

588
00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:04,319
Perhaps the only thing a man in a rut
could see is love.

589
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:28,681
Take it easy.

590
00:39:28,722 --> 00:39:29,732
Dr. Zhang.

591
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:31,400
I'm sorry.

592
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:36,160
How could someone show interest
in a rough guy like you?

593
00:39:37,595 --> 00:39:40,475
The does anyone show interest in a
gentleman like you?

594
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,341
Man, can you not poke at my sore spot?

595
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:47,791
Are you bringing food for her?

596
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:50,121
Yes.
Where is Xia Chu?

597
00:39:50,398 --> 00:39:51,434
She is at the Emergency Department.

598
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:52,495
Does she have a patient?

599
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,120
You didn't know?

600
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:55,640
What happened?

601
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,920
The person you guys saved went missing
during her shift.

602
00:40:00,337 --> 00:40:01,720
Chief Chen is very mad.

603
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,790
So she was sent to
the Emergency Department.

604
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:07,070
Just consider it as a training.

605
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:10,640
I'll go and visit her.

606
00:40:13,005 --> 00:40:16,720
You have no hesitation in pursuing a girl.

607
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,207
Being a soldier is busy,

608
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:20,440
I have no time to hesitate.

609
00:40:27,753 --> 00:40:29,080
I should learn from you.

610
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:46,089
I know you doctors are neat,

611
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,910
so I made you a handmade soap.

612
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,060
I hope you like it.

613
00:40:51,261 --> 00:40:52,360
You specially made it for me?

614
00:41:25,475 --> 00:41:26,480
It's me.

615
00:41:27,957 --> 00:41:29,120
Can I help you?

616
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,400
I just used the soap you gave to me.

617
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,670
You just used it?

618
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,816
I'm not willing to use it.

619
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,280
It'll be gone if I finished it.

620
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,090
Do you like it?

621
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,760
It's good.

622
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:49,960
It has a faint fragrance...

623
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,821
and it's not stimulating.

624
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,650
It doesn't hurt my hands.

625
00:41:55,503 --> 00:41:56,400
It's great.

626
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,600
Do...

627
00:41:58,992 --> 00:42:00,652
Do you have time on weekend?

628
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,672
I would like to go see you.

629
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:05,460
Didn't I say I wanted to buy books
but I didn't?

630
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,320
Mum, I'm going to school.

631
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:08,251
I love you.

632
00:42:08,697 --> 00:42:09,800
Stay safe!

633
00:42:16,605 --> 00:42:18,085
It might not work on weekend.

634
00:42:18,276 --> 00:42:20,886
I promised Xiao Jun to fly kite with him.

635
00:42:21,676 --> 00:42:22,720
How about this?

636
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:25,662
I'll go with you guys, can I?

637
00:42:28,142 --> 00:42:30,392
The playground is not ours.

638
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:31,761
Why do you need my permission?

639
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:33,159
You can go if you want.

640
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,335
Okay.

641
00:42:34,376 --> 00:42:35,826
That's the deal.

642
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,810
See you this weekend.

643
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:40,989
Okay, goodbye.

644
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:42,120
Goodbye.

645
00:42:54,469 --> 00:42:56,418
Doctor, doctor, listen to me.

646
00:42:56,459 --> 00:42:57,339
What's going on?

647
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,710
When can we leave?

648
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:00,475
Doctor!

649
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:02,640
Give me a reply!

650
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:05,191
When can my daughter recover?

651
00:43:05,925 --> 00:43:08,289
Didn't you hear what I told you just now?

652
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,560
Your daughter is in a
very dangerous situation.

653
00:43:10,878 --> 00:43:13,160
We'll keep on
treating her after the hemoperfusion.

654
00:43:13,912 --> 00:43:15,543
It's a difficult process.

655
00:43:15,955 --> 00:43:16,969
So we need you, her family,

656
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,090
and the patient to cooperate.

657
00:43:18,131 --> 00:43:19,621
It's too hard.

658
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:21,699
I already spent more than 5000 dollars.

659
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,080
What should I do next?

660
00:43:23,793 --> 00:43:25,361
Moreover, isn't she already awake?

661
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,902
Why can't she be discharged?

662
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,579
Do you really have to drain us
before you let her go?

663
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,699
Do you know what paraquat is?

664
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,281
Isn't that just herbicide?

665
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:34,889
I heard that it's not even poisonous.

666
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:36,319
Who did you hear from?

667
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,239
I'm the doctor.

668
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,580
Can you listen to me?

669
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,728
Ten milligrams of paraquat can be fatal.

670
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:43,359
Your daughter's current situation
is very dangerous.

671
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,530
Do you know that?

672
00:44:16,315 --> 00:44:17,215
Senior,

673
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,691
was the paraquat poisoned
patient who got admitted...

674
00:44:19,732 --> 00:44:22,882
to the gastroenterology department
of your hospital cured?

675
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:42,120
Fourteen days after admission,

676
00:44:42,161 --> 00:44:43,694
the blood oxygenation began to drop.

677
00:44:43,735 --> 00:44:45,235
It was at 60 percent.

678
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:46,815
The oxygen partial pressure was bad too.

679
00:44:46,856 --> 00:44:48,382
We put the patient on a respirator.

680
00:44:48,423 --> 00:44:50,603
It resulted in aggravating
the alveolar damage.

681
00:44:50,872 --> 00:44:52,040
It started a vicious cycle.

682
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:53,981
He passed away last week.

683
00:44:58,254 --> 00:44:59,784
Didn't I tell you...

684
00:45:00,985 --> 00:45:01,960
Tell me what?

685
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,369
I thought you were the patient's family.

686
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,550
You're really close to
the patient's family now.

687
00:45:09,929 --> 00:45:11,278
They even bring you food.

688
00:45:15,263 --> 00:45:16,133
You succeeded?

689
00:45:17,176 --> 00:45:18,183
Have a taste.

690
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,360
I'm hungry too.

691
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,680
Let me taste it.

692
00:45:45,303 --> 00:45:46,323
It tastes good.

693
00:45:47,275 --> 00:45:49,440
You said it tastes good without
knowing what taste it is?
