=Episode 22=

3
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,510
I confessed my feelings.

4
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,330
It's so embarrassing!

5
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,730
Surprise!

6
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,850
Cut it out.

7
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,690
Aunt, did you cross over here?

8
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,350
Liang Mu Ze, let's walk around.

9
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,499
Now?

10
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,710
Yes.

11
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,580
Isn't it a shame if we don't walk around
with such a nice dress?

12
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,150
-Aren't you sleepy?
-I'm not sleepy.

13
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,790
Didn't I take a nap just now?

14
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,930
I'm feeling great now!

15
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,600
Okay.

16
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,100
♫It feels sweet whenever I think of you♫

17
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,840
♫Even the night breeze revels♫

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,800
♫The wind blows and the butterflies fly♫

19
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,620
♫They are in pairs in the bush♫

20
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,290
♫The night deepens
My longing intensifies♫

21
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,560
♫What do we mean to each other?♫

22
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,880
♫In the four seasons
And to the ends of the Earth♫

23
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,300
♫The luckiest thing
Is to have you with me♫

24
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,040
♫The flower in our heart♫

25
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,980

Let go! Let go!

30
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,470
♫This familiar string of numbers♫

31
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,290
No, I'm running out of energy!

32
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,870
-Here.
-Bring it on.

33
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,820
Three, two...

34
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,900
Mother, why can't it fly?

35
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,450
I don't know. Perhaps we did it wrongly.

36
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,210
You messed up!

37
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,890
Dr Zhang.

38
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,450
Why are you here?

39
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,890
Perhaps it's destiny.

40
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,870
We meet again.

41
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,470
-Come!
-Don't touch my kite!

42
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,510
There's a problem with your kite.

43
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,870
How do you know that?

44
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,990
I'm a doctor. Of course I know.

45
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,170
Let me fix it for you.

46
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,590
Okay, you guys fix it.

47
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,370
I'll go get you some water.

48
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,120
Here, take this.

49
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,450
Let me take a look.

50
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,390
Can you do it?

51
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,570
Rest assured.

52
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,920
You were a tadpole...

53
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,210
when I played the kite.

54
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,220
A tadpole?

55
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,250
A frog's baby.

56
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,000
I know what the problem is.

57
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,460
Why am I a frog's baby?

58
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,010
You're not the baby of a frog.

59
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,650
I'll tell you later.

60
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,690
Drink your medicine.

61
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,040
I don't want to drink it.

62
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,730
The kite has to be fixed
when it has a problem.

63
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,490
People should take medicine
when they are sick.

64
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,110
Can you guarantee that my kite will fly
after I drink the medicine?

65
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,130
Of course.

66
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,850
It's not only the kite,

67
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,830
you might also fly
if you finish the medicine.

68
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,550
Okay.

69
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,950
Keep your words.

70
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,050
You have my words.

71
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,770
Slow down, don't choke yourself.

72
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,310
-It's not bitter, right?
-It's not bitter.

73
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,930
Okay, give it a try.

74
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,530
Okay.

75
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,870
-Pull it longer.
-Enough.

76
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,030
Enough.

77
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,550
-Ready!
-Okay, then.

78
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,830
Here. Ready, go!

79
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,810
Run!

80
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,730
It's flying!

81
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,410
Run!

82
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,460
-Run and it will...
-Feed the line!

83
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,640
Feed the line!

84
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,880
I can't ride anymore.

85
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,110
I shouldn't have listened to you
to come here by bicycle.

86
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,130
We should've been here by now
if we came by car.

87
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,740
Are you in a hurry?

88
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,150
I'm exhausted.

89
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,130
How can you operate
when you have such poor stamina?

90
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,010
I'm here to enjoy the cosy sunshine.

91
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,620
I'm not here to train with you.

92
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,510
Can't you let me relax
as it's hard to have a rest day?

93
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,910
Then just go home,
and lie down on the sofa to read.

94
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,870
It's very pleasant.

95
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,870
So...

96
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,830
are you jealous?

97
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,030
I'm not.

98
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,190
You are.

99
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,180
You're jealous.

100
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm not.

101
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,530
You can't lie to me, Liang Mu Ze.

102
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,170
You drank my water.

103
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,700
Yes.

104
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,630
What do you mean yes?

105
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,460
Which question are you answering?

106
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,240
Your water, I'm giving it back to you.

107
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,150
Are you sure?

108
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,330
I'm sure.

109
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,740
What are you doing?

110
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,770
Disinfecting it!

111
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,550
Zhang Yi Chi, you're so amazing!

112
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,890
You can fix everything.

113
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,150
Didn't I tell you?

114
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,250
I'm an old player in kite-flying.

115
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,170
Can you fly kites with me in the future?

116
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,880
Can you fly kites with me in the future?

117
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,630
As long as you're willing to.

118
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,710
Xiao Jun,

119
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,800
the question you asked me last time...

120
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,050
about marrying your mother.

121
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,170
To be honest,

122
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,290
I hope that...

123
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,290
I could be this fortunate.

124
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,610
I know...

125
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,270
luck is for those who are prepared.

126
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,470
So I plan to...

127
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,170
show my utmost sincerity...

128
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,210
and get along with her...

129
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,880
in ways that she prefers
and is comfortable with.

130
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,730
As for the result,

131
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,870
I have no idea too.

132
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,010
Even if you ask your mother this question,

133
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,630
she wouldn't know the answer either.

134
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,170
Give us some time, okay?

135
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,850
What if I say no?

136
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,390
If you say no,

137
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,650
I'll tear this string apart.

138
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,590
Don't.

139
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,910
Don't do it.

140
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm just kidding.

141
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,440
Just come to me if you have any problem.

142
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,420
Okay.

143
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,470
Take it.

144
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,450
Pull it tight.

145
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,970
Okay.

146
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,110
Pull it tight.

147
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,700
It's tight.

148
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,530
-Take a rest.
-Okay.

149
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,250
What are you writing?

150
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,810
A film script.

151
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,290
A script?

152
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,610
It's a job recommended by my friend.

153
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,990
It's a story about the comeback
of a single mother...

154
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,130
as a wedding gown designer.

155
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,460
Comrade Chen Meng Zhen,

156
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,770
how many secrets do you have
that I'm unaware of?

157
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,770
Dr Zhang, thank you.

158
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,030
Thanks for coming to play with Xiao Jun.

159
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,890
I can free up some time to write this.

160
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,810
I'm not here just to accompany Xiao Jun.

161
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,250
It doesn't matter,
as long as you're attentive.

162
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,610
It must be tough...

163
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,130
to take care...

164
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,290
of a kid alone, right?

165
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,510
It was a bit hectic at first.

166
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,170
I got used to it as time went by.

167
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,690
Actually, sometimes,
it's not that Xiao Jun needs me,

168
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,690
but it's I who need him instead.

169
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,840
It's Xiao Jun who makes me
have a deeper bond with this world.

170
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,150
When I wake up,

171
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,750
I'll find myself being fearless.

172
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,210
I didn't expect that it was my child
who'd teach me to be brave.

173
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,650
Isn't that incredible?

174
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,270
Sometimes, Xiao Jun and I
don't seem like a mother and a son.

175
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,360
We're more like friends.

176
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,380
For me,

177
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,700
he is a great child.

178
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,250
I hope that I am...

179
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,670
a good mother to him too.

180
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,240
You've done great...

181
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,270
as a first-time mother.

182
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,770
I think so too.

183
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,020
Eat it.

184
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,050
Take it.

185
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,010
The kite got loose!

186
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,110
Hurry, get it!

187
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,060
Just take a rest if you're tired.

188
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,670
Seems like it's easier to cheer a woman up
by provoking her...

189
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,090
rather than encouraging her.

190
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,470
What do you mean?

191
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,430
Be careful!

192
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,730
Are you all right?

193
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,870
Liang Mu Ze?

194
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,800
Xiao Jun?

195
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,620
Mr Zhang?

196
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,590
You guys...

197
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,770
What a coincidence!

198
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,310
Is this an encounter?

199
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,230
He said it was destiny that sent him here.

200
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,450
And he said I'm the son of a frog.

201
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,450
I...

202
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,710
I'm here to fix this kite.

203
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,450
Look.

204
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,730
Dr Zhang is quite idle.

205
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Captain Liang, you're quite idle too.

206
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,270
Mother, I want to drink water.

207
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,700
Okay, I'll take you there.

208
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,750
Dr Xia.

209
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,240
Dr Xia, what do you want to drink?

210
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,280
Mineral water will do, thank you.

211
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,240
Okay.

212
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,250
Didn't you have one already?

213
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,780
It's poisoned.

214
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,770
What do you two want to drink?

215
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,310
-I'll go with you.
-I'll go with you.

216
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,740
What?

217
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,910
You just ride the bicycle with me.

218
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,600
-I'll go buy the water.
-Just let Mr Zhang go with Ms Meng Zhen.

219
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,610
Right.

220
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,430
I'll go with you.

221
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,390
Okay.

222
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,730
I'm reliable.

223
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,030
-Let's go!
-Xiao Jun, let's go.

224
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,000
Let's go!

225
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,230
Let's go!

226
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,290
Xia Chu, don't be this childish, okay?

227
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,600
What do you mean by that?

228
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,070
Is it childish to blow bubbles?

229
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,770
I like it, it's none of your concern.

230
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,960
I'm talking about Zhang Yi Chi
and Meng Zhen.

231
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,140
You stay out of it.

232
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,170
It's not your concern too.

233
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,300
I know Zhang Yi Chi.

234
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,410
His love life is too complicated.

235
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,840
He doesn't want to get married
just because he has to.

236
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,840
He wishes to find his true love.

237
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,930
Is that wrong?

238
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,380
Right, it's not wrong.

239
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,960
But Meng Zhen can't be the cost
of his trial-and-error.

240
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,800
If you don't try it out,
how will you know if it's right or wrong?

241
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,560
For some men,

242
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,200
it's enough to be friends with them.

243
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,500
It's too dangerous to be lovers with them.

244
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,850
Nothing is more dangerous
than being a special forces soldier.

245
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,940
If it's wrong to be dangerous,

246
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,100
then what does the love
between Ms Meng Zhen...

247
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,080
and your comrade mean?

248
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,090
Was it wrong?

249
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,000
And...

250
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,930
Liang Mu Ze,

251
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,170
as you're a special forces soldier,

252
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,590
what kind of man are you?

253
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,310
I'm talking about Zhang Yi Chi.

254
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,590
Don't turn this on me.

255
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,630
Obviously, you're too subjective.

256
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,110
No matter if he is Zhuo Ran
or Zhang Yi Chi,

257
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,450
you're biased
against my mentor and friend.

258
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,610
I'll tell you what.

259
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,950
Zhang Yi Chi is my friend too.

260
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,270
Don't compare him to Zhuo Ran, get it?

261
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,150
You don't have the right
to make the decision for your friend.

262
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,790
I didn't make decisions for him.

263
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,350
I just dissuade him in good faith, okay?

264
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,790
They are not suitable, understand?

265
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,390
Being suitable
may give us a right relationship,

266
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,190
but it will never explain
how love happens.

267
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,510
Being suitable means nothing to love!

268
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,770
The water is here.

269
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,910
Get off.

270
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,970
We're here.

271
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,989
Slow down.
(Passer-by Bookstore)

272
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,150
Wash your hands first.

273
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,170
Okay.

274
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,960
He has been smiling all day long.

275
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,940
You've worked hard today.

276
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,350
No, I'm happy too.

277
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,850
It's been a while
since I've been so happy.

278
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,830
Just now...

279
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,790
Right.

280
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,300
Mu Ze told me that you saved his life.

281
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,450
So he'll help you
if you have any problems.

282
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,310
Similarly,

283
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,160
he knows what kind of woman
is suitable to be your partner.

284
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,250
He considers you a friend,
and speaks bluntly.

285
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,010
Don't mind him.

286
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,160
Are you comforting me?

287
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,410
I think your greatest virtue...

288
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,940
is being considerate.

289
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,250
I really admire that.

290
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,630
Okay, then.

291
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,230
You're always welcome to my book store,
I'll give you discounts.

292
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,010
I'll come here every day,
as long as I'm free.

293
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,190
Okay.

294
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,110
How much do you think they heard?

295
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,070
I don't know.

296
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,690
Mu Ze, I have good news and bad news.
Which one do you want to hear first?

297
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,790
Good news.

298
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,660
Aunt already knew you kissed Xia Chu.

299
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,950
She is very pleased with your progress.

300
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,530
What about the bad news?

301
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,350
She happens to be here for work
and she is currently at home,

302
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,450
preparing for your second renovation.

303
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,860
Keep her calm first.

304
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,670
Okay.

305
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,380
My mother is here.

306
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,250
Don't forget that you're my girlfriend.

307
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,240
Even after talking back to me just now?

308
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,420
You think you're right...

309
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,640
and I think I did nothing wrong.

310
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,850
I don't know what to say,

311
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,350
aside from shelving disputes.

312
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,920
Before going out today,

313
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,930
you did that to me...

314
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,630
to make Liang Shao Xue...

315
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,470
believe in our relationship, right?

316
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,030
Is that what you think?

317
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,390
I prefer to get a precise answer
than a rhetorical question.

318
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,140
Xia Chu.

319
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,170
Don't try to sweet-talk me.

320
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,670
Liang Mu Ze, do you like me?

321
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,070
What about you?

322
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:30,940
I don't.

323
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,090
I do.

324
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,730
And then?

325
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,400
Are you apologizing...

327
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,570
to write off everything
that happened today?

328
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,250
I apologized because I made you uneasy.

329
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,540
You can choose to break down my unease.

330
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,010
You know you can do it.

331
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,650
I can't.

332
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,740
This is the best I can do now.

333
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,350
Why?

334
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,140
Why do you hesitate?

335
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,070
Is the list of redeployment confirmed?

336
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,330
Is it about the military information
that you need to keep secret?

337
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,480
Yes.

338
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,570
Well, so much...

339
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,810
for your affection.

340
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,850
-Xia Chu...
-Look at you.

341
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,850
You've always been
this obnoxiously rational.

342
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,810
But...

343
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,720
maybe this is the real you.

344
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,670
I accept your apology.

345
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,530
Liang Mu Ze,

346
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,530
don't ever mess with me.

347
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,650
What happened?

348
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,890
These are my plates.

349
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,190
Who threw them out?

350
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,630
I have no idea.

351
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,770
Aunt, you can't do this!

352
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,190
You can't take this away!

353
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,230
Why not?

354
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,750
Didn't you hear what the master said?

355
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,670
You can't raise this cat anymore!
Give it to me!

356
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,390
You guys hurry back!
I can't do this anymore!

357
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,570
You guys are back!

358
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,990
So this is how you keep her calm?

359
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,640
How can I keep her calm?

360
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,150
You're Xia Chu, right?

361
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,180
You're prettier in person.

362
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,440
It's really rare.

363
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,150
Aunt, I'm flattered.

364
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,010
You guys are finally back.

365
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,190
It's harder than I thought.

366
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,830
Hello, aunt.

367
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,790
Hello.

368
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,440
Have you registered for marriage?

369
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,880
No.

370
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,340
We only went to the seaside.

371
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,190
That's good.

372
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,390
Xia Chu, let me tell you.

373
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,990
Marriage should be taken seriously.

374
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,890
You can't listen to Meaty
about this matter.

375
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,810
Meaty?

376
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,120
Meaty is Mu Ze.

377
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,020
He only ate meat when he was little.

378
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,670
He was a fat boy up until he 15 years old.

379
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,630
Right, brother?

380
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,700
Xia Chu, tell you what.

381
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,240
About you and Meaty, I...

382
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,450
Why did you bring these cutlery back?

383
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,650
Aunt, these cutlery
are still fine and usable.

384
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,910
I'll buy you a new set.

385
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,750
You can't use these anymore.

386
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,810
It's all right.

387
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,990
Who told you they're not usable?

388
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,730
Liang Mu Ze!

389
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,590
Why did you hold the cat?

390
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,870
Put the cat down!

391
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,150
Liang Mu Ze, I'll tell you what!

392
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,340
Liang Mu Ze, put that cat down!

393
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,750
You can't hold this cat
because it has fleas!

394
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,790
Aunt, don't worry.

395
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,270
I've de-wormed it.

396
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,190
That's useless. It's still dirty.

397
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,390
You can't raise it.

398
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,490
Come, give it to me.

399
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,010
Meaty!

400
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,270
I'll tell you what.

401
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,150
I have found an adopter.

402
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,710
It's one of my friends in Ningjiang.

403
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,790
-They have many cats in their house.
-What a relief!

404
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,300
You guys are busy working every day.

405
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,500
How can you guys take care of it?

406
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,450
It's good for either side to send it away,
right?

407
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,230
You know nothing!

408
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,650
You're really stubborn!

409
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,780
What is this?

410
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,290
What are you pulling out?

411
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,260
It's a tapping device.

412
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,010
You didn't...

413
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,010
install this, right?

414
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,280
Of course not.

415
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,760
I handed the tapping device
to the technical department.

416
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,270
They said it's a professional device.

417
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,930
Yes, the installation technique
was professional too.

418
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,570
We searched everywhere that day.

419
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,410
But we didn't expect...

420
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,830
he'd put a bugging device
in the cat's collar.

421
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:18,820
Thank you.

422
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,070
-Did you leak any confidential info?
-No.

423
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,660
This is the basic military capacity.

424
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,700
After leaving the military camp,
my chat context is only about my life.

425
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,800
Moreover, I've taken preventive measures
that day...

426
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,500
after I suspected someone broke
into my house.

427
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,440
Good.

428
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,060
Did you check the camera footage
of the district?

429
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,100
I checked it on the day.

430
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,200
Nothing was found.

431
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,970
Who do you think it might be?

432
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,860
Zhuo Ran.

433
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,240
He asked someone to switch...

434
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,160
the sleeping pills
which Xia Chu gave to me.

435
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,700
But based on what he said,

436
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,770
he didn't know the pills were for me.

437
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,230
He did it out of his concern for Xia Chu.

438
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,410
I certainly never believed
in his explanation.

439
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,600
But I don't understand.

440
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,300
Because Xia Chu improvised
the pills for me the night before.

441
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,950
The pills happened to be switched
the next morning.

442
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,930
And I found this tapping device today.

443
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,210
All I could think is him.

444
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,600
Do you guys have any history
before the pills were switched?

445
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,370
I wouldn't call it that.

446
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,190
Just that, he was Xia Chu's first love.

447
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,430
Xia Chu is currently staying in my house.

448
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,930
So you think he did that for Xia Chu.

449
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,750
I found no other reason.

450
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,460
Mr Zhuo?

451
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,750
You're here.

452
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,950
Did you ask someone to keep an eye on him
after the medical forum?

453
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,330
I did.

454
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,030
But this guy has high vigilance.

455
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,060
Our man got ditched a few times.

456
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,610
According to the information available,

457
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,740
we only know that he frequently travelled
between Ningjiang and Dong'an.

458
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,150
But we didn't know where he went,
and who he met.

459
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,910
He went to Dong'an?

460
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,510
Mr Zhuo, is the matter of a paymaster...

461
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,520
that's going to start
a pharmaceutical company in Dong'an...

462
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,750
that you'd mentioned before reliable?

463
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,990
Of course.

464
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,050
Professor Xia already agreed
to be our technical consultant.

465
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,730
Teacher agreed?

466
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,180
It's currently in a confidential phase.

467
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,930
When the conditions are right,
his inauguration will be announced.

468
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,630
No wonder.

469
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,720
No wonder what?

470
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,980
He sent an email to me
via his personal mailbox.

471
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,030
Asking me to send him the data of a kind
of sedative in the current clinical trial.

472
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,790
I thought there was something wrong.

473
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,780
I thought his email was hacked.

474
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,620
You are the apprentice
whom he's most proud of.

475
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,800
He certainly wishes to take you with him
if he leaves the institute.

476
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,790
Then...

477
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,020
Then he should tell me in advance.

478
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,870
He even intentionally got mad at me,
and asked the security to talk to me.

479
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,650
What was all that about?

480
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,470
Professor Xia has his own difficulty.

481
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,800
The point is there are many
inexplicable things in the current phase.

482
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,980
There will be many gossips,
especially in your institute.

483
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,880
We should follow the procedure.

484
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,660
You're right.

485
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,670
But I didn't expect Teacher
would leave too.

486
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,000
Who wouldn't leave if there's a way?

487
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,670
Dr Tang, I'm not going to deceive you.

488
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,670
This is a factory building contract
in two copies.

489
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,190
Take a look.

490
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,950
Let's sign the contract
if you think it's applicable.

491
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,930
We'll discuss the rest later.

492
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,690
Mr Zhuo,

493
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,230
the consultation fee
is 100,000 dollars per month?

494
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,150
This is the fee
for the preliminary preparation.

495
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,670
We'll pay you immediately
after you sign the contract.

496
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,930
This is for your first month.

497
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,760
After the factory is built,

498
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,040
it'll be adjusted
according to your personal performance.

499
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,130
The greater the contribution,
the higher the wages.

500
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,780
Did Teacher already sign this?

501
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,790
He did.

502
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,370
After all,
your institute is only a platform.

503
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,340
It's obvious that we can give you
more than the vanity title...

504
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,610
it gives you.

505
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,070
I kept reviewing
the background of this guy,

506
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,050
but nothing wrong was found.

507
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,340
What about the 3D-printed gun?

508
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,550
Currently, there's no proof
that he downloaded and printed it.

509
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,210
Moreover, he happened to have an alibi...

510
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,190
on the night Gui died.

511
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,960
Any clue at Yunshan Tunnel?

512
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,480
Perhaps we were too late.

513
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,060
The transaction parties had escaped.

514
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,510
Or it might be false information.

515
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,990
We set up roadblocks
and conducted searches,

516
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:15,710
but no suspected transaction parties
and cars were found.

517
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,550
Uncle Rao,

518
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,920
Xiao Xue was at Yunshan Tunnel that night.

519
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,540
She said she dozed off,
and Zhuo Ran saved her...

520
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,780
and brought her to the hospital.

521
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,840
Zhuo Ran?

522
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,800
He saved Xue at Yunshan Tunnel?

523
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,760
Yes.

524
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,640
Why?

525
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,040
Based on what he said,

526
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,890
it was because Xue wore Xia Chu's clothes.

527
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,460
That's strange.

528
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,440
If he was one of the transaction parties,

529
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,278
his behaviour was tantamount...

530
00:30:53,362 --> 00:30:56,080
to exposing himself
to the sight of the police.

531
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,560
What if Xue didn't doze off,
but witnessed the whole process?

532
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,860
Isn't he afraid?

533
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,960
Some people are born to be a gamester.

534
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,130
Right.

535
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,580
Erasing any trace
after killing someone...

536
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,460
is a kind of disguise.

537
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,390
It might be an advanced method
to hide oneself...

538
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,290
by fully exposing oneself to light.

539
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,860
Just keep an eye on him.

540
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,190
I'm sure there's another move coming.

541
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,440
And given everything we know,

542
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,958
Xue and Xia Chu can't stay
in my house anymore...

543
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:33,680
before the infiltrator is captured.

544
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,960
We have to make other arrangements
for them.

545
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:41,050
It's not as simple as making arrangements
for Xue and Xia Chu.

546
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,390
A tapping device
was installed in the house...

547
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,600
of a military officer
of Special Forces Brigade.

548
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,340
It's a big deal.

549
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,430
We have to find out the identity...

550
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,890
of the infiltrator and his purpose
as soon as possible...

551
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,130
to avoid further losses.

552
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,100
I already informed your unit.

553
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,580
Brigade Commander Dong
will be here tomorrow.

554
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,580
Let's have a brief meeting,
and go through all the information.

555
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,620
Okay.

556
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,460
Those pills were for me.

557
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,960
He didn't know that.

558
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,340
Then how did he know you had these pills?

559
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,970
Miss Lan.

560
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:55,590
Girl, are you having relationship
with Liang Mu Ze?

561
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,680
No.

562
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,740
Then why did Aunt Mu Min
call to congratulate me...

563
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,680
and address me as her in-law?

564
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,110
His mother asked him to go
on blind dates, but he didn't want to.

565
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,530
So he asked me to pretend
to be his girlfriend.

566
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,990
When did this happen?

567
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,520
You actually agreed?

568
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,690
I don't want to move.

569
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,710
Then do you like him?

570
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,050
Be honest with me.

571
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,750
No...

572
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,780
You don't like him?

573
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,920
I don't know.

574
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,570
What do you mean by that?

575
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,080
I just don't know.

576
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,680
Miss Lan, how about you?

577
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,530
How did you and my father fall in love?

578
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,610
How did you know...

579
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,130
he's the one?

580
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,310
Girl, I'm hanging up.

581
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,960
I'll call you back
as I've got something to do.

582
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,190
What is the matter?

583
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,980
Xia, you're back.

584
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,889
Come on in.

585
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,719
What's wrong?

586
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:43,110
Actually, what I'm most worried
is not about losing my reputation,

587
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,409
but dragging Tang into this
due to my negligence.

588
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,920
He is a talented youth.

589
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,190
If he can't continue participating
in the project,

590
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,130
it's not only his future
that would get affected.

591
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,798
It'd be a great loss for the project...

592
00:34:57,882 --> 00:35:01,660
and the institute's
long-term development too.

593
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,050
It won't happen.

594
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,810
You already clarified the causality...

595
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,520
of the matter.

596
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,660
It was omission,
not criminal, like you said.

597
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,420
The institute will find out...

598
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,070
which part that went wrong.

599
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,330
Just consider it as taking a break.

600
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,761
Actually, for the past two days,

601
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:49,110
I've been thinking what I can do
if I can't do research anymore.

602
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,410
I can't do anything else.

603
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,650
I can't even steam an egg custard.

604
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,800
Do you think it's easy
to steam an egg custard?

605
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,700
Even the most able housewife
can't guarantee...

606
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,840
that every egg custard she steams
have no air bubbles.

607
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,250
Moreover,

608
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,040
you're not a housewife.

609
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,700
You are Professor Xia.

610
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,840
A difference in profession
makes one feel worlds apart.

611
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,710
If such a day came,

612
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,970
would you hold it against me?

613
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,170
I've always held it against you,

614
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,750
from the first day I met you.

615
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,290
Do you remember...

616
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,950
you got admitted to our hospital...

617
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,020
when you first suffered from tuberculosis?

618
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,030
You had high fever,

619
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,750
haematemesis and cough.

620
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,870
We performed bronchoscopy for you.

621
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,881
You even refused to use anaesthesia...

622
00:37:00,965 --> 00:37:03,515
because you were afraid
it'll affect your intelligence.

623
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:15,010
The patient we dislike most
is those like you...

624
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,830
who do not cooperate.

625
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,820
Why did you marry me and have child
with me if you dislike me?

626
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,800
That was because...

627
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,450
I found a farewell letter
under your pillow.

628
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,230
You said you were willing
to donate your body...

629
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,520
for medical research purposes
if you couldn't be cured.

630
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,570
And you said,

631
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,500
you're particularly grateful
to a nurse named Lan Zi Yu.

632
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,970
She couldn't find your blood vessel
every time she put you on a drip,

633
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,180
causing her to be on the verge
of breaking down.

634
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,570
You thanked her for giving you...

635
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,760
nice memories...

636
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,320
and for cheering you up
at your final moments.

637
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,420
Xia, is there anything harder than this?

638
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,150
I dislike every flaw your father has,

639
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,670
but I want to love every virtue he has.

640
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,920
Are you like that too?

641
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,210
Did you go to the police station?

642
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,990
Why are you still up?

643
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,010
I can't sleep.

644
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,810
Xue sent aunt to the airport.

645
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,980
I know.

646
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,110
I have something for you.

647
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,210
Hold on.

648
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,710
This is the present
that your mother gave to me when she left.

649
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,850
I'll give it back to you.

650
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,360
She gave it to you.

651
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,130
Why did you give it to me?

652
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,780
I can't have it.

653
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,100
Why?

654
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,130
We're only putting on a show for her.

655
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,950
It's too much if I take it.

656
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,210
What do you mean?

657
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,090
She wanted me to ask my parents
to have a meeting with her.

658
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,760
And she asked me to persuade you
to have a career change.

659
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,210
Then how did you reply her?

660
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,090
I can only tell her we have no plans
to marry at this point.

661
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,641
We can have a fake relationship,
but we can't have fake marriage.

662
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:16,835
Marriage will get both sets
of parents involved.

663
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,020
You can blame me
for not keeping my words,

664
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,600
you can ask me to move out too.

665
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,370
Anyway, I can't do this anymore.
I don't want to lie to your mother.

666
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:25,950
I mean,

667
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,050
how are you going to persuade me?

668
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,430
What?

669
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,470
About changing my career.

670
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,840
I'd like you to tell me about it.

671
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,270
I have nothing to say.

672
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,630
It's your choice to leave or stay.

673
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,590
Who do you think put the tapping device...

674
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,610
in Er Miao's collar?

675
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,960
I don't know.

676
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,280
Try to think.

677
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,580
Can you think of nothing?

678
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,250
Nothing.

679
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,900
Did you ever bring Zhuo Ran back here?

680
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,020
What do you mean?

681
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,220
Just what I said.

682
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,500
Of course not!

683
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,590
I have no object of suspicion!

684
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,190
Nothing jogs my memory,
and I didn't bring anyone back home!

685
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,490
No one!

686
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,450
I just...

687
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,980
Liang Mu Ze, I don't understand.

688
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,780
Why do you always take aim at Zhuo Ran?

689
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,770
To me,

690
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,970
he's a guy that I knew
when I was 18 years old.

691
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,080
His clean appearance in a white shirt...

692
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,920
was my youth.

693
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,070
How could he...?

694
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,560
How could I suspect him?

695
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,880
So you don't like men in green uniforms,
you like men in white shirts.

696
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,620
Will you listen properly?

697
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,960
Listen to my point, okay?

698
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,390
Calm down.

699
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,540
It's useless to be agitated.

700
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:52,820
Where are you going?

701
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,230
-Let go!
-I don't want to.

702
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,590
Let go of me!

703
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,610
I can't.

704
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,960
What?

705
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,180
Liang Mu Ze, we're even.

706
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,910
Do you think I'm medical waste?

707
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,070
You ditched me after using me.

708
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,410
I'm tired.

709
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,130
I want to rest.

710
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,830
You said Zhuo Ran
are the memories of your youth.

711
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,540
I have no objection about this matter.

712
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:19,410
But, Xia Chu, you need to know
the memories of youth...

713
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,150
are not completely reliable.

714
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,920
Have Zhuo Ran told you why he appeared
at the tunnel yesterday?

715
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,480
He said he passed by
while having night run.

716
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,880
Xia Chu,

717
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,810
the dangers in this world...

718
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:41,280
are much more than you think.

719
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,270
Guarding against strangers
is actually as important...

720
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,130
as guarding against familiar strangers.

721
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,070
So you should train yourself
when you're free.

722
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,670
Do not travel alone
and do not stay in a hotel alone.

723
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,230
Set your speed dial number on your phone
to call the police.

724
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:59,680
You can call the police
if anything happens.

725
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:01,820
Wherever you go,

726
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,490
you must remember the location
of the lifts and stairs.

727
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:06,890
And...

728
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,190
no matter how fast the lift is,

729
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,080
a person running can catch up to it
within three floors.

730
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,110
So if there's any contingency,

731
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,550
you must press the button
for more than three floors...

732
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,170
if you have to take the lift.

733
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,570
You can press multiple floors
to deceive the opponent...

734
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:20,550
if it's necessary.

735
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,060
If you really couldn't get away,

736
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,950
just keep yourself
surrounded by the crowd,

737
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,130
and yell for help.

738
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,930
Anything around you
can be used as a makeshift weapon.

739
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,480
Anyway, Dr Xia,

740
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,670
you need to learn to protect yourself.

741
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,960
You'll have the chance
to save more people...

742
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,170
only if you can protect yourself.

743
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:42,490
Do you get it?

744
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,180
Why did you suddenly tell me these?

745
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,530
I'm going to be redeployed.

746
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,330
When do you leave?

747
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:57,510
It's not certain.

748
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:02,010
So do you really have nothing...

749
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,910
to tell me about my career change?

750
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,740
Goodnight, Liang Mu Ze.

751
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,940
Goodnight.
