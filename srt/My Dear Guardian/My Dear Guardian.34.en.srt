1
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,770
=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 34=

3
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,270
Liang Mu Ze!

4
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,690
It's you!

5
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,579
Long time no see.

6
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,970
Why are you here?

7
00:02:31,293 --> 00:02:33,610
We're invited to watch the drill but,

8
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,586
I did not expect to see you here.

9
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,826
So, is everybody okay?

10
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,426
Yeah,

11
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,650
pretty good.

12
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,520
Except for Songpaisarn.

13
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,186
He quit the team

14
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,090
and joined the mercenary army and then

15
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,386
he was killed

16
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,866
in an encounter with

17
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,829
Chinese troops.

18
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,120
I know.

19
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,690
I know.

20
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,770
What about you?

21
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,570
Sooner or later,

22
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,530
we will all be there.

23
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,010
Hey,

24
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,810
do you know his family?

25
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,730
I got a picture

26
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,250
from his body.

27
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,600
Can you pass this to them?

28
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,850
Thank you.

29
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,250
We were so young back then.

30
00:03:29,037 --> 00:03:31,617
Do you know who is this guy?

31
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,970
Pei Yu.

32
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,666
Attention to Team Thunder!

33
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,130
Get your equipment ready!

34
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,586
In 20 minutes,

35
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,666
gather and depart!

36
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,970
Yes, sir!

37
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,276
Why didn't Blue Team
set up their base camp

38
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,620
somewhere with proper roads?

39
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,210
Are you all right?

40
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,540
Hang in there.

41
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,050
Otherwise,

42
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,250
we can stop the car
and get some fresh air out there.

43
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,120
It's okay.

44
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,896
Look at you.

45
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,506
Professor already told us.

46
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,906
You could've skipped this trip

47
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,159
if you have bad motion sickness.

48
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,120
No way.

49
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,080
Our department is going
to elect the chief resident soon.

50
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,900
This is a merit.

51
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,080
I won't let you run alone.

52
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,986
Stop pushing me away.

53
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,490
I'm dying. Just let me lean on you.

54
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,746
(Attention to all vehicles.)

55
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,706
(Infantry Brigade from Red Team
just passed by.)

56
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,930
(Please take cover.)

57
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,050
Watch out.

58
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,100
A fleet is coming.

59
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,900
Why should we take cover?

60
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,630
The drill hasn't started yet.

61
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,210
Miss, where's your military literacy?

62
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,066
A drill is real.

63
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,250
You don't have to wait for it to start
to arrest anyone.

64
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,050
No, I can't take it.

65
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,920
Among the Red Team's Infantry Brigade,

66
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,266
there are 59 jeeps,

67
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,970
114 trucks,

68
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,866
9 ambulances,

69
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,346
8 mobile command vehicles,

70
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,650
12 communication vehicles.

71
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,640
The number seems off.

72
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,180
Report to the command post.

73
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,700
Tell them

74
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,409
Red Team might outnumber us,

75
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,186
but judging
from their equipment and setup,

76
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,680
they're still using the same trick.

77
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,830
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,580
Enter the woods.

79
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,580
Come down! Help us push the cars!

80
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,690
What happened?

81
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,490
Is the car stuck?

82
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,730
Come help us!

83
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,010
One, two, three!

84
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,150
Captain,

85
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,410
I think the fleet in the woods

86
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,360
belongs to Dr Xia.

87
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,106
It won't budge!

88
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:05,626
Move aside.

89
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,930
Move aside, move aside.

90
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,770
I think she noticed us.

91
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,970
Be careful next time,

92
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,640
don't let me catch you again.

93
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,220
Xia Chu!

94
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,330
Let's go!

95
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,930
Move it.

96
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,410
Yes, sir.

97
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,200
Four-leaf clover.

98
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,530
That's really rare.

99
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,010
Yeah.

100
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,780
But I still found it.

101
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,800
I just can.

102
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:11,550
(Jungle at Willick's border)

103
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,120
How long does it take?

104
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,890
Very soon.

105
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,840
We'll get there
after we walk through this forest.

106
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,940
It's quite hidden.

107
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,000
Where did you get the bullet
you're hanging on your neck?

108
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,380
I was shot...

109
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,400
on my chest.

110
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,290
Dang.

111
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,810
And you survived.

112
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,040
There's an old Chinese saying.

113
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:53,227
Those who survive a catastrophe

114
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,850
are bound to have good fortune later on.

115
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,720
You'll have everything
once you meet Old Master.

116
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,016
Red Team's infantry reconnaissance

117
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,810
is 300 meters ahead.

118
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,870
Pay attention.

119
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,660
Make sure your radio is silent.

120
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,800
Turn off all light sources.

121
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,200
Turn off night vision infrared.

122
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,330
Yes, sir.

123
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,430
Fox, Koala,

124
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,726
take care of the sentry.

125
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,690
Got it.

126
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,250
Freeze!

127
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,906
Sorry,

128
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,970
please make room.

129
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,890
Done.

130
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,990
Let's go.

131
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,690
Sorry, gentlemen.

132
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,660
Captain,

133
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,866
we got their strategy map.

134
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,586
We'll go all out this time.

135
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,186
What if it is a bait?

136
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,226
Just give it a shot.

137
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,120
If 99 percent is true,

138
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,610
it will be our lucky day.

139
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,780
Move.

140
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,106
(I'm telling you,)

141
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,450
(this is against the law!)

142
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,800
I gave them my order,

143
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,346
but they didn't obey it.

144
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,356
Besides that,

145
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,476
before the commanders

146
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,906
sent me any information,

147
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,676
they had already

148
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,380
gotten rid of your logistics department.

149
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,700
You can look into it.

150
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,630
As for the details,

151
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,570
I'm not clear about it either.

152
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,030
(Fine.)

153
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,830
(You win.)

154
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,650
Stupid bug.

155
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,976
Keep searching!

156
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,236
Whether in the sky or underground,

157
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,810
you have to find them!

158
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,706
Communication team!

159
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,586
Yes!

160
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,776
What is wrong with the signal?

161
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,586
Brigade Commander,

162
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,786
Blue Team is using the information
of our communication network

163
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,786
they seized from us last night

164
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,426
to interfere our digital devices.

165
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,026
Hurry up

166
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,666
and solve the interception!

167
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,630
Yes, sir!

168
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,666
Organize an air strike

169
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,810
and attack Blue Team's base camp
right now!

170
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,750
Air raid! Air raid! Take cover!

171
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,590
This is communication vehicle number 4.

172
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,310
We were not harmed during the air raid.

173
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,000
We'll move to another location

174
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,740
and continue interfering

175
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,890
Red Team's communication network.

176
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,400
Move!

177
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,230
(Somewhere in Southeast Asia,
Willick, T4's Headquarters)

178
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,066
Usually, at this hour,

179
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,770
Old Master will be at the dining hall.

180
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,285
Every night,

181
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,646
Old Master will take a herbal bath.

182
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,710
It has to be prepared
when he's having dinner.

183
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,830
Old Master,

184
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,100
this...

185
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,170
Tian Yong, right?

186
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,426
I heard

187
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,410
you're from Chinese Mainland's
top special forces.

188
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,186
I used to be.

189
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,370
What about now?

190
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,960
I made a mistake,

191
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,640
got sent to jail,

192
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,830
and now I want to start over.

193
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,700
Why did you come here?

194
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,596
Long Yi called me

195
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,940
and said there's an opportunity here.

196
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,450
Old Master, I can explain.

197
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,940
I do have opportunities for you,

198
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,570
but what can you offer?

199
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,010
Connections,

200
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,930
access,

201
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,810
and the bosses' money.

202
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,320
If you work with me,

203
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,330
not only your stuff,

204
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,360
even weapons,

205
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,930
organs,

206
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,650
and information,

207
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,826
will have a market

208
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,810
through me.

209
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,430
You don't have to wait.

210
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,850
As long as you ask for it,

211
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,610
I can provide it anytime you want.

212
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,906
You brought so much cash,

213
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,970
yet you managed
to leave the country safely.

214
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,016
Should I say that you're lucky

215
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,520
or is someone

216
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,130
playing tricks behind my back?

217
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,510
Tell me, who sent you here?

218
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,700
Money.

219
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,850
Money sent me here.

220
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,840
Take him away.

221
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,050
How was it?

222
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,026
Not good.

223
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,546
I can't track his signal.

224
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,466
Where's Zhuo Ran?

225
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,266
I'm contacting him,

226
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,410
but there's no answer.

227
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,730
Sun Xiao Mo,

228
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,906
take someone

229
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,066
to check Zhuo Ran's company
and hotel suite right now.

230
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,466
You must track him down.

231
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,480
Yes.

232
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,206
Director Zhuo,

233
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,630
some police officers...

234
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,986
I think he's asleep.

235
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,456
He's been working overtime recently.

236
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,280
Why don't you ask him when he's awake?

237
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,210
Mr Zhuo.

238
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,550
He's really asleep.

239
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,386
He printed a 3D mask of his own face

240
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,296
saying that it was for product testing.

241
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,226
Then, he asked his male staff to put it on

242
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,666
and sat in his office.

243
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,626
Now,

244
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,250
he is nowhere to be found.

245
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,970
Calm down.

246
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,136
You knew that he's from the special forces

247
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,506
and a police undercover.

248
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,080
Why didn't you tell me?

249
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,760
You made me bring him to meet Old Master,

250
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,320
and secretly fanned the flames

251
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,276
in front of Old Master,

252
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,966
made him suspect his identity
and my motive.

253
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,770
What exactly do you want?

254
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,190
Heart.

255
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,910
What?

256
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,640
Tian Yong's heart.

257
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,586
I remotely controlled the computer

258
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,290
of Hospital 109,

259
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,286
and saw Tian Yong's

260
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,416
organ donation registration form

261
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,160
in their internal system.

262
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,030
His blood type

263
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,120
is the same as my mother's.

264
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,700
Later, I checked
his physical examination data

265
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,260
and confirmed that their hearts match.

266
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,300
He can save my mother.

267
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,960
Old Master threw him into a well.

268
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,610
He won't die.

269
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,050
Old Master won't let him off.

270
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,050
He won't let you off either.

271
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,920
How did you know he's a police?

272
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,090
When the police arrests Old Master,

273
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,610
remember to save Tian Yong.

274
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,530
Why should I listen to you?

275
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,180
If you flee with Tian Yong,

276
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,890
you'll have better protection.

277
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,786
What if the police don't come?

278
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,460
Old Master still won't kill Tian Yong.

279
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,430
Otherwise,
he wouldn't go through all the trouble.

280
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,620
Save Tian Yong.

281
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,240
I'll take care of the rest.

282
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,810
If you fail,

283
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,710
I will take your life right away.

284
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,210
I still have...

285
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,406
the information which Tang Lin stole.

286
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,250
You didn't give it to Old Master?

287
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,670
After tonight,

288
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,010
everything will be over.

289
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,940
This is a statement
of Professor Xia Guang Yuan

290
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,270
from Institute of Chemistry,
University of Dong'an.

291
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,450
He said,

292
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,186
one time, Zhuo Ran framed him

293
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,370
for drug possession.

294
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,870
He even dragged his assistant down.

295
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,296
He repeatedly stole

296
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,376
a medical sedative formula

297
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,370
and clinical experiment data

298
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,810
that their laboratory was researching on.

299
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,170
I think

300
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,306
this is his main motive

301
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,130
for travelling
between Ningjiang and Dong'an.

302
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,530
I must've overlooked it.

303
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,160
How is Tian Yong now?

304
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,660
Judging from the news we got,

305
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,100
I assume Tian Yong has exposed himself.

306
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,490
What's your suggestion?

307
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,760
Seek international cooperation

308
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,640
through diplomatic relations.

309
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,240
Form a joint military
and police team immediately

310
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,970
to travel to the country and arrest him.

311
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,426
Up till now,

312
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,010
we haven't found any solid proof
against Old Master.

313
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,320
If we start an overseas operation,

314
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,816
it might be a problem.

315
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,290
What about Tian Yong's safety?

316
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,130
I know.

317
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,260
I know.

318
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,110
What about this?

319
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,400
Keep on tracking Tian Yong's whereabouts.

320
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,366
I will report this situation

321
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,316
to the superior.

322
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,500
After we get the approval,

323
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,100
we will start overseas operations.

324
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,210
This is the only thing we can do now.

325
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,210
Captain,

326
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,240
which is our target today?

327
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,330
Red Team's Special Forces Brigade?

328
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,670
Stop joking, captain.

329
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,186
There are over 2,000 people

330
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,550
in their Special Forces Brigade.

331
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,220
There are just a few of us,

332
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,050
we'll make a fool of ourselves.

333
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,970
Look at how terrified you are.

334
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,170
I mean this.

335
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,946
This is...

336
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,770
The defensive tank
of Red Team's Infantry Brigade?

337
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,650
Where are the red armbands we seized?

338
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,890
Amazing.

339
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,706
Let's depart three minutes later!

340
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,050
Yes! Got it!

341
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,450
Move!

342
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,270
Stop!

343
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,010
Stop!

344
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,346
Come up here.

345
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,570
I'll drive.

346
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,626
You want to drive the tank?

347
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,506
Tian Yong is not here.

348
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,066
Take over the lieutenant's place

349
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,250
and command on my behalf.

350
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,410
Yes.

351
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,940
Keep the radio connected,

352
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,346
be ready to fire at any time.

353
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,850
Consider it done.

354
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,170
The gun.

355
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,200
Sergeant, you've come to the wrong place.

356
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,506
No!

357
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,970
Isn't this Special Forces Brigade?

358
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,256
What are you doing?

359
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,306
Chief,

360
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,666
we've fallen behind.

361
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,146
Our signal was intercepted by Blue Team,

362
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,536
we couldn't contact the other tanks.

363
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,746
We're running out of petrol.

364
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,226
We'll leave after refilling petrol here.

365
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,500
Go find the logistics for petrol.

366
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,890
Stop blocking the way here.

367
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,120
Go refill petrol and leave right away.

368
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,190
Yes!

369
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,190
Fox.

370
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,520
We've located the target.

371
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,420
Be ready to fire.

372
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,080
Copy that.

373
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,386
Sir,

374
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,770
the drill's commanding department
has confirmed

375
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,346
that Red Team's Special Forces Brigade

376
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,360
has been attacked by our commandos.

377
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,560
Besides that...

378
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,990
Besides what?

379
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,930
The chief of Red Team is pissed off.

380
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,700
That little brat.

381
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,330
Freeze! Hands up!

382
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:21,070
Get everyone under control!
Search carefully!

383
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,199
Go, go!

384
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,730
Mum.

385
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,659
Mum.

386
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,440
Everything's fine now.
Let's get out of here.

387
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,110
Where is Tian Yong?

388
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,050
Where are you going?

389
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,850
Don't look at him. Look at me!

390
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,900
You traitor.

391
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,690
You exposed my factory in Isaia,

392
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,236
now you're using Tian Yong as a bait

393
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,476
so that the police would arrest me,

394
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,440
right?

395
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,726
You even try
to use Xia Guang Yuan's research

396
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,656
to do a deal with me.

397
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,146
What were you thinking?

398
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,810
Listen. Over here,

399
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,720
the person who calls the shots is me.

400
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,530
Only me!

401
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,340
Thank you for your cooperation
in this play.

402
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,056
So I can find out

403
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,710
the ghosts hiding around me.

404
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,266
Don't be happy just yet.

405
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,906
The government has received a report
from the Chinese police.

406
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,140
Next time,

407
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,670
it could be a real one.

408
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:16,880
You're here.

409
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,250
I'm leaving.

410
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,380
What can they find?

411
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,320
Please.

412
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,890
Old Master, please take us in.

413
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,810
No, don't eat it!

414
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,390
I know you're a good son.

415
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,986
You did all these

416
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,776
just to save your mother.

417
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,360
You're a good child.

418
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:08,986
I'll make your wish come true.

419
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,660
Go get Xia Guang Yuan's research for me

420
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,416
in exchange for your mother.

421
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,600
What do you think?

422
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,946
Go back to Chinese Mainland now,

423
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,650
I will arrange manpower for you.

424
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,576
All you have to do

425
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,406
is get the stuff I want,

426
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,950
including Tian Yong.

427
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,040
If you want to use him

428
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,726
to exonerate yourself from your crime,

429
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,230
you can do that as well.

430
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,640
Make your own choice.

431
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,730
Where do we go?

432
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,710
The training ground of the Chinese army

433
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,710
to find someone.

434
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,130
Many of those who fell into that well

435
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,540
either drowned or died from terror.

436
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,790
The water isn't deep.

437
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,230
No.

438
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,130
They died from despair.

439
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,676
They didn't know
if they could make it out alive,

440
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,300
just like now.

441
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,580
Do you think the people who sent you here

442
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,250
still care about your safety?

443
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,690
Who... Who sent me here?

444
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,020
Make a guess.

445
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,840
Think.

446
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,680
Wasn't it Long Yi?

447
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,866
Perhaps you can tell me

448
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,050
how much

449
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,450
the Chinese police know about me,

450
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,340
what evidence they have.

451
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,160
If you're so concerned
about the Chinese police,

452
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,110
why don't you send me back?

453
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,880
I will find out for you.

454
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,890
I am

455
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,050
an expert in this.

456
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,450
You're quite stubborn.

457
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,720
But when it comes to certain things,

458
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,580
even a Chinese Special Forces soldier

459
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,070
can only give in.

460
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,540
Handcuffs.

461
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,386
If you can't stand it,

462
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:54,986
just call me.

463
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,050
Did you hear me?

464
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,010
Call me if you can't stand it.

465
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,130
Both of you,

466
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,360
listen to me.

467
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,950
If you kill him,

468
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,970
I'll let you out.

469
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:53,610
Grenade launcher, fire!

470
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,266
Meet at the designated location!

471
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:04,066
(Roger!)

472
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,306
Everyone, go to the designated location

473
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,010
-to meet the tank!
-Yes!

474
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,386
I heard

475
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,106
that Liang Mu Ze and his men

476
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,826
wiped out the ace unit

477
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,706
which Red Team was proud of.

478
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,786
The commander from Red Team was so pissed

479
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,586
that his blood pressured spiked to 180.

480
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,946
Do you know what the slogan

481
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,210
for Red Team is now?

482
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,986
Turn the training ground upside down,

483
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,850
arrest Liang Mu Ze!

484
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,560
You must be proud, huh, Dr Xia?

485
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:37,850
It's none of my business.

486
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,240
You're blushing.

487
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,370
Liang Mu Ze.

488
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,260
-Plant the bomb.
-Yes.

489
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:23,540
The equipment!

490
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,690
Let's go. Move.

491
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,290
Get in the tank!
