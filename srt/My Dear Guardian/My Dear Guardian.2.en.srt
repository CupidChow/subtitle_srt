00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,153
Do you think I'm short on cash?

4
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:38,857
If you can't afford a moving company,
I can sponsor you.

5
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:40,097
Don't be afraid to ask.

6
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:44,116
Look at him being all obnoxious.

7
00:01:44,196 --> 00:01:45,584
That one, two, three, four, too.

8
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:47,651
He can't wait to see me
fall into despair.

9
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,664
Who gave him that confidence?

10
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:50,973
How hard is it to get a new place?

11
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:53,156
I can't believe
that in the entire Ningjiang District,

12
00:01:53,236 --> 00:01:55,053
there's not a place for me.

13
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,665
Where do you usually crash at night?

14
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:05,042
The whole world belongs to me.

15
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:08,889
But I really hate moving.

16
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:11,716
I've got to go to work, look for a place,
then pack up and clean up again.

17
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:13,716
I'll really go mad.

18
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:18,558
Calm down.

19
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,359
It's okay. I must remain calm.

20
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,627
As a modern lady,

21
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:26,115
I won't be defeated
by such a trivial matter.

22
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:28,084
Just focus on doing the laundry first.

23
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:35,137
He says a little pain in life
doesn't matter...

24
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:40,664
It's just moving to a new place, isn't it?

25
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:18,602
Anything on tonight?

26
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:20,927
Where did you come from?
You gave me a scare.

27
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:22,341
Do you have anything to do tonight?

28
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:25,187
I'll be looking for new places online
so I can move out soon.

29
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,241
I need you to come with me.

30
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:29,689
I'm not done hanging up my laundry yet.

31
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:31,187
It's for something more important
than this.

32
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:32,646
A kid was hurt,

33
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:35,055
but he refuses to go to the hospital.
I need a doctor.

34
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:39,503
So I'm needed only when something happens?

35
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,103
Isn't it a doctor's duty
to heal the wounded and save the dying?

36
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:45,447
Let's go.

37
00:03:58,017 --> 00:03:59,387
Is that kid...

38
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:02,646
-very important to you?
-Yes.

39
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:08,817
What if...

40
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:12,974
I'll do my best.

41
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:31,014
Xiao Jun.

42
00:04:32,143 --> 00:04:33,312
Liang Mu Ze.

43
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:38,397
Alright, let me see it.

44
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:41,064
Now you're embarrassed?

45
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:42,952
I just asked you to wash up
but you didn't.

46
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,827
He insisted on waiting for you.

47
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:50,349
You got hit?

48
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:53,324
I brought this madam doctor
to look at your injury.

49
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,127
Madam doctor?

50
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:57,547
Just call me sister.

51
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:03,900
Pretty please, handsome boy?

52
00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:07,041
Let me have a look.

53
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,213
It's too dark in here.
Do you have a torchlight?

54
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:14,405
Yes. Mu Ze.

55
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:15,626
On the table over there.

56
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:29,897
Just give up, Mu Ze.

57
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:31,910
I know you're almost out.

58
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,541
How would you know that?

59
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:36,988
If you can, so can I.

60
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:42,830
I can't do this anymore.

61
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,249
I can't.

62
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:51,178
-You lost.
-I lost.

63
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:52,946
I lost.

64
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:57,142
There's always a bigger fish.

65
00:06:02,337 --> 00:06:05,480
-Let's continue this tomorrow.
-Sure.

66
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,334
I'm always up for that.

67
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,675
Anytime.

68
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:11,885
Don't move.

69
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:14,662
Let me try out my new camera.

70
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:15,795
Go away.

71
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,173
Three, two, one. Look up.

72
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:21,942
Mu Ze.

73
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:30,627
Now close your eyes.

74
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:34,645
Don't move. It's going to sting a little.

75
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:38,497
Hold on. It's almost done.

76
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:42,647
Hold on just a little bit more.

77
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:45,597
Xiao Jun is so brave.

78
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:50,245
Done.

79
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,528
Will there be a scar?

80
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,929
It probably won't.

81
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,987
A scar is nothing.

82
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,878
Am I right? We're tough men.

83
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:06,598
Mu Ze, you two have a seat.

84
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:07,932
I need to head out for a while.

85
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,077
Where are you going?

86
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:14,141
Look after the kid.

87
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,570
Liang Mu Ze.

88
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,940
Liang Mu Ze, don't leave.

89
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,445
I'm not. I'll just go
to see where she's going.

90
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:20,592
You promise?

91
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:21,938
I promise. Don't worry.

92
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:23,299
Have some fun with madam doctor.

93
00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:25,020
It's sister.

94
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:27,932
How dare he.

95
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:31,134
What's your relationship
with Liang Mu Ze?

96
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:40,469
To be precise, we actually
have just really known each other today.

97
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:42,041
What about you and him?

98
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:44,746
We've known each other for many years.

99
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,688
He's my father.

100
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:56,826
Where are you going?

101
00:07:58,606 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm fine.

102
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,131
Please head back first.
Your friend's still there.

103
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:02,852
I... I'll be back soon.

104
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:04,208
It doesn't seem like you're fine.

105
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:05,325
What's the matter?

106
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:07,640
I...

107
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,603
Xiao Jun got bullied in class today.

108
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:16,667
He panicked and banged his head
against the door.

109
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:17,667
After that, he fainted.

110
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:19,465
Although his father is dead,

111
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:22,283
Xiao Jun has always been very obedient.

112
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:23,798
I've never hit him.

113
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,277
I went through a lot to raise him.

114
00:08:25,357 --> 00:08:27,063
Who are they to bully him?

115
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:30,293
They won't give me an explanation
so I'm getting it myself.

116
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:31,994
Please don't stop me, Mu Ze.

117
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:34,180
I don't mean to stop you.

118
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:35,928
Xiao Jun...

119
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:37,882
How much longer
can you defend him like that?

120
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:40,265
And you're going with a torchlight?

121
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:41,912
What can it do?

122
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:57,162
Stop touching it.
There are germs on your hand.

123
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:58,924
Let it heal on its own.

124
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:05,954
Why are your lips becoming purple?

125
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:08,290
They've always been that way.

126
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:11,952
Do you usually feel dizzy
or experience chest tightness?

127
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:13,104
No.

128
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,227
No?

129
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,749
Well, I... I've done my best.

130
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:37,615
The dressing isn't really that ugly,
is it?

131
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,971
Does it hurt?

132
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,725
Xiao Jun.

133
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:48,688
Listen to me.

134
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:51,150
In future,
if someone tries to bully you...

135
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,699
I was wrong.

136
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:54,152
Next time, I'll avoid it immediately.

137
00:09:54,232 --> 00:09:55,548
No, it's not your fault.

138
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,915
You can't avoid it.

139
00:09:57,364 --> 00:10:00,240
If someone bullies you,
you retaliate immediately.

140
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,515
You hear that?

141
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:03,589
You can't bully others,

142
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,199
but you can't let others bully you either.

143
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,192
Got it?

144
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:14,943
But I'm afraid.

145
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:16,214
What are you afraid of?

146
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:21,052
Your bully feels afraid too.

147
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:23,574
He only has two fists and two legs
just like you.

148
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:25,380
As long as you fight back,
he'll be afraid too.

149
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,702
And he won't come at you again.

150
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:27,961
Got it?

151
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,563
Really?

152
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:31,154
Let me show you a few tricks.

153
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:32,702
-Okay.
-Come here.

154
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:45,190
Thanks for talking
to Miss Meng Zhen all night.

155
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,285
It's fine.

156
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:49,763
Is Xiao Jun really your son?

157
00:10:49,843 --> 00:10:50,868
Yes.

158
00:10:54,577 --> 00:10:56,425
Your personalities are different.

159
00:10:56,982 --> 00:10:58,405
What do you mean?

160
00:10:58,485 --> 00:10:59,885
He really cares for you.

161
00:11:00,356 --> 00:11:01,710
I know.

162
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,468
He'll believe and do
whatever you tell him to.

163
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:08,645
Is that a problem?

164
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:12,703
Do you really think the fighting skills
you taught him...

165
00:11:12,783 --> 00:11:14,615
will make him untouchable?

166
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:16,066
I never meant it that way.

167
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:17,569
Why did you teach him to fight then?

168
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,328
It's called resistance.

169
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:21,587
When you're bullied,

170
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:23,609
you won't necessarily win with your fist.

171
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:28,584
But at least, it'll make sure you won't
become a target of bullies anymore.

172
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:32,286
Is there really no other tactful way
to resolve this?

173
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:33,713
Must it be an eye for an eye?

174
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:37,395
He will have
to face this world by himself.

175
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,225
Thanks for sending me to the hospital.

176
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:05,993
Go home and get some sleep.

177
00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:07,934
I don't really need any sleep.

178
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:11,275
Sleep probably doesn't need you.

179
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,200
Is there a medical explanation for that?

180
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:15,653
Not that I know of.

181
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,681
But my woman's hunch says,

182
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:22,298
the body of a sleepless person
harbours a battered and weary soul.

183
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:29,088
Did I get it right, Captain Liang?

184
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,627
Stop being conceited, Dr Xia.

185
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:33,352
Goodbye.

186
00:12:36,537 --> 00:12:38,867
(Outpatient Department)

187
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,790
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

188
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,467
You have dark circles under your eyes.
Where did you party last night?

189
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:49,780
I had a vocational study.

190
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,057
Get changed quickly.

191
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,673
Dr Zhang will be here soon.

192
00:13:06,677 --> 00:13:09,007
(Miss Lan)

193
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:11,080
Miss Lan.

194
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,081
Hey, girl.

195
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:13,427
How's the place?

196
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:15,323
I'm getting ready to move.

197
00:13:16,704 --> 00:13:17,727
Why?

198
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,177
I was thinking of...

199
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:20,679
Hold your thought.

200
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,163
He has a son. Do you know that?

201
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:23,499
What?

202
00:13:26,318 --> 00:13:27,323
A son?

203
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:28,927
What son? I didn't know that.

204
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:32,672
And yet you were so eager to push
your daughter into relationship hell?

205
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:33,975
Are you even my biological mother?

206
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:35,270
I...

207
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,987
Enough. I won't blame you for it.

208
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,409
I need to work now. Talk again later.
Love you.

209
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:40,717
Goodbye, Miss Lan.

210
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:42,087
Wait, girl.

211
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,335
A son?

212
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:53,304
Xiao Xiao, do you have
an extra pair of shoes?

213
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,376
Didn't you keep a pair here?

214
00:13:58,175 --> 00:13:59,325
I forgot.

215
00:14:00,782 --> 00:14:02,324
In that case, I can't help you.

216
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,776
To hell with it then.

217
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,776
A week ago, the patient did
a coronary artery bypass graft.

218
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:09,563
Since yesterday, his fluid intake
has been 2000 milliliters,

219
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:10,997
urine output has been 2100 milliliters.

220
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,238
Intake and output volumes are balanced.
The drainage tube was removed yesterday.

221
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:16,384
She is doing well so far.

222
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:20,857
-You catch a cold?
-No.

223
00:15:20,947 --> 00:15:24,326
I'm just a little sensitive
to the perfume of this doctor.

224
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,082
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,122
My apologies.

226
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:34,901
You're doing good.

227
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:36,180
Rest well now.

228
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:38,973
Why are you back here?

229
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:47,488
Liang Mu Ze.

230
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:53,397
This will count as a reward
for treating Xiao Jun yesterday.

231
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:56,159
Must you draw a line in everything?

232
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,370
Yes.

233
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:00,582
Fine, whatever you say.

234
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,999
Things like bangles, rings,

235
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:09,378
brooches and earrings
that interfere with your work...

236
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,916
and affect the recovery of patients
must all be discarded.

237
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:13,021
Keep in mind.

238
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:16,230
You're either a good or bad doctor,
regardless of gender.

239
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,333
Xia Chu is working
without her military outfit.

240
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:19,853
Why am I the only one being scolded?

241
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:22,817
Xia Chu.

242
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:24,099
I'm here.

243
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:25,484
Why are you so smug?

244
00:16:25,564 --> 00:16:27,521
Why aren't you wearing the military outfit
during working hours?

245
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:28,725
No.

246
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:31,022
I'm properly attired. Look.

247
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,987
I'm a professional military doctor.

248
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:42,198
How can I make a rookie mistake?

249
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:46,169
Very good.

250
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:49,050
Correct mistakes if you've made any,
guard against them if you haven't.

251
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:52,002
Especially you.

252
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:56,196
By the way,

253
00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:58,678
that young officer
who returned from Isaia with us,

254
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:00,626
how is he doing?

255
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:02,297
He was already discharged
from ICU yesterday.

256
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:05,459
According to the order of higher-ups,
he is now placed in the private ward.

257
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:06,554
Alright.

258
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:07,760
Let's check on him first.

259
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,788
Yes.

260
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:20,287
Captain Liang,
are you here to visit the patient?

261
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:22,077
I was initially here to deliver something.

262
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:24,214
I came to see Tian Yong since I'm here.

263
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,676
How are you feeling?

264
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:28,036
Is everything good?

265
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,790
-Xia Chu.
-Yes.

266
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,235
Describe the patient's condition.

267
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:50,255
Patient's name, Tian Yong.
Age, 32 years old.

268
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,927
Because he was shot
in the left thoracic cavity,

269
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:54,786
he was given a thoracotomy
by the Isaia Joint Medical Team.

270
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:55,955
The bullet was removed.

271
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:58,642
Two days after the surgery, he
was transferred from Isaia to our ICU.

272
00:17:58,722 --> 00:18:00,955
After receiving medical treatment,
his condition is good.

273
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:03,984
Currently, his blood pressure is 120
over 80 mmHg, heartbeat is stable.

274
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:05,781
Thoracic cavity and pericardium drainage
tube flow is steady.

275
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:08,292
The rate of drainage in 24 hours
is 100 mililiters.

276
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:10,239
What should be done next?

277
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,077
Conduct an echocardiography
and chest CT scan,

278
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,614
a blood routine and a full-set
blood coagulation examination.

279
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:15,067
Check if the thoracic cavity and
the pericardial drainage...

280
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:16,459
flow rates have reduced

281
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:17,994
and whether the colour
has gradually turned clearer,

282
00:18:18,074 --> 00:18:20,028
which will decide
if we can remove the tube soon.

283
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:21,402
In other words,

284
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,169
your recovery is going well.

285
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:27,194
Dr Zhang.

286
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,119
Will there be any medical repercussions?

287
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:31,447
Are you experiencing any yourself?

288
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,092
Xia Chu.

289
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:35,455
Let me introduce.

290
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:38,548
He is the officer
I told you about in Isaia...

291
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:41,187
who was injured even worse than Tian Yong.

292
00:18:41,811 --> 00:18:43,372
You must be a major now, aren't you?

293
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:48,323
Chief, I've heard so much of you.

294
00:18:50,357 --> 00:18:51,592
We know each other.

295
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,859
Really?

296
00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:55,507
Why didn't you mention it?

297
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,463
We don't know each other too well.

298
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:02,533
We only crossed paths back in Isaia
when I was held hostage.

299
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:03,945
Now I remember.

300
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:06,073
You were the one who saved the hostage,
weren't you?

301
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:09,022
Since you know each other,
why are you so discreet?

302
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:10,479
I don't know.

303
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,153
We even met a few times upon returning.

304
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:15,153
Is there a cause for it?

305
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,460
No.

306
00:19:18,641 --> 00:19:20,045
If she says so.

307
00:19:20,837 --> 00:19:22,050
Alright then.

308
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,233
In that case,

309
00:19:23,313 --> 00:19:25,631
if there's any problem
with Lieutenant Tian's condition,

310
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:27,758
you can look for Dr Xia in future.

311
00:19:27,838 --> 00:19:29,175
No problem.

312
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,826
We're done here. Next ward.

313
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:46,597
What were you doing back there,
Liang Mu Ze?

314
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:47,840
What do you mean?

315
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,274
Do you know
that what you said just now...

316
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:53,452
will bring me a lot of troubles?

317
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,836
I only spoke the truth.

318
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,428
Are you a pretty little fool?

319
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:59,863
If you can't handle gossips,

320
00:19:59,943 --> 00:20:01,313
that is your problem.

321
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:02,510
Liang Mu Ze.

322
00:20:02,957 --> 00:20:04,175
Liang Mu Ze.

323
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,617
You don't call me chief now, do you?

324
00:20:09,486 --> 00:20:11,325
Listen, Dr Xia.

325
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:15,936
If you think it is right
to cast people away...

326
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:19,075
after using them, then continue with it.

327
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:20,423
I don't care.

328
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:21,968
But I've told you before.

329
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:25,331
I like simplicity
and straightforwardness.

330
00:20:25,911 --> 00:20:27,915
It's not something honourable to know you.

331
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:30,396
So there's no point in lying about it.

332
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:33,682
If you like to act, then suit yourself.

333
00:20:33,762 --> 00:20:35,163
I have no obligation to play along.

334
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:41,552
Something is not right.

335
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,185
What is it?

336
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,407
Aren't you from the Special Forces?

337
00:20:45,884 --> 00:20:46,842
So?

338
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,557
A person from the Special Forces
shouldn't be...

339
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:51,943
arrogant, cool, inarticulate and tough?

340
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:54,156
Why is it different when it comes to you?

341
00:20:54,622 --> 00:20:55,937
You're so talkative.

342
00:20:56,017 --> 00:20:58,395
I bet if you were
on a prolonged ambush mission...

343
00:20:58,517 --> 00:21:00,249
where you can't speak nor move,

344
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:01,671
the silence could just kill you.

345
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:10,572
When you move out,

346
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,517
make sure you take all your stuff.

347
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:18,139
Captain Liang, join us.

348
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:19,309
I'm done.

349
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:36,648
I'm a pretty little fool?
I can't take this.

350
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:37,856
Has she lost her mind?

351
00:21:37,936 --> 00:21:40,195
What a joke.
How am I a pretty little fool?

352
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,643
She called an officer
a pretty little fool.

353
00:21:42,723 --> 00:21:44,762
Tell me, Tian Yong.

354
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:47,194
As the top-notch graduate
of military school,

355
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,244
your captain, in my every aspect,

356
00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:52,269
whether it's my physique,

357
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:54,681
or my military skills,

358
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:56,732
or my cognitive aptitudes,

359
00:21:56,812 --> 00:21:58,240
aren't they all equally excellent?

360
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,004
How can she call me a blockhead?

361
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:01,382
This isn't the worst part.

362
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:03,125
What really pissed me off is that...

363
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:06,881
she pretended not knowing me
in front of her colleagues.

364
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:08,632
What's wrong with knowing me?

365
00:22:08,712 --> 00:22:09,991
Tell me what's wrong with that?

366
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:11,505
Does it embarrass her?

367
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:14,166
You're just sneering.
Why don't you say something?

368
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:18,473
Did I feed you too fast?

369
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:22,286
I'm asking you.

370
00:22:22,664 --> 00:22:23,846
I've answered you.

371
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,187
What did you say?

372
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:30,631
Via Morse code?

373
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:39,448
I've been thinking if we should have
some kind of secret way...

374
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,600
of communication between us.

375
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:43,965
We should, shouldn't we?

376
00:22:44,611 --> 00:22:47,101
If someday you are captured
by the enemy...

377
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:48,355
Nonsense.

378
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,972
Why isn't it you being captured?

379
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:52,106
-I'm just saying.
-You can't do that either.

380
00:22:52,186 --> 00:22:56,044
Let's be clear that there's no way
for it to happen in my troop.

381
00:22:56,973 --> 00:22:58,840
You're being too idealistic.

382
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,975
Major.

383
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:02,040
Without ideals, why are you
even a soldier?

384
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,972
Without ideals, how can you be a soldier?

385
00:23:04,052 --> 00:23:06,309
Didn't you start off as a soldier
because of your ideals?

386
00:23:09,797 --> 00:23:11,269
I did it for survival.

387
00:23:12,108 --> 00:23:15,090
I grew up in an orphanage
with no parents.

388
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,959
I couldn't find a decent job
after graduating from high school.

389
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,273
What ideals did I have?

390
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,711
I was looking to survive.

391
00:23:22,182 --> 00:23:23,284
Tian Yong.

392
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:24,811
Listen.

393
00:23:25,835 --> 00:23:26,913
You're wrong.

394
00:23:28,835 --> 00:23:30,260
Even if in the beginning,

395
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,332
you joined the forces
merely because of survival,

396
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,532
you've still managed to stay in it
for so long.

397
00:23:35,612 --> 00:23:37,679
After so many years, your ideals...

398
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,918
have already transcended
the mere reason of surviving.

399
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:40,931
Am I right?

400
00:23:41,011 --> 00:23:42,447
Don't you deny that.

401
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:43,871
It's pointless to deny it either.

402
00:23:45,112 --> 00:23:46,183
Look at this.

403
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:49,664
This here is the best proof.

404
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,486
What's that?

405
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:05,369
It was this?

406
00:24:05,449 --> 00:24:06,793
Yes.

407
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:08,265
Hold on to it.

408
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:10,908
Keep it, so you'll always remember.

409
00:24:15,174 --> 00:24:16,349
Thanks, captain.

410
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:17,555
Take it.

411
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:18,911
That's so kind of you.

412
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,987
Ouch.

413
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:24,593
It hurts.

414
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,269
That's good.

415
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:27,634
That way you'll remember.

416
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:29,693
-Brace yourself.
-My wound hurts.

417
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:31,361
Alright. I'll remove it.

418
00:24:36,957 --> 00:24:40,617
(Somewhere in Southeast Asia,
Willick, T4 Headquarters)

419
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:44,087
Why did the mission fail?

420
00:24:44,687 --> 00:24:47,589
The local police
hired help from Hunter Military School.

421
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:51,393
They were all top-notch special forces
from various countries.

422
00:24:53,517 --> 00:24:55,237
What about the thing I wanted?

423
00:24:55,317 --> 00:24:56,197
It's gone.

424
00:24:58,237 --> 00:24:59,597
But we can find another one.

425
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:01,207
Listen.

426
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:03,617
I'm running out of time.

427
00:25:03,697 --> 00:25:05,682
-I must have it as soon...
-Of course.

428
00:25:06,313 --> 00:25:08,606
Just like the steak before us.

429
00:25:08,686 --> 00:25:10,300
As long as one can afford it,

430
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,321
anyone can have a taste of it.

431
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:14,390
Money is not a problem.

432
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,217
Once I've received it
and confirmed that it's compatible,

433
00:25:18,922 --> 00:25:20,887
you'll have the rest of the payment.

434
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:23,215
Again, just like this steak,

435
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:27,024
time determines its doneness.

436
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:28,364
Likewise,

437
00:25:28,871 --> 00:25:30,948
its taste will vary accordingly too.

438
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,364
What are you trying to say?

439
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:43,039
The organ provider is from Country A.

440
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,035
This matter has now alerted
not only the Isaia police,

441
00:25:46,115 --> 00:25:48,215
but the Interpol is watching closely too.

442
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:50,691
Trying to retrieve your goods...

443
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:58,995
under such dire conditions...

444
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:01,365
requires a higher price now,
don't you agree?

445
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,328
You're fooling with me.

446
00:26:21,357 --> 00:26:23,409
Business is business.

447
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:25,633
Great.

448
00:26:28,237 --> 00:26:30,164
So it is.

449
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:32,420
Fine.

450
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:35,740
You may be in power in China,

451
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,135
but over here,

452
00:26:38,252 --> 00:26:39,905
I'm in charge.

453
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:49,586
Boss, don't move.

454
00:26:57,287 --> 00:26:59,417
You must understand
that everything in this world...

455
00:26:59,497 --> 00:27:01,096
revolves around money,

456
00:27:01,597 --> 00:27:03,435
except money itself.

457
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,569
Money is related to one's dreams.

458
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:12,609
And you seem to have belittled mine.

459
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:13,987
Therefore,

460
00:27:14,973 --> 00:27:16,809
your opportunity is gone now.

461
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:19,152
What do you mean?

462
00:27:19,232 --> 00:27:22,350
Have you forgotten whose fundings
T4 owes for its glory today?

463
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:27,470
There's an old Chinese saying.

464
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,062
Great kindness repaid with ingratitude.

465
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:33,388
No kindness needs a lifetime of repayment.

466
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,049
Furthermore,

467
00:27:35,393 --> 00:27:38,733
while we were negotiating our ties,
your little brother, Gui,

468
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:40,828
struck a money deal with me.

469
00:27:40,908 --> 00:27:42,205
He wants you dead.

470
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,440
Plus he has offered me
something I simply can't refuse.

471
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:49,826
You liar.

472
00:28:00,863 --> 00:28:03,881
Tell Old Gui that the job is done.

473
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:06,234
Have him come over...

474
00:28:06,897 --> 00:28:08,997
to negotiate the remaining terms
of the goods supply and market sharing...

475
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:10,536
as soon as possible.

476
00:28:10,616 --> 00:28:11,549
Yes.

477
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,228
Master.

478
00:28:30,487 --> 00:28:33,426
People think my resources come from
T4 alone.

479
00:28:34,158 --> 00:28:37,363
But they never know
my greatest asset is you,

480
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:38,716
Zhuo Ran.

481
00:28:38,796 --> 00:28:40,394
I owe it to your cultivation, Master.

482
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:42,089
Here, have a seat.

483
00:28:43,127 --> 00:28:44,258
Yes.

484
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:49,922
Try out my cooking.

485
00:28:50,002 --> 00:28:51,068
Master.

486
00:29:00,492 --> 00:29:01,649
How does it taste?

487
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,346
Zhuo Ran.

488
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:15,081
Hasn't it been eight years
since you last set foot in China?

489
00:29:15,528 --> 00:29:17,185
It's been eight years and 27 days.

490
00:29:17,265 --> 00:29:18,554
Pack up.

491
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:19,733
You'll be heading there.

492
00:29:20,243 --> 00:29:21,517
Can I bring my mother along?

493
00:29:21,598 --> 00:29:22,772
Have you forgotten that...

494
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:25,489
she needs to recuperate?

495
00:29:34,432 --> 00:29:35,563
Don't worry.

496
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:41,297
Once you return,

497
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:44,153
I'll arrange a short reunion.

498
00:29:45,488 --> 00:29:46,655
Sounds good?

499
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:48,485
Yes.

500
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:50,218
What's the mission?

501
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:57,230
Dong'an University of China recently
invented a new form of medical sedatives.

502
00:29:58,002 --> 00:30:00,450
I need the formula
and its person-in-charge,

503
00:30:00,942 --> 00:30:02,198
Xia Guang Yuan.

504
00:30:07,663 --> 00:30:10,881
Perhaps his daughter rings a bell.

505
00:30:12,901 --> 00:30:14,045
Xia Chu.

506
00:30:20,036 --> 00:30:21,169
I got it.

507
00:30:26,717 --> 00:30:30,021
We've already locked
onto this dark web platform called...

508
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:31,313
City of Desires.

509
00:30:34,018 --> 00:30:36,306
Many recent cases of drug trafficking
in the city...

510
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:37,788
are connected to this platform.

511
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:40,695
After our technical team
hacked into the server,

512
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:45,398
they collected metadata
for further analysis and interpretation.

513
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:47,230
We gradually found...

514
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,692
some basic information
about the mastermind behind the platform.

515
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:53,325
This person uses an online account named
Dreadful Pirate.

516
00:30:53,405 --> 00:30:54,677
Just moments ago,

517
00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:59,131
he published several images
mourning the death...

518
00:30:59,211 --> 00:31:01,143
of several T4 mercenaries.

519
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:02,680
Besides that,

520
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,993
he even initiated
a suicide mission game...

521
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,603
using high monetary rewards as bait.

522
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:11,571
Various mission cards
are randomly published...

523
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:16,154
to incite netizens
to commit suicide missions.

524
00:31:17,452 --> 00:31:19,190
Although the motive is unclear,

525
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:22,543
it has already caused
terrible ramifications.

526
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:24,896
Higher-ups have called for
a special task force...

527
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:27,259
led by the chief
of Criminal Investigation Detachment Unit,

528
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:28,622
Rao Feng,

529
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,075
along with Narcotics Divison,
Financial Investigation Division...

530
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:35,437
and various other divisions...

531
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:38,243
to identify the whereabouts
of Dreadful Pirate.

532
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:42,786
According to the latest Intel,

533
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:45,096
Dreadful Pirate is hiding somewhere
amidst our country's borders.

534
00:31:45,176 --> 00:31:48,071
It's likely related
to the mercenaries hired by T4.

535
00:31:48,424 --> 00:31:49,652
If we were to arrest them,

536
00:31:49,732 --> 00:31:51,530
the police would need your help.

537
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,279
No problem.

538
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,663
I'll inform the Thunder Commando
to get ready immediately.

539
00:31:55,743 --> 00:31:57,421
Once the mission is approved,

540
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:59,067
we'll assist in the operation.

541
00:31:59,722 --> 00:32:00,812
Thank you.

542
00:32:03,469 --> 00:32:06,260
She asked me to lend her
my pair of shoes.

543
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:08,573
But I didn't have an extra pair.

544
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:11,611
I think Army Officer Liang was the one
who brought her those.

545
00:32:17,522 --> 00:32:18,653
How can I help you?

546
00:32:21,847 --> 00:32:24,451
I bet the shoes and military uniform
you're wearing now...

547
00:32:24,531 --> 00:32:26,501
were delivered by Army Officer Liang.

548
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:29,119
Of course not.

549
00:32:30,254 --> 00:32:31,728
He's pursuing you?

550
00:32:31,808 --> 00:32:32,758
Impossible.

551
00:32:32,838 --> 00:32:33,958
Are you guys together?

552
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:35,820
Nope.

553
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,196
He seems to be close to Dr Zhang.

554
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,288
How should I know about that?

555
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,692
So the reason
you were selected to attend...

556
00:32:42,772 --> 00:32:45,248
that international medical
training program in Isaia...

557
00:32:45,328 --> 00:32:47,376
was because he talked
to Dr Zhang about it?

558
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:11,882
Dr Zhang.

559
00:33:24,646 --> 00:33:26,216
Why aren't you doing this in the office?

560
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,352
It's too noisy there.

561
00:33:27,683 --> 00:33:29,131
You heard gossips?

562
00:33:31,117 --> 00:33:32,424
You heard them too?

563
00:33:33,207 --> 00:33:34,657
It's easy to guess.

564
00:33:35,225 --> 00:33:38,761
You should know that
you're our first ever resident doctor...

565
00:33:39,157 --> 00:33:42,002
to have participated
in a foreign aid medical program.

566
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,342
You're also the first ever resident doctor
to stand in front of the operating table.

567
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:52,020
Others of the same age as you
are still busy practising how to stitch.

568
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,097
Hence comes the gossip.

569
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:58,645
You have to learn to handle them.

570
00:33:59,264 --> 00:34:00,433
Why should I?

571
00:34:00,513 --> 00:34:01,731
To wear the crown...

572
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:04,259
is to bear its weight.

573
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:09,421
What you have to do now
is to work as hard as you can.

574
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:12,652
Let those who talk feel hopeless.

575
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,595
Then, they'll stop talking.

576
00:34:18,197 --> 00:34:19,485
Will they really stop?

577
00:34:19,565 --> 00:34:20,645
Of course they will.

578
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:22,532
I'm certain of it.

579
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:27,434
It's because I experienced it too.

580
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:35,270
Do you train like this all the time?

581
00:34:36,247 --> 00:34:38,080
Of course. It's a must.

582
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,055
Ever since the day
I first did stitching...

583
00:34:40,135 --> 00:34:42,639
and was kicked out of the operating room
by my teacher.

584
00:34:43,924 --> 00:34:45,182
Every day.

585
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:48,947
But this time during the day,

586
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:50,619
isn't it bright enough already?

587
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,304
Why do you also need a candle?

588
00:35:02,557 --> 00:35:04,154
They aren't for the training.

589
00:35:06,197 --> 00:35:07,495
It's for those...

590
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:10,118
who went on the operating table...

591
00:35:10,802 --> 00:35:13,589
but never made it back alive.

592
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:14,991
Because of them,

593
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:19,335
I remind myself
that I can't slack even for a moment.

594
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:22,637
Remember this, Xia Chu.

595
00:35:23,985 --> 00:35:26,800
Nothing is more important
than a person's life and death.

596
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,961
I understand now.

597
00:35:43,295 --> 00:35:44,733
Mi Gu.

598
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:45,893
Hey, girl.

599
00:35:45,973 --> 00:35:46,999
Do you miss me?

600
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,199
I do.

601
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,868
I miss you a lot.

602
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:51,127
How are you doing there?

603
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:54,786
Is your residency life
full of blood, sweat and tears?

604
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:56,353
Not only that.

605
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:58,858
It's an imperial court drama
here every day.

606
00:35:59,229 --> 00:36:00,910
When I started medical school,

607
00:36:01,397 --> 00:36:04,521
I thought
I just needed skills to survive.

608
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:06,470
Only now do I realise that...

609
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:09,900
emotional intelligence is super important.

610
00:36:11,062 --> 00:36:13,607
No matter how terrible it is, at least
you've got a free mansion to live in.

611
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:15,595
-Am I right?
-Forget it.

612
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:17,603
The landlord is forcing me to move out.

613
00:36:17,683 --> 00:36:20,590
Mi Gu. How I wish you were my landlady.

614
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,966
Well, I'm always ready to share
half of my tatami bed with you.

615
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,943
Mi Gu.

616
00:36:27,397 --> 00:36:28,845
You're the best.

617
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:32,632
I'll leave you with that thought.
I've got a cab to catch. Goodbye.

618
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:33,929
Bye.

619
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:47,344
What doesn't kill me
only makes me stronger.

620
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:55,991
Thunder Commando unit,
check your communication devices.

621
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:57,478
Once we're at the borders,

622
00:36:57,558 --> 00:37:00,047
our orders
are to capture the target alive.

623
00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:01,754
But if the target fires,

624
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:03,115
we won't hold back.

625
00:37:03,195 --> 00:37:04,270
Yes, sir.

626
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:11,760
Alright, let's have a look.

627
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:13,530
Who knows?

628
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,646
We might find a better place
than this one.

629
00:37:15,726 --> 00:37:18,539
I don't want to go. I like it here.

630
00:37:22,518 --> 00:37:26,067
What a pity. This house is so exquisite.

631
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:28,922
I was almost getting used to it.

632
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:34,660
Stop thinking, stop thinking.

633
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:36,617
Delete that thought.

634
00:37:37,498 --> 00:37:38,714
Look for a new place.

635
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:41,004
Look for a new place.

636
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:42,308
You can do it.

637
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:54,409
Hi, Dr Xia.

638
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:56,607
I'm Chen Meng Zhen,
Luo Xiao Jun's mother.

639
00:37:56,687 --> 00:37:57,892
Do you remember me?

640
00:37:57,972 --> 00:38:00,076
Yes. How can I help you?

641
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:01,489
Well...

642
00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:02,740
Two days back,

643
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,122
Xiao Jun kept complaining
about tightness in his chest.

644
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:07,280
He even fainted in school earlier today.

645
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,503
I was wondering...

646
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:11,084
if it could be some kind of repercussion
from his previous head injury?

647
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,457
Has he done a check-up?

648
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:15,642
I brought him to the community hospital
during the day.

649
00:38:15,722 --> 00:38:17,098
But their equipment was broken.

650
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:18,873
So they couldn't do an X-ray.

651
00:38:18,953 --> 00:38:20,451
How is he doing now?

652
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,868
Right now, he's sleeping.

653
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:24,820
Mum.

654
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:26,845
I feel terrible.

655
00:38:27,777 --> 00:38:28,890
Mum.

656
00:38:29,712 --> 00:38:30,772
I feel terrible.

657
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:34,404
Don't worry. Just observe him for now.

658
00:38:34,484 --> 00:38:36,663
If it gets worse, come straight
to the hospital tomorrow morning.

659
00:38:36,743 --> 00:38:37,809
I'll be there.

660
00:38:38,327 --> 00:38:40,426
That'd be great. Thank you so much.

661
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:42,415
You're welcome. Goodbye.

662
00:38:50,252 --> 00:38:52,941
Could it be that I didn't dress
the wound properly?

663
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:01,490
What's the point of raising
a lazy cat like you?

664
00:41:06,955 --> 00:41:08,209
A hologram?

665
00:41:10,857 --> 00:41:12,699
Looks like someone's messing with us.

666
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:31,465
Whale.

667
00:41:48,701 --> 00:41:49,951
What's the situation?

668
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:52,686
The other party definitely
has ill intentions.

669
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:53,934
You have to be careful.

670
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:56,741
Yes, sir.

671
00:41:56,821 --> 00:41:58,299
No matter what case this is,

672
00:41:58,379 --> 00:41:59,865
or who the mastermind is,

673
00:41:59,945 --> 00:42:01,634
I'll get to the bottom of it.
