=Episode 14=

3
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:40,253
Zhuo Ran.

4
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:41,930
Did you notice that...

5
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:43,880
you're especially unlucky
when you're with me?

6
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:46,280
You either injure yourself or fall sick.

7
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:49,424
Perhaps we're not meant to be together.

8
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:50,720
How about this?

9
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:54,240
I'll stay away from you.

10
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:02,925
I know I'm quite annoying at times.

11
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:08,600
Mi Gu.

12
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:11,440
It's not your fault.

13
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't mind.

14
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:21,485
Did I interrupt you?

15
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,560
We're coming in.

16
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:27,115
Hello, Mr. Zhuo and Ms. Mi.

17
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:31,064
With regard to the incident
outside the banquet hall at the hotel,

18
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:33,240
it's indeed tricky and troublesome.

19
00:02:33,704 --> 00:02:36,960
Now, we need cooperation from
both of you to give a statement.

20
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,264
He's still bleeding.

21
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:40,214
Can we do it later?

22
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:41,165
No.

23
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:42,880
Please cooperate with us.
It won't be long.

24
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:44,444
-You...
-Mi Gu.

25
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,814
It's okay.

26
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:47,864
Do we do it together or...

27
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:48,925
Do it separately.

28
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:49,960
Come with me.

29
00:02:56,748 --> 00:02:58,055
He's a lunatic.

30
00:02:58,096 --> 00:02:59,784
He's been pestering me a long time
insisting to date me.

31
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:00,895
Have you ever given him any promises?

32
00:03:00,985 --> 00:03:01,880
Of course not.

33
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:03,277
I don't know.

34
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,240
Don't know?

35
00:03:07,484 --> 00:03:10,965
Ms. Mi Gu and I
met each other not long ago.

36
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:13,920
I'm not quite familiar
with her romantic experience.

37
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:15,440
So,

38
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:17,600
both of you are not close with each other?

39
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:20,280
Yes, you may say so.

40
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:22,240
All thanks to Zhuo Ran.

41
00:03:23,144 --> 00:03:24,369
That's why I escaped.

42
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,840
Why did he ask for your help to
obtain the license of the forum?

43
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:28,553
He's a businessman.

44
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:30,120
Isn't it normal for him
to expand his connection?

45
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,720
I couldn't help but wonder...

46
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:36,600
why you chose to attend
a medicine related forum?

47
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,360
My company is mainly about 3D printing.

48
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,745
Lately, we're doing a collaboration
with the hospital.

49
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:46,365
Therefore, I'm interested
to get an understanding...

50
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:48,216
of the related industry information.

51
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:52,680
You're indeed far-sighted
and in the full vigor of life.

52
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:57,320
Do you know this person?

53
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:01,016
No.

54
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:02,440
No.

55
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:03,480
Does Zhuo Ran know him?

56
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:06,000
How do I know?

57
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:09,680
Why do you keep asking about Zhuo Ran?

58
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,160
He's not the person who assaulted me.

59
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:15,077
We need to get a better understanding
of every detail at the scene.

60
00:04:15,118 --> 00:04:16,080
Take off your shirt.

61
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:20,360
We received complaints
from the public that you...

62
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:22,284
illegally possessed a gun.

63
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:23,480
We need to confirm on that.

64
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:27,920
Can you give me a hand?

65
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:29,080
Okay, no problem.

66
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:39,560
What a nice material.

67
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:47,200
Please raise your hands.

68
00:04:57,956 --> 00:04:59,997
It seems that it was just a mischief.

69
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:01,480
Mr. Zhuo, I'm so sorry.

70
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:05,800
People who simply take up police resources
should be taught a lesson.

71
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:07,600
That's all for today.

72
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,696
You're working for the people.
I can understand that.

73
00:05:11,737 --> 00:05:12,840
All right, see you again.

74
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,008
Please sign the document
if everything is okay.

75
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:30,738
It's not working.

76
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:36,680
Do you have any other pen?

77
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:38,245
I have a pen.

78
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,895
Do you?

79
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,949
It's done.

80
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:51,799
Use it.

81
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:05,480
Thank you for your cooperation.

82
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,564
What do you keep in your bag?

83
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:09,560
It looks quite heavy.

84
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:20,648
It's camera.
I need it for working purposes.

85
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:26,062
Let's go.

86
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:36,643
Mi Gu.

87
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:38,520
It's not your fault.

88
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:52,491
I heard from my dad
that someone assaulted you.

89
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:55,674
Are you okay?

90
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:56,975
Are you injured?

91
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,410
I'm fine.

92
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:00,651
Zhuo Ran injured himself though.

93
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:03,033
Is it serious?

94
00:07:03,732 --> 00:07:04,932
According to the doctor,

95
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:06,713
his nerves and bones are intact.

96
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,889
I think he should be fine.

97
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:14,080
Where is he?

98
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,420
He's undergoing debridement.

99
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,209
Well...

100
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:25,139
I went to the hotel
for film shooting on location.

101
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,406
He was there to attend a medical forum.

102
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:30,457
We...

103
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:33,878
We were there for work
and we ran into each other by chance.

104
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,619
Something unexpected occurred.

105
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:37,578
As he's bleeding profusely,

106
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:39,240
-I sent him to the hospital.
-Actually...

107
00:07:40,616 --> 00:07:41,720
Don't mind it.

108
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:45,920
Take a seat.

109
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:57,115
I mean,

110
00:07:58,262 --> 00:07:59,280
to Zhuo Ran, I...

111
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,600
Yes.

112
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:04,160
When I saw him,

113
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:06,680
I still felt something
which couldn't be explained.

114
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:08,883
However, I think...

115
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:11,800
it's not because of him per se...

116
00:08:12,902 --> 00:08:15,032
but it's because of the memories.

117
00:08:16,173 --> 00:08:20,285
Everything in the past happened for real
and it won't happen again in the future.

118
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:22,905
Hence, I won't forget it.

119
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:30,920
Sometimes, we couldn't help reminiscing
those guys in white shirts...

120
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:32,800
who played basketball on the court.

121
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:36,877
However, it's just nostalgia.

122
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:38,320
Life goes on no matter what.

123
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:41,778
The story between Zhuo Ran
and I has ended.

124
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:44,640
As for you,

125
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:51,025
if he really makes you happy,

126
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,080
then you should go ahead.

127
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:02,960
I thought
you wouldn't talk to me anymore.

128
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:06,447
Just because of a former lover?

129
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:07,858
Am I so petty?

130
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:11,346
To me,

131
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:14,246
a serious friendship...

132
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,747
is more memorable than
romantic relationship.

133
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,080
I love you, Mi Gu.

134
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:25,600
Any man
can never take your place in my heart.

135
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:49,455
I've to get back to work.

136
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:50,640
Call me if anything.

137
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:22,159
Why did you bring me to the hospital?

138
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,210
Didn't I tell you to send me home?

139
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:24,514
We're here to apologise.

140
00:10:24,555 --> 00:10:25,480
What?

141
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,377
-Hello.
-Hello.

142
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,448
Is Xia Chu here?

143
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:29,729
I think she went to the emergency ward.

144
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,880
You may give her a call.

145
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:31,840
All right, thank you.

146
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,280
-I don't want to go there.
-Let's go.

147
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:47,465
Thank you for your help at the hotel.

148
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,040
Have you taken the medicine?

149
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:51,316
What?

150
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,240
-What are you doing?
-It's tranquillizer.

151
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:00,360
I told Mi Gu to replace the tranquillizer.

152
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:01,947
Have you taken it?

153
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:04,560
The tranquillizer is not for myself.

154
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:06,040
I gave it to Liang Mu Ze.

155
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:07,754
Tell him to throw it away.

156
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:09,889
What's wrong?

157
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:13,747
My company had a collaboration
with a medicine manufacturer before.

158
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:15,664
We attempted to use
3D printing technology...

159
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:17,720
to produce hypnotic
which is made of Chinese medicine.

160
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:21,320
However, the first batch
contains excessive birthwort.

161
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,868
Long term consumption...

162
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:26,520
may lead to kidney failure
or worse, liver cancer.

163
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:28,805
Hence, we decided to destroy the products.

164
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:31,315
My assistant took it by mistake.

165
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,240
I didn't know that
and I gave it to Mi Gu.

166
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:39,556
Normally, when a man and a woman
are together

167
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:41,240
and they did not pick up the phone call
at first instance,

168
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:43,764
it's either they're busy
or they're having fun.

169
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:45,920
Don't ask for embarrassment.

170
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:49,400
Xia Chu.

171
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:51,785
It was an accident.

172
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:53,520
Luckily nothing happened to you.

173
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:01,388
I'm fine...

174
00:12:01,673 --> 00:12:04,200
but my friend almost took
substandard medicine.

175
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:06,664
Do you know
how much of trouble you caused me?

176
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,495
If his health is affected
because of my negligence,

177
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:11,480
I won't be able to forgive myself.

178
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:13,520
Also,

179
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:15,960
before you make any decision
that has something to do with me,

180
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,665
will you please inform me about it?

181
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:19,942
Don't simply do whatever you want.

182
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:22,263
Don't get Mi Gu
involved in your so-called accidents.

183
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:25,440
Please don't hurt me over and over again
in the name of protecting me.

184
00:12:26,515 --> 00:12:27,480
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:39,544
She looks like she's having fun.

186
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:48,343
Where did you go?

187
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,790
Take a guess.

188
00:13:03,795 --> 00:13:05,285
Where did you find her?

189
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,760
Well...

190
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:12,135
Sorry to have troubled you
to pick her up at the airport.

191
00:13:14,187 --> 00:13:15,167
Mu Ze.

192
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:17,295
I'm tired.

193
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:22,465
She...

194
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:23,523
What's wrong?

195
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:24,554
She fell asleep due to her illness.

196
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,845
Let's go to your office.

197
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:27,805
Let's go.

198
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:35,365
Zhuo Ran.

199
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:39,669
You're still here.

200
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:41,840
I went to pick up the medicine.

201
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:45,024
The doctor prescribed medicine
for tetanus and antibiotics.

202
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,949
Thank you.

203
00:13:47,603 --> 00:13:48,800
Let's go to the injection room.

204
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:51,320
Okay.

205
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:05,993
Do you plan to leave her here?

206
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:07,854
Yes, if I send her home,

207
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:08,875
she'll run away once she's awake.

208
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:13,066
Even if you leave her here,

209
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:14,760
I can't be watching her all the time.

210
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:16,382
Are you busy?

211
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,600
Of course.

212
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,625
At night, if any emergency
happens to any of the patients,

213
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,040
I have to handle it at the first instance.

214
00:14:23,842 --> 00:14:26,320
Why were you
hugging a man in the lift?

215
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:34,704
The test result of the medicine is out.

216
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:35,645
I know.

217
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:38,280
It's Chinese medicine
produced by 3D printing technology.

218
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:40,825
Zhang Yi Chi told you that?

219
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:42,320
No, it's Zhuo Ran.

220
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:44,200
Zhuo Ran told you about it?

221
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,520
He told his assistant to get the medicine.

222
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:49,040
His assistant got confused.

223
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:53,240
-So, he's the one who gave it to Mi Gu?
-Yes.

224
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:56,000
However, he didn't know that
his assistant made a mistake.

225
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,280
Was that his explanation?

226
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:00,153
I believe that it's the truth.

227
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:02,485
Otherwise, he wouldn't have had
come to to see me at the first instance.

228
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:06,046
Did he know that
I was testing the medicine?

229
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:07,478
I didn't tell him anything.

230
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:08,640
How about Mi Gu?

231
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:14,040
I'm not sure of that.

232
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:16,325
He's...

233
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,520
trying to get us before we get him.

234
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:21,135
It's just an accident.

235
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:22,956
You don't have to come down
on him too hard.

236
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:25,890
Accident?

237
00:15:26,096 --> 00:15:27,215
Of course it's an accident.

238
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:29,295
Otherwise, why would Zhuo Ran harm me?

239
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:31,215
The medicine was for me.

240
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:32,640
He didn't know that.

241
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,040
How did he know
that you have the medicine?

242
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:39,640
How did he know?

243
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:02,855
For a very long time after he left,

244
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,920
I could only fall asleep
with the help of drugs.

245
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:08,678
When I had insomnia,

246
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:11,086
I sent many emails to him.

247
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:12,480
In some emails, I scolded him.

248
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:14,320
In some, I begged of him.

249
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,390
He didn't reply any of the emails.

250
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:19,000
He didn't reply...

251
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:23,415
but I think he knew
what was going on with me.

252
00:16:24,313 --> 00:16:25,600
Therefore, when he came back,

253
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:27,968
he worried that I got agitated.

254
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:32,035
He told Mi Gu to keep a close watch on me
just in case.

255
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:34,680
As a result,

256
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:36,531
he accidentally discovered the medicine.

257
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:46,281
Trust me, Liang Mu Ze.

258
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:47,914
Zhuo Ran wouldn't harm me.

259
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:49,445
There's no reason for him
to make things personal against you too.

260
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:51,800
This is just an odd coincidence.

261
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:57,520
In short,

262
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,657
I'm sorry for this incident.

263
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:02,200
If you get mad at me or hate me for that,

264
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:03,280
I can totally understand it.

265
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:06,560
However, I can't doubt my friend.

266
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:08,680
This is my principle
when it comes to dealing with people.

267
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:11,360
Are both of you just friends?

268
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:15,240
Liang Mu Ze, what do you mean?

269
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:17,880
There's an eight year gap.

270
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:21,320
Are you sure you still know him well?

271
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:26,038
Also, how old are you?

272
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:31,505
Running away from home
was a trick I used when I was young.

273
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:32,624
You can't be using the same trick
all the time.

274
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:33,880
It'll become ineffective.

275
00:17:37,865 --> 00:17:39,365
Think like an adult.

276
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,714
You may fight me or mess around,

277
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:43,765
but you're not allowed
to run away from home.

278
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:45,360
Got it?

279
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:04,215
You just want me to stay home
and take care of your cousin.

280
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,215
That's right.

281
00:18:31,715 --> 00:18:33,200
Zhuo Ran didn't have a gun with him.

282
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:35,160
The meeting concluded successfully.

283
00:18:35,674 --> 00:18:36,920
I'm back to the camp.

284
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:41,285
Zhuo Ran switched my medicine.

285
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:43,184
It's not a coincidence for sure.

286
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:44,200
Something must be wrong with him.

287
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:46,160
Keep a close watch on him.

288
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:54,407
What's wrong?

289
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:58,312
Professor Xia is receiving
physiotherapy treatment. It's ending soon.

290
00:18:58,558 --> 00:18:59,760
Tang Lin wants us to wait for him.

291
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:04,306
Zhuo Ran.

292
00:19:07,217 --> 00:19:08,200
Officer Liang.

293
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:11,895
Why did you attend the medical forum?

294
00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:13,773
What's wrong?

295
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:16,965
Are you going to question me again
like those police officers?

296
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:20,598
At that moment, you behaved
as if you're fully prepared.

297
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:23,542
It's all about upbringing.

298
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:26,920
I must protect a lady
who was assaulted by a violent guy.

299
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:30,434
How about changing away my medicine?

300
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:32,455
Who were you trying to protect? Xia Chu?

301
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,218
It was me.

302
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:38,999
I'm asking you a question.

303
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:42,800
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:03,705
What happened?

305
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:10,520
Xia Chu doesn't need your protection.

306
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:12,480
Stay away from her.

307
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:18,408
Can you stay by her side
twenty-four hours a day?

308
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:21,114
When I am by her side,

309
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:24,440
what can you do for her
being in the military camp?

310
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:32,775
Try me.

311
00:20:47,785 --> 00:20:48,800
Who is he?

312
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:51,112
Why did he mention about Xia Chu?

313
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:53,965
Do they know each other?

314
00:20:54,204 --> 00:20:55,200
Professor Xia.

315
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:58,412
He is Liang Mu Ze.

316
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,023
He's an officer with
the Special Forces Brigade.

317
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,754
He's just an uncultured person...

318
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,400
who is not good at
controlling his emotion.

319
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,960
It seems that he's one of
Xia Chu's admirers too.

320
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:22,375
Rao Zhi, finally he said something.

321
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,356
He wants to see you.

322
00:21:31,315 --> 00:21:32,295
Have you thought it through?

323
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:37,480
Are you their leader?

324
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:38,995
Yes.

325
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:40,096
Leader.

326
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,640
No, I mean Chief.

327
00:21:42,825 --> 00:21:46,000
I really had no idea that
there were many other things in the car.

328
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,613
I trust you.

329
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:50,120
But would the person who met you
believe you?

330
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,720
No, Chief.

331
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:54,240
Please believe me.

332
00:21:54,755 --> 00:21:57,253
I accepted a job on the internet.

333
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:59,880
I was told to get a new car
when I reached there.

334
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,400
That lad didn't escape, did he?

335
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,080
What do you think?

336
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:14,703
Not only did he not escape,

337
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,279
he sold you out.

338
00:22:19,595 --> 00:22:20,960
He said you betrayed him.

339
00:22:21,405 --> 00:22:22,654
He's talking nonsense.

340
00:22:22,695 --> 00:22:24,135
I get nothing if I betray him.

341
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,775
Betraying him
is no different than betraying myself.

342
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,064
Fine.

343
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:34,520
I'm no stranger to people like you.

344
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,000
Hurry up.

345
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:38,680
Tell me everything that you know.

346
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:44,984
Listen, Chief.

347
00:22:45,025 --> 00:22:46,120
I'm...

348
00:22:46,982 --> 00:22:47,849
always unlucky.

349
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,200
You know what?
I ran into a silly lady.

350
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:52,104
That lady...

351
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:54,095
You'd better contact her parents
as soon as possible.

352
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:56,185
That young lady is crazy.

353
00:22:56,226 --> 00:22:58,720
Something is truly wrong with her.

354
00:22:58,761 --> 00:23:01,157
I'm worried about her.

355
00:23:01,198 --> 00:23:02,734
When her illness strikes,

356
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:04,264
in just a split second,

357
00:23:04,305 --> 00:23:06,960
she may destroy her whole family.

358
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:11,640
She always...

359
00:23:28,586 --> 00:23:30,400
You don't have to worry
about that young lady.

360
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,895
You'd better worry about yourself.

361
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:46,160
Okay, got it.

362
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,785
If I come clean,

363
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,120
will you protect me?

364
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:56,640
You're not in the position to negotiate.

365
00:23:58,345 --> 00:23:59,885
We'll ensure your safety.

366
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:03,800
Answering all the questions honestly
is the best way to save yourself.

367
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,160
The cross-border crimes is unique.

368
00:24:18,697 --> 00:24:21,960
The criminal knew that we wouldn't
conduct security check on the VIP's car.

369
00:24:22,923 --> 00:24:26,095
They filled the door
and other compartments...

370
00:24:26,136 --> 00:24:29,400
in two identical commercial vehicles
with gold and drugs.

371
00:24:30,194 --> 00:24:31,340
They intended...

372
00:24:31,381 --> 00:24:33,680
to get the transaction done in a fast way
by exchanging cars.

373
00:24:38,969 --> 00:24:40,661
According to Liu Zheng Min,

374
00:24:40,702 --> 00:24:44,765
the real owner of the sapphire
is someone by the name of Old Master.

375
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:46,191
He's the one...

376
00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:48,652
who made Liu Zheng Min
took a photo of the sapphire.

377
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:51,053
In the name of Old Master,

378
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:53,194
he also transferred the sapphire
to the deceased in the bungalow,

379
00:24:53,495 --> 00:24:54,360
Sang Kun.

380
00:24:59,803 --> 00:25:02,640
Sang Kun is kind of a big shot.

381
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:07,165
Under his financial aid, T4
developed along the way.

382
00:25:07,354 --> 00:25:08,714
However, in recent years,

383
00:25:08,755 --> 00:25:10,695
he's down with kidney failure.

384
00:25:10,785 --> 00:25:13,445
As such, T4
has been controlled by...

385
00:25:13,486 --> 00:25:14,800
Old Master who has the real power.

386
00:25:15,355 --> 00:25:16,334
As for him,

387
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:20,280
he's been
looking for a kidney for transplant.

388
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:22,879
Not long ago, the kidnapping case...

389
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,325
that happened to the Isaia Joint
Medical Team is also related to him.

390
00:25:25,444 --> 00:25:29,640
His murder is most likely a result of
the internal conflict in T4.

391
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:33,800
Judging from the current situation,

392
00:25:33,841 --> 00:25:36,385
we're unable to ascertain
the identity of Old Master.

393
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:38,135
Liu Zheng Min also said that

394
00:25:38,176 --> 00:25:39,984
he's never seen Old Master.

395
00:25:40,025 --> 00:25:44,154
He always contacted him through
a middle person on City of Desire.

396
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:45,041
Middle person?

397
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:46,800
Was it the person who met with him today?

398
00:25:46,841 --> 00:25:47,688
No.

399
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:49,440
That person is Gui's lackey.

400
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,224
According to Liu Zheng Min's statement,

401
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:52,544
the person who was supposed...

402
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:54,885
to meet up with him for transaction
was Sang Kun's younger brother,

403
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:56,796
Bai Sen, whose nickname is Gui.

404
00:25:57,027 --> 00:25:58,314
Last year,

405
00:25:58,355 --> 00:26:00,704
when Gui came to China
to find a cure for his elder brother,

406
00:26:00,745 --> 00:26:02,074
both of them met once.

407
00:26:02,115 --> 00:26:03,833
According to Liu Zheng Min's
description...

408
00:26:03,874 --> 00:26:05,474
and the surveillance recording
at the scene,

409
00:26:05,515 --> 00:26:06,615
we did a comparison.

410
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,565
We've targeted the suspect
who was blended in with the guests,

411
00:26:09,762 --> 00:26:10,760
Gui.

412
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:16,880
He disguised as Ba Song.

413
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:22,293
He pretended to be a legal representative
of a foreign listed company as a cover.

414
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:24,784
He was invited to attend
the medical forum.

415
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:28,594
Why did he send his lackey
to meet Xiong,

416
00:26:28,635 --> 00:26:30,680
but he attended the forum instead?

417
00:26:32,515 --> 00:26:33,560
What was his plan?

418
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:36,120
Xiong is unsure of his plan.

419
00:26:36,604 --> 00:26:40,925
It looks like only when we find Gui
can we find out more.

420
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:43,284
At the nearby street of the scene,

421
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:45,735
we stopped a Chevrolet car
which was ferrying Gui.

422
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:47,803
We only found a severely injured driver.

423
00:26:47,844 --> 00:26:49,760
He was announced dead
not long after he reached the hospital.

424
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:51,528
As for Gui's whereabouts,

425
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:52,720
we're still locating him.

426
00:26:55,252 --> 00:26:59,025
Did the sniper who was hiding in
the residential area find any clues?

427
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:01,424
We contacted the management department
to get the surveillance recording...

428
00:27:01,465 --> 00:27:04,480
and we found that only the recording
of the said building had gone missing.

429
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:05,801
We could only leave it to
the technology department...

430
00:27:05,842 --> 00:27:07,032
to recover the recording.

431
00:27:07,146 --> 00:27:07,993
At the same time,

432
00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:09,194
we tried to find out
the relevant information...

433
00:27:09,235 --> 00:27:10,704
by interviewing the residents.

434
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:12,274
However, the progress is slow.

435
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:14,280
We're unable to ascertain his identity
at the moment.

436
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:20,840
All right, let me
explain the coming work arrangements.

437
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,784
For Team A,

438
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:26,095
continue locating Gui's whereabouts.

439
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:30,113
You may send the relevant information
to the Command Center.

440
00:27:30,154 --> 00:27:32,025
Ask them to look out for us too.

441
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:32,946
Got it.

442
00:27:33,482 --> 00:27:34,362
Team B,

443
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:39,193
continue look out for the hidden clues
on City of Desire.

444
00:27:39,234 --> 00:27:42,120
Find out if Gui and the sniper
share any form of contact.

445
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:43,485
Team C,

446
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:47,535
follow up with Zhuo Ran, the man
who was suspected of possessing a gun.

447
00:27:48,164 --> 00:27:50,914
No doubt we didn't find
any gun on him,

448
00:27:50,955 --> 00:27:52,264
but taking into consideration

449
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:54,554
there was a time gap,

450
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:56,680
he's most likely
transferred the gun to somewhere else.

451
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,785
Besides that,

452
00:27:57,826 --> 00:27:59,836
based on the surveillance recording
at the scene,

453
00:28:00,265 --> 00:28:01,745
when Gui saw Zhuo Ran,

454
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:03,880
he behaved strangely.

455
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:05,504
Hence,

456
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:07,314
we must find out his background.

457
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:09,800
Make sure you leave no stone unturned.

458
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:11,400
-Got it?
-Yes.

459
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:21,840
Slow down.

460
00:28:22,404 --> 00:28:23,634
I live next door.

461
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:24,920
Let me know if anything.

462
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,120
Okay.

463
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:33,680
Thank you for your help.

464
00:28:34,365 --> 00:28:35,440
Rest early.

465
00:28:38,378 --> 00:28:39,278
Mi Gu.

466
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:41,045
The interview...

467
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,255
It's okay, Mr. Xia.

468
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:45,756
We can talk about it when you feel better.

469
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:48,200
That's great.

470
00:28:52,035 --> 00:28:52,920
Let me...

471
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,859
Rest early.

472
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:02,240
Mr. Zhuo.

473
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:04,720
Please send Mi Gu off.

474
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:08,360
It's okay. I should do that.

475
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:11,785
This is my name card.

476
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:14,314
When Professor Xia is in Ningjiang...

477
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:16,335
and if he needs anything,
he may contact me at any time.

478
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:19,320
Thank you.

479
00:29:20,348 --> 00:29:21,728
If it weren't for you,

480
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:24,080
god knows how huge of a mess
that madman would make.

481
00:29:25,454 --> 00:29:26,600
I'm glad that everyone is safe.

482
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:28,255
Let's go.

483
00:29:29,164 --> 00:29:31,634
Sure, let me get ready
for tomorrow's forum.

484
00:29:31,675 --> 00:29:32,680
I'll see you off.

485
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:33,975
Goodbye.

486
00:29:34,335 --> 00:29:35,280
Goodbye.

487
00:29:49,775 --> 00:29:50,680
Zhuo Ran.

488
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,660
I'm home.

489
00:30:00,855 --> 00:30:01,800
You should go up.

490
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,360
Hold on.

491
00:30:18,774 --> 00:30:19,760
I've something to return to you.

492
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:21,720
Is this yours?

493
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:28,880
Don't you think you need to explain to me?

494
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:33,656
I'm exhausted, Mi Gu.

495
00:30:33,697 --> 00:30:34,963
I'm exhausted too.

496
00:30:35,004 --> 00:30:36,745
I was on tenterhooks at the hospital.

497
00:30:36,786 --> 00:30:37,633
I wanted to ask you,

498
00:30:37,674 --> 00:30:39,164
but I worried that someone
might find out about it.

499
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,054
Where did it come from?

500
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:42,955
Why did you keep a gun with you?

501
00:30:55,935 --> 00:30:56,880
It's fake.

502
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,400
It's just a toy.

503
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,960
Then why didn't you inform me before hand?

504
00:31:12,385 --> 00:31:13,640
It was an emergency.

505
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:15,320
I did it subconsciously.

506
00:31:17,395 --> 00:31:19,280
You knew that the police officers
would conduct a search on you.

507
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,800
I only know that all the police officers
in the world are the same.

508
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:25,640
If they found out that
I brought a toy gun with me,

509
00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:28,200
they would interrogate me non-stop...

510
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:30,821
and then choose to believe
what they want to believe.

511
00:31:31,202 --> 00:31:32,482
I didn't want to put myself in trouble.

512
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,000
What if I got myself into trouble?

513
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,760
If that ever happened,

514
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,400
I would explain to them.

515
00:31:45,232 --> 00:31:46,560
You hugged me...

516
00:31:48,225 --> 00:31:51,360
just to hide the gun
and avoid the risk, right?

517
00:31:55,184 --> 00:31:56,160
Am I right, Zhuo Ran?

518
00:31:57,734 --> 00:31:58,600
No.

519
00:32:00,244 --> 00:32:01,274
At that moment,

520
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:02,400
I wanted to give you some comfort.

521
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:07,828
I'm going upstairs.

522
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:26,263
Have you found Gui?

523
00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:28,605
You're asking me?

524
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:33,320
He ran away under your nose.
Why are you asking me?

525
00:32:33,825 --> 00:32:35,105
The situation was a chaos.

526
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:36,480
It was chaotic, yes.

527
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,825
You've been making errors
in the past few missions.

528
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:42,526
Don't tell me it's an accident.

529
00:32:44,945 --> 00:32:46,005
What else could it be?

530
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:47,440
What do you think it is?

531
00:32:48,394 --> 00:32:49,824
Don't think that you can
check and balance Old Master...

532
00:32:49,865 --> 00:32:51,165
by releasing Gui.

533
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:53,545
If you don't want your mum...

534
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:54,883
Don't talk about my mum!

535
00:32:54,924 --> 00:32:55,864
For your mum's sake,

536
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:58,040
you'd better stop playing tricks!

537
00:33:19,585 --> 00:33:20,615
Old Master.

538
00:33:20,905 --> 00:33:22,320
Are you done with Gui?

539
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:24,534
I'm sorry.

540
00:33:27,394 --> 00:33:30,120
You know that I hate apologies the most.

541
00:33:31,435 --> 00:33:32,365
I know.

542
00:33:32,573 --> 00:33:34,713
However, though Gui escaped,

543
00:33:34,754 --> 00:33:37,120
we finally got to meet Xia Guang Yuan.

544
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:39,934
He's changed his mind about me
due to the incident.

545
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,484
Hence,

546
00:33:41,525 --> 00:33:42,920
it's not completely a bust.

547
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,920
What went wrong in the process?

548
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:48,337
Liang Mu Ze.

549
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:49,423
Who?

550
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:53,225
He's the Chinese military officer
who I had bugs installed at his place.

551
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:54,878
Xia Chu is living at his place.

552
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:56,139
They're quite close.

553
00:33:56,385 --> 00:33:57,994
Because of him,

554
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:59,375
Gui escaped.

555
00:33:59,459 --> 00:34:03,200
His presence has made my attempt
to approach Xia Chu even harder.

556
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,484
I wanted to kill him before but I failed.

557
00:34:06,908 --> 00:34:09,474
He's a Special Forces soldier
and he usually live in the military camp.

558
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:10,855
It's difficult to go near him.

559
00:34:10,896 --> 00:34:12,086
Even if I get to approach him,

560
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:15,855
it would be too risky
to take action in China.

561
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,354
Unless...

562
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:18,444
Unless what?

563
00:34:18,485 --> 00:34:21,671
Unless we can find a chance
to end him...

564
00:34:21,712 --> 00:34:22,880
when he receives training abroad.

565
00:34:23,285 --> 00:34:25,600
The difficulty will be much lower.

566
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:27,760
End him abroad?

567
00:34:30,955 --> 00:34:31,835
Zhuo Ran.

568
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,480
You're really something.

569
00:34:33,915 --> 00:34:35,295
Just by one line,

570
00:34:35,336 --> 00:34:36,880
you passed the problem to me.

571
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,723
You can send Long Yi.

572
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,745
Are you trying to get rid of me?

573
00:34:42,786 --> 00:34:44,236
You serve no purpose here.

574
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:45,840
Enough.

575
00:34:48,223 --> 00:34:51,734
Your mission is to look for Gui
and nail Xia Guang Yuan.

576
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:54,280
As for Liang Mu Ze who may spoil our plan,

577
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:00,600
send his particulars to me.

578
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,120
Got it.

579
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:07,680
What should we do?

580
00:35:09,305 --> 00:35:10,760
It's not difficult to trace Gui.

581
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:13,125
It's easy for you to say.

582
00:35:14,985 --> 00:35:17,040
Keep a close eye on
the police and Xia Guang Yuan.

583
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,000
The police are looking for him
and he's looking for Xia Guang Yuan.

584
00:35:19,545 --> 00:35:20,520
We'll find something eventually.

585
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:46,720
What on earth is this?

586
00:35:54,715 --> 00:35:55,920
Who is she?

587
00:35:58,578 --> 00:35:59,600
Meet each other.

588
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:02,560
She's Liang Mu Ze's cousin.
Her name is Liang Shao Xue.

589
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,504
Be careful.

590
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:06,040
Don't let her crush you to death.

591
00:36:07,058 --> 00:36:08,640
This is my place!

592
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:10,600
Look after her. I need to take a rest.

593
00:36:11,947 --> 00:36:12,827
Please don't leave.

594
00:36:46,824 --> 00:36:49,534
Where is this?

595
00:36:55,744 --> 00:36:57,760
What's wrong?

596
00:36:58,515 --> 00:36:59,680
It has nothing to do with me.

597
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,880
Where is this?

598
00:37:04,775 --> 00:37:05,760
This...

599
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:07,629
This is Liang Mu Ze's place.

600
00:37:07,945 --> 00:37:09,360
How is it possible?

601
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:11,658
No way Mu Ze has a pet cat.

602
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:14,359
It licked my face!

603
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:17,160
Don't be dramatic.

604
00:37:18,515 --> 00:37:19,440
Calm down.

605
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:20,944
It's early in the morning.

606
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:22,264
Don't make a ruckus.

607
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:24,905
Don't irritate our neighbour
or they may report it to the police.

608
00:37:24,946 --> 00:37:26,466
Leave me alone!

609
00:37:26,507 --> 00:37:28,040
I'm about to explode!

610
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:36,920
Calm down.

611
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:40,695
You're completely awake.

612
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,904
If I hadn't woken up,

613
00:37:41,945 --> 00:37:43,855
I might have been sold off
without knowing it.

614
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:47,085
Do you remember
yesterday, in the afternoon,

615
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:49,066
you suddenly fell asleep
at the corridor in the hospital?

616
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:52,320
Falling asleep is normal.

617
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:54,664
I was dealing with jet lag.

618
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:55,985
I didn't say that it's abnormal.

619
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:59,576
I just want to remind you that
when you were in a deep sleep,

620
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,933
it was me who brought you home...

621
00:38:02,974 --> 00:38:04,513
despite being completely
burnt out after a night shift.

622
00:38:04,554 --> 00:38:06,275
Not only did you not thank me,
you're dubious of me.

623
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:07,646
You suspected that I would sell you off!

624
00:38:08,195 --> 00:38:09,585
Fine, it's okay.

625
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:10,584
You can question me all you want.

626
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,505
But now, I beg of you.

627
00:38:12,546 --> 00:38:15,634
Will you keep quiet
and let me take a nap?

628
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:17,945
That's because I need to work
in the afternoon.

629
00:38:17,986 --> 00:38:18,866
Okay?

630
00:38:22,155 --> 00:38:23,325
Repeat!

631
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:26,240
-What?
-Repeat

632
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:27,400
the last word.

633
00:38:29,504 --> 00:38:30,984
I said so many things.

634
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:31,905
The last...

635
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:33,855
What did I say?

636
00:38:34,865 --> 00:38:38,965
I said I need to work in the afternoon.

637
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:40,560
Okay?

638
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:44,098
Okay?

639
00:38:45,035 --> 00:38:47,585
What should I do? I forgot about okay!

640
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,876
How could I forgot okay?

641
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:53,156
My okay!

642
00:38:57,945 --> 00:38:58,800
Report.

643
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:00,812
Come in.

644
00:39:04,364 --> 00:39:05,244
Brigade Commander.

645
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:09,255
The police have forwarded the summary
of the action to me.

646
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:10,880
I'm waiting for
a detailed report from you.

647
00:39:12,455 --> 00:39:14,245
Something happened in the process.

648
00:39:14,286 --> 00:39:15,840
However, it went on smoothly in general.

649
00:39:16,305 --> 00:39:17,245
Sure, it's okay.

650
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:19,615
Later, please submit a report in detail.

651
00:39:20,215 --> 00:39:21,077
By the way,

652
00:39:21,118 --> 00:39:24,645
have an internal meeting with
everyone who took part in the action...

653
00:39:24,686 --> 00:39:25,816
to conclude the matter.

654
00:39:26,285 --> 00:39:27,794
-Yes.
-Also,

655
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:30,124
I received instruction
from the higher authorities...

656
00:39:30,165 --> 00:39:32,525
to send a team to
the Central Asian military training...

657
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:34,346
which will be held by Willick
at the end of the month.

658
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:35,520
End of the month?

659
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:37,034
We don't have much time.

660
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:39,125
You'll be leading the team
during the training camp.

661
00:39:39,532 --> 00:39:40,502
How long will it take?

662
00:39:40,975 --> 00:39:42,275
It's tentatively scheduled for a week.

663
00:39:42,476 --> 00:39:45,040
However,
it depends on the training progress.

664
00:39:45,757 --> 00:39:46,597
Do you have any question?

665
00:39:46,638 --> 00:39:47,518
No.

666
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,085
Get ready.
Military reform is just around the corner.

667
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:54,800
This is a rare opportunity.

668
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,630
Don't make any mistake.

669
00:39:57,192 --> 00:39:58,160
Yes, sir.

670
00:40:06,935 --> 00:40:09,360
Can you stay by her side
twenty-four hours a day?

671
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,360
When I am by her side,

672
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:15,600
what can you do for her
being in the military camp?

673
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:38,035
Brigade Commander
wants me to check on you.

674
00:40:39,425 --> 00:40:40,375
Why?

675
00:40:41,778 --> 00:40:44,525
He thinks that you're not in a good mood
after executing the mission.

676
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:54,215
It turns out that
Xia Chu is also suffering from insomnia.

677
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,105
Why can't she fall asleep?

678
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:57,575
It's because of her first love.

679
00:40:58,397 --> 00:41:00,707
You...

680
00:41:01,682 --> 00:41:03,320
Are you in a bad mood?

681
00:41:04,272 --> 00:41:05,172
No.

682
00:41:08,812 --> 00:41:09,760
I'm worried.

683
00:41:10,907 --> 00:41:14,000
I think this guy
has some hidden agendas.

684
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:30,172
Hello.

685
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:31,338
Old Master.

686
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,735
The military invited the special
forces of China for a training camp.

687
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:37,166
It seems that...

688
00:41:37,207 --> 00:41:40,027
the person who you're interested in
is in the participant list.

689
00:41:40,488 --> 00:41:42,848
I've sent you his particulars
through email.

690
00:41:43,174 --> 00:41:44,394
You may take a look.

691
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:46,725
Got it.

692
00:42:16,544 --> 00:42:17,964
Judging from the x-ray,

693
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:20,185
it's aortic regurgitation.

694
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:23,075
You can't wait any longer.

695
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:25,394
Many problems will manifest as time pass.

696
00:42:25,435 --> 00:42:26,754
Therefore, I suggest that...

697
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,655
you undergo the surgery
as soon as possible.

698
00:42:29,395 --> 00:42:30,455
I can't do that, doctor.

699
00:42:30,496 --> 00:42:32,520
I'm really occupied at work.

700
00:42:32,561 --> 00:42:33,760
I can't make it.

701
00:42:34,024 --> 00:42:35,760
Let me be frank.

702
00:42:36,115 --> 00:42:38,135
You will have to undergo the surgery
sooner or later.

703
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,590
It's better to do it early.

704
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:44,400
I think my body is doing fine.

705
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:45,560
It's okay.

706
00:42:46,145 --> 00:42:47,880
Why are you here if everything is okay?

707
00:42:48,754 --> 00:42:50,304
Why do you come to me if you're okay?

708
00:42:50,345 --> 00:42:52,415
I'm busy.
Don't take up my time for nothing.

709
00:42:52,732 --> 00:42:54,423
Doctor, don't be mad.

710
00:42:54,464 --> 00:42:55,697
I'm not mad.

711
00:42:55,738 --> 00:42:56,800
It's your body.

712
00:42:57,402 --> 00:42:58,727
You should think for yourself.

713
00:42:59,414 --> 00:43:01,594
I know. How about this?

714
00:43:01,635 --> 00:43:02,744
Please prescribe some medicine for me.

715
00:43:02,785 --> 00:43:03,785
I'll start with taking medicine.

716
00:43:03,971 --> 00:43:04,841
What do you think?

717
00:43:04,884 --> 00:43:06,965
Please do me a favour.
Thank you. Please do me a favour.

718
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:10,015
Don't stretch yourself thin.

719
00:43:12,734 --> 00:43:15,080
If you are down with flu or diarrhea,

720
00:43:15,121 --> 00:43:16,491
you must seek medical help
soonest the possible.

721
00:43:16,834 --> 00:43:19,271
-Sure.
-If your heart contracted a virus,

722
00:43:19,312 --> 00:43:20,560
it would become a serious problem.

723
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:21,891
-Okay.
-Bear it in mind.

724
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:23,664
Okay.

725
00:43:24,243 --> 00:43:25,123
Okay.

726
00:43:25,655 --> 00:43:27,840
Thank you, doctor.

727
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,640
That's all for today. Come again tomorrow.

728
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:44,200
Dr. Zhang, it's me.

729
00:43:49,052 --> 00:43:50,160
It's you.

730
00:43:50,201 --> 00:43:51,381
Yes.

731
00:43:52,155 --> 00:43:53,095
Where is Xiao Jun?

732
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:55,800
Xiao Jun has gone to school.

733
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,988
I'm out for groceries shopping.

734
00:43:58,036 --> 00:44:00,976
That's why I brought you
some steamed cakes which I just made.

735
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:01,864
Try it.

736
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:02,785
Great.

737
00:44:03,364 --> 00:44:05,080
I was thinking
what I should have for lunch.

738
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:07,230
Thank you.

739
00:44:07,585 --> 00:44:08,560
You're welcome.

740
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:10,083
I should be the one to thank you.

741
00:44:10,124 --> 00:44:12,179
Xiao Jun recovered well after the surgery.

742
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,480
Therefore,
I'm here to thank you officially.

743
00:44:15,968 --> 00:44:17,638
Don't do that.

744
00:44:17,965 --> 00:44:19,960
What are you doing?
You don't have to do that.

745
00:44:24,905 --> 00:44:25,965
Well...

746
00:44:26,204 --> 00:44:27,840
I'll not take up your time.

747
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:29,101
Enjoy the food.

748
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:30,520
Sure, thank you.

749
00:44:31,488 --> 00:44:32,560
I'm leaving.

750
00:44:34,274 --> 00:44:35,687
-Goodbye.
-Sure.

751
00:44:35,728 --> 00:44:37,280
Chen Meng Zhen.

752
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:42,080
My name is Zhang Yi Chi.

753
00:44:42,585 --> 00:44:43,705
The next time we meet each other,

754
00:44:43,746 --> 00:44:44,960
you may address me by my first name.

755
00:44:45,001 --> 00:44:47,000
You're being so polite all the time.

756
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,400
You sound distant.

757
00:44:48,441 --> 00:44:50,000
We're almost the same age.

758
00:44:50,615 --> 00:44:52,880
The way you address me
makes me sound old.

759
00:44:54,095 --> 00:44:55,480
Okay, I got it now.

760
00:44:56,924 --> 00:44:58,320
-I'll go now.
-Goodbye.

761
00:44:58,913 --> 00:44:59,800
Goodbye.
