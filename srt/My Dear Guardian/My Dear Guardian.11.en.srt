1
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,770
=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 11=

3
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:31,240
Captain.

4
00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:47,670
Captain Liang!

5
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:49,151
What are you doing here? Leave now!

6
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:51,592
I'm here to deliver the medicine
and to give you a checkup.

7
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:52,671
I'm alright. Leave now!

8
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:54,003
How can you be alright?

9
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:56,074
Xiao Teng said you haven't slept
for days.

10
00:02:56,413 --> 00:02:58,173
I'm reminding you as a doctor.

11
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,832
You must take a break now!

12
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:02,003
No need to!

13
00:03:02,343 --> 00:03:04,083
Just take a break for a few minutes.

14
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:07,198
Send her away.

15
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,441
Unless you take a break,
I'm not going anywhere.

16
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,212
Captain, why don't you listen to Dr. Xia?

17
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:14,763
So you're aware that I'm your captain?

18
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:16,286
Send her away!

19
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:17,787
Listen, Liang Mu Ze.

20
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:20,863
You should carry out
the mission on the premise...

21
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,480
that you take care of yourself.

22
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,181
You're made of blood and flesh!

23
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:26,896
I'm an occupational military officer.

24
00:03:26,937 --> 00:03:28,652
I know my own body's condition.

25
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:30,451
-Send her away!
-Yes!

26
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,742
Don't touch me! Liang Mu Ze!

27
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:36,281
Liang Mu Ze!

28
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:38,520
-Keep working! Stay safe!
-Yes!

29
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:40,062
Liang Mu Ze, let go of me!

30
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:41,113
What are you doing?

31
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:42,843
Liang Mu Ze, let go of me!

32
00:03:42,884 --> 00:03:43,904
Do you hear me?

33
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:45,480
Liang Mu Ze, let go of me!

34
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:46,891
I'm getting angry!

35
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:49,758
Liang Mu Ze, let go of me!

36
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:50,899
I'm getting angry!

37
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:53,029
Brigade Commander Dong!

38
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,640
Help, Brigade Commander Dong!

39
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,520
Liang Mu Ze!

40
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:02,888
Brigade Commander.

41
00:04:03,372 --> 00:04:05,002
What are you doing?

42
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:22,692
Xiao Teng!

43
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:24,553
Xiao Teng, what's wrong?

44
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:29,131
Xia Chu.

45
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:31,009
Have some water.

46
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,019
Cool down.

47
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:33,720
Thank you, Brigade Commander Dong.

48
00:04:37,884 --> 00:04:39,945
He's not gentle at all.

49
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:41,603
You need to reflect upon yourself

50
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:43,572
for what has happened today.

51
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:44,649
As long as she stays away from the dyke,

52
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,870
I'll reflect upon myself on anything.

53
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,113
If I don't go to the dyke,
will you take a break?

54
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:49,698
Is it the right time for a break?

55
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:51,479
-As I said, your safety...
-Enough!

56
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,062
How are things going on on your side?

57
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:58,942
No doubt the water level
at the ten mission areas have reduced,

58
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:01,083
but the water level at three other areas
are still above the warning line.

59
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:03,513
Mission area number two
is the most dangerous one.

60
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,253
What happened?

61
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:09,624
Don't move. Let me check on him.

62
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:15,592
-He came down with a fever.
-Report!

63
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:17,781
Brigade Commander!

64
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:19,382
Brigade Commander.

65
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:21,203
Something urgent came up
at Dr. Wu's camp.

66
00:05:21,952 --> 00:05:22,832
What?

67
00:05:30,392 --> 00:05:32,412
Brigade Commander,
the three patients who caught a cold...

68
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:34,382
came down with fevers
higher than 39 degrees Celsius.

69
00:05:34,423 --> 00:05:36,633
They have sore throats,
stuffy noses and body aches.

70
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:38,873
They also suffer from
coughing and diarrhea.

71
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:41,443
Report.

72
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:43,498
I need to use the outhouse.

73
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:44,652
-Tian Yong.
-Yes!

74
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:45,983
-Bring him to the outhouse.
-Yes.

75
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:55,648
Brigade Commander, I must not die.

76
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:58,553
I'm the only son in the family.

77
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:01,043
He is still waiting to hand over
the family business to me.

78
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:03,344
Cut the nonsense.

79
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,683
Stay in bed.

80
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:06,003
Yes.

81
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:08,332
Can't you confirm the diagnosis by now?

82
00:06:08,373 --> 00:06:09,612
With the equipment that we have,

83
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:10,582
I can't confirm the diagnosis.

84
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:12,292
You can report it to the superior
since there are three patients.

85
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,213
It's four.

86
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:15,803
We have to include the staff officer
who has just passed out.

87
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,382
-What's wrong, Xiao Teng?
-I'm having a stomachache.

88
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:20,412
Don't go near him.

89
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:21,523
Stay back.

90
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:22,819
Yes.

91
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,341
Brigade Commander Dong.

92
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:27,243
Please arrange manpower
to isolate this tent.

93
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,092
Before the superior unit sends someone
who can confirm the diagnosis,

94
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:31,212
besides Dr. Wu and me,

95
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:32,553
everyone else
has to leave the tent immediately.

96
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:35,547
Is it really so serious?

97
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:37,298
Plague always comes after a flood,
Brigade Commander.

98
00:07:19,943 --> 00:07:21,315
Observe the patients closely.

99
00:07:21,356 --> 00:07:22,706
Lower his body temperature.

100
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:23,938
Yes.

101
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:31,852
Do you feel better?

102
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:32,953
I'm still not feeling well.

103
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:34,447
You're still not feeling well?

104
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,833
-My body is burning.
-Okay.

105
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:43,753
Now, the doctors are doing their best
to save our comrades!

106
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:49,883
We have to hold on to our post
to protect their safety!

107
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:51,293
Got it?

108
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:52,808
Yes!

109
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,433
It's okay, don't worry.

110
00:07:56,263 --> 00:07:57,193
Don't be scared.

111
00:08:21,197 --> 00:08:22,847
Finally, it's sunny again.

112
00:09:23,468 --> 00:09:24,808
It's finally sunny again.

113
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,334
Yes.

114
00:09:37,973 --> 00:09:39,163
Will they recover?

115
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:43,399
Are you scared?

116
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,626
Have you ever met some people in life...

117
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,683
where you completely trust them
and will take a bullet for each other?

118
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:55,841
Have you?

119
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:01,193
I trust all of them.

120
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,502
Every time I bring them out on a mission,

121
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:06,883
I only have one thought.

122
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,490
I will make sure they're intact...

123
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,993
when they go home to their parents,

124
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:15,127
wives, and children.

125
00:10:21,044 --> 00:10:22,904
The tears of a military officer's
family are too heavy.

126
00:10:24,381 --> 00:10:25,440
I can't take it.

127
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:56,027
(Martyr Luo Liang)

128
00:11:10,823 --> 00:11:11,840
Meng Zhen.

129
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:14,943
Don't worry.

130
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,738
We'll always keep you
and your son company.

131
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,322
If I had a choice,

132
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:43,792
I would rather be
the person in the casket.

133
00:11:44,783 --> 00:11:46,080
I don't want anything
to happen to my comrades.

134
00:11:47,276 --> 00:11:48,736
That's why when we were in Isaia,

135
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:51,440
when Lieutenant Tian injured himself,

136
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:53,723
you overreacted.

137
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:57,753
It's not only because
Tian Yong injured himself.

138
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:01,317
It's also because of
your reckless behaviour...

139
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:02,608
when we're organizing the rescue.

140
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,902
The moment you lifted the robber's gun,

141
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:06,280
it's no different from committing suicide.
Do you know that?

142
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:10,353
If I didn't give it a second thought
and fired the gun at you,

143
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:14,434
I think my career as a military officer
would have stopped then.

144
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:18,683
I bet the complaint
must have caused you so much trouble.

145
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,560
I was number one
in the Hunter Military School assessment.

146
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:23,546
Then, I dropped to number two.

147
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:26,275
Songpaisarn got the advantage for nothing.

148
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,228
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:29,333
It's okay.

150
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:30,713
I'll take it back soon or later.

151
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:37,375
How about you?

152
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:38,641
Are you scared?

153
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:41,873
Back in 2003, Ms. Lan,

154
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:44,747
who was my mom,

155
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:47,931
was the chief nurse
of the General Surgery Department...

156
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:49,372
of the city's best hospital.

157
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:51,633
She contracted SARS
when she was taking care of the patients.

158
00:12:53,263 --> 00:12:55,123
Though she survived the disease,

159
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:57,931
her health deteriorated.

160
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:00,163
She had no choice but to retire early.

161
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:02,492
Because of my mom,

162
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:03,923
I decided to become a doctor.

163
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:06,883
In the beginning, she was against it.

164
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:09,901
When the admission letter
was sent to my house,

165
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:13,516
she looked at it for a long time.

166
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:17,923
Then, she said,

167
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:20,833
"Daughter,"

168
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,609
"there's no turning back."

169
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:32,003
As a doctor,

170
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,619
fear...

171
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:37,193
is one of the human natures
that we have to get over.

172
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:38,993
Instead of feeling scared,

173
00:13:39,806 --> 00:13:43,793
my urge to play my role as a doctor
at disastrous times is stronger.

174
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,457
I don't want to live with regrets.

175
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:47,572
As such,

176
00:13:47,973 --> 00:13:49,043
no matter what,

177
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:52,443
I'll guard the dyke.

178
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:54,922
I'll stay committed
and dedicated to my job.

179
00:13:54,963 --> 00:13:56,113
I'll complete my duty.

180
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:57,993
Before my comrades give up,

181
00:13:58,395 --> 00:13:59,545
I'll never give up.

182
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:02,772
Being committed doesn't mean
you don't have to take care of yourself.

183
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:04,953
Something bad will happen
if you don't rest well.

184
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:06,883
Are you worried about me?

185
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:08,013
Yes.

186
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:12,251
Why?

187
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:20,356
Why are you worried about me?

188
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:27,274
I'm a doctor, Liang Mu Ze.

189
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:30,928
I can't stand it when someone
doesn't take care of themselves.

190
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:35,483
Thank you, Dr. Xia.

191
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:43,600
They're back.

192
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:54,459
Brigade Commander!

193
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:57,253
Brigade Commander!

194
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:02,078
Sir.

195
00:15:02,343 --> 00:15:03,963
It's the W4C9 virus.

196
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:05,413
No mutation is detected.

197
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:06,504
The vaccine is already on the way.

198
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:08,462
The isolation measures
were executed just in time.

199
00:15:08,503 --> 00:15:10,363
We'll wait for the patients
to be vaccinated.

200
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:12,012
Then, conduct blood tests on the soldiers.

201
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:12,963
We'll give them a talk
on prevention and control...

202
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:14,154
to prevent further infection.

203
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,773
Let's start working!

204
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:17,787
Yes!

205
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:19,414
-Liang Mu Ze!
-Yes!

206
00:15:19,455 --> 00:15:20,840
-Carry out full protection!
-Yes!

207
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,470
Come with me!

208
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:31,462
See?

209
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:33,313
As usual, you hold us up again.

210
00:15:33,783 --> 00:15:34,663
But,

211
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:36,883
well done!

212
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:38,190
-Report.
-Come in.

213
00:16:39,143 --> 00:16:41,833
Captain, Xiao Teng's fever is gone.

214
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:43,080
How is he doing?

215
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:44,560
He's doing fine.

216
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:45,581
Xiang Yang is taking care of him.

217
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:47,520
He's still muddle-headed though.

218
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:48,491
He kept asking me,

219
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,193
"Where are the angels?"

220
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:51,683
What angels?

221
00:16:51,904 --> 00:16:53,614
When he came down with the fever,

222
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:55,487
he thought Dr. Xia had a pair of wings.

223
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,923
Have the medical team left?

224
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:01,648
Not yet, they're on the dyke.

225
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:03,480
Brigade Commander wants to send them off.

226
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:05,132
Let's check it out.

227
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:06,073
Yes.

228
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,342
Thank you for your help.

229
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:14,883
-Don't mention it.
-Otherwise, God knows...

230
00:17:14,924 --> 00:17:16,542
what would happen to the soldiers.

231
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,772
It's our duty.

232
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:18,692
Thank you for the hard work.

233
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:46,344
Salute!

234
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:57,083
Take care.

235
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,280
I'll wait for you to come home.

236
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,362
All thanks to the doctors,

237
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:07,993
especially Dr. Xia.

238
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:12,313
She looks fragile
but she takes her job so seriously.

239
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:13,556
Not only is she professional,

240
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:15,221
she is also kind-hearted.

241
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,240
She is such a nice lady.

242
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:19,908
What do you think, captain?

243
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,803
What's wrong? Are you having insomnia?

244
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:29,877
I'm exhausted physically
but my brain keeps me awake.

245
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:31,753
These are my first sleeping pills
since I came here.

246
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:34,443
Every medicine has its side effects.
Don't...

247
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:37,733
What's wrong?

248
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,147
Something is wrong with the pills.

249
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:54,382
It looks like an effervescent tablet.

250
00:18:54,423 --> 00:18:55,723
It dissolves in the water right away.

251
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:01,120
It melts in water.

252
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:14,880
At ease! Attention!

253
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:16,760
Look to the left!

254
00:19:18,077 --> 00:19:19,560
Eyes front! At Ease.

255
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,160
Attention!

256
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:25,720
Later, according
to the order from the superior,

257
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:29,121
besides the injured soldiers
who are recuperating,

258
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:31,692
the rest who are from
combat battalion and Special Forces...

259
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,483
are going to Zone Four.

260
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,100
Team Nine of the Special Forces Brigade
will stay back...

261
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,481
as the reserve team, just in case.

262
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:40,720
-Got it?
-Yes!

263
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:08,003
It's the same formula.

264
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:10,593
The smell is so familiar.

265
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:15,737
Are you done being sentimental?

266
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:19,508
Dr. Zhang.

267
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:23,716
How does leading a surgery feel?

268
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:28,040
Just like a nightmare, it's exciting!

269
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:29,851
Great.

270
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:32,362
Get ready to enter the theater.

271
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:33,560
Now?

272
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,342
The heart transplant which was
scheduled earlier had been postponed.

273
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:40,081
Of course, if you're not keen
to take part in it,

274
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,245
you may skip it.

275
00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:42,252
I want to join.

276
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:44,123
-Sure.
-Dr. Zhang.

277
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,870
Yes?

278
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,440
Xiao Xiao performed well too.

279
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:53,410
So?

280
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:55,841
She would like to watch
the heart transplant surgery.

281
00:20:55,966 --> 00:20:57,942
Can both of us
enter the theater together?

282
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,033
It's full.

283
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:01,891
There's only one vacancy
for a houseman.

284
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:05,041
Is there any question?

285
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,200
No.

286
00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:10,283
All right, hurry up.

287
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:20,163
-In the next round...
-I won't thank you.

288
00:21:22,373 --> 00:21:24,753
Next time, it'll be me.

289
00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:37,856
This place is a battlefield for patients.

290
00:21:38,124 --> 00:21:39,624
It's also a battlefield for doctors.

291
00:21:39,887 --> 00:21:44,368
Everyone who enters this place
is fighting for survival.

292
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:46,932
For life,

293
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,091
dignity,

294
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:49,218
responsibility,

295
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:51,609
and the irreplaceable
sense of accomplishment at work,

296
00:21:51,973 --> 00:21:54,618
we put ourselves in tight spots
over and over again.

297
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,039
We fight hard against the God of Death.

298
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:04,267
If I chose the path
because of youth's passion,

299
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:06,412
then being persistent
throughout the journey...

300
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:08,880
is because I have faith in the profession.

301
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:10,372
As the saying goes,

302
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,040
"The one who wants to wear a crown"

303
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,600
"must bear the weight."

304
00:22:16,463 --> 00:22:18,353
I'm looking for a birthday present
for our daughter.

305
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:22,888
You told me she likes dolls, right?

306
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:28,191
She doesn't like it anymore?

307
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:32,802
All right, I got it.

308
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:36,200
What is it? Say it.

309
00:22:40,532 --> 00:22:42,372
No, no way!

310
00:22:42,413 --> 00:22:43,863
It's not the right time.

311
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,482
When I'm done with my work,

312
00:22:46,523 --> 00:22:47,853
I'll pay her a visit.

313
00:22:49,176 --> 00:22:51,276
I don't know when I can get it done.

314
00:22:53,422 --> 00:22:54,612
Stop speaking in English!

315
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:55,723
I don't understand English.

316
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:58,177
Listen...

317
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:12,751
Li Lei.

318
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,203
Rao Zhi, we found something.

319
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:18,193
Okay, got it. I'm coming back.

320
00:23:20,853 --> 00:23:21,833
How is it?

321
00:23:22,764 --> 00:23:23,644
Rao Zhi.

322
00:23:23,856 --> 00:23:25,532
The information is provided by
the Intelligence Bureau.

323
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:27,902
Xiong has been scrutinized by
the narcotics squad for a long time.

324
00:23:27,943 --> 00:23:30,723
They suspect that his business
is just a camouflage.

325
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:33,102
He supplies
a type of Chinese shrub, Ephedra...

326
00:23:33,143 --> 00:23:35,772
which is one of the ingredients to produce
crystal meth to drug cartels abroad.

327
00:23:35,813 --> 00:23:37,640
Have the narcotics squad taken any action?

328
00:23:38,423 --> 00:23:40,342
Not yet.
They haven't figured out...

329
00:23:40,383 --> 00:23:41,732
the mode of communication
and the transaction channel...

330
00:23:41,773 --> 00:23:42,982
between Xiong and the purchasers.

331
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:44,713
Just like us, they're monitoring him.

332
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,584
Channel?

333
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:53,394
The City of Desire?

334
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:17,113
(Completing invasion)

335
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:30,458
(Please send the information
to my mailbox.)

336
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:43,159
Xiao Xiao, let's hang out tonight.

337
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:46,271
I can't make it. I'm on duty.

338
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:47,993
How about Xiao Chu?

339
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:51,139
I'll pass. Something happened at home.

340
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:55,354
I heard that front line flood fighters
have left the disaster area.

341
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:58,120
I guess your beloved military officer
is coming home, right?

342
00:24:59,462 --> 00:25:00,802
He's not mine.

343
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:03,513
As for his whereabouts,
you have to ask him.

344
00:25:04,142 --> 00:25:05,220
Goodbye, everyone.

345
00:25:05,261 --> 00:25:06,280
Have fun!

346
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:10,403
She's so impatient.

347
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:59,215
Welcome home, Captain Liang.

348
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:01,809
I left my key in the military camp.

349
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,103
Take it.

350
00:26:04,048 --> 00:26:04,928
What is this?

351
00:26:06,635 --> 00:26:07,655
Give me a hug.

352
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:11,065
You bought custard steamed buns!

353
00:26:11,376 --> 00:26:12,546
Yes, I crave it.

354
00:26:12,913 --> 00:26:14,177
That's why I bought an extra portion.

355
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:22,440
Finally you're back.
I've missed you so much!

Should I start cooking?

00:27:31,637 --> 00:27:33,273

By the way,

381
00:29:28,677 --> 00:29:30,217
I prepared some pills for you.

382
00:29:30,622 --> 00:29:32,502
Take one tablet
when you're having insomnia.

383
00:29:32,543 --> 00:29:33,780
Don't overdose.

384
00:29:33,821 --> 00:29:35,151
Every medicine has its side effects.

385
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:38,539
What's wrong?

386
00:29:39,853 --> 00:29:41,203
Something is wrong with the medicine.

387
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,880
I'll leave Er Miao with you. Let's go.

388
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:09,106
Custard steamed bun will be ready soon.

389
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:12,320
Did you cook those dishes?

390
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:15,033
No, they're cooked by Ms. Snail.

391
00:30:17,635 --> 00:30:19,295
What a lame joke.

392
00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:21,394
I love cooking.

393
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,541
Why?

394
00:30:22,582 --> 00:30:24,012
Human heart is located above the stomach.

395
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:26,139
The way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

396
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,273
Is it scientifically proven?

397
00:30:28,472 --> 00:30:31,313
Please trust the professional judgment
of a cardiac surgeon.

398
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:33,292
So much for professional judgment.

399
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,513
Have some soup.

400
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:45,920
Have you taken the pills I gave you?

401
00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:47,533
I took one.

402
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:49,463
You...

403
00:30:50,173 --> 00:30:51,763
Did you notice anything?

404
00:30:52,423 --> 00:30:53,320
What is it?

405
00:30:56,513 --> 00:30:57,920
You're indeed a straight guy.

406
00:31:00,053 --> 00:31:00,933
Nothing.

407
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:06,963
How many days will you stay?

408
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,413
I'm going back to
the military camp tomorrow.

409
00:31:10,143 --> 00:31:12,182
All your comrades are back, right?

410
00:31:12,223 --> 00:31:13,153
Yes, they're back.

411
00:31:15,543 --> 00:31:16,423
Good to hear that.

412
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,250
I was under the impression

413
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,913
doctors take life and death lightly.

414
00:31:26,893 --> 00:31:29,453
I don't know about others
but I...

415
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:32,082
I don't have the talent
to take it lightly.

416
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,299
When I was undergoing rotation
at the Obstetrics Department,

417
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:38,699
there was an old pregnant woman.

418
00:31:39,507 --> 00:31:41,097
She couldn't give birth to the baby.

419
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:44,273
She held my hand and said,

420
00:31:45,787 --> 00:31:48,257
"Doctor, it's too painful."

421
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,033
"I don't want to do it anymore."

422
00:31:52,503 --> 00:31:53,673
Two minutes later,

423
00:31:55,653 --> 00:31:57,633
she passed away due to
amniotic fluid embolism.

424
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,293
Her husband
while carrying the newborn...

425
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:04,644
burst into loud sobs.

426
00:32:05,903 --> 00:32:10,563
I never knew
a man could cry for so long.

427
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:18,483
That was the first time
I witnessed the death of a patient.

428
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:21,742
Until now, I still vividly remember...

429
00:32:21,783 --> 00:32:23,673
the moment she lied
on the operating table.

430
00:32:24,989 --> 00:32:27,529
I always feel that a hand
is holding me down.

431
00:32:30,493 --> 00:32:32,259
No matter how difficult it is,

432
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,120
she motivates me to run forward.

433
00:32:39,853 --> 00:32:40,733
I'm sorry.

434
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:12,843
Five years ago, I went to Yunnan
for residency training.

435
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:16,433
I received a phone call from home...

436
00:33:16,474 --> 00:33:17,524
informing me that
my grandma was terminally ill.

437
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,733
I applied for leave and rushed home.

438
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:25,055
When I reached home,

439
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:27,444
my grandma was already unable to talk.

440
00:33:28,664 --> 00:33:29,772
However, when she saw me,

441
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:31,843
she got agitated. She cried non-stop.

442
00:33:33,996 --> 00:33:36,216
I don't think I would ever
understand how she felt.

443
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:39,542
I didn't know what to do.

444
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,073
I didn't know what I could do.

445
00:33:42,543 --> 00:33:43,673
I sat at the bedside.

446
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:45,900
I held her hand...

447
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:48,840
and sang her a song.

448
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,050
So, my grandma passed away...

449
00:33:53,303 --> 00:33:55,113
as I sang.

450
00:33:58,567 --> 00:34:01,222
Then, I could feel the warmth of her palm
slowly disappearing.

451
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:02,593
In the end, it turned completely cold.

452
00:34:04,254 --> 00:34:05,504
But at that moment,

453
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:07,473
I was really calm.

454
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:14,493
Yes.

455
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:16,752
Calm.

456
00:34:25,052 --> 00:34:27,083
Why are we talking about this
all of a sudden?

457
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:28,963
You started it first.

458
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:31,381
However,

459
00:34:31,686 --> 00:34:33,315
it's okay to talk about it.

460
00:34:34,263 --> 00:34:37,163
Military officers and doctors
are two occupations...

461
00:34:37,204 --> 00:34:38,394
that are close to death.

462
00:34:39,603 --> 00:34:41,062
We understand death.

463
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:42,963
That's why we cherish the moment.

464
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,464
When we're alive,

465
00:34:46,027 --> 00:34:47,737
we won't miss out on
any wonderful moments.

466
00:34:48,532 --> 00:34:49,412
Am I right?

467
00:34:52,213 --> 00:34:53,353
You are afraid of missing out.

468
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:07,182
Do you want some?

469
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:12,105
Does it go well with Chinese cuisine?

470
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,273
I like it.

471
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,822
We deserve to take a well-earned break.

472
00:35:16,863 --> 00:35:18,193
We can have some liquor.

473
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:22,073
Just a sip.

474
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:37,673
Bourbon Whiskey.

475
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:39,282
It's Matthew's favourite drink.

476
00:35:40,453 --> 00:35:41,333
Who is that?

477
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:44,999
He's a detective
in Lawrence Block's novel.

478
00:35:57,903 --> 00:35:58,953
When I was in high school,

479
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:01,083
a new student joined our class.

480
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:02,793
He sat beside me.

481
00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:04,803
Under his influence,

482
00:36:05,383 --> 00:36:07,003
I started reading detective novels.

483
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:11,523
He said
he wanted to be a detective novelist.

484
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:14,252
However,

485
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:16,520
due to the harsh reality,

486
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:18,520
he didn't realise his dream.

487
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:22,360
He said he wanted to be
a National Defence Student...

488
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:24,191
and contribute to society
by joining the special forces.

489
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:26,654
Back then,

490
00:36:26,695 --> 00:36:28,315
no matter what he said or what he did,

491
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,100
I always thought that he was right.

492
00:36:33,982 --> 00:36:35,558
However, one day,

493
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,209
he disappeared from school.

494
00:36:38,503 --> 00:36:40,043
I couldn't find him anywhere.

495
00:36:40,653 --> 00:36:42,193
I didn't know where to find him.

496
00:36:43,712 --> 00:36:47,113
I couldn't do anything besides reading
the detective novels he got me one by one.

497
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:50,313
Then, I bought more novels from
the book store.

498
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:52,753
I even hoped that...

499
00:36:53,374 --> 00:36:56,504
one day,
in one of the detective novels,

500
00:36:56,697 --> 00:37:00,877
I could see his name, Zhuo Ran.

501
00:37:07,198 --> 00:37:09,908
He is now neither a novelist
nor a military officer.

502
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,122
He set up a 3D printing company.

503
00:37:13,823 --> 00:37:14,923
He's now a business owner.

504
00:37:16,142 --> 00:37:19,563
I have retained a habit of his
in my own life.

505
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:24,920
However, I was already 18
and our high school memories...

506
00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:27,393
were gone for good.

507
00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:32,993
How about you, Liang Mu Ze?

508
00:37:34,093 --> 00:37:37,842
Do you practice someone else's habit?

509
00:37:38,263 --> 00:37:39,143
No.

510
00:37:40,814 --> 00:37:43,574
Your life is so boring.

511
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:47,332
Because of his ambition,

512
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:51,143
you're not interested
in military officers, is that it?

513
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,000
What do you mean?

514
00:37:58,521 --> 00:37:59,501
The other day,

515
00:38:01,302 --> 00:38:02,431
you told him,

516
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:03,972
for a very long time,

517
00:38:05,624 --> 00:38:07,884
you couldn't even stand the phrase,
"special forces soldier,"

518
00:38:08,563 --> 00:38:09,994
let alone seeing one.

519
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:11,615
You eavesdropped on me?

520
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:12,556
No, I didn't.

521
00:38:13,683 --> 00:38:14,783
I can read lips.

522
00:38:15,912 --> 00:38:16,852
Just a bit.

523
00:38:17,535 --> 00:38:19,595
However, I could understand what you said.

524
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:33,484
Cheers.

525
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:55,703
Good morning.

526
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:57,321
Good morning.

527
00:38:57,722 --> 00:38:59,742
Did you stay awake
for the whole night again?

528
00:39:01,443 --> 00:39:02,323
What say you?

529
00:39:03,482 --> 00:39:05,272
You look energetic.

530
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:06,560
You have sharp eyes.

531
00:39:07,976 --> 00:39:09,880
You're not humble at all, Braised Egg.

532
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,290
What?

533
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,821
I'm complimenting your head shape.

534
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:17,125
Thank you for the compliment.

535
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:20,245
What are you looking for?

536
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:23,863
"The Tokyo Zodiac Murders."

537
00:39:24,553 --> 00:39:25,933
You're still reading it?

538
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:28,240
Didn't I tell you the ending?

539
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:31,885
I'll never get sick of reading you.

540
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,640
It feels like spring when I read you.

541
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,000
What are you saying?

542
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,336
I'm talking about the book.

543
00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:54,728
What were you thinking?

544
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:00,405
It was on the shelf.

545
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,280
Where is it?

546
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:06,484
Do you have any plans later?

547
00:40:07,802 --> 00:40:09,141
No, I don't have any plans.

548
00:40:09,182 --> 00:40:11,332
I'm going to chill in the morning
before going to the hospital.

549
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:15,080
Let's take a stroll
at the furniture store.

550
00:40:15,794 --> 00:40:17,774
I want to change some of the furniture.
Give me some suggestions.

551
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:19,880
Sure.

It's so comforting.

568
00:41:44,346 --> 00:41:46,200
Finally it doesn't look like
a sample house.

What are you doing?

590
00:43:02,003 --> 00:43:02,960
Do you want some?

591
00:43:25,443 --> 00:43:27,000

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,670
Nothing.

594
00:43:41,615 --> 00:43:42,760
You can't have it unless you tell me.

595
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:49,112
I suddenly recalled the first time
we had custard steamed bun in the store.

596
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:53,023
I had the urge to squeeze the custard
onto your face.

597
00:43:58,074 --> 00:43:59,494
It's never crossed my mind.

598
00:44:00,334 --> 00:44:01,200
Here.

599
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:04,441
Liang Mu Ze, that's inhumane!

600
00:44:04,482 --> 00:44:05,450
Don't move!

601
00:44:05,491 --> 00:44:06,401
Go back!

602
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,220
I didn't see anything.

603
00:44:41,288 --> 00:44:42,308
The memory has been deleted.

604
00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:44,600
I'll go get changed. Clean up the mess.

605
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,740
By the way,
don't forget to clean the litter.

606
00:44:47,961 --> 00:44:48,861
Why?

607
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:54,680
Fine, I'll do it.
