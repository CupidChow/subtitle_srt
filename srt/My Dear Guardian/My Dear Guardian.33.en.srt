2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,120
=Episode 33=

3
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:37,359
How long do we have to wait?

4
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:40,549
Is it that hard to find
the building's information?

5
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,480
This structure was built by
the Chinese government.

6
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:46,839
It's for helping people
who are poor and have no money,

7
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,419
and then after a few years,

8
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,319
all files and all investments,

9
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,689
international investments are pulled,

10
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,440
and then this structure is frozen.

11
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,500
How about now?

12
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:06,265
Now, we need to find people
who know about this situation...

13
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:09,426
and try to help us make this great plan.

14
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,630
My father will be dead
before you finish planning!

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,320
Calm down! Calm down!

16
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:20,778
Hello.

17
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:22,471
What is it?

18
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,320
Okay, okay.

19
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:26,030
Now, we have good news.

20
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:27,861
In 10 minutes,

21
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:30,200
Officer Chen from the Chinese
government will be coming,

22
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:32,491
and he has what we need.

23
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,519
Have a seat.

24
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:40,711
It's hard to get these blueprints.

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,360
It's a young officer named Liang Mu Ze,

26
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:46,511
who accidentally found
that the Corps of Engineers of his unit...

27
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:48,602
was involved in
the construction of this structure...

28
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:50,603
when they came to Isaia for a
peace operation a few years ago.

29
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:53,981
He insisted on digging out the information
about the structure's construction...

30
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:56,582
of the Corps of Engineer
from the mountain of papers.

31
00:02:56,888 --> 00:02:58,168
But the blueprints were incomplete.

32
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:00,204
So...

33
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:03,164
He spent time and found an
old soldier who's soon retired.

34
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:06,440
The soldier experienced
the reconstruction back then.

35
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:10,320
He helped Liang Mu Ze to
redraw the missing parts of the map.

36
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,320
He didn't tell you about this in
advance because he was afraid that...

37
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:22,560
you'd be disappointed
if no result was found.

38
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:26,040
He could've passed you
these blueprints by himself,

39
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:28,951
but it'll gain more
attention from the police...

40
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:31,000
of Isaia if it's submitted by me.

41
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:33,968
Thanks.

42
00:03:34,326 --> 00:03:35,206
Thank you.

43
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:38,591
The embassy has been closely
following the developments.

44
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:41,750
We'll try our best to
push them to act fast...

45
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,271
and rescue your father
as well as solve the case.

46
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:46,173
You need to learn patience too,

47
00:03:46,782 --> 00:03:47,760
do not panic.

48
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:50,565
Okay.

49
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,320
Where are you taking me?

50
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,070
Professor!

51
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:22,294
Old master, we're in trouble.

52
00:05:32,108 --> 00:05:33,040
Xia Chu.

53
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:34,271
Liang Mu Ze.

54
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,440
Are you all right? What's the matter?

55
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:41,640
Mahadi told me that
my father has been rescued!

56
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,681
Thank you.

57
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:47,911
Thanks for everything
you've done for us.

58
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,791
Then when are you going to come back?

59
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:55,497
After taking care of Tang Lin's funeral.

60
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:57,443
Who is Tang Lin?

61
00:05:58,182 --> 00:05:59,320
He is my father's assistant...

62
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:01,760
and it was him who
lured my father to Isaia.

63
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,960
At last,

64
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,871
he took the bullet for my father.

65
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:08,480
He's gone.

66
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:09,467
Is uncle all right?

67
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:10,503
He's fine.

68
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,702
He's currently cooperating with
the local police investigations.

69
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:14,063
I can see him tomorrow.

70
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:15,911
Okay, then.

71
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:18,240
Get some rest today.

72
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:20,280
We'll talk about it when you get back.

73
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:26,594
Goodnight, Braised Egg.

74
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:28,800
I'm going to hang up.

75
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:16,840
(Relationship status report)

76
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,520
I thought I would never see you again.

77
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:05,339
Are you all right?

78
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:07,266
Dad, are you hurt?

79
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:08,818
Are you all right?

80
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:11,947
That's great.

81
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:19,800
Thank you for saving me.

82
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,087
You're welcome, my old friend.

83
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:27,381
You need to thank your daughter.

84
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:28,920
She has found a good son.

85
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:31,840
Mahadi.

86
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,560
What did he say?

87
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:35,481
Nothing.

88
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,920
Liang, good!

89
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:46,040
I didn't say anything.

90
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:53,840
Thank you, old comrade.

91
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,151
I'll celebrate your return
when you're back.

92
00:08:56,384 --> 00:08:57,344
That's the deal.

93
00:08:58,075 --> 00:08:58,955
Okay, goodbye.

94
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:02,160
Are they back?

95
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:03,044
Yes.

96
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,200
They arrived at noon.

97
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:06,175
Now, she's taking her father
to the hospital for a checkup.

98
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:09,480
You two sure do keep in touch.

99
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:11,861
Brigade Commander,

100
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:17,576
this is my relationship report.

101
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,280
-Have you come around?
-Yes.

102
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:26,920
Redeployment is a problem
but it's hard to meet the right person.

103
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:28,200
I don't want to miss her.

104
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:32,381
But Xia Chu's father is
the major problem now,

105
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:34,431
not your redeployment.

106
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:37,040
Isaia police have found out that
her father was being framed.

107
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,961
But the matter of him leaking information
has yet to be determined.

108
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:43,058
Leaking information?

109
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:47,440
He used his personal mailbox
to discuss work with his assistant,

110
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:49,280
causing the leakage of information.

111
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:52,335
Now the Institute of Chemistry
has initiated the investigation.

112
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:54,591
There was no final outcome...

113
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:56,991
before he went to Isaia.

114
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:03,873
What are you trying to say?

115
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:11,855
Okay.

116
00:10:12,788 --> 00:10:13,668
Okay.

117
00:10:13,985 --> 00:10:15,865
Stop pretending with me.

118
00:10:16,473 --> 00:10:18,793
I know you must be
feeling bad now.

119
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,008
I was your age once.

120
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:25,240
I can see you're currently
very confused about this.

121
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:26,775
You're mostly thinking...

122
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:29,078
that you, as a soldier,

123
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,497
can't protect the one you love,

124
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:33,661
can't give her a decent family,

125
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:37,656
can't show up when
she needs you the most.

126
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,879
You must be very torn,

127
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,840
and very wrong.

128
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:42,726
Report!

129
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:44,600
Haven't you had
this kind of feeling before?

130
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:46,432
Liang Mu Ze,

131
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:49,181
the words that I'm about to say,

132
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:51,854
I'm saying them as a brother...

133
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:56,631
and an old soldier instead of
as a Brigade Commander.

134
00:10:58,184 --> 00:10:59,064
Let me tell you,

135
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:01,042
you and I...

136
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:03,400
are professional soldiers.

137
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:06,047
Since we choose to put this uniform on,

138
00:11:06,694 --> 00:11:09,520
we have to shoulder
the responsibility as soldiers.

139
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,880
Everything is non-negotiable
in front of the national interest.

140
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:18,582
What is professional to a soldier?

141
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:20,480
This is professional.

142
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:22,804
I understand.

143
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:23,960
If there's nothing else,

144
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:25,591
I'll head back first.

145
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,790
Come back here.

146
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,455
You're being surly.

147
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:35,692
I know
you still have a knot in your heart.

148
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:37,016
How about this?

149
00:11:38,183 --> 00:11:39,440
I'll allow you to take a half day off.

150
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:40,671
Just go to the hospital.

151
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,040
And...

152
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,385
submit your relationship status report
to the Special Branch for approval.

153
00:11:44,982 --> 00:11:46,302
Adjust your form and...

154
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,711
report to me!

155
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:49,640
Thank you, Brigade Commander!

156
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:54,960
This brat!

157
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:01,600
Stay for a few more days.

158
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:04,667
At least wait until we obtain
the result of the medical checkup.

159
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,360
You're lying.
You didn't want me to stay here.

160
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:09,271
How am I lying?

161
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,201
I have to hurry back.

162
00:12:11,242 --> 00:12:14,280
Your mother must've missed me
since I've left home for days.

163
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:16,759
I already called Ms. Lan.

164
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,181
She said just take your time.

165
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:23,175
Girl, I can't stay.

166
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:25,487
I miss your mother too.

167
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:28,741
Someone fainted!

168
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:33,316
Step aside! Step aside!

169
00:12:33,357 --> 00:12:34,597
Don't touch her!

170
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,123
Go get the transfer bed.

171
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:16,621
Uncle Xia,

172
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:19,720
have you finished the medical checkup?

173
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:24,096
Yes, I have.

174
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,559
I'm here for Xia Chu.

175
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:27,949
She...

176
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:29,501
is rescuing the patient.

177
00:13:35,822 --> 00:13:37,772
I've called a cab.

178
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:39,271
It'll be here soon.

179
00:13:39,697 --> 00:13:40,577
I'm leaving.

180
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,830
Where are you going?

181
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:43,974
To home.

182
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:45,607
I'm going back to Dong'an.

183
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:49,680
Let me send you off.

184
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:53,231
No need for that.

185
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:14,201
I heard from them that...

186
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,591
you played a big part in solving
the matter of Isaia.

187
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:20,400
I was saved, thanks to you.

188
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:21,791
Thank you.

189
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:22,917
Uncle Xia,

190
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:24,431
you're welcome.

191
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:27,511
But don't you think that
I'll let Xia Chu be with you...

192
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:30,341
just because you helped me.

193
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:32,920
Uncle Xia,

194
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:34,281
case by case,

195
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:36,911
I'll help you whether you approve or not.

196
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,487
Even if you don't approve,

197
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:39,408
I'll help you too.

198
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:43,440
But Xia Chu and I will be together...

199
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,511
no matter what.

200
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,720
Xia Chu.

201
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:13,784
Have you seen my father?

202
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:15,440
I've seen him, he just left.

203
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,350
Wait for me.

204
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:25,951
Dad!

205
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:30,480
Didn't I tell you to wait for me?

206
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:33,520
Liang Mu Ze is here.

207
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:34,911
So what?

208
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:36,768
Are you afraid of meeting him?

209
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:40,038
A bit.

210
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:43,194
Perhaps it's the legacy
of the first meeting...

211
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,031
with your grandfather back then.

212
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:48,231
I flinched when I saw someone
in a military uniform.

213
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:50,600
I doubt it.

214
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,279
Grandpa is such a kind man.

215
00:15:54,397 --> 00:15:55,917
That's because you're his granddaughter.

216
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:58,157
He is always rough on me.

217
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:01,351
He always thinks that
your mother loses out in marrying me.

218
00:16:02,422 --> 00:16:06,711
You still remember how Grandpa opposed
your marriage with Ms. Lan back then?

219
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:07,742
Of course.

220
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:09,630
He always wanted to
find your mother someone...

221
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:10,711
who's a soldier like him.

222
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,677
And he always persuaded
your mother to leave me.

223
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:14,951
He said that to my face several times.

224
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:17,480
Can I forget such hurtful words?

225
00:16:18,784 --> 00:16:20,160
So...

226
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:21,881
Don't be like my grandfather.

227
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,520
Don't be rough on Liang Mu Ze and
persuade him to break up with me.

228
00:16:26,054 --> 00:16:27,791
He'll remember you
for the rest of his life,

229
00:16:27,832 --> 00:16:29,285
if we become man and wife in the future.

230
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:32,200
Don't you think it'd be awkward?

231
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,756
Don't vent your anger on Liang Mu Ze...

232
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,757
just because my grandfather
was hard on you.

233
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:42,440
I didn't vent my anger.

234
00:16:52,423 --> 00:16:54,183
I just think that
my daughter is too excellent.

235
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:57,560
No one around you deserves to have you.

236
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,640
Your grandfather might think that
too back then.

237
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:07,520
But I really like him,

238
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:10,344
I want to be with him.

239
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,799
The cab is here, I'm leaving.

240
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:25,734
Girl,

241
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,431
no parents in this world
could ever win their kids.

242
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:34,766
Your grandfather can't,

243
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:37,351
neither can I.

244
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,631
Dad, I love you!

245
00:17:52,436 --> 00:17:53,680
She is my daughter.

246
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,671
I can see that.

247
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:57,471
She's like you.

248
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:06,200
She is a doctor from Hospital 109.

249
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:08,352
She is a heart surgeon.

250
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,800
She is glowing...

251
00:18:14,204 --> 00:18:15,814
like an angel...

252
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,640
when she's rescuing the patients.

253
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:32,534
My daughter...

254
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,640
has grown up.

255
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,160
I handed in the relationship report.

256
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:58,360
But Dong said it can't be
approved at the moment.

257
00:19:01,048 --> 00:19:02,360
Is it because of my father?

258
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:04,336
Yes.

259
00:19:05,136 --> 00:19:07,416
The decision can only be made
after the result of...

260
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:09,381
the investigation is obtained.

261
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:23,640
I thought it was a big deal.

262
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:25,241
We just have to wait.

263
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:27,951
We'll get the result no matter
how long it takes.

264
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:31,000
And I believe that
my father will be fine.

265
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:34,880
But I don't wish to wait any longer.

266
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:36,360
I'm soon to be redeployed.

267
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,111
I want to tell everyone
that Xia Chu is my girlfriend.

268
00:19:46,488 --> 00:19:47,888
Don't be afraid, Braised Egg.

269
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:51,295
We pulled through when we were
in such a difficult situation in Isaia.

270
00:19:51,336 --> 00:19:53,320
Now, we just have to wait a little bit.

271
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:56,400
And I have a feeling that...

272
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,711
we'll have a happy life in the future.

273
00:20:00,168 --> 00:20:01,280
You need to have faith.

274
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:07,440
I have faith!

275
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:08,360
Liang Mu Ze!

276
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:09,881
Xia Chu must be my girlfriend.

277
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:11,208
I love her!

00:21:19,343 --> 00:21:21,390
Send them back for us via air
transportation when you're free, okay?

287
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:22,279
Okay.

288
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,880
I'll send you the address later.

289
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:26,141
Xue,

290
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:27,696
can you put on your shoes?

291
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:41,266
Stop playing with your phone.

292
00:21:41,307 --> 00:21:42,880
We still have to catch the plane.

293
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Honey!

294
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:51,920
Stop playing with your phone!

295
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:53,640
We still have to catch the plane!

296
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:55,246
Is it you?

297
00:21:58,248 --> 00:21:59,440
Go back by yourself.

298
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:01,600
What?

299
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:05,040
Go back by yourself.

300
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,320
Impossible!

301
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:07,713
Mom!

302
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:11,021
I let you come back as you said so!

303
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:12,081
How long has it been?

304
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:13,551
Look what you've been!

305
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:14,501
And you even want to stay?

306
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,721
Do you have a death wish?

307
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:17,528
This is an accident!

308
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:18,449
Accident?

309
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:21,800
Very well,

310
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:22,721
just stay here.

311
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,080
I don't care!

312
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,561
Aunt!

313
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:33,320
Seriously?

314
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,360
I didn't want to yell at her.

315
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:52,912
That wasn't yelling.

316
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,751
I wonder who she got
her stubbornness from.

317
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:01,440
Like father, like daughter.

318
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:02,361
Whom else could she like?

319
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:10,647
Xue's injury is still recovering.

320
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:12,791
It's good to let her
stay here for a while.

321
00:23:13,064 --> 00:23:14,720
Don't worry, I'll look after her.

322
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:16,776
Is he doing well?

323
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:18,117
It's just her temper.

324
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:19,400
She'll forget it soon.

325
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,990
No.

326
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:22,041
I'm not asking about Xue.

327
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:22,961
I'm asking about...

328
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:25,079
He's doing fine.

329
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,270
Same as always.

330
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:29,151
Right, same as always.

331
00:23:30,487 --> 00:23:31,367
Same as always.

332
00:23:33,383 --> 00:23:35,040
He didn't even show up when his

333
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:37,480
daughter was in such big trouble.

334
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:39,629
He's on mission, he has no choice.

335
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,139
Right.

336
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,320
He's an excellent...

337
00:23:43,357 --> 00:23:44,920
police officer.

338
00:23:45,622 --> 00:23:48,671
But we both fail as parents.

339
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,350
Aunt,

340
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:53,400
go in and take a look.

341
00:23:53,441 --> 00:23:54,431
I got to sign some paperwork.

342
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,360
Is it because of Tian Yong?

343
00:24:28,616 --> 00:24:29,896
Liang Mu Ze told you that?

344
00:24:30,113 --> 00:24:32,113
You'd been calling him
when you were comatose.

345
00:24:38,473 --> 00:24:39,633
What is he like?

346
00:24:40,016 --> 00:24:40,936
Are you willing to tell me?

347
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:44,479
He's a soldier.

348
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:47,888
My brother's lieutenant.

349
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,600
A comrade he knows well.

350
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:50,951
He's not right for you.

351
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:54,016
Why do you all say that?

352
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:56,303
I don't know what others say.

353
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:59,927
But my experience taught me
that a soldier is entirely

354
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:00,888
unsuited to you.

355
00:25:01,385 --> 00:25:03,276
But you said it's your experience.

356
00:25:03,316 --> 00:25:05,116
Shouldn't I make my choice?

357
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:06,360
Your choice?

358
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:07,281
Yes!

359
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:18,671
Xue,

360
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:24,368
do you know what the future is like...

361
00:25:25,888 --> 00:25:27,560
if you're with that kind of man?

362
00:25:27,957 --> 00:25:29,700
He is not that kind of man.

363
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:30,711
He is Tian Yong.

364
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,871
Well, I might think it's fun
at the beginning.

365
00:25:35,713 --> 00:25:36,913
I just want to conquer him.

366
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:38,976
Maybe any man will do.

367
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:40,569
All he has to say is,

368
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:43,287
Xue, you look good,

369
00:25:43,616 --> 00:25:44,653
you're cute and pretty,

370
00:25:44,694 --> 00:25:45,654
you're not sick.

371
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:47,185
And I'd be happy.

372
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:52,160
But I found that
Tian Yong isn't that kind of person.

373
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,360
Guess what.

374
00:25:53,574 --> 00:25:57,551
I bit the back of his hand
when I first met him.

375
00:25:58,103 --> 00:25:59,263
The trace was very deep.

376
00:25:59,712 --> 00:26:02,311
But he told my brother
that he's fine.

377
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:04,605
As for this parrot,

378
00:26:05,344 --> 00:26:06,744
I've been treating it as my brother.

379
00:26:07,008 --> 00:26:08,608
Everyone thinks I'm a fool...

380
00:26:10,078 --> 00:26:11,598
but Tian Yong asked...

381
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,871
if I'd feel lonely,

382
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:16,160
if I lost this parrot.

383
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:20,271
He even told me that
this world would be boring...

384
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,751
if only the birds with nice voices
were allowed to tweet.

385
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,600
The most important thing is...

386
00:26:28,368 --> 00:26:30,048
he's willing to hug me...

387
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,120
after knowing my past.

388
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,501
He's multiple times better than
those jerks who bad-mouth me...

389
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:40,680
after kissing me.

390
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,487
This is Tian Yong.

391
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:47,799
You know what?

392
00:26:48,248 --> 00:26:50,568
He never tried to sweet-talk me.

393
00:26:52,008 --> 00:26:55,640
I didn't even understand
what he said.

394
00:26:58,351 --> 00:26:59,711
But he told me that...

395
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:04,120
one could live a wonderful life
in this world even if one's imperfect.

396
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:07,341
I don't have to care about
how they think of me.

397
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:10,861
I just have to live my life
the way I want it to be.

398
00:27:11,471 --> 00:27:15,031
You and Dad never taught me this.

399
00:27:17,231 --> 00:27:18,231
Only he...

400
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,087
can reassure me.

401
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:38,258
Mom,

402
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,753
I know you'll feel sad...

403
00:27:42,606 --> 00:27:44,416
as I said these.

404
00:27:46,728 --> 00:27:48,808
But these are my true thoughts.

405
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,760
I...

406
00:28:04,407 --> 00:28:05,567
Met your father...

407
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:08,335
at age 21,

408
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:10,805
got married at age 23,

409
00:28:10,846 --> 00:28:13,326
I had you at age 25,

410
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,335
I divorced him at age 40...

411
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:18,936
and took you to the United States.

412
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,480
This is your failed marriage.

413
00:28:23,153 --> 00:28:25,073
I once strongly believed that...

414
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:30,591
I could grow old with him.

415
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:33,551
But...

416
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:37,719
between family and his job
as a police officer,

417
00:28:38,707 --> 00:28:40,081
he chose the latter.

418
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:41,242
This is not Dad's fault.

419
00:28:41,496 --> 00:28:42,520
It's my fault.

420
00:28:43,577 --> 00:28:45,760
You guys separated because
of my incident.

421
00:28:46,952 --> 00:28:47,920
Shut up.

422
00:28:48,823 --> 00:28:50,440
You don't get it.

423
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:51,871
You don't understand what I said.

424
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,560
Then do you get what I mean?

425
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,970
You've been avoiding this matter,

426
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:57,971
just like you protected me.

427
00:28:58,631 --> 00:29:02,951
You organized my life
and wanted me to follow your path.

428
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,360
Have you ever thought about me?

429
00:29:07,555 --> 00:29:10,351
It's like I can only live in
the year when the incident happened,

430
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,400
I can never be freed.

431
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:13,321
I...

432
00:29:15,032 --> 00:29:15,992
I thought...

433
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:20,200
I thought you hate...

434
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:22,351
to see me cry.

435
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,471
Mom,

436
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:28,920
I hate to see you pretend
to be happy even more.

437
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:50,169
Do you still love Dad?

438
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:13,600
Send me a message when you've arrived.

439
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:18,952
I love you, Mom.

440
00:30:35,032 --> 00:30:37,772
I'll meet your parents
when I switch flights in Beijing.

441
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:41,480
Do you have anything
to give them or tell them?

442
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:42,621
Nothing,

443
00:30:42,662 --> 00:30:43,702
just tell them I'm doing fine.

444
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:45,551
Okay.

445
00:30:58,165 --> 00:30:59,415
Have a safe journey, aunt.

446
00:31:15,711 --> 00:31:16,611
Have you made up your mind?

447
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,920
It's not too late to turn.

448
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:23,671
I want to wait for Tian Yong here.

449
00:31:23,712 --> 00:31:25,350
Then you need to
follow me back to the unit...

450
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:26,711
and you're not allowed to leave.

451
00:31:26,904 --> 00:31:28,584
Report to me in advance
if there's anything.

452
00:31:28,936 --> 00:31:31,631
Someone is going to follow you around
until it's all clear.

453
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:32,904
Is that all right?

454
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,359
Why?

455
00:31:34,712 --> 00:31:36,800
This is the discussion from all sectors...

456
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:38,840
to ensure the safety
of yours and Tian Yong...

457
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:40,161
and help in their operations.

458
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,462
You were thrown into the ocean by him,

459
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:43,687
you were dead,

460
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:44,608
understood?

461
00:31:57,191 --> 00:31:58,360
How long do we need to stay here?

462
00:32:00,075 --> 00:32:01,000
I don't know.

463
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:08,951
What are we waiting for?

464
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:10,832
Waiting for news.

465
00:32:11,511 --> 00:32:13,631
You'll see the man you want to see
when we get the news.

466
00:32:15,591 --> 00:32:16,831
So...

467
00:32:17,648 --> 00:32:18,880
This is your...

468
00:32:21,888 --> 00:32:22,848
transit station.

469
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:25,209
It's one of them.

470
00:32:28,007 --> 00:32:29,007
When can we get the news?

471
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:30,847
I don't know.

472
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:35,040
They will inform me.

473
00:32:36,111 --> 00:32:40,231
So that means
his ranking is higher than yours.

474
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,591
We have different roles.

475
00:32:43,407 --> 00:32:44,647
Then why do I think you are...

476
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:48,439
always in the forefront
while he commands at the back?

477
00:32:50,825 --> 00:32:52,120
You two are partners.

478
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:54,649
He is not your boss.

479
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:56,496
If I were you,

480
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,968
I wouldn't like his style.

481
00:33:06,911 --> 00:33:07,951
I'm going to the washroom.

482
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:29,248
Remember to take your medication.

483
00:33:29,951 --> 00:33:31,911
Immediately tell me
if you don't feel well.

484
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,544
And take good care of your friend.

485
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:35,984
I got it.

486
00:33:36,271 --> 00:33:37,581

Brigade Commander,

515
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:49,801
why are you up so late?

516
00:36:50,445 --> 00:36:51,325
Nothing.

517
00:36:52,991 --> 00:36:54,271
I'm just thinking,

518
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:57,119
there was no Xiao Xiao yet
when I participated...

519
00:36:57,911 --> 00:36:59,071
in the tree planting here back then.

520
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:02,871
Years have gone in a flash,

521
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:04,471
my daughter has grown up,

522
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:06,192
the tree has grown tall too.

523
00:37:12,018 --> 00:37:14,840
What did Sister-in-law say
about the redeployment?

524
00:37:15,206 --> 00:37:16,286
What can she say?

525
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:18,041
This is not the first time.

526
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:19,951
Your sister-in-law...

527
00:37:21,861 --> 00:37:22,741
is a strong person.

528
00:37:22,926 --> 00:37:26,440
She had been running around with me
since she was young.

529
00:37:27,448 --> 00:37:29,088
She never made complaints.

530
00:37:30,689 --> 00:37:32,360
She cringed as she knew I'm

531
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:33,281
going to leave.

532
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,568
It's not a problem to relocate.

533
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:37,271
The only problem is...

534
00:37:38,017 --> 00:37:41,591
Xiao Xiao doesn't want to
leave her classmates and friends.

535
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:43,880
She has been losing her temper.

536
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:46,440
If your sister-in-law hadn't come up...

537
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:48,911
with so many ways
to cheer her up,

538
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:52,831
I wouldn't know what to do
with this girl's ideological work.

539
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:56,496
It's a complete waste...

540
00:37:57,511 --> 00:38:00,031
of such a nice woman to marry me.

541
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:02,271
Brigade Commander.

542
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,590
Well, stop talking about me.

543
00:38:04,631 --> 00:38:05,511
Let's talk about you.

544
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:07,791
Have you set everything up for Xue?

545
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:08,831
Yes.

546
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:10,829
The superiors have given the orders.

547
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:14,239
The defense unit
will send someone to take care of Xue.

548
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:18,351
Moreover, the families left behind
will come over to help too.

549
00:38:19,016 --> 00:38:22,351
So you don't have to worry about
her living and safety.

550
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,056
I know.

551
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:26,471
Why?

552
00:38:27,062 --> 00:38:28,062
Any other concerns?

553
00:38:31,616 --> 00:38:32,496
Brigade Commander,

554
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,200
can you inform Tian Yong
to return and see Xue?

555
00:38:38,031 --> 00:38:38,951
What do you say?

556
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,911
I have no idea where Tian Yong is.

557
00:38:43,328 --> 00:38:44,406
Right now,

558
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,047
this isn't what we should worry about.

559
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:48,080
After redeployment,

560
00:38:48,121 --> 00:38:49,855
joint military exercise
will be conducted right away.

561
00:38:50,391 --> 00:38:51,271
By then,

562
00:38:52,024 --> 00:38:53,491
the representatives of
the foreign militaries...

563
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:55,840
have to attend it
except the captain of the war zone.

564
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:56,881
Be well-prepared...

565
00:38:59,022 --> 00:39:00,062
and do your best.

566
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:01,191
Yes.

567
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:04,711
As soldiers,

568
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,271
we can't choose the region
and era we're in.

569
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,800
The only thing we can choose

570
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,520
is loyalty to our era.

Xia Chu, here's your parcel.

604
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,350
Thank you.

605
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:21,293
I'll protect you for Mu Ze.

606
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,000
I received the figure.

607
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,440
Is it handsome?

608
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:01,985
Not as handsome as you.

609
00:44:06,808 --> 00:44:07,798
Of course.

610
00:44:25,032 --> 00:44:26,280
How's the new outpost?

611
00:44:49,866 --> 00:44:51,346
Boss, are you there?

612
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,543
I want to customize a figure.

613
00:45:44,473 --> 00:45:45,353
Goodbye, fellow students.

614
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:48,311
Goodbye, teacher!

615
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,000
Xia Chu?

616
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:56,399
You're here.

617
00:45:58,471 --> 00:45:59,351
Where is Xiao Xiao?

618
00:46:00,552 --> 00:46:02,272
Two patients came to
the emergency department abruptly.

619
00:46:02,313 --> 00:46:03,993
I think she couldn't
get away at the moment.

620
00:46:04,034 --> 00:46:05,194
So I come here by myself.

621
00:46:08,806 --> 00:46:10,446
This is the honey from her.

622
00:46:10,614 --> 00:46:13,141
Her father
bought this from the beekeeper.

623
00:46:13,182 --> 00:46:14,062
It's all-natural.

624
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:15,783
That's great.

625
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:16,744
Thank her for me.

626
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:20,720
These are our thesis.

627
00:46:20,761 --> 00:46:21,891
We had amended two drafts.

628
00:46:22,168 --> 00:46:23,800
Okay.
Let me read them.

629
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:29,351
Are you still in touch with Ms. Meng Zhen?

630
00:46:31,326 --> 00:46:32,526
I've been busy lately.

631
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:35,329
I have many works in school.

632
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:37,664
A little while ago,

633
00:46:38,104 --> 00:46:40,000
she took Xiao Jun to our
hospital for medical checkup...

634
00:46:41,205 --> 00:46:42,885
and said she's going to Beijing.

635
00:46:43,664 --> 00:46:44,544
Really?

636
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:47,111
By the way,

637
00:46:47,756 --> 00:46:48,636
how is it?

638
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:49,879
How does it feel to be back...

639
00:46:51,323 --> 00:46:52,280
at the Cardiac Surgery Department?

640
00:46:54,094 --> 00:46:58,231
I'm not used to stitch the patient up
during operation at first.

641
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,400
Never mind.

642
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:01,630
You'll get used to it.

643
00:47:02,031 --> 00:47:02,911
You're like me.

644
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:05,120
I'm currently adapting to the life...

645
00:47:05,695 --> 00:47:07,280
which I don't have to stitch patients up.

646
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,270
Everything will be fine.

647
00:47:15,255 --> 00:47:16,922
I'm preparing to sign up
for the military exercise.

648
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,040
Is Liang Mu Ze going?

649
00:47:20,873 --> 00:47:21,753
I don't know.

650
00:47:22,616 --> 00:47:23,880
I think he'll go.

651
00:47:24,431 --> 00:47:25,311
I can feel it.

652
00:47:26,048 --> 00:47:26,928
Sir,

653
00:47:27,495 --> 00:47:28,375
thank you.

654
00:47:29,197 --> 00:47:31,160
About me returning to
the Cardiac Surgery Department,

655
00:47:31,201 --> 00:47:34,525
things wouldn't be this smooth
if you hadn't talked to the chief.

656
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,640
Don't say that.

657
00:47:36,865 --> 00:47:37,745
I think...

658
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:40,200
you deserve this.

659
00:47:41,101 --> 00:47:41,981
It's true.

660
00:47:46,088 --> 00:47:49,311
If you really want to thank me,
how about this?

661
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:51,551
Clean the blackboard.

662
00:47:52,993 --> 00:47:53,873
No problem.

663
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,840
Sir,

664
00:48:23,057 --> 00:48:24,017
I'll keep that in mind.
