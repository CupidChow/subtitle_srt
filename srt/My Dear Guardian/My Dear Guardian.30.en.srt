=Episode 30=

3
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,560
Do you practice like this often?

4
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,440
Of course. It's my daily routine.

5
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,930
From the day I was kicked out
of the operating room,

6
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,400
by my supervisor for shoddy suturing.

7
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,040
Every day.

8
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,060
(Mr. Xia)

9
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,820
(Mr. Xia)

10
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,090
Dad.

11
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,920
I just saw the news.

12
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,840
Something bad happened
to a doctor in your department.

13
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,570
How are you?

14
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,560
I'm fine.

15
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,520
Are you really fine
or are you just pretending?

16
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,560
Don't keep the bad news to yourself.

17
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,536
I'm fine, really.

18
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,770
That's good to hear.

19
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,680
Are you off work?

20
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,760
Send me Liang Mu Ze's home address.

21
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,320
What are you going to do?

22
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,210
I'll wait for you there.

23
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,200
Pack up your stuff and bring them out.

24
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,640
You're coming back to Dong'an with me.

25
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,136
No way.

26
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,520
Why not?

27
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,570
Whatever I say goes.

28
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,880
Listen, if you don't resign
and come back with me,

29
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,800
I'll visit your workplace every day.

30
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,976
And call your superior every day.

31
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,495
How can you do that?
You're being militant.

32
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,256
I'm an adult.

33
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,730
Even if you're 80 years old,
you're still my little girl.

34
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,976
I can't stand by and watch you
jump into the fire.

35
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,280
Look here missy,

36
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,200
you'd better listen to me.

37
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,329
This is for your own good.

38
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,456
Did you hear what I said?

39
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,216
Can you give me some time?

40
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,600
I promise I'll straighten things out
at work.

41
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,280
-Xia Chu.
-Please, can you stop pressuring me?

42
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,160
Xia Chu.

43
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,370
Aren't you supposed to be sending
Meng Zhen home?

44
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,690
I did.

45
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,010
I'm here to fetch you.

46
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,280
How did you know I was still
at the hospital?

47
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,800
Call it a hunch.

48
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,520
Let's go home.

49
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,976
Are you going back to the camp?

50
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes.

51
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,680
Do you know when you'll be redeployed?

52
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,810
Soon.

53
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,320
You should get inside.

54
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,720
Is something wrong?

55
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,200
I'm thinking of...

56
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,200
transferring back to Dong'an.

57
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,930
Have you made up your mind?

58
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,640
Today was so tiring.

59
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,320
Not just physically,

60
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,080
but emotionally, too.

61
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,456
Dr. Zhang is such a brilliant surgeon.

62
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,000
But from now on,

63
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,600
he'll never step into another
operating theatre again.

64
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,090
He gave us a hell of a pep talk today.

65
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,730
But still, I feel awful.

66
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,280
For a moment, I felt...

67
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,120
what's so great about being a doctor?

68
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,090
Compared to spending time
with our parents,

69
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,720
wearing a white coat
or a set of fatigues...

70
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,920
means very little.

71
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,240
If that's how you feel,

72
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,360
then go for it.

73
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,960
But if you don't truly believe in it,

74
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,416
you shouldn't let anyone
influence your life decisions.

75
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,840
I really mean it.

76
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:30,540
Really.

77
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,150
Very well.

78
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,800
This is so conservative.

79
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,170
It doesn't look feminine at all.

80
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,050
I'm not going to wear this.

81
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,960
Sister-in-law, you're back.

82
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,736
I bought a bunch of stick-on
tattoos online.

83
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,696
They're super realistic.

84
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,696
No bad guys will come near us now.

85
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,120
Let me tell you...

86
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,416
I'll show my brother
I can protect myself just fine,

87
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,080
and he shouldn't be paranoid.

88
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,786
Going on a business trip?

89
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,320
No. I'm moving out.

90
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,679
Moving out?

91
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,520
(Xia Chu is moving out.
Come back, pronto.)

92
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,816
Stop. Don't go.

93
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,416
-Don't go.
-Xiao Xue, calm down.

94
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,376
Mu Ze, she's going away!

95
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,696
She's going away!

96
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:48,317
Put the boxes back.

97
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,456
Liang Mu Ze, those are my boxes.

98
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,600
Those are my luggage, Liang Mu Ze.

99
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,800
Let go of me, Liang Mu Ze.

100
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,240
You're sick of white coats
and fatigues?

101
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:03,216
That's right.

102
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,370
Liar.

103
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,850
If you really are,
you wouldn't have given me that drivel.

104
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,640
You weren't sure
because this isn't what you want.

105
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,056
You said those words
are not for me, but for yourself.

106
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,450
You were trying to convince yourself.

107
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,496
You decided to transfer and move back
for no reason,

108
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,560
other than your father coerced you
over the phone.

109
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,080
You're avoiding the issue.

110
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,060
Xia Chu,

111
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,040
some things in life,

112
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,440
you just have to face
no matter how much it hurts.

113
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,080
This is such a thing.
There's no use running away.

114
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,440
You can avoid the issue now,
but what about the future?

115
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,096
You'll regret it, you know that?

116
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,496
I don't think so. How dare you
accuse me of running away?

117
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,176
I'm not trying to run away.
Quitting my job is my idea.

118
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,616
It's what I want.

119
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,216
It's how I honestly feel right now.
I'm an adult.

120
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,706
I know what I'm doing.
You don't have to lecture me.

121
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,256
I hate the way you label people
as if you know better.

122
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,080
Who are you to me?
Do you have the right to control me?

123
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,736
Who am I to you?

124
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,016
Who am I to you?

125
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,450
You're nobody to me!

126
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,656
Go back to your camp.

127
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,960
I don't want to see you again.

128
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,240
Let go!

129
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,960
Let go, Liang Mu Ze.

130
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,890
Let go!

131
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,976
Let go of me.

132
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,416
I can't take it anymore!

133
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,080
Break it up, you two!

134
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,096
Listen to yourselves.

135
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,536
It's like an idol drama.

136
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,146
Liang Mu Ze, what are you babbling on for?

137
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,096
Just say, "Xia Chu, please don't go."

138
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,096
"I love you."

139
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,626
"I was a lazy bum who wouldn't touch
a broom yet I learned to bake for you."

140
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,810
"Do you know why?
Because I love you!"

141
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,416
And you, Sister-in-law.

142
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,136
How can you be so oblivious?

143
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,000
Don't you love him, too?

144
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,696
It was in this very living room,

145
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,016
that Liang Mu Ze kissed you
and sent you to seventh heaven.

146
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,280
There's no way you don't love him.

147
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,456
Do you two know what the odds
of finding true love in one's life are?

148
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,496
1 to 280,000!

149
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,896
The odds are nearly nil,
yet you two found each other.

150
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,570
Why can't you cherish each other?

151
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,120
Why do you oldies
need a little girl like me to lecture you?

152
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,536
Be honest with yourselves, will you?

153
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,976
Stop finding excuses.

154
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,400
Be true to your love!

155
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,120
If you let this opportunity pass by,
you may never see each other again.

156
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,160
Is your dad still in Ningjiang?

157
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:23,253
Yes.

158
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,100
Take me to him.

159
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,680
Good luck.

160
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,520
That was hard work.

161
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,280
If it's ugly, so be it.

162
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,160
Wait, Liang Mu Ze.

163
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,760
Are you sure you want to do this?

164
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,490
Do you trust me?

165
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,160
I do.

166
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,216
If you trust me,
don't say a word or do a thing.

167
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,880
Just follow me
and I'll take care of it.

168
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,160
-Dad.
-Mr. Xia.

169
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,940
Dad.

170
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,840
I'd like to chat with you.

171
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,200
Xia Chu likes being a doctor.

172
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,520
I know.

173
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,730
Changing careers, moving back,
those are her decisions.

174
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,520
But,

175
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,280
if she hadn't been pressured,
she wouldn't have made those decisions.

176
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,240
What do you mean?

177
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,640
Are you saying I'm pressuring her?

178
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,450
She gets a lot of pressure at work.

179
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,530
But most of it was from you.

180
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,320
Liang Mu Ze.

181
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,600
Nonsense.

182
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,240
Get out.

183
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,760
Dad.

184
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,720
Please get out now!

185
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,280
Dad, don't be like that.

186
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,760
Dad, don't.

187
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,000
Mr. Xia,

188
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,570
all parents
want what's best for their children.

189
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,560
But seldom do they consider
what decisions,

190
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,560
are truly the best for them.

191
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,200
Xia Chu brought me here today
so I could tell you,

192
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,373
that when helping the sick
and the dying, she radiates happiness.

193
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,320
She's passionate about her job.

194
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,720
There's nothing with changing careers.

195
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,920
But now is not the time.

196
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,560
This is her first year
as a resident doctor.

197
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,930
If she gives up this opportunity,

198
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,120
it would not be easy for her
to put on a white coat again.

199
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,900
If she quits and goes home,

200
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,320
do you think she'll be happy?

201
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,560
This is all I have to say.

202
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,360
Get some rest. I'm off.

203
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,800
What was that about?

204
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,720
He thinks he can lecture me?

205
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,400
Did you see his attitude?

206
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,700
Dad.

207
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,730
I admit he was a little rude.

208
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,880
But he wasn't afraid to displease you
to speak up for me.

209
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,210
For that, I'm grateful.

210
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,920
Liang Mu Ze.

211
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,720
Did your dad disown you
because of what I said?

212
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,440
What are you saying?

213
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,440
My dad's not usually like that.

214
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,570
He's probably just a little paranoid
because of the explosion incident.

215
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,920
I understand.

216
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,760
Why don't you go back
and talk to him?

217
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,560
I want to follow you and your brigade.

218
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,250
I'm serious.

219
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,280
Xia Chu,

220
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,530
you don't really want to follow me.

221
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,200
You're just lost because
of Zhang Yi Chi's sudden departure.

222
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,200
You don't know what to do next.

223
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,400
All the things that are happening
and the pressure from your parents...

224
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,850
are affecting your judgement.

225
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,120
What you need is rest.

226
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,000
Take a shower
and get a good night's sleep.

227
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,560
When you wake up and see the fatigues
and the white coat,

228
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,160
you'll be glad.

229
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,490
Glad that you're still able to wear it.

230
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,800
Really?

231
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,560
I've been through it.

232
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,600
When Luo Liang left,

233
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,400
I was more devastated than you are now.

234
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,080
I thought you were going to say,

235
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,656
"Be with me, Xia Chu."

236
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,840
"I'll take care of you."

237
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,240
That's not the kind of love
you want, Xia Chu.

238
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,119
I told you...

239
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,800
I wouldn't let you down.

240
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,570
Let's be together.

241
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,400
Forever and always.

242
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,650
Let's be together.

243
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,480
Forever and always.

244
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,056
We're ready. Let's go.

245
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,120
Got it. No problem.

246
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,360
Nine o'clock tonight.

247
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,000
We have a guest
at Ms. Hua's Hot Pot Restaurant.

248
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,640
Do you have a cigarette?

249
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,050
I don't smoke.

250
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,880
Do you have a light?

251
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,000
What a big appetite you have.

252
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,360
Peng said,

253
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,776
you'd treat me well.

254
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,800
Of course.

255
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,000
This is just an appetizer.

256
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,280
Then what's the main course?

257
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,240
I'll let you experience it
when we get the chance.

258
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,320
Hai.

259
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,760
Long.

260
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,340
Dig in.

261
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,440
Hai?

262
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,016
Fei. Long time no see.

263
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,056
Long time no see.

264
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,290
Still alive, I see.

265
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,680
Watch your mouth.

266
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,856
What's the hurry?
Sit down and eat with us.

267
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,240
No thanks.

268
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,296
I just got a message from Jiu.

269
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,000
He wants me to buy some
barbecue for him. I should get to it.

270
00:21:41,796 --> 00:21:43,186
Jiu is out now?

271
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:45,552
Yes.

272
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:46,816
Haven't you heard?

273
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:51,136
We're having a celebration for him.
Want to join us?

274
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:53,232
Come on.

275
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:54,536
Let's go.

276
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:01,576
What do you say?

277
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:04,536
Do you want to experience it?

278
00:22:08,236 --> 00:22:09,856
Let's drink!

279
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,096
Hai, who is this?

280
00:22:21,476 --> 00:22:22,656
A friend.

281
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:24,226
Long.

282
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:38,336
Nice to meet you, Jiu.

283
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:41,992
Are we shaking hands now?
Drink, drink!

284
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:43,616
Let's drink!

285
00:22:43,836 --> 00:22:45,136
Come on!

286
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:48,866
Let's drink!

287
00:22:49,396 --> 00:22:51,856
Come on.
Sit down and drink.

288
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:53,296
Drink, drink.

289
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:17,192
Hai and Jiu have been hanging out
together in the last couple of days.

290
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:18,816
They hired a bevy of girls.

291
00:23:19,446 --> 00:23:22,376
On the surface,
it was a never-ending party.

292
00:23:22,756 --> 00:23:25,512
In reality, it was Jiu's
high-end underground casino.

293
00:23:25,596 --> 00:23:28,017
I heard he's quite the high roller.

294
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:30,656
He's the real deal.

295
00:23:37,436 --> 00:23:38,936
This is the middleman.

296
00:23:42,276 --> 00:23:43,856
Jiu trusts him very much.

297
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:00,616
Let's meet him.

298
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:10,946
Long Yi.

299
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:13,736
Jiu's idea is,

300
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:16,666
money is no object...

301
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:19,594
as long as it's the good stuff,

302
00:24:20,406 --> 00:24:21,336
and there's plenty of it.

303
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:24,936
No point going small, am I right?

304
00:24:25,249 --> 00:24:26,719
Jiu wouldn't like that.

305
00:24:28,236 --> 00:24:29,296
Don't worry.

306
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:31,856
How much can you take?

307
00:24:32,116 --> 00:24:33,696
How much do you have?

308
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:35,856
As much as you can take.

309
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:44,186
Level with me.

310
00:24:45,236 --> 00:24:47,056
Does Jiu have the appetite for it?

311
00:24:49,436 --> 00:24:50,416
You bet.

312
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,256
Jiu has a big appetite.

313
00:24:53,836 --> 00:24:55,112
What do you say?

314
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:57,166
If it doesn't work for you,
that's okay.

315
00:24:57,756 --> 00:24:59,096
We'll forget about the deal.

316
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:01,001
It's not like we need your business.

317
00:25:02,996 --> 00:25:03,986
Right?

318
00:25:06,286 --> 00:25:07,336
It's okay.

319
00:25:08,996 --> 00:25:09,876
I'll be off.

320
00:25:10,716 --> 00:25:11,602
Hey now.

321
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:13,552
Sit down, sit down.

322
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:15,176
What's the rush?

323
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:21,856
There's always room for negotiation.
We can work something out.

324
00:25:24,446 --> 00:25:25,336
Tell you what.

325
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:27,656
Don't take this the wrong way,

326
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:32,096
but if you can't make the call,

327
00:25:33,996 --> 00:25:35,856
bring me someone...

328
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:38,426
who can.

329
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:41,296
I fully represent the seller.

330
00:25:43,156 --> 00:25:44,256
Long Yi,

331
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:46,466
do you take me for a fool?

332
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:07,906
Hello, Jiu.

333
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:09,816
Yes, we're in the middle of it.

334
00:26:10,356 --> 00:26:11,496
Sounds good.

335
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:12,916
Okay.

336
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,136
Sure.

337
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:16,736
Bye, Jiu.

338
00:26:24,156 --> 00:26:25,896
Jiu is going to Hawaii the day after.

339
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:27,576
So soon?

340
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,296
Things are getting hot.

341
00:26:30,596 --> 00:26:31,656
Besides,

342
00:26:32,356 --> 00:26:34,896
you're not the only ones selling.

343
00:26:38,286 --> 00:26:39,706
Jiu can take his time.

344
00:26:43,956 --> 00:26:44,836
Good beer.

345
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:46,086
See you.

346
00:26:47,596 --> 00:26:48,976
Sit down.

347
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:01,391
He wants to see the owner
of the goods?

348
00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:02,472
That's right.

349
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:04,026
Jiu is very cautious.

350
00:27:04,196 --> 00:27:05,576
He insisted on negotiating
face to face.

351
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:07,176
Have you looked into his background?

352
00:27:08,156 --> 00:27:10,882
We've checked Jiu
and the middleman, Hai.

353
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:12,032
They're clean.

354
00:27:12,116 --> 00:27:13,266
"We?"

355
00:27:13,436 --> 00:27:14,706
Long Yi is out.

356
00:27:20,236 --> 00:27:21,256
Old Master.

357
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:25,152
I suppose you know what happened
in the organisation recently?

358
00:27:25,236 --> 00:27:26,116
I do.

359
00:27:26,956 --> 00:27:29,106
Did the Chinese Police give you
a hard time?

360
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,496
No.
It was a standard interrogation.

361
00:27:32,086 --> 00:27:33,376
They had no evidence,

362
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:35,096
and I kept my mouth shut.

363
00:27:37,396 --> 00:27:38,816
You've just come out,

364
00:27:39,716 --> 00:27:41,376
and already a buyer has contacted you.

365
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:44,136
How lucky for you.

366
00:27:44,716 --> 00:27:46,832
They also have some cash
that needs moving.

367
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,722
If you don't feel safe going,
I can deal with them.

368
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:50,696
No.

369
00:27:53,396 --> 00:27:54,616
I'll do it myself.

370
00:27:55,996 --> 00:27:56,976
When?

371
00:27:59,316 --> 00:28:01,176
Before we decide
on the distribution channel,

372
00:28:02,156 --> 00:28:04,256
we must figure out the bait and switch.

373
00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:10,386
The solution to our problem
is Xia Guang Yuan and his research.

374
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:12,282
I know.

375
00:28:12,366 --> 00:28:13,416
You do?

376
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:18,592
Then why haven't you succeeded yet?

377
00:28:18,676 --> 00:28:21,656
Don't give me that line
about the explosion and some dead cop.

378
00:28:21,876 --> 00:28:23,146
It's not enough.

379
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:24,576
Listen, Zhuo Ran.

380
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:26,336
I'll say this again.

381
00:28:27,156 --> 00:28:28,632
I want Xia Guang Yuan.

382
00:28:28,716 --> 00:28:31,576
If not him, at least his daughter.

383
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:35,696
Somebody must pay for my loss.
Do you understand, Zhuo Ran?

384
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:37,056
I understand.

385
00:28:41,476 --> 00:28:42,536
Listen,

386
00:28:44,076 --> 00:28:45,976
don't keep me waiting for too long.

387
00:28:46,116 --> 00:28:47,096
I won't.

388
00:29:01,796 --> 00:29:03,186
This is the last time.

389
00:29:05,606 --> 00:29:06,776
I'm serious.

390
00:29:07,636 --> 00:29:08,936
I've already broken the law...

391
00:29:09,316 --> 00:29:12,136
by breaching the security system
and stealing the data.

392
00:29:13,526 --> 00:29:16,272
If you want more detailed information,
there's nothing I can do.

393
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:17,736
It's not on his computer.

394
00:29:18,956 --> 00:29:20,096
Then where is it?

395
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:25,216
You need to ask the professor.

396
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:26,896
Incidentally,

397
00:29:27,236 --> 00:29:31,352
I was just thinking of inviting you
and Professor Xia to Isaia.

398
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,316
Where?

399
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:33,376
Isaia.

400
00:29:33,796 --> 00:29:35,896
We have a lab and a manufacturing
facility there,

401
00:29:36,126 --> 00:29:38,426
that can meet all of your needs.

402
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:39,856
An overseas lab?

403
00:29:42,276 --> 00:29:43,576
I've never thought of that.

404
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,576
Now's the time to think about it.

405
00:29:51,316 --> 00:29:52,586
What did the professor say?

406
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,256
I haven't asked him.

407
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:57,546
There's no way he'll go.

408
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:02,776
Then I hope you'll help me
deliver this invitation...

409
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:04,905
to Professor Xia.

410
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:07,345
Whose invitation is this?

411
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:08,585
Yours.

412
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:10,801
At noon tomorrow,

413
00:30:10,885 --> 00:30:12,505
your girlfriend
and the entire research team,

414
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:14,785
will receive an automatic email,

415
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:19,065
describing in vivid detail your arrest
for solicitation of prostitution.

416
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:22,355
Zhuo Ran, what do you want?

417
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:24,205
Of course,

418
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:28,041
if you can deliver this invitation
to Professor Xia,

419
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,241
and persuade him to go to Isaia with you,

420
00:30:30,325 --> 00:30:34,841
I guarantee that provocative email
will never see the light of day.

421
00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:36,065
When it's over,

422
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,185
you'll go back to being the upstanding
Professor Tang.

423
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:42,065
The arguments you have with
your girlfriend over financial matters,

424
00:30:42,245 --> 00:30:43,601
will magically disappear.

425
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:44,665
Trust me.

426
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:46,705
I know.

427
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,465
You set this up.

428
00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:50,105
It's all a ploy, isn't it?

429
00:30:54,525 --> 00:30:56,561
I'd appreciate your cooperation,
Professor Tang.

430
00:30:56,645 --> 00:30:57,675
No way.

431
00:30:58,085 --> 00:31:00,985
I'm telling you,
I'll never betray my teacher.

432
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:04,545
Think.

433
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:09,235
Between being a successful traitor
and a failure that nobody wants,

434
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:11,644
which is worse?

435
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:15,265
Professor Xia, take a look at this.

436
00:31:25,735 --> 00:31:27,121
Half a month ago,

437
00:31:27,205 --> 00:31:30,201
somebody transferred a sum of money
to your personal account.

438
00:31:30,285 --> 00:31:31,585
Are you aware of that?

439
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:34,131
Who transferred it?

440
00:31:34,215 --> 00:31:35,681
It's an overseas account.

441
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:37,835
Opened by a guy called Francis.

442
00:31:38,245 --> 00:31:39,715
Does it ring any bells?

443
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:43,235
Not that I recall.

444
00:31:44,045 --> 00:31:45,115
Overseas?

445
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:48,305
Could it be one of Xia Chu's friends?

446
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:50,505
Why do you bring her up?

447
00:31:50,615 --> 00:31:52,385
Why would her friend give us money?

448
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:54,121
It's such a huge sum.

449
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:57,315
Why would Xia Chu not tell us
and keep us in the dark?

450
00:31:58,445 --> 00:32:02,505
As for the real identity
of the account owner, we'll look into it.

451
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,345
And about your PhD student, Tang Lin,

452
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:11,401
and the email he received
from your personal email...

453
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:15,225
As I've said,
I didn't send that email.

454
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:18,425
I never use my personal email
for work-related matters.

455
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:24,625
Professor Xia, simmer down.

456
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:28,305
We'll look into this matter.

457
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:33,905
So far, it seems your personal email
has been hacked.

458
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:38,681
The university would like you
to hand over your research materials,

459
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:42,435
to ensure the project's smooth progress
while you're under investigation.

460
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:45,025
Whose idea is this?

461
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:47,945
It was a collective decision
by the university council.

462
00:32:48,205 --> 00:32:51,691
Later on, an accounting firm,

463
00:32:51,775 --> 00:32:54,665
will perform a proper audit
on the project's finances.

464
00:32:54,925 --> 00:32:56,955
Are they so eager to get rid of me?

465
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,881
-Professor Xia...
-Ask Chairman Qin to come here right now!

466
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:01,545
I'll speak to him face to face.

467
00:33:02,725 --> 00:33:04,841
What's all this fuss about an audit?

468
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:07,425
Are you after the hacker
or me, Xia Guang Yuan?

469
00:33:07,805 --> 00:33:09,305
This is an outrage.

470
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:11,035
An outrage.

471
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:12,491
What are you waiting for?

472
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:13,705
Go!

473
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,025
Alright. Professor Xia,
we shall not bother you, then.

474
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:31,265
Honey, why don't you
hand the project over to them?

475
00:33:32,245 --> 00:33:33,441
I can hand it over.

476
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:34,881
I can back out of it.

477
00:33:34,965 --> 00:33:36,625
But I can't just leave.

478
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:41,385
Those who want me gone
don't really care about my research.

479
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:48,185
I've had enough of you people.

480
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:50,225
Professor.

481
00:33:51,325 --> 00:33:52,745
This is all my fault.

482
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:56,065
If I hadn't sent that email...

483
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:05,065
Right now, this whole thing
has gone way beyond your email.

484
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:10,305
Some green-eyed monsters
are trying to ruin me.

485
00:34:11,805 --> 00:34:13,345
What are you going to do about it?

486
00:34:16,525 --> 00:34:19,624
If you ask me how to conduct research,
I'd have an answer.

487
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:22,905
But if you ask me how
to deal with nasty people,

488
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,105
I'm stumped.

489
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,405
Take a seat.

490
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:38,515
Professor,

491
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,985
have you considered resigning
or changing jobs?

492
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:48,345
It's the same everywhere.

493
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:53,545
The biggest challenge to do research
in China isn't in the laboratory.

494
00:34:55,245 --> 00:34:56,305
What about overseas?

495
00:34:58,045 --> 00:34:59,921
There are many research institutions
out there,

496
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:01,835
that need someone
with solid theoretical grounding,

497
00:35:02,005 --> 00:35:04,035
and extensive experience
to lead their projects.

498
00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:07,995
Even outside the laboratory,
you have a bright future.

499
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:16,545
When my mother passed away
due to a terminal illness,

500
00:35:16,765 --> 00:35:20,585
I swore I'd become
a traditional medicine researcher.

501
00:35:20,775 --> 00:35:22,635
But at this age,

502
00:35:23,045 --> 00:35:27,425
my career and my job
aren't just about personal interests.

503
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:30,865
I feel
I have other responsibilities.

504
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:33,065
So,

505
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:36,395
even if I can't stay in the laboratory,

506
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:38,865
I won't venture overseas...

507
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:41,279
as it's against my original intention
of joining this field.

508
00:35:44,165 --> 00:35:45,515
But don't worry.

509
00:35:45,765 --> 00:35:47,425
I'll be in the front line,

510
00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:50,945
making sure
you youngsters are not affected.

511
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:54,225
You're all good kids.

512
00:35:57,005 --> 00:36:00,065
You shouldn't
get mixed up in these shenanigans.

513
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:05,825
Professor, actually I...

514
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:09,735
What?

515
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:15,995
I'm getting married.

516
00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:18,705
You're getting married?

517
00:36:29,285 --> 00:36:31,345
We're having a wedding in Isaia.

518
00:36:31,855 --> 00:36:34,745
I'd like you to be our witness.

519
00:36:35,605 --> 00:36:37,385
This is so sudden.

520
00:36:38,335 --> 00:36:40,755
This was a long time in the making.

521
00:36:41,925 --> 00:36:43,161
I wanted to tell you,

522
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:45,865
but then,
the investigation happened,

523
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:47,705
and I couldn't bring it up.

524
00:36:49,485 --> 00:36:51,025
My big day is just around the corner.

525
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:54,025
I hope on this momentous occasion,

526
00:36:54,205 --> 00:36:56,625
you can be my witness.

527
00:36:57,445 --> 00:36:58,745
Isaia is visa-free.

528
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:01,115
I've arranged the food and accommodation.

529
00:37:01,605 --> 00:37:04,505
All you have to do is fly there
on the weekend.

530
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:06,425
Will you...

531
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:09,265
be free?

532
00:37:13,805 --> 00:37:15,145
This is wonderful news.

533
00:37:17,325 --> 00:37:18,465
I'll be there.

534
00:37:24,165 --> 00:37:26,505
Can you believe that Tang Lin?

535
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:30,025
Such an important thing as marriage,
and he's only just told you.

536
00:37:30,325 --> 00:37:32,625
We don't even have time to prepare.

537
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:37,225
I'm not the bridegroom.
What's there to prepare for?

538
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:40,705
Shouldn't you at least prepare
a wedding gift?

539
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:43,985
I'll just give him money.

540
00:37:44,325 --> 00:37:46,505
Young people nowadays
have all kinds of crazy ideas.

541
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,281
Even if we take the trouble
to pick out a gift,

542
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:51,105
they may not even like it.

543
00:37:52,525 --> 00:37:54,035
Good point.

544
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:00,195
Professor Xia.

545
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:01,465
What do you think?

546
00:38:03,085 --> 00:38:04,785
I'll look so dashing in that.

547
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:07,185
You wish.

548
00:38:09,965 --> 00:38:11,401
I guess we can use a trip.

549
00:38:11,485 --> 00:38:13,545
Think of it as a vacation.

550
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:18,185
But where is this Isaia?
How come I've never heard of it?

551
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,945
The wife's family chose it.

552
00:38:22,215 --> 00:38:23,315
It has great views.

553
00:38:24,525 --> 00:38:26,065
Are you sure you aren't coming?

554
00:38:26,285 --> 00:38:27,291
I can't.

555
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:28,705
It's the old man's birthday.

556
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:31,145
Then,

557
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:34,545
wouldn't it be inappropriate
for me to skip his birthday?

558
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:35,985
Don't worry about it.

559
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:38,505
Birthdays come around every year.

560
00:38:39,405 --> 00:38:41,931
But a wedding happens only
once in a lifetime.

561
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:43,505
You're his teacher.

562
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,705
You should be there for him.

563
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:49,201
Call Xia Chu.
Ask her to keep you company.

564
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,625
Enough already.

565
00:38:50,765 --> 00:38:52,001
Young people have their own plans.

566
00:38:52,085 --> 00:38:54,425
She might not be
too happy to come back.

567
00:38:54,845 --> 00:38:57,011
Whenever I think
of her and that military guy,

568
00:38:57,095 --> 00:38:58,105
I get upset.

569
00:39:00,495 --> 00:39:03,051
Why do you have an issue
with Liang Mu Ze?

570
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:05,425
He's Mu Min's son, after all.

571
00:39:06,485 --> 00:39:08,145
So what if he is Mu Min's son?

572
00:39:09,485 --> 00:39:10,955
You don't know him.

573
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:12,601
And you do?

574
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:13,985
How well do you know him?

575
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:17,401
I just don't get it.

576
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:22,225
Are you unhappy with him
or the fact that he's a soldier?

577
00:39:26,805 --> 00:39:28,041
I just don't like him.

578
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:29,555
I don't like anything about him.

579
00:39:30,445 --> 00:39:33,395
When I'm back, I'll settle
this matter with Xia Chu.

580
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:35,425
You must stand on my side.

581
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:42,665
Stubborn old coot.

582
00:39:46,645 --> 00:39:47,665
Honey,

583
00:39:48,205 --> 00:39:49,931
I packed your suit in the luggage.

584
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:52,281
Remember to iron it
at the hotel before you wear it.

585
00:39:52,365 --> 00:39:54,305
-Here, Tang Lin.
-Got it.

586
00:39:55,845 --> 00:39:57,361
Congratulations, Tang Lin.

587
00:39:57,445 --> 00:40:00,425
Remind him to measure his blood
pressure and blood sugar at night.

588
00:40:00,685 --> 00:40:01,565
Okay.

589
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:22,225
Professor,

590
00:40:22,405 --> 00:40:23,601
my stomach hurts.

591
00:40:23,685 --> 00:40:24,601
Let me use the bathroom.

592
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:26,385
Go. Hurry.

593
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:28,841
I'll wait for you here.

594
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:29,805
Okay.

595
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:48,785
(We've landed.)

596
00:41:00,445 --> 00:41:01,755
Sorry.

597
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:05,785
No problem.

598
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:07,985
No problem.

599
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:18,385
Sir, may I see your passport, please?

600
00:41:18,695 --> 00:41:19,575
What?

601
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:26,705
Sir, may I see your passport?

602
00:41:28,205 --> 00:41:29,105
My friend...

603
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:31,521
Sir, where's your passport?

604
00:41:31,605 --> 00:41:33,665
I'm waiting...

605
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:58,025
Sir, passport!

606
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,075
Please show us your passport!

607
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:04,745
Sir, please open it.

608
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,235
One step back.

609
00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:17,745
-One step back.
-Okay.

610
00:42:30,605 --> 00:42:31,665
What's this?

611
00:42:33,165 --> 00:42:34,345
This...

612
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:37,475
It's cocaine! Seize him!

613
00:42:38,645 --> 00:42:39,561
What are you doing?

614
00:42:39,645 --> 00:42:40,811
What are you doing?

615
00:42:40,895 --> 00:42:42,011
I have no idea.

616
00:42:42,095 --> 00:42:43,315
Who does this belong to?

617
00:42:43,535 --> 00:42:44,771
What are you doing?

618
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:46,105
This isn't mine.

619
00:42:46,445 --> 00:42:47,665
I have no idea.

620
00:42:48,005 --> 00:42:48,985
Wait.

621
00:42:51,805 --> 00:42:53,315
This may be...

622
00:42:54,925 --> 00:42:59,345
the biggest redeployment
in this time of peace.

623
00:42:59,965 --> 00:43:02,545
Many brigades are leaving...

624
00:43:02,895 --> 00:43:05,315
or are about to leave
their familiar bases.

625
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:09,275
To put down their roots
in new territories.

626
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:12,225
To us, the Special Forces Brigade,

627
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:14,115
redeployment,

628
00:43:15,245 --> 00:43:16,721
isn't simply about moving.

629
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:17,801
Have these been sorted?

630
00:43:17,885 --> 00:43:18,905
Yes, they have.

631
00:43:19,645 --> 00:43:21,715
We must carry out the redeployment...

632
00:43:23,285 --> 00:43:26,625
as though we're in an actual war.

633
00:43:42,175 --> 00:43:43,945
Captain, shouldn't we wait
for the Lieutenant?

634
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:47,585
No, move on.

635
00:43:47,845 --> 00:43:48,825
Alright.

636
00:44:02,245 --> 00:44:04,465
Xiao Xue may have gone to your camp
to find Tian Yong.
