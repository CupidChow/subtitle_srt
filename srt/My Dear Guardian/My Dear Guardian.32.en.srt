Xia Chu,

57
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,051
your father went to Isaia
to attend Tang Lin's wedding.

58

I haven't heard from him for two days.

but neither of them answered.

What's going on?

61
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,096
Mum, don't panic.

62
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,161
I've been to Isaia before.
The signal there is terrible.

63
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,600
Tell you what,

64
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,776
why don't you give me
Dad's flight number,

65
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,696
and the name of the hotel?

66
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,776
I'll call in to check
and get back to you.

67
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,280
Alright. I'll send it over right away.

68
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,200

69
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:15,760
(Hotel not found)

70
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,176
Hello. You've reached
the Chinese Embassy in Isaia.

71
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,920
How may I help you?

72
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,936
Hi.

73
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,760
I've lost contact with my father
after he landed in Isaia two days ago.

74
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,736
And I can't find his hotel online.

75
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,080
Can the embassy
help me find his whereabouts?

76
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,936
Ms. Xia, we've just been informed
by the Isaia police.

77
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,736
Your father, Xia Guang Yuan,
was arrested for drug possession,

78
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,056
by the airport police on the 23rd
when he was going through immigration.

79
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,080
He is now held at a police station
in the suburbs of Isaia.

80
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,480
Take a seat.

81
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,520
I'm the lawyer sent to bail you out.

82
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,736
Here are your papers.

83
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,291
And here is your bail bond.

84
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,720
Just sign on the dotted line,
and we'll be on our way.

85
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,560
Don't worry.
Your friend sent me here.

86
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,520
Everything has been arranged for you.

87
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,240
All you have to do is sign it,
Professor Xia.

88
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,000
Have a drink, Professor Xia.

89
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,360
Thanks.

90
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,040
May I ask where the person
who came here with me is right now?

91
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,560
I want to call my family.

92
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,040
But my phone is missing.

93
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,360
I want to go home.

94
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,120
Can I go home right now?

95
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,960
Can I?

96
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,920
This isn't the way to the airport.

97
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,210
Where are you taking me?

98
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,420
Pull over!

99
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,040
I... I want to get out.

100
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,240
Calm down, Professor Xia.

101
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,880
It'll all be clear when you wake up.

It's me, Mummy.

If I don't come here,

112
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,000
what will become of you?

113
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,490
I'm sorry.

114
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,800
What happened?

115
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,360
You were fine...

116
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,546
and now you're injured.

118
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,770

120

Are you still as green as ever?

121
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,280
It's you.

122
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,650
Who did you think it was?

123
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,280
What are you trying to find?

124
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,240
What are you trying to find?

125
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,426
What is it?

126
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,930
My smartphone.

127
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,560
Here it is.

128
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,000

129
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,480
Xiao Xue.

130
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,760
I didn't mean to get in his way.

131
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,160
I didn't mean to.

132
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,480
Xiao Xue, what's wrong?

133
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,536
You're not feeling well?

134
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,200
I didn't mean to give him trouble.

135
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,416
Why?

136
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,240
Stop asking.

137
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,760
What are you doing here?

138
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,000
Going through the material.

139
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,720
It's about Zhuo Ran's confession.

140
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,760
Any new discoveries?

141
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,466
He said a lot of things.

142
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,240
But when it came
to Old Master's identity,

143
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,080
he revealed nothing.

144
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,520
If he wasn't covering up
for Old Master,

145
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,400
he was covering up for himself.

146
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,840
Is this Mi Gu from Life FM?

147
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,496
Yes. May I know who's speaking?

148
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,400
I've been following your program.

149
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,570
I have a lead
that you might find interesting.

150
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,600
Go on.

151
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,800
Professor Xia Guang Yuan
of Dong'an University,

152
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,760
was kidnapped in Isaia.

153
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,810
T4 has just confirmed
they're responsible for it.

154
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,640
Who was kidnapped?

155
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,600
Who are you?

156
00:15:33,777 --> 00:15:34,610
Hello?

157
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,680
Mum!

158
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,290
You're back.

159
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,880
What's going on?

160
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,640
We basically got the picture now.
Try and think about it.

161
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,016
If there is any detail
that we missed,

162
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,410
remember to contact the university.

163
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,610
Or Officer Zhou here.

164
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,690
We'll take our leave, then.

165
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,120
Mum!

166
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,520
Mum!

167
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,160

168
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,530
Slowly.

169
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,240
Well?

170
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,810
Feeling better now?

171
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,040
So many things have happened.

172
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,976
Why didn't you guys tell me earlier?

173
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,640
What's the use?

174
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,160
You were too far away
to help us.

175
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:19,520
Didn't you have things
you wanted to tell us back in Ningjiang?

176
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,560
No wonder Dad was so adamant
that I come back to Dong'an.

177
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,200
Xia Chu, don't blame your father.

178
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,720
He has too much on his plate.

179
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,520
It's hard on him emotionally.

180
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,040
I know.

181
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,930
I know.

182
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,690
Mum,

183
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,960
Dad would never
run off to another country...

184
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,280
and join a research institution
there, would he?

185
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,370
What are you saying, Xia Chu?

186
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,240
Don't you trust your father?

187
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,936
Don't you know what kind of person
he is?

188
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,016
I do.

189
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,066
To him, work was never simply work.

190
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,000
It is his dream.

191
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,056
No matter how hard life is,
no matter how unfairly he's treated,

192
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,496
even if he's forced to leave
the laboratory,

193
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,936
he'd never abandon us,

194
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,976
his friends,

195
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,616
his colleagues, his students,

196
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,720
and his project
to pursue a so-called future.

197
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,136
No way. I know him.
There's no way he'd do such a thing.

198
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,336
I know he wouldn't.

199
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,576
Take it easy,

200
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,540
alright?

201
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,240
No matter what the people
who came to our house said,

202
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,600
I still believe in your father.

203
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,400
I believe in him, too.

204
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,530
Don't worry.

205
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,080
I'll go to Isaia
and bring Dad back safely.

206
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,856
When are you going?

207
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,840
Tomorrow.

208
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,256
I need to go to Ningjiang first
to pack up.

209
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,786
I'll fly from there in the afternoon.

210
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,750
Okay.

211
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:01,096
Let me pack up.
I'm coming with you.

212
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,280
Mum. Mum, calm down.

213
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,273
Listen, you have to stay at home.

214
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,336
The university people might
want to contact you.

215
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,346
Someone has to stay back.

216
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,226
But how can you go on your own?

217
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,240
Trust me.

218
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,480
I can do it.

219
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,960
Tell you what,
why don't you tell me what happened,

220
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,320
on the day Tang Lin came to see Dad
down to the last detail?

221
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,040
That day,

222
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,960
Tang Lin came to our house
unannounced.

223
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,000
He told your father,

224
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,800
he was going to have
a wedding in Isaia.

225
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,016
Xia Chu!

226
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,056
I have to go to Isaia.

227
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,490
Is this about your father?

228
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,400
I received a phone call
saying he's in trouble.

229
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,616
From whom?

230
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,536
I don't know.

231
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,480
I tried calling back,
but nobody answered.

232
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,280
Wake up.

233
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,730
What's up?

234
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,200
Find Hai.

235
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,616
-Right now?
-Right now.

236
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,040
Take him to Old Master.

237
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,080
Does Old Master know?

238
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,216
Should I give him a heads-up?

239
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,840
Listen, Xia Guang Yuan
and the others have arrived in Isaia.

240
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,920
The new product development
is in the bag.

241
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,840
What Old Master wants
is the Chinese market.

242
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,000
I need to solve this problem
as soon as possible.

243
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,520
For my mother.

244
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,930
She doesn't have much time left.

245
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,840
Why do you need Hai?

246
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,600
He's only a middleman.

247
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,240
Because compared to Jiu,
he's more valuable.

248
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,586
Rao Zhi, Old Master has agreed
to meet up.

249
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,786
But Hai must go to his turf.

250
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,530
Why Hai?

251
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,576
He doesn't want to give you
too much sway over him.

252
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,130
He's hoping Hai can provide
more options for distribution.

253
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,250
Long Yi...

254
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,176
was the man who hurt Xiao Xue.

255
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,140
Isn't that right?

256
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,720
Xiao Xue told me everything.

257
00:21:34,248 --> 00:21:36,268
It's been so many years,

258
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,920
yet Xiao Xue could recognize
him straight away.

259
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,840
Your mission this time is two-fold.

260
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,800
First, to find the actual location
of T4's HQ.

261
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,680
Second, to meet
the puppetmaster, Old Master,

262
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,936
and take a clear photograph
of his face.

263
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,680
So that the police can identify him.

264
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,850
And if possible,

265
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,880
obtain evidence of him
and T4's crimes.

266
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,920
I'll do whatever it takes
to find proof of their wrongdoing.

267
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,600
I will complete the mission.

268
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,240
Be careful.

269
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,136
Are you going by yourself?

270
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,976
Don't worry.
I've lived in Isaia for six months.

271
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,160
I'll be fine.

272
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,840
If, like the man claimed, T4 is involved
with your father's disappearance...

273
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:35,176
All the more reason
for me to go.

274
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,896
I need to relay the information
to the embassy and the local police,

275
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,560
so they can find him
as soon as possible.

276
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,376
My father was charged
with drug smuggling,

277
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,776
and now he's missing.

278
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,376
I must go, Mi Gu.

279
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,880
Have you told Liang Mu Ze?

280
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,136
I don't intend to.

281
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,320
Why not?

282
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,210
He's your boyfriend.

283
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,680
Are you afraid he won't come with you?

284
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:09,936
No.

285
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,490
I know he'd be happy to.

286
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,080
But he can't because he's a soldier.

287
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,450
Even I had to get special permission.

288
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,000
It's impossible for him.

289
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,536
He'd feel torn.

290
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,560
You're still thinking of him
at a time like this?

291
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,296
Xia Chu, you're just a girl.

292
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,760
Don't think
you can handle everything on your own.

293
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,346
Tell him.

294
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,530
At least let him hear you out.

295
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,610
I don't want him to feel guilty.

296
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,640
Is there anything I can do for you?

297
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,920
Keep it a secret.

298
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,680
Take care of yourself.

299
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,000
Don't worry.

300
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,640
Dr. Zhang.

301
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,690
Can I have Liang Mu Ze's
contact information?

302
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,000
Reporting in!

303
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,398
What's all that racket?

304
00:25:31,483 --> 00:25:32,746
(Brigade Commander's Office)
Come in.

305
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,710
Yes, sir.

306
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,400
Commander,
I'd like to take a leave.

307
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,791
-Now?
-That's right.

308
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:40,773
What for?

309
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:42,610
Xia Chu's father ran into some
trouble in Isaia.

310
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,880
I want to go there with her.

311
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,960
Is there any way
I can get to Isaia as soon as possible?

312
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,496
Do you expect me
to call up the Air and Ground Forces?

313
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,480
-Thank you, Commander.
-Liang Mu Ze!

314
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,960
You're getting out of line.

315
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,080
You're an active personnel.

316
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,900
What right do I have to let an active
personnel leave the country willy-nilly?

317
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,746
Besides, under what justification
should I let you go?

318
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,936
For business?

319
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,040
For a trip?

320
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,040
Or to visit your family
on a holiday?

321
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,000
I think you're out of your gourd.

322
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,680
Our priority now is the redeployment.

323
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,520
And we're firing on all cylinders.

324
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,480
-I know.
-Like hell you do.

325
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,560
Let me tell you, Liang Mu Ze,
I can't send you to Isaia this time,

326
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,050
but even if I can,
and you arrive in Isaia,

327
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,010
what can you, a Special Forces soldier,
the face of Chinese military, do?

328
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:36,416
Do you think this is a movie
where you get to roam free

329
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,560
in a foreign territory
with guns blazing?

330
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,120
Dream on!

331
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,590
Commander,

332
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,040
I just want to be there
to protect her when she needs me.

333
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,650
I want to protect my loved one.

334
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,750
Say no more.

335
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,360
How many times
must I repeat our code of conduct?

336
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,040
Go back.

337
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,060
Commander.

338
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,016
Don't make me put you
in confinement!

339
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,881
-Get out!
-Yes, sir.

340
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,240
Please get me Military Attache
Chen's contact information.

341
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,440
Thanks.

342
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,520
I heard T4 kidnapped him.

343
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,160
But I'm not sure if it's true.

344
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,936
I'm really worried about her.

345
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,880
I don't know who else can help her.

346
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,336
It's dangerous for her to go there.

347
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,800
Can you figure something out?

348
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,200
Xia Chu.

349
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,720
Why are you here?

350
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,410
Mi Gu told me.

351
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,280
I tried to ask the Brigade Commander
to deploy me to Isaia,

352
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,010
but to no avail.

353
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,040
What were you thinking?

354
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,360
It's just a pipe dream.

355
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,200
I can't come with you.

356
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,920
I'm sorry.

357
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,546
What are you apologizing for?

358
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,760
I'm a military personnel, too.
I understand.

359
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,320
That's why...

360
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,840
I asked Mi Gu not to tell you.

361
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,450
I didn't want you to feel guilty.

362
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,880
The fact that you came here today
and told me those things is enough.

363
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,096
By the way, when you arrive,

364
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,440
a man named Mahadi
will be there to pick you up.

365
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,080
He's a friend of mine in Isaia.

366
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,096
He works for the local police.

367
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,280
He should
be able to help your father.

368
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:01,856
If you run into any trouble there,
just give me a call,

369
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,480
and I'll figure something out, okay?

370
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,160
Sure.

371
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,720
You should get going.

372
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,610
I have to go now.

373
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,490
Safe journey.

374
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,880
I'm going back to the camp.

375
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,470
Bye.

376
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,600
Commander.

377
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,120
Well I'll be, kid.

378
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,560
So tell me.

379
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,760
Where were you heading?

380
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,370
I went to see Xia Chu off.

381
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,420
By the way,

382
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,800
I've sent Xia Chu's contact information,

383
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,240
to Military Attache Chen
at the embassy in Isaia.

384
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,960
He'll get in touch with her.

385
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,600
Thank you, Commander.

386
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,330
Remember,
if I see you running off again,

387
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,080
I'll take disciplinary action.

388
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,336
I'll make an example of you
in front of the entire brigade.

389
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,300
Yes, sir.

390
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,630
(At Willick's border)

391
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,680
Where's your partner?

392
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,960
He has something important to do.

393
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,960
What's so important?

394
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,130
Dig in.

395
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,890
The food here is pretty good.

396
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,320
Where are we?

397
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,520
Jade City.

398
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,336
This is their current location.

399
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,520
Based on the map, I'd say they're
in a restaurant outside the border.

400
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,160
It's the same place
Zhuo Ran met Old Master last time.

401
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,050
Keep an eye on it.

402
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,120
Director, Tian Yong
and the rest have crossed the border.

403
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,240
Tell the Interpol and the local police
to keep a close watch.

404
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,050
Got it. I'll coordinate it.

405
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,600
One more thing.

406
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,096
While helping the Dong'an Police

407
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,856
investigate an inter-provincial
wire transfer,

408
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,680
the Financial Investigation Division
made an interesting discovery.

409
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,050
Who is it about?

410
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,560
Zhuo Ran.

411
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,336
Before you came,

412
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,130
I checked the airport
and the police's surveillance footages.

413
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,360
So, I understand your father
has some problems?

414
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,680
Is this your father?

415
00:32:33,515 --> 00:32:34,376
Yes.

416
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,520
His suitcase
was lifted up by a janitor.

417
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,120
The whole process lasted less than
five seconds.

418
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:46,080
Nothing suspicious
was found with the janitor.

419
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,866
The suitcase had already been opened.

420
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,050
How do you know?

421
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,840
Here.

422
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,000
There is a sign of deliberate tearing
on the sticker along the latch.

423
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,560
Probably caused by the opening
of the zipper.

424
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,840
So,

425
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,946
maybe we can check it out?

426
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,480
The CCTV at the baggage claim area.

427
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,600
We need to look into the baggage handler
for that flight.

428
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,630
Yeah.

429
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,690
And what about the student
who came with my father?

430
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,616
He went to a bathroom after
your father claimed his luggage,

431
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,889
and changed his clothes. Then he left
your father alone with the police.

432
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,920
No entry has been recorded yet, but,

433
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,840
we searched, and we're sending
more people to search for him.

434
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,410
Why would he do that?

435
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,851
I don't know.

436
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:48,160
He certainly has a direct connection
to what happened to your father.

437
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,000
Have you found that hotel?

438
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,106
Fake address.

439
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,680
That hotel isn't even in Isaia.

440
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,880
So, look at this. Do you know him?

441
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,736
This is the lawyer
that took your father from our custody.

442
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,960
We tried to identify him.

443
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,520
I don't know him.

444
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:16,176
I don't know anyone in Isaia
apart from the colleagues

445
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,016
from the army medical team.

446
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,040
I couldn't get a lawyer to bail
my father out.

447
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,520
It's a trap all along.

448
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,360
You're really tired today.

449
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,000
You should eat something.

450
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,760
Wait, wait. Eat this.

451
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,080
Liang said your taste is light.

452
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,639
So he reminded me to put
less salt in your food.

453
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,520
He's so sweet, right?

454
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,800
Yes.

455
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,920
Liang Mu Ze.

456
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,210
Xia Chu?
Where did you get this number?

457
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,880
I asked the embassy to connect
my call.

458
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,720
How are you getting on?

459
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,826
I've found a hotel.

460
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,680
Which hotel? Is it safe?

461
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,936
Don't worry. Mahadi found it for me.

462
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,410
It has great security.

463
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,880
That's a relief.

464
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,826
What about dinner?

465
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,616
I had dinner with Mahadi.

466
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,920
Something light and simple
at the restaurant where we first met.

467
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,050
The owner still remembers me.

468
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,620
Alright.

469
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,890
Too bad I wasn't there.

470
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,560
Liang Mu Ze,

471
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,280
my father
could be in serious trouble this time.

472
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,480
I don't know how things will turn out.

473
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,560
What are you trying to say?

474
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,050
I'm afraid it might affect you.

475
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,690
No, Xia Chu.

476
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,656
No matter the outcome,
I'll always be with you.

477
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,620
Rest assured.

478
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,620
Are you crying?

479
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,820
No.

480
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,510
Tell you what, why don't you tell me
everything you know, alright?

481
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,740
Okay.

482
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,770
Mahadi and I went to the airport today,

483
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,696
where we learned
that a baggage handler named Zaha,

484
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,440
had suddenly quit after the incident.

485
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,000
In the past few days, Zaha has been seen
frequenting high-end outlets.

486
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,256
Through his fingerprint, the police
confirmed he had handled,

487
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,360
the bag of cocaine found
in my father's suitcase.

488
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,736
Zaha was acting on the orders
of a man named Francis.

489
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,696
Zaha admitted
that Francis was the lawyer,

490
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,600
who took my father from custody.

491
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,520
By tracking Francis' account activities,
Mahadi and his team...

492
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:12,975
verified that
he has been laundering money

493
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,600
for the T4 group headquartered
in Willick.

494
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,640
Afterward, Mahadi secretly followed
Francis to a secluded industrial area.

495
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,780
There,

496
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,440
he saw Tang Lin, who had been missing.

497
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:37,146
Based on the analysis of the waste
material coming from the factory,

498
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,800
we know there is drug manufacturing.

499
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,000
What about my father?

500
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,160
He should be there.

501
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,370
Are you sure?

502
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,200
Every day,

503
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,456
two Chinese people would prepare
two servings of Chinese food and send them

504
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,800
to the south factory building.

505
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,186
When can we get him out of there?

506
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,896
-Not yet.
-Why?

507
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,891
We need more information
and analysis about that building.

508
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,760
What kind of analysis?

509
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,696
Analysis about the building
and its walls,

510
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,256
because that building
has two security gates,

511
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,496
meaning there are two security
checkpoints,

512
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,466
and we don't know anything about it.

513
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:18,240
About the structure and the interior,
we know that.

514
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,656
The problem is,

515
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,360
the Isaia police can't find any more
information about the building.

516
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,850
Their surveillance tools and techniques
are too crude,

517
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,240
to penetrate the building's interior.

518
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,010
They fear going in blindly
might result in unnecessary casualties.

519
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,320
Hence the rescue is delayed.

520
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,240
Need anything, Captain Liang?

521
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,560
Mi Gu!

522
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,320
Mi Gu!

523
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,010
Your best friend's father
has been captured by a drug cartel?

524
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,856
How did you know?

525
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,880
You just posted the article
on your public account.

526
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,056
Get back to work.
I need to take a call.

527
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,120
Okay.

528
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,690
Xia Chu. I saw your article
on your public account.

529
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,720
I didn't post it.
Nor did I write it.

530
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,120
Then how did it appear
on your account?

531
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,290
I have no idea.

532
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,840
It's already had over
a hundred thousand views.

533
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,840
I really don't know.

534
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,576
Xia Chu,
I promised I'd keep it a secret.

535
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,896
I'd never compromise your privacy
and your father's safety,

536
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,410
just to get some views.

537
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,800
Please believe me.

538
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,520
I believe you.

539
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,570
I'm just worried about my father.

540
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,160
If this article
keeps propagating on the internet

541
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,560
and my father's captors see it,

542
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,520
his life may be in danger.

543
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,200
I'll delete it immediately.

544
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,360
Thanks.

545
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,160
You're sure you haven't told anyone
about this, right?

546
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,080
Except for Liang Mu Ze,
I haven't told a soul.

547
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,320
Then who could it be?

548
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,840
Not only is he privy to this, he's even
able to post using your public account.

549
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,970
What is this person trying
to accomplish?

550
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,370
Is this Mi Gu from Life FM?

551
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,760
Yes. May I know who's speaking?

552
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,450
Professor Xia Guang Yuan
of Dong'an University,

553
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,440
was kidnapped in Isaia.

554
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,083
I'm opening up my boundaries
to you.

555
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,300
From now on,

556
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,760
you'll be an administrator
of my public account.

557
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,920
If I'm not free,

558
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,480
you'll post on my behalf.

559
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:32,055
Sorry, the number
you've dialed is unavailable.

560
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,960
Please call again later.

561
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,776
Mi Gu, have a cup of coffee.

562
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,410
Thank you so much
for taking me to that fan's club event.

563
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,920
Don't mention it.

564
00:41:54,937 --> 00:41:55,776
By the way,

565
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,693
Mr. Zhuo has been mighty busy
with his clients.

566
00:41:57,778 --> 00:41:59,521
I'm not sure if he's coming
to the office today.

567
00:41:59,606 --> 00:42:01,200
Would you like to call him and ask?

568
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,680
I called him but he didn't answer.

569
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,360
Why don't I give it a try?

570
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,100
No thanks.

571
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,720
I'll just wait here.

572
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,000
Alright.
I'm off to lunch.

573
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,320
Would you like anything?

574
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,560
No thanks.

575
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:15,946
Patient's name?

576
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:16,960
Zhuo Ran.

577
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,330
Date of birth?

578
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,530
Hold on.

579
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,520
February 19, 1991.

580
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,736
On December 25, 2009, in a joint effort
between the army and the police,

581
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,976
a drug dealer, who assaulted a boy,

582
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,520
who had just turned 18 the prior week...

583
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,360
2009.

584
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,970
December 25.

585
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,920
Turned 18 a week prior.

586
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,880
Take it back.

587
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,760
Is this yours?

588
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,200
What are you trying to do
carrying a gun around?

589
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,440
It's fake.

590
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,130
It's just a toy.
