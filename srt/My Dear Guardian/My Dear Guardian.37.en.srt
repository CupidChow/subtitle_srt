=My Dear Guardian=

2
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,080
=Episode 37=

3
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,610
Are you feeling better?

4
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:54,333
I'm fine.

5
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:57,293
Thank you.

6
00:02:15,793 --> 00:02:17,333
Why were you shot?

7
00:02:19,523 --> 00:02:21,533
Someone held me hostage with a gun.

8
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:24,653
I escaped after I got changed.

9
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,604
Why didn't you report to the police?

10
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:28,603
I was afraid that they might seek revenge.

11
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:30,302
Zhuo Ran.

12
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,703
For how long was I asleep?

13
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:38,928
You were not sleeping.

14
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,141
You kept talking nonsense.

15
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:51,297
What did I say?

16
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:55,093
I couldn't hear it clearly.

17
00:03:00,273 --> 00:03:01,803
I'm heading out.

18
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:04,479
Where are you going?

19
00:03:07,393 --> 00:03:08,640
I need a computer.

20
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,852
Now?

21
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:11,696
It's about work.

22
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:13,389
I need to contact someone.

23
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:15,861
Where is your hand-phone?

24
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,163
Can't you do it with a hand-phone?

25
00:03:19,553 --> 00:03:21,427
I lost my phone when I was on my way here.

26
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:23,413
Fortunately, I remember your phone number.

27
00:03:29,313 --> 00:03:31,377
I've a laptop at home.
I'll get it for you.

28
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:32,662
No need.

29
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:35,315
You're injured. Will you stay at home?

30
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:42,821
Will I put you in trouble?

31
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:46,128
Now only you're worried about it.

32
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:49,184
Why did you mess with me then?

33
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:52,013
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:02,583
Liang Mu Ze is out of the ICU.

35
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:03,993
He's just been transferred to
the Department of Infectious Disease.

36
00:04:04,073 --> 00:04:05,173
Do you know that?

37
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,013
Yes.

38
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:11,698
Dr Liu told me that...

39
00:04:12,963 --> 00:04:17,093
you injected bacteriophage
into him without permission.

40
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,733
Do you have anything to say about that?

41
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,293
I've violated the hospital rule.

42
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:27,703
I'm willing to face the consequences.

43
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:32,304
Even if you have to risk
losing your practising licence...

44
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:35,704
and end your career from now on?

45
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:38,923
Yes.

46
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:45,743
No regrets?

47
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:50,032
No doubt I feel sorry...

48
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:52,422
as my behaviour
has put everyone in trouble.

49
00:04:52,812 --> 00:04:55,988
However, under the circumstances,
I would do it no matter what.

50
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:57,436
What if it fails?

51
00:04:57,516 --> 00:05:01,038
The right thing can't be determined
by success or failure.

52
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,090
Right is right.

53
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:06,663
Right is right.

54
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:09,719
All right.

55
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:11,859
Let me ask you another question.

56
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:14,962
If the patient was someone else,

57
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:18,327
would you be so obsessed
with the so-called right decision?

58
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,844
It's a shame that Liu Ran
is no longer here.

59
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,305
Otherwise,

60
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:32,693
I would answer the question with action.

61
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,301
Xia Chu, I requested to see you
for two things.

62
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,047
First, regarding to your behaviour,

63
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,106
the hospital committee...

64
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:46,897
decided to circulate a letter of criticism
against you.

65
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:48,338
It's considered a serious demerit.

66
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:50,819
Do you have anything to say?

67
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:53,933
Okay. Second,

68
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:58,306
Brigade Commander Dong specially
expressed his gratitude for your work.

69
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:00,710
After a discussion
in the department meeting,

70
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,770
it's decided that...

71
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:05,932
you'll be the next chief resident.

72
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,824
So, you...

73
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:11,539
You don't have to remove your white robe.

74
00:06:22,393 --> 00:06:24,566
However, bear it in mind.

75
00:06:25,443 --> 00:06:26,983
In the hospital,

76
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:32,072
each system that seems negligible
is slowly formed...

77
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:33,693
at the cost of life, blood and tears.

78
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:36,053
System...

79
00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:40,773
may not promote the greatest kindness
but it can avoid...

80
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:43,770
the least evilness.

81
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,951
Xia Chu.

82
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,835
You're a doctor,

83
00:06:49,673 --> 00:06:50,973
not a hero.

84
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:55,411
Got it.

85
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,791
The supervisor told me that...

86
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,682
you decided not to run for
Chief Resident.

87
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:38,775
Yes.

88
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:40,346
Is it because of me?

89
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:42,652
Do you need me to let you win?

90
00:07:42,732 --> 00:07:43,881
No.

91
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:46,603
Hence, my withdrawal
has nothing to do with you.

92
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:48,861
It's because I've another career plan.

93
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,909
What career plan?

94
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:53,034
Take a guess.

95
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:55,991
You're such a strange person.

96
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:03,891
Thank you.

97
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:07,920
I take back my assumption about you.

98
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,537
No doubt I didn't do a good job
when I was trying to rescue Liang Mu Ze.

99
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:15,119
However, I have to say that that's me.

100
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,777
Your rationality will ensure that
you have a smooth journey.

101
00:08:17,857 --> 00:08:20,442
My emotion will bring me far.

102
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,614
I can't be you
and you'll never replace me.

103
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:26,682
What do you say?

104
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:33,886
I have to answer the call.

105
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:38,582
Yes, I am. Who is speaking?

106
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,654
Sure, I'll come now.

107
00:08:43,665 --> 00:08:44,695
I have to go.

108
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,855
Excuse me, may I know
where the interrogation room is?

109
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:01,573
-Go straight and turn right.
-Thank you.

110
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:09,213
Mi Gu.

111
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,583
Are you okay?

112
00:09:15,113 --> 00:09:16,460
Rao Zhi.

113
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,177
Can I take my friend with me?

114
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,246
Dr Xia.

115
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:21,140
I heard from Brigade Commander Dong...

116
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,636
that Mu Ze's wound is severely infected.

117
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:26,293
Yes.

118
00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:29,285
However, he finally made it.

119
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:31,700
He's doing okay now. Don't worry.

120
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,194
I just want to let you know that...

121
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,932
on the dagger that injured Mu Ze
and his clothes,

122
00:09:37,012 --> 00:09:39,685
we found a huge amount
of Acinetobacter baumannii.

123
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:44,552
I think it's not an accidental infection.

124
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:50,863
Got it.

125
00:09:53,332 --> 00:09:54,441
Be careful.

126
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,919
They kept asking me about
my relationship with him...

127
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,132
and his whereabouts.

128
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:29,862
How did you answer?

129
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:34,330
I told them the truth.

130
00:10:36,923 --> 00:10:38,133
However, I feel that...

131
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:43,926
I've put him in trouble.

132
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,401
Ever heard of the
Acinetobacter baumannii bacteria?

133
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:08,237
On Liang Mu Ze's clothes,
the same bacteria was detected.

134
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:11,661
The person who stabbed Liang Mu Ze
was Zhuo Ran's accomplice.

135
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:14,403
They barged into the drill site
and held me hostage.

136
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:18,115
All thanks to him,
Liang Mu Ze and I almost lost our lives.

137
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:19,552
Have you thought about it?

138
00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:23,986
What kind of person came out with
the idea to use a weapon like that?

139
00:11:24,793 --> 00:11:27,760
Not only he intended to kill a person,
obviously he enjoys torturing others.

140
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,166
He's so cruel and inhumane.

141
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:32,983
Who is he?

142
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:35,785
I don't know him.

143
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:38,967
Perhaps I've never known him.

144
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:49,157
Think about it.

145
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:52,663
Why would he
let you leave to get the laptop?

146
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:57,257
I offered to help.

147
00:11:57,655 --> 00:11:58,944
How about taking care of him?

148
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:00,909
Did you offer to take care of him too?

149
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:04,833
He knew that you wouldn't turn him down.

150
00:12:04,913 --> 00:12:05,825
He trusts me.

151
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:07,060
He did that on purpose!

152
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:09,897
Once he's missing,
the police will come after you...

153
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:12,167
and put you under scrutiny..

154
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:14,086
No way he doesn't know
about the current situation.

155
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,697
Why did he choose to do that?

156
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,459
Why did he let you
look for a computer for him?

157
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:21,640
That's because through you,
he could confirm the police's next step.

158
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,713
He was trying to verify his own safety
by putting you in danger.

159
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:28,521
If you don't go back by today,
he will run away immediately.

160
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:31,010
He doesn't care about you.
Do you believe that?

161
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:33,513
Even if you go back today,

162
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:36,120
the only thing that he cares about
is the current situation...

163
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,921
and whether the police
follow you in secret.

164
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:41,718
He's determined to drag you into it
so that you will do things for him.

165
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:43,610
He knows your love for him too well.

166
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,436
From the beginning,
he's been using you and deceiving you!

167
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,660
Say no more!

168
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:58,668
I've thought about...

169
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,233
everything that you just said.

170
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,443
I'm so stupid.

171
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:20,439
Mi Gu.

172
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,561
You've made the right choice.

173
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:47,533
You're back.

174
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:05,354
Take the laptop.

175
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:10,292
What took you so long?

176
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:14,659
The traffic on the highway was terrible.

177
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:16,475
Or else, I'd be back a long time ago.

178
00:15:19,413 --> 00:15:20,824
Did you run into anyone?

179
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:23,327
No.

180
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:24,973
Who would I run into?

181
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:32,183
I was worried that, just like last time,
you got abducted by crazy fans again.

182
00:15:36,713 --> 00:15:37,919
If I got abducted again,

183
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:40,595
would you save me?

184
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:44,072
Or would you run away?

185
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,912
I would run away for sure.

186
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:52,192
I don't believe that.

187
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:56,094
You would save me for sure.

188
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:57,788
Then why did you ask me?

189
00:16:05,843 --> 00:16:07,406
I bought two bowls of porridge.

190
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:09,018
Eat up.

191
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:10,701
It'll go cold soon.

192
00:16:17,702 --> 00:16:19,009
Where is yours?

193
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:20,270
Mine...

194
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,781
The waiter passed it
to the deliverer by mistake.

195
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:25,983
I didn't want you to wait.

196
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:27,655
That's why I brought yours back first.

197
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,569
I'll get mine later.

198
00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:39,713
Is it delicious?

199
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,051
Yes.

200
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:43,131
I prefer your cooking.

201
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:52,056
Zhuo Ran.

202
00:16:56,712 --> 00:16:58,475
Are you the only son?

203
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:02,979
Yes.

204
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:04,322
What's wrong?

205
00:17:06,822 --> 00:17:07,937
Nothing.

206
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:11,637
You're mature and stable.

207
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:15,962
You behave as if you had siblings.

208
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:25,602
Actually...

209
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:31,842
What?

210
00:17:39,662 --> 00:17:41,164
This is the key for this place.

211
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:42,702
Keep one with you.

212
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:44,317
It's easier for you to come in.

213
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:06,267
I'm going to pick up the porridge.

214
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:07,910
It's their fault.

215
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,482
Let them deliver to you.

216
00:18:11,102 --> 00:18:12,671
It's not far anyway.

217
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,606
I need to go to the supermarket
to get some kitchen utensils.

218
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:20,876
I'll cook for you tomorrow.

219
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:37,272
Have I ever told you you're like my mum?

220
00:18:40,378 --> 00:18:42,130
If I can escape this time,

221
00:18:43,713 --> 00:18:45,333
I'll meet you up with her.

222
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,407
She will surely like you.

223
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,122
I'll meet your mum with you.

224
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:31,697
The goods have been received.

225
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:33,380
Wait for the wind.

226
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:01,902
Rao Zhi.

227
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:03,337
Scary Pirate has logged in.

228
00:21:40,285 --> 00:21:41,288
Don't move!

229
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:42,595
Don't move!

230
00:21:59,512 --> 00:22:00,402
Take him back.

231
00:23:17,902 --> 00:23:19,242
We meet again.

232
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:24,918
Lack of sustainable momentum.

233
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:26,668
Who are you referring to?

234
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:29,861
Me.

235
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:30,910
Fine.

236
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:32,972
Let's talk about it.

237
00:23:34,352 --> 00:23:35,539
What should I say?

238
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:38,709
Ever since you're missing in action,
we have kept a close watch on Mi Gu.

239
00:23:39,644 --> 00:23:41,080
You've worked hard.

240
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:44,054
You logged in with Scary Pirate's ID.

241
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:46,022
What do you plan to do next?

242
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:48,047
Why don't you take a guess?

243
00:23:54,742 --> 00:23:58,209
Have you ever counted the victims
on the City of Desire?

244
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:08,902
I know.

245
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:11,672
Once I'm arrested,
I won't be able to escape.

246
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,579
I'm doomed.

247
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:15,700
I failed miserably
in a very simple mission.

248
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,696
I admit that I was careless.

249
00:24:21,022 --> 00:24:22,924
However, on the journey to the afterlife,

250
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,084
I'm sure someone will keep me company.

251
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,658
I won't be lonely.

252
00:24:33,382 --> 00:24:35,501
You're afraid of being lonely.

253
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,598
Perhaps you don't know this.

254
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:42,633
I can tell you
Liang Mu Ze is out of danger.

255
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:44,867
He was saved by Dr Xia Chu.

256
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:57,037
What about Tian Yong?

257
00:24:57,117 --> 00:24:58,471
Where is Tian Yong?

258
00:24:58,551 --> 00:25:00,769
Is he still at Old Master's mansion?

259
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:02,012
How well do you know Old Master?

260
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:03,773
I'm asking you a question.

261
00:25:04,181 --> 00:25:05,559
Ask away.

262
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:09,166
You barged into the drill site
because of Xia Chu, right?

263
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:11,549
Yes and no.

264
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:12,855
Who gave you the instruction?

265
00:25:12,935 --> 00:25:14,226
Was it Old Master?

266
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:16,217
Do you want me to identify Old Master?

267
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:18,494
He aims to threaten
Professor Xia Guang Yuan...

268
00:25:18,574 --> 00:25:20,522
through Xia Chu, right?

269
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,790
Who is he?

270
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,640
What is the deal between both of you?

271
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,847
What deal?

272
00:25:24,927 --> 00:25:26,392
How did you contact him?

273
00:25:26,472 --> 00:25:28,182
How did you pass things to him?

274
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:33,602
If I tell you the truth,
will you let go of me?

275
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:38,812
Are you playing with fire?

276
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,191
If I don't play with fire,

277
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:42,328
I'll be grilled instead.

278
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:51,068
I'm curious.

279
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,151
If Tian Yong is dead,

280
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:55,691
will you be upset?

281
00:25:57,142 --> 00:25:58,478
Especially Liang Mu Ze.

282
00:25:59,021 --> 00:26:00,097
Will he be upset?

283
00:26:17,622 --> 00:26:18,933
If your best friend died,

284
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:22,227
what would you feel?

285
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:24,239
You've experienced it.

286
00:26:24,802 --> 00:26:26,513
You should know better.

287
00:26:30,192 --> 00:26:31,592
It's been eight years...

288
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:35,642
yet you haven't figured out
who is actually grilling you on fire.

289
00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:32,937
Dolphin.

290
00:27:33,017 --> 00:27:34,669
This is Camel.

291
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:37,427
Team One is already at the raiding spot.

292
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:40,641
The other teams, report in sequence.

293
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:42,392
Team Two is in place.

294
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,202
You should know the consequences.

295
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:08,995
Boss.

296
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:12,322
What do you mean?

297
00:28:16,742 --> 00:28:18,910
The Vietnamese will be here soon
to examine the goods.

298
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,269
We are ten percent short.

299
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:23,018
What should I do?

300
00:28:23,098 --> 00:28:25,417
It has nothing to do with me.

301
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:27,871
You're the mastermind.

302
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:30,523
I did everything
according to your instructions.

303
00:28:31,363 --> 00:28:32,793
It's nothing to do with me.

304
00:28:33,806 --> 00:28:35,308
Team Three, come now.

305
00:28:35,388 --> 00:28:36,686
I got bitten by the tongue just now.

306
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:37,904
Got bitten by the tongue?

307
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:39,598
Hurry up, everyone is waiting for you.

308
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:41,358
You know which tongue I meant.

309
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,880
Attention, everyone.
Take cover while moving.

310
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,858
We still have some time. Stay calm.

311
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:52,526
This is Camel.

312
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:53,892
We've reached the raiding spot.

313
00:28:53,972 --> 00:28:55,666
Can we launch the attack?

314
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:57,524
You may launch the attack now.

315
00:28:57,604 --> 00:28:59,081
Camel received the message.

316
00:28:59,353 --> 00:29:00,262
Everyone,

317
00:29:00,342 --> 00:29:02,863
get rid of the respective enemy
in front of you.

318
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:06,052
The person who is in charge of blasting,
check the equipment.

319
00:29:06,132 --> 00:29:07,539
Listen to the command.

320
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,002
We're brothers.

321
00:29:15,062 --> 00:29:16,675
Don't push my limit.

322
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:18,677
As long as you return the goods,

323
00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:21,732
I'll pretend nothing has happened.

324
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:24,753
You may leave after that
while I'll get busy with my own thing.

325
00:29:25,317 --> 00:29:28,722
When you need my help moving forward,
just let me know.

326
00:29:31,474 --> 00:29:32,496
Dad?

327
00:29:32,576 --> 00:29:33,705
Son.

328
00:29:36,702 --> 00:29:38,323
What do you mean?

329
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:40,383
I didn't take the goods.

330
00:29:58,582 --> 00:30:00,826
Let me ask you one last time.

331
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,831
Where are the goods?

332
00:30:02,911 --> 00:30:04,366
I don't know.

333
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:06,234
I don't know.

334
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:13,962
I really don't know.

335
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:15,890
Don't blame me for being merciless.

336
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,450
No!

337
00:30:26,315 --> 00:30:27,706
Get ready.

338
00:30:31,382 --> 00:30:33,026
Team Two is ready to break in.

339
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:41,069
Attack!

340
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,282
Stop them!

341
00:31:19,142 --> 00:31:21,042
Put down the weapon and stop fighting.

342
00:31:24,742 --> 00:31:26,011
Back down.

343
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:56,013
Jerk!

344
00:32:10,632 --> 00:32:11,748
Son!

345
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:13,430
Leave!

346
00:32:18,182 --> 00:32:19,483
Hide!

347
00:32:23,147 --> 00:32:24,176
Come back!

348
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,075
Captain!

349
00:35:41,382 --> 00:35:43,692
Something was shot! Doctor!

350
00:35:43,782 --> 00:35:45,128
Captain.

351
00:35:48,622 --> 00:35:50,110
Hang in there! It's okay.

352
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:52,831
Mu Ze.

353
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,930
When Meng Zhen gives birth to the baby,

354
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:05,184
don't forget to tell me.

355
00:36:05,592 --> 00:36:07,394
See it for yourself, Captain!

356
00:36:07,818 --> 00:36:10,351
Captain!

357
00:36:11,092 --> 00:36:13,873
Luo Liang!

358
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:09,653
Back then,
we destroyed the drug laboratory.

359
00:37:10,982 --> 00:37:15,242
However, the culprit who provided the
fund and manufactured the drugs escaped.

360
00:37:15,322 --> 00:37:16,978
His hands were full of blood.

361
00:37:17,058 --> 00:37:18,752
Not only did he kill our people,

362
00:37:18,832 --> 00:37:22,722
he also killed your dad,
Pei Yong Yan and Zhuo Ran.

363
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:25,176
That's not right.

364
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:27,332
That's not right.

365
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,780
You came back here in Zhuo Ran's name.

366
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,703
Besides approaching Xia Chu
to obtain research information...

367
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:33,990
from Professor Xia Guang Yuan,

368
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,934
you also want to
avenge your father and brother.

369
00:37:36,014 --> 00:37:39,430
Over and over again,
you targeted Liang Mu Ze.

370
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,852
You tried to murder him!

371
00:37:40,932 --> 00:37:43,286
However, do you know
you're assisting your enemy...

372
00:37:43,366 --> 00:37:44,506
by doing all the evil deeds?

373
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:45,670
Do you know that your father...

374
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,219
and your brother died with their
eyes wide open?

375
00:37:49,382 --> 00:37:50,469
Tell me.

376
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:52,495
Who gave you the instructions?

377
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:53,882
You're lying!

378
00:37:53,962 --> 00:37:55,018
Was it Old Master?

379
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:56,711
Did you kill him?

380
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:03,971
He's Lu Wen Long,
the wanted person who has been on the run.

381
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,724
Am I right, Pei Yu?

382
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,279
I'm not at fault!

383
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:09,600
I'm not at fault!

384
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,304
I want to kill Liang Mu Ze!

385
00:38:11,384 --> 00:38:12,475
Bring him out.

386
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:14,448
I want to kill him!

387
00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:16,227
I want to kill him!

388
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:18,898
I'm not at fault! Don't leave!

389
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:20,617
Bring him here!

390
00:38:20,697 --> 00:38:22,359
I want to kill him!

391
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:25,072
I want to kill him!

392
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:28,626
I want to kill him!

393
00:38:49,342 --> 00:38:50,391
Captain.

394
00:38:52,822 --> 00:38:53,672
Take a seat.

395
00:39:05,062 --> 00:39:08,122
I remember we competed in shooting,

396
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:13,514
driving, combat, table tennis,

397
00:39:13,594 --> 00:39:15,174
and basketball. Am I right?

398
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:16,287
Yes.

399
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:18,908
We haven't competed
in eating dumplings, right?

400
00:39:18,988 --> 00:39:20,144
What?

401
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:24,540
I made it.

402
00:39:26,262 --> 00:39:27,798
Let's see who can finish it first.

403
00:39:28,429 --> 00:39:29,641
What's the point?

404
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,030
Let's begin!

405
00:39:56,182 --> 00:39:57,709
What is the occasion?

406
00:39:57,789 --> 00:39:59,508
Why are we having a dumpling
eating competition?

407
00:39:59,588 --> 00:40:01,105
Steamed buns to welcome the new,

408
00:40:02,222 --> 00:40:03,659
dumplings to see off the old.

409
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:06,085
Mu Ze.

410
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,523
I have to go.

411
00:40:20,032 --> 00:40:21,355
Didn't you promise...

412
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:25,376
to be my rival forever?

413
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:32,419
Your rival is not me.

414
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:37,477
It's your ego...

415
00:40:38,596 --> 00:40:40,381
and endless guilt.

416
00:40:45,022 --> 00:40:46,256
It's been eight years.

417
00:40:47,462 --> 00:40:49,211
It's enough to make up for everything.

418
00:40:51,832 --> 00:40:53,089
It's been eight years.

419
00:40:56,302 --> 00:40:57,440
Captain.

420
00:40:58,822 --> 00:41:00,629
I can't fall asleep every day.

421
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:02,203
The moment I close my eyes,

422
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:05,531
I can see the nightmare.

423
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,127
Those birds,

424
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,176
crushed stones and bullets...

425
00:41:13,063 --> 00:41:14,532
I can see them clearly.

426
00:41:17,382 --> 00:41:18,879
However, they're not real.

427
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:23,319
I've been asking myself...

428
00:41:25,422 --> 00:41:26,796
where did my captain go?

429
00:41:27,638 --> 00:41:28,859
Where is Luo Liang?

430
00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:31,880
If it weren't because of me,

431
00:41:34,822 --> 00:41:36,877
you could watch Xiao Jun grow up.

432
00:41:39,152 --> 00:41:40,922
You could grow old with Meng Zhen.

433
00:41:43,552 --> 00:41:45,802
Whenever I see them,

434
00:41:49,142 --> 00:41:50,638
I feel as if I'm a sinner.

435
00:41:52,942 --> 00:41:54,322
I trained hard.

436
00:41:55,502 --> 00:41:57,015
I locked my heart away.

437
00:41:58,842 --> 00:42:01,547
When I'm not in the military camp,
I never open up to anyone.

438
00:42:02,223 --> 00:42:04,063
I worry that
I may put someone else in trouble.

439
00:42:04,637 --> 00:42:06,554
Sometimes, I'm cold to my parents.

440
00:42:08,992 --> 00:42:11,614
I hope that
I could be an unpleasant son.

441
00:42:14,982 --> 00:42:17,181
If something happened to me one day soon,

442
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:20,019
or if I sacrificed in a mission,

443
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:22,414
they would only remember
the worst thing about me.

444
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:26,186
I don't want them
to remember the good side of me.

445
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,482
In that case,

446
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:33,122
will they feel less sad?

447
00:42:39,552 --> 00:42:40,999
I've thought too much.

448
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:45,004
I've thought about so many things.
However, it's useless.

449
00:42:45,084 --> 00:42:46,239
It's not enough.

450
00:42:49,742 --> 00:42:51,482
I know that
it's been eight years, Captain.

451
00:42:56,262 --> 00:42:58,262
I'm so afraid something bad
would happen to others.

452
00:43:00,032 --> 00:43:01,842
I would rather sacrifice myself.

453
00:43:05,662 --> 00:43:06,908
I mean it.

454
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:10,202
You won't die, Mu Ze.

455
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:14,635
You have someone in your heart.

456
00:43:16,582 --> 00:43:17,704
Xia Chu.

457
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,710
She's your soft spot...

458
00:43:21,695 --> 00:43:24,153
and at the same time, she's your armour.

459
00:43:27,462 --> 00:43:30,690
She'll make you a braver person for sure.

460
00:43:31,265 --> 00:43:32,281
Am I right?

461
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:37,317
I gave you my back.

462
00:43:38,494 --> 00:43:40,563
I took that bullet for you.

463
00:43:42,182 --> 00:43:44,271
I hope that...

464
00:43:44,351 --> 00:43:47,371
you can fight
like a real military officer.

465
00:43:49,643 --> 00:43:51,777
You're the sharpest knife in Team Thunder.

466
00:43:51,857 --> 00:43:53,274
You're the sharpest.

467
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,236
You need to find the right direction.

468
00:43:57,113 --> 00:43:58,731
It's time to unleash yourself, lad.

469
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,631
Mu Ze, bear it in mind.

470
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:10,726
Don't let your lover down.

471
00:44:18,342 --> 00:44:19,692
I have to go.

472
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:04,760
Son.

473
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:07,234
Finally you're awake.

474
00:45:09,752 --> 00:45:11,977
You make us so worried!

475
00:45:12,057 --> 00:45:13,735
My dear son.

476
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,591
Slow down.

477
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:19,655
You almost scared me to death!

478
00:45:20,478 --> 00:45:21,474
Enough.

479
00:45:21,554 --> 00:45:22,744
He's awake.

480
00:45:22,824 --> 00:45:23,871
Stop crying.

481
00:45:23,951 --> 00:45:25,149
Here.

482
00:45:29,262 --> 00:45:30,502
Mum.

483
00:45:50,102 --> 00:45:51,205
Braised Egg.

484
00:45:52,073 --> 00:45:54,004
Each story has an ending.

485
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:57,769
The ending of my story is you.

486
00:45:58,871 --> 00:46:00,042
Da Miao...

487
00:46:01,302 --> 00:46:02,648
Son.

488
00:46:02,728 --> 00:46:04,754
The Brigade Commander
wants me to tell you...

489
00:46:04,834 --> 00:46:07,606
the investigation
against Xia Chu's dad has ended.

490
00:46:07,686 --> 00:46:10,003
He's not involved in the matter.

491
00:46:10,364 --> 00:46:13,542
He's approved your love report.
