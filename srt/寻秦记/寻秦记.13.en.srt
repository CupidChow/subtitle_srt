1
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,880
Godfather, goddaughter-in-law is about to get married and leave as an envoy

2
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,000
In order to fear that Zhao Mu has a conspiracy

3
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,600
So I have my godfather take care of Pan'er on my behalf.

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,120
By the way, Zhao Kuo entrusted Pan'er to me

5
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,120
He is my godson. When he went to war,

6
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:04,440
He couldn't come with me, so he died in battle

7
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,040
Now only you, mother and son, are left

8
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,040
I have been guarding the border all year round

9
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,240
Not taking good care of my grandson

10
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,520
It’s rare to return to Handan this time

11
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,600
I must make good compensation

12
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,160
Godfather’s words are serious

13
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,080
Wife, be careful on the road

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,640
Pan'er is taken care of by my husband, so you can rest assured on the road.

15
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,320
My goddaughter-in-law thanked her godfather

16
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,000
General Li, Mrs.

17
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,920
Juluhou

18
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,120
The Marquis has arrived, but what's the important matter?

19
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,000
Why is Madam so outspoken?

20
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
Madam is about to get married and leave as an envoy

21
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,000
I know that my wife loves you the most

22
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,720
The one who worries the most is Pan'er

23
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,080
In order to make my wife feel at ease, I went on a mission

24
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,160
I came here specially to pick Paner up and stay at my mansion for a few days.

25
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,600
Very convenient to take care of

26
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,560
Mr. Hou is really concerned about me. I would like to thank you for this.

27
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,520
Madam, you're welcome

28
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,720
Now it seems that someone has already done it for me

29
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,480
I'm afraid I'm already a step too late

30
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,720
It is rare for me to return to Handan from the border

31
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,760
I want to take this opportunity to spend some family time with my godson

32
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,720
Do you also want to argue with me?

33
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,240
I don’t dare, it’s a great reunion between grandpa and grandson

34
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,480
Madam is really thoughtful

35
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,640
The Nu family just doesn’t want Master Hou to worry about Pan’er

36
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,840
The wizard said that this is a good time to get married.

37
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,400
The beginning of Chenshi is the time to worship heaven and earth and ancestors.

38
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,760
Follow the wizard and pray for you

39
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,880
You have to stand in this dress for one more hour

40
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,760
This pair was given to you by your aunt

41
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,480
And Mrs. Chu gave you this set

42
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,160
This set was specially made by Queen Jing.

43
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,640
Which set do you like?

44
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,720
Aunt, you make the decision

45
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,000
All the princes and princes gave many gifts to the princess.

46
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,240
I don’t know that the princess wants to take them all to the Kingdom of Wei

47
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,960
Or choose the dowry you like?

48
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,840
Auntie makes the decision

49
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,200
You are not allowed to eat when the sacrifice begins

50
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,760
It's better to prepare breakfast for the princess first

51
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,840
Brother Wang, the princess comes to say goodbye to you

52
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,760
Wang'er, you have grown up

53
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,840
When you get married, you must serve your husband well.

54
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,640
Sister Wang, please take care of the princess on the way.

55
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,000
Brother Wang, don’t worry, Xiaoya will try her best to take care of the princess

56
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,520
Sister Qian, take care of yourself

57
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,520
Thank you, Your Majesty, for allowing the wife, mother and child to

58
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,840
Return to Wei Province to gather family and friends

59
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,320
Mrs. Pingyuan, please return to the Kingdom of Wei

60
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,000
Remember to say hello to your brother, Mr. Xinling, on behalf of the widow.

61
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,720
Yes, Your Majesty

62
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,960
Your Majesty, the auspicious time to get married has arrived

63
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,240
Father, please send you out

64
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,000
Madam, this wedding is a long way from home

65
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,080
Madam, please take care

66
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,680
Thank you Mr. Hou for your concern

67
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,000
Madam, this mission is of great importance and there is no room for failure.

68
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,680
But remember to bring the treasure back

69
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,160
To ensure the safety of Xiaopan’s life

70
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,960
Xiaopan is taken care of by grandpa, so there is no need for the marquis to worry about it.

71
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,120
It turns out Madam doesn’t know yet

72
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,800
General Li has received the King's Tiger Talisman this morning

73
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,400
Immediately ordered to set off for the border, Madam, you can rest assured

74
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,800
I will take good care of Xiaopan

75
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,880
you…

76
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,400
Madam, remember, you must make a prompt decision after the matter is done.

77
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,600
Cutting off the roots, I don’t want to see Xiang Shaolong again

78
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,680
Princess, are you tired after a long journey?

79
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,880
Come and eat

80
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,680
You didn't eat this morning. You must be hungry. Come here.

81
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,960
there are many things to eat

82
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,080
Princess, it’s a long way to go to Daliang City in Wei State.

83
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,800
If you don't eat, you might fall ill

84
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,760
If the princess doesn't like eating meat, eat rice

85
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,600
I asked the cook to make some pastries and rice porridge for you to eat

86
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,240
No need, aunt, Qian'er doesn't want to eat it

87
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,600
Are you patrolling over there...

88
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,640
General Xiang, why are you sighing?

89
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,160
Are you reluctant to let the princess marry to Wei?

90
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,560
I feel it deeply now

91
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
When people are in the arena, they can’t help themselves.

92
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,360
The princess doesn’t want to get married, and I don’t want to get married

93
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,720
I'm afraid Madam was also forced to do so.

94
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,440
Born as a princess, she is destined to have no control over her life.

95
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,320
How is the princess?

96
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,160
She's fine, but she's eaten very little today

97
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,680
After a long journey, I'm afraid she won't be able to bear it and will fall ill.

98
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,600
Then I'll go see her

99
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,640
You must not go if she knows you are marrying a general

100
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,480
She will definitely be sad

101
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,080
It will definitely be a big hit

102
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,800
I advise you not to disturb her mood

103
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,520
Otherwise, it will be more and more troublesome

104
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,080
What a good couple

105
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
What did you say?

106
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,160
Fornication and tryst in full public view

107
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,560
Error 504 (Server Error)!!1504.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

108
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,200
What is lawless? You are the lawless one

109
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,400
Walking out on your own without my permission

110
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,920
Do you believe that I took you back to your room?

111
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,720
You were caught in an affair, and you want to take revenge.

112
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,760
What did you say?

113
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,040
Selfless and selfish, everyone knows that Zhao Ya is a prostitute

114
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,080
Mr. Shao Yuan, you have gone too far.

115
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,520
I, Mr. Shao Yuan, will not be afraid of you adulterers and adulterers.

116
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,360
You dare to hit me?

117
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,800
What's the problem?

118
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,480
Once you enter Daliang City, you will know

119
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,000
I will definitely ask my uncle to teach you a lesson

120
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,200
Mr. Xinling? I'm never scared

121
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,120
Shaolong

122
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,120
This person is so arrogant

123
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,480
I must teach him a lesson, someone is here

124
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,200
Catch him, I won't interrogate him until tomorrow

125
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,760
Do you dare?

126
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,280
stop

127
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,280
Let go

128
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,800
lady of plains

129
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,080
daughter

130
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,920
Madam Ya, what crime did I, De'er, commit?

131
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,480
He went out without my permission and showed no military discipline.

132
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,880
And if you are drunk and talking nonsense, is it a crime?

133
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,040
General Xiang, my wife has no way to teach her son.

134
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,880
If the general wants to punish the child

135
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,200
Then even this lady should be punished too.

136
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,280
My father Pingyuan Jun served as prime minister for three times

137
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,640
At that time, Handan City was besieged by the Qin army.

138
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,640
If my mother hadn’t sent letters to Wei Guo many times,

139
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,640
Asking my uncle to send troops to help

140
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,440
Handan City has long been occupied by the Qin State

141
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,480
How dare you be so rude to Zhao Guo’s great benefactor?

142
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,720
De'er, if you are kind to others, you don't have to say it all day long.

143
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,440
Mom always teaches you to be humble and tolerant.

144
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,600
Did you hear what your mother said?

145
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,840
Your mother is here and you are so arrogant

146
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,960
I will give her face and let you go today

147
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,640
General Xiang, thank you for being open-minded.

148
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,560
Mother, why are you so polite to them?

149
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,360
It's simply that this pair of dogs and men are not right.

150
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Shut up, De'er, why don't you go back to your room with me?

151
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,760
This Mrs. Pingyuan is really not simple

152
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,880
Very cheap... Come and take a look, it's a little cheaper

153
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,320
Are there any hotels nearby?

154
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,440
Over there…

155
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,480
Thanks

156
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,080
Go, hinder us from doing business

157
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,600
Let's go, don't hold me back

158
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,640
You give me a jar of wine on credit and I will definitely pay it back tomorrow

159
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,800
On credit... I can give you urine on credit

160
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,160
If you don't leave, I'll beat you to death. Let's go.

161
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,800
hinder us from doing business

162
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,320
There is wine for sale

163
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,520
Please come in and sit wherever you like…

164
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,440
Thank you, you stand, you will not check out today

165
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,160
Don't even think about stepping into our inn.

166
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,840
I just want my baggage back

167
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,040
How many days do you owe our store rent?

168
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,040
Even if you take your luggage, it won't be enough to pay it off.

169
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,360
Don’t you have to pay back the money you owe me?

170
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,240
Even though my hand is lame, I still feel shameless

171
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,320
The money I owe you will definitely be paid back.

172
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,040
You only have one life left, so pay with your life.

173
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,560
There is something valuable

174
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,600
Bring it...

175
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,920
stop

176
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,400
Brother Lian, drinking too much wine on an empty stomach is useless.

177
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,440
Let's eat something first

178
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,080
Wine is so good

179
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,480
You need it when you are happy, you also need it when you are unhappy

180
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,080
Don't drink too much alcohol, otherwise it will harm your health

181
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,760
I am now a useless person

182
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,280
What else can I do besides drink?

183
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,640
Fang'er, you are now married to Xiang Shaolong

184
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,760
Why are you traveling alone?

185
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,120
Fang'er doesn't want to get married yet

186
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,360
I want to travel around and see a lot of things

187
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,160
Fang'er has always been willful and willful

188
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,000
Today you and I can meet in a different place

189
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,040
I should be happy, but it's a pity that I am now...

190
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,640
Even brother, don’t say that

191
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,400
Fang'er and Brother Lian will always be good friends

192
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,520
Do you still consider me a friend?

193
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,880
certainly

194
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,840
It's a pity that I am already a useless person who is worse than a beggar.

195
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,120
I really would rather die than live

196
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,320
Brother Lian, you can be a cripple but not a cripple.

197
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,000
Do you still remember Sun Bin, the famous general of Qi State?

198
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,480
Although he was framed by his fellow disciples

199
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,680
Cutting off both legs makes it impossible to walk

200
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,440
But he still sat in the chariot and commanded the army to fight

201
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,920
Become a military advisor with repeated military exploits

202
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,280
You can also build a reputation in the same way.

203
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,880
Of course the world

204
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,000
It is impossible for everyone to have extraordinary wisdom and courage.

205
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,720
But as long as you stay safe

206
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,240
Even if you are a farmer in a remote area

207
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,480
You can still live happily

208
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,240
Better than giving up on yourself

209
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,120
It's much better to be confused and drunk all day long

210
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,840
You're right, I promise you won't drink anymore

211
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,960
It's impossible in the world

212
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,320
Everyone has extraordinary talents

213
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,160
But as long as you stay safe

214
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,760
Even if you are a farmer in a remote area

215
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
You can still live happily

216
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,080
Better than giving up on yourself

217
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,760
It's much better to be confused and drunk all day long

218
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Brother Lian, good morning, good morning

219
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Are you going to hit the road?

220
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,080
Be careful on the road

221
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,520
Brother Lian, what are your plans?

222
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,960
I have an uncle who runs a salt farm by the lake on the border between Qin and Zhao

223
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,680
I plan to go to him

224
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,080
Since you are on your way

225
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,680
You will need this horse and silver coins

226
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
I can't have it

227
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,560
I still have some silver, and I can buy more horses.

228
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,000
Brother Lian, take it.

229
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,560
I'm in this situation now, luckily I have your help

230
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,160
There is really nothing to repay

231
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,760
I can't accept your gift, you can take it back

232
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,760
Brother Lian is too outspoken.

233
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,600
If you don't want to accept gifts

234
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,680
Just treat it as Fang'er and borrow it for the time being.

235
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,720
When we meet again in the future, you can return it to Fang'er

236
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,360
By the way, you said you wanted to travel around

237
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,160
I wonder where you want to make a living?

238
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,240
Maybe to the west, maybe to the north

239
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,920
In this case, we can go on the road together

240
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,280
I'll take care of you on the way, okay?

241
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,400
Or we can go on the road first

242
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,280
You decide on the way

243
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,560
I assume this is the border between Zhao and Wei

244
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,480
And this is the inn

245
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,080
We set off tomorrow and after crossing the Wei border

246
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,920
Error 504 (Server Error)!!1504.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

247
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,800
hard to say

248
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,240
How hard is it to say?

249
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,760
If you go south first and then southeast

250
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,680
You will encounter one mountain and four rivers

251
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,280
If you go southeast first and then south

252
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,400
You will encounter four mountains and one river

253
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What did you say?

254
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,960
Crossing the river takes a lot of effort and is very dangerous.

255
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,520
But it will be faster

256
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,040
Going around the mountain will take more time

257
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,680
Is there a map? Take a look at the map

258
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,720
East, south, west, north, I don’t know what they mean?

259
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,560
No

260
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,360
General, should we cross the river or go around the mountains?

261
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,600
let me think about it first

262
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,080
general

263
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,320
Lady Ya

264
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,240
Discuss the itinerary?

265
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,640
Yes, we will arrive in Wei State tomorrow

266
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,320
There will be no inns at that time, so tents will be set up every night

267
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,000
Of course we have to find a better way.

268
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,440
Living in the open air, the journey must be very difficult

269
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,920
The princess is getting thinner and thinner, I'm afraid she won't be able to bear it anymore

270
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,040
Chef...can I add something to dinner tonight?

271
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
General Xiang, add more ingredients?

272
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,240
It means adding vegetables

273
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,360
I know a family nearby who raises many chickens

274
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,680
But I've got a big pot of beef soup ready

275
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,960
Beef is bad, has mad cow disease, chicken is good

276
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,440
We'll go out and buy some cages of chickens later and hit the road.

277
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,040
Then you can make chicken soup every day to nourish the princess.

278
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,920
Really wise

279
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,040
In addition to chickens, there are also eggs

280
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,440
Eggs are the most nutritious

281
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,640
Nutrition?

282
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
It means to replenish the body, don’t say any more, let’s go

283
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,560
Why are you bringing a knife? Put the knife down first

284
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,240
General Xiang, my mother wants to see you for something.

285
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,800
See me?

286
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,080
Mom, General Xiang is here

287
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,120
General Xiang

288
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Do you have a problem with me?

289
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,560
Because of the long journey, wind evil invades

290
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,040
Feng Xie? Does Feng Xie mean possessed by a ghost?

291
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,640
General Xiang, my wife is feeling unwell.

292
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,160
I want to stay in the post house and rest for a few more days.

293
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,960
this…

294
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,360
But take two more days of rest

295
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,920
Wouldn't it be very troublesome if the princess got married late?

296
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,680
But after entering the Wei Kingdom, he had a meal and slept in the open air.

297
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,840
If my mother cannot bear it and becomes seriously ill

298
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,880
Who bears this responsibility?

299
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,840
My responsibility is to send the princess to Wei quickly

300
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,000
Other things...you won't understand even if I tell you.

301
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,320
It's up to you. If you want to rest for two more days, please feel free to do so.

302
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,480
Or maybe you want to play here

303
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,160
In short, our team must set off on time

304
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,920
Don't worry, I'm still rushing to buy chickens

305
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,480
Just take a rest if you have nothing to do

306
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,560
Mother, what should I do?

307
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,120
Chop the ingredients...chop into large pieces of barbecued pork

308
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,880
If you two, mother and son, really plan to stay,

309
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,520
From now on, you will be responsible for your own meals

310
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,160
No chef to serve you

311
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,960
My mother is not feeling well, I went to see her

312
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,400
Go after drinking chicken soup

313
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,480
No need

314
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,200
Really good

315
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,080
General Xiang, please have a meal

316
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,040
Okay, wait a minute

317
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,800
Really poisonous?

318
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
Mom, did you drink that bowl of broth?

319
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,640
Don't drink at all, it will only make people suspicious

320
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,040
But that bowl of broth contains sweat medicine

321
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,040
Fool, I took the antidote beforehand

322
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,400
Mom, you are so thoughtful in your actions

323
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,840
De'er, we have to act according to our plan tonight

324
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,280
Tonight, not only can you go to the gentle land with the princess,

325
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,600
You can also threaten Xiang Shaolong

326
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,880
Mom, you and your uncle are so wise and powerful.

327
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,080
De'er, you must be careful what you do tonight

328
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,800
I heard that the princess has lost her appetite recently

329
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,360
If she doesn't drink broth tonight

330
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,720
Let her scream at the sky and the earth tonight

331
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,920
It is also said that the sky cannot respond and the earth cannot hear it.

332
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,000
I am Shao Yuanjun

333
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,920
Fight, I won't beat you enough

334
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,720
Have you beaten enough?

335
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,440
Oh my god

336
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,120
Help

337
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,920
You have to stop bleeding, otherwise stitches won't work

338
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,160
Help

339
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,560
You, a pervert, can be considered a coward.

340
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,280
Actually raped the princess

341
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,920
Mom, help me

342
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,720
It's late at night, don't make any noise

343
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,160
Bring me the knife and let me kill him

344
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,200
General Xiang, no, stop.

345
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,040
Mother, save me, mother

346
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,720
Xiang Shaolong, what crime did I, De'er, commit?

347
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,720
He sneaked into the princess's room late at night and wanted to rape her

348
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,880
Is this a crime?

349
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,480
You said that I, De'er, broke into the princess's bedroom without permission?

350
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,040
Can you ask the princess to come out and testify?

351
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,640
The princess has gone to bed in my lady's room

352
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,720
Mom, they have already discovered our plan.

353
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,920
They're ambushing the room, Del.

354
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,840
General Xiang, I, De'er, and the princess are cousins.

355
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,960
Even if he goes to the princess room to find the princess

356
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,720
It's also reasonable

357
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,680
Besides, the princess is not in the room

358
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,000
How can there be any crime of evil intention?

359
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,480
Why do you need to look for your cousin late at night?

360
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,760
Got a lot to talk about?

361
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,880
General Xiang, why are you in the princess room at midnight again?

362
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,720
How can you really argue like this?

363
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,960
I ask you, you mother and son

364
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,680
Was there poison in the soup?

365
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,440
If Shaolong hadn't been careful

366
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,920
I'm afraid your evil plot has succeeded.

367
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,080
There is no evidence, it is nonsense

368
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,640
No evidence? I haven’t poured out the pot of soup yet.

369
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,000
Also, he entered the princess's room

370
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,840
Four guards and two maids also saw it

371
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,080
They can all testify

372
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,840
Mrs. Pingyuan, we are finally a family

373
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,120
Why do you want to ruin the princess' reputation?

374
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,160
Trapping General Xiang into injustice?

375
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,760
Stop talking. If you, mother and son,

376
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,680
If you are not interested in explaining things clearly

377
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,200
I'll use King Zhao's token to kill him everywhere.

378
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,480
No, mother, you have to save me

379
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,760
I don't want to die, save me, mother

380
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,640
Princess loses her innocence

381
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,160
Will make Wei Guo dissatisfied and refuse the marriage

382
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,920
King Zhao will definitely investigate

383
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,960
I'm afraid it's hard to escape the guilt of escorting the general.

384
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,880
When the time comes, General Xiang will not tolerate Zhao Wei

385
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,920
I will definitely seek refuge with my brother

386
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,440
Killing two birds with one stone, it is indeed a poisonous plan

387
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,920
Why did Lord Xinling want to destroy

388
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,000
How can Zhao and Wei make peace and form an alliance?

389
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,240
She doesn't seem to want to say it

390
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,720
Forget it, send her back to Handan

391
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,880
Let her make it clear to King Zhao

392
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,640
My brother is plotting rebellion and wants to isolate the King of Wei

393
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,240
It turns out that Lord Xinling has such great ambitions

394
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,080
The king of Wei is fatuous and ignorant, but his brother is extremely intelligent.

395
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,920
If my brother were to rule Wei,

396
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,000
We can definitely compete with Qin

397
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,280
He even ordered the six kingdoms to destroy Qin

398
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,120
Crazy, dreaming?

399
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,280
Only Qin can destroy the six countries

400
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,360
General Xiang, both are unknown

401
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,080
You are a wise and brave person

402
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,520
If you can help my brother achieve great things

403
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,240
In the future, you will enjoy endless glory and wealth.

404
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,120
Of course not, if I turn history upside down

405
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,160
How do I go back?

406
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,520
Turning history upside down?

407
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,960
Anyway, I won’t help Mr. Xinling

408
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,000
General Xiang, you are so arrogant.

409
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,280
My brother has three thousand diners

410
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,160
If this lady strongly recommends the general in front of my brother,

411
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,200
The general will definitely be reused

412
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,800
It's much better than being Zhao Guo's lackey now.

413
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,120
Being Lord Xinling's lackey will lead to a more tragic end.

414
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,960
If I didn't estimate wrongly

415
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,240
Lord Xinling wanted to use General Xiang to assassinate King Wei

416
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,280
If successful, kill and silence them on the spot.

417
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,280
If he is captured by mistake, he will blame Zhao Guo.

418
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,920
No, let’s imprison the mother and son first.

419
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,760
At least I have something on my hands

420
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,520
But I also want to trouble Madam to do something for me.

421
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,000
Just write a letter for me

422
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,800
With this letter from Mrs. Pingyuan

423
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,240
It will be much easier for us to steal Lu Gong’s secret records.

424
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,640
Mr. Xinling is a very shrewd and cautious person.

425
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,960
We put Mrs. Pingyuan and her son under house arrest for this news.

426
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,560
Never leak

427
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,560
Of course it cannot be leaked

428
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,840
And it must be kept secret

429
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,160
So I hired a few trustworthy people to watch over me.

430
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,960
Also, the keys to their handcuffs and shackles

431
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,240
Leave it here for my safekeeping

432
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Unless they have wings growing on their backs and can fly

433
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,960
But it’s useless if they know how to fly

434
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,280
Those handcuffs and footcuffs are heavier than your head

435
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,680
Fortunately, Shaolong broke through their plot this time.

436
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,360
Otherwise it would be unthinkable

437
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,680
Not only is our strategy unworkable,

438
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,920
The most pitiful one is the princess

439
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,040
By the way, you just asked the princess to sleep in your room

440
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
Did she have any doubts?

441
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,360
The princess's heart felt like it was dead

442
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,280
indifferent to anything

443
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,160
Please give way

444
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,840
Princess…

445
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,040
You guys stand down?

446
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:25,720
Xiaoqian…

447
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,160
Aunt, I just saw Brother Xiang

448
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,280
I'm not dreaming. I really saw Brother Xiang?

449
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,000
Brother Xiang is marrying the general?

450
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,000
No, he won't do that

451
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,880
Brother Xiang doesn't know how to be a marrying general, he doesn't know how to do it

452
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,760
Xiaoqian

453
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,120
No, he won't

454
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,040
real

455
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,280
Why? Has Brother Xiang forgotten?

456
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,560
The promise made to Qianer that day at Madam’s Mansion?

457
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,240
Not only do you not keep your promise

458
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,040
He even sent Qian'er into the tiger's mouth with his own hands

459
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
come out with me

460
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,600
yes ma'am

461
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,840
The day I met Brother Xiang

462
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
It’s the happiest day in Qian’er’s life

463
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,880
Qian'er keeps these shoes by her side all the time

464
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,080
On the day of getting married and going on the road

465
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,280
I hope day and night that Brother Xiang will show up

466
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,200
Save Qian'er from birth

467
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,440
sorry

468
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,800
Now Qian'er's dream has been shattered

469
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,920
I really don’t want to stay in this world

470
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,280
Princess, don't talk nonsense

471
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,920
I will never let you die

472
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,320
Instead of marrying into the Kingdom of Wei and living a miserable life

473
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,840
It would be better to die

474
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,360
Don’t worry, princess, I will definitely not let you marry to the Kingdom of Wei

475
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,600
Why did Brother Xiang deceive Qianer again?

476
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,640
I want Qianer to be sad one more time

477
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,200
I just hope you can trust me again

478
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,520
I will definitely take you out of Wei safely

479
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,200
You will live happily in the future

480
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,080
I want to add a shock absorber to the wheel

481
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,560
Install shock absorbers?

482
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,160
The road is bumpy and the princess is not in good health.

483
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,160
I'm afraid she won't be able to bear the shaking if it's too strong.

484
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,520
If you add a spring to the wheel

485
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,800
Then it can have the effect of shock absorber

486
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,080
spring?

487
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,960
Anyway, help me find a few long pieces of iron

488
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,720
When I find it, I'll teach you how to do it.

489
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,480
Yes, General

490
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,880
General Xiang, didn't you take the princess away?

491
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,040
Why repair the carriage?

492
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,280
Did you hear it all?

493
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,080
Shaolong, I advise you to think twice.

494
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,880
You are ordered by the king to escort the princess

495
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,000
If you take the princess and run away

496
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,440
The king and the king of Wei will definitely send troops to hunt him down

497
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,360
By then you will have no place in heaven and earth.

498
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,200
The princess is a golden branch and jade leaf

499
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,160
Since I was a child, I have been well-fed and well-fed, and I have never suffered any hardships.

500
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,640
If you take her to flee, I'm afraid she won't be able to survive.

501
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,000
I've thought about this too

502
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,400
You told the princess very truthfully

503
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,400
It turns out you have no plan yet

504
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,720
That's right, you men

505
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,360
Make a promise so easily

506
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,920
Never thought it through at all

507
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,440
Don't worry, I promise to the princess

508
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,640
I will definitely do it

509
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,760
Anyway, we still have a few days to get to Daliang City.

510
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,320
I think there must be a way

511
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,240
Will you enter Daliang City again?

512
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,840
Of course, because we also want to steal Lu Gong's secret records

513
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,360
I thought you had forgotten about this

514
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,480
Such an important thing, I will never forget it

515
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,920
After passing the mountain col in front, there is a large salt lake.

516
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,720
The scenery over there is beautiful

517
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,640
Not only are there mountains and water, there are also many fruit trees on the mountains

518
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,840
you will definitely like

519
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,040
There is a very special flower in the valley here

520
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,560
The flower center is large and the petals are bright yellow

521
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,400
The most special thing is that it changes direction with the sun

522
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,280
Face east in the morning and look up to the sky at noon

523
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,960
In the afternoon, it will slowly turn towards the west again

524
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,480
You must see it

525
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,240
Okay, let's go over there and take a rest.

526
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,240
Then try again, okay?

527
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,000
It's very fragrant. You worked very hard picking it just now.

528
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,200
It's a pity that it will wither tomorrow

529
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,720
It doesn't matter, I will pick it for you tomorrow

530
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,600
real?

531
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,560
certainly

532
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,160
given to you

533
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,560
Thanks

534
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,080
Although this is the border between Qin and Zhao,

535
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,920
But due to the dangerous mountain road

536
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,800
The two armies rarely fight here

537
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,280
This is truly a paradise for seclusion

538
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,120
The mountain roads in this area are dangerous. Wouldn't it be difficult to enter Qin?

539
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,400
Do you want to enter Qin?

540
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,280
Or Fang'er parted ways with Brother Lian right here

541
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,920
Even if you want to join the Qin Dynasty, there is no need to rush

542
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,160
Let’s go to Salt Lake to stay for a few days first

543
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,360
You'll love that place

544
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,720
Fang'er wants to enter Qin first

545
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,680
It looks like it's going to rain

546
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,640
Let's find a place to take shelter from the rain first, shall we?

547
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,880
Fang'er...

548
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,560
Uncle, let’s eat steamed buns

549
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,200
Lao Ai, today I will cut you into pieces

550
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,760
To comfort the spirit of my deceased brother

551
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,640
I advise you to dig out your own eyes

552
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,480
Lest I take action and make your death worse

553
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,360
I just took a look at your broken hand

554
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,560
You're going to dig out people's eyes and kill them.

555
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,960
You've gone too far

556
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,240
Today I will do justice for heaven, go up
