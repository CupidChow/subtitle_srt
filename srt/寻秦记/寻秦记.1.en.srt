1
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,480
just in front

2
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,040
Is everything done?

3
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,960
Done

4
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,200
Shaolong, look at these stone statues

5
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,240
like someone

6
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,160
By the way, like you, look at it

7
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,480
How come they are so similar?

8
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
Do you think he could be your ancestor?

9
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,880
I won't respond to things that are not true

10
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,720
You are almost at the end without any surprises.

11
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,720
What?

12
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,960
Learn to get married

13
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,440
you don't like getting married

14
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,560
It's your business if you like to be a diamond king or five.

15
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,800
I don’t know how much thought and time I spent

16
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,960
Only then did I coax Azhen into marrying me.

17
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,320
I don't know what you think

18
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,240
What?

19
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,480
Such a large forest lies in front of us

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,640
What a waste if you can only watch but not eat

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,200
If you really can’t eat it, don’t waste it.

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Yes, Shaolong, he doesn’t dare to eat it

23
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,880
Just go ahead, you are different

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,280
Are you still playing during working hours?

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,600
What's wrong? Are you afraid of embarrassment?

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,040
I thought you were just afraid of getting married

27
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,240
Why am I not confident about my appearance now?

28
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,040
Fire... Shaolong

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,960
Peel off his teeth and treat you to a meal.

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,560
yes

31
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,040
How do you want to peel it?

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,840
You can peel it off any way you like, but it's up to me to choose the person.

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,800
Just choose her

34
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,520
You guys are just playing, hurry up and memorize the information

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,960
Isn’t this Shaolong’s girlfriend?

36
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,360
In case you can’t answer it later, yes

37
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,560
They quarreled for a week

38
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,160
If you are afraid, you will only lose half if you surrender.

39
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,040
Why are you following me?

40
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,360
I didn't follow you

41
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,600
What are you doing? Are the stone statues handsome?

42
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm here to work, not to tease girls

43
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,520
I'm not teasing girls

44
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,400
I just want to chat with you

45
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,960
I know there's a coffee shop on the third floor that has a good menu

46
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,120
After I finish my work later, I'll go have dinner with you

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,560
I'm not as free as you are

48
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,560
Not as free as me?

49
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,240
This exhibition will be open for eight days once it opens

50
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,040
Doesn’t it mean that I won’t be able to date you for a week?

51
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,160
Please give way

52
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
What do you want?

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,840
I don't want to do anything

54
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,720
I have calculated that this exhibition will be held for eight days

55
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,200
It's just open until next Sunday

56
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,360
I specially bought two Ocean Park admission tickets

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,320
You think I forgot

58
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,560
Is next Sunday the anniversary of our acquaintance?

59
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,200
We met at Ocean Park

60
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,160
I just want to give you a surprise

61
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,000
Li Xiaochao has arrived

62
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
Hurry up, don't let me take the blame

63
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,360
Can't retire tomorrow

64
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Mr. Li...your group

65
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,080
An artificial satellite was launched into space last month

66
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,240
Does that mean you will also develop space technology?

67
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,520
Mr. Li

68
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,600
The new net shares issued by your group last month

69
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Listed below the IPO price

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,200
How do you explain it to small investors?

71
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,040
Regarding this issue…

72
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,240
Sir, I'm sorry

73
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,120
Mr. Li, we can start

74
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,680
Mr. Li...answer the question first, Mr. Li

75
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,040
Mr. Li

76
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,480
You are sponsoring this Qin Terracotta Warriors Exhibition this time

77
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,320
Does it indicate that you intend to develop a career in archeology?

78
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,920
I have always been interested in archeology

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,400
Mr. Li

80
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,880
I heard that you intend to acquire the entire Qin Shihuang’s tomb

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,800
I wonder if it is true?

82
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,160
Qin Shi Huang’s Mausoleum Belongs to the State

83
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,760
How can I afford it?

84
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,720
Mr. Li, you didn't answer the question

85
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,560
Your Xinwang stock fell below the bottom price as soon as it was listed

86
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,320
How do you explain it to small investors?

87
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,640
I have no comment on this issue

88
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,520
Don't come over to everyone, don't come over to me

89
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,960
Don't mess around

90
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,760
Don't come over

91
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,640
Speak slowly and don't hurt innocent people

92
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,760
Do you also know about innocence?

93
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,560
I am innocent, why do you want to hurt me?

94
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,640
Could you be mistaken? I don't know you at all

95
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,200
You don’t know me? I bought your unlucky internet stocks

96
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,600
Make me whole body in debt

97
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,560
Of course when buying stocks, they will rise and fall.

98
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
What does it have to do with you? Baldhead, do you want to die?

99
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,920
you're right

100
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,120
Mr. Li is the only one who made you miserable

101
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,360
It's none of other people's business, just let them go

102
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,800
Yes, let us go

103
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,960
It's none of our business...

104
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,840
Yes, please let the others go first.

105
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Shut up, I won't listen to you

106
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,680
But I listen to you

107
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,240
But the girl in white can't leave

108
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,880
She was rude, she stopped me from asking Mr. Li a question

109
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,280
You come here, you command them, drop the gun

110
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Follow them slowly

111
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,280
Shaolong, I just received the news

112
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,840
This guy’s name is Mai Weijian, he used to be a colleague of O’s

113
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,280
Because I lost money by speculating in stocks, I owed a lot of debt to loan sharks.

114
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,880
I was fired by my boss and now I'm insane.

115
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,760
You and the other injured go first

116
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
How could this happen? Mr. Li

117
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,440
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

118
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,240
Your Internet stocks will also fall?

119
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,480
I invested a lot in you

120
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,000
I've lost a lot of money now, you know?

121
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,080
You go, colleague, I want to die with him

122
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,600
You also work at Oji

123
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,080
You know I can't leave my job

124
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,280
I owe people a lot of money now

125
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,480
Of course stocks rise and fall

126
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,360
if you die today

127
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,760
If that stock suddenly surges

128
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,760
Isn’t your death very unworthy?

129
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,480
That stock hasn't risen in several months.

130
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,560
Li Xiaochao's Internet stocks kept falling

131
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,120
Now it's all gone, I can't help it

132
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,840
You yourself would also say that he was responsible for the stock.

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,520
Can you just ask him to raise the stock price?

134
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,720
Why do so many things?

135
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,480
May I?

136
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Can

137
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,680
Is it possible?

138
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,200
Is it possible?

139
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,680
Can

140
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,520
Then hurry up and make the stock rise, hurry up

141
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,600
Shaolong, is this okay?

142
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,160
I'm retiring tomorrow

143
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,600
I'm going to get married soon

144
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,360
The suspect's phone was connected

145
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,160
Emperor Investment Center, what can I help you with?

146
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,040
What is the current price of 9413? How much?

147
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,560
38.8 yuan?

148
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,440
You are so hateful

149
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,880
If it really goes up, it goes up; if it goes down, it goes down.

150
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,760
You are still awesome and have a way

151
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,480
Now that the stock price has rebounded, we can let him go.

152
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,240
Mr. Li, can you give me a few more dollars?

153
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,320
How many yuan more per liter? OK?

154
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,640
Please raise a few more dollars

155
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,360
Thank you... let me go...

156
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
The key is in your pocket, take it

157
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,480
your pocket?

158
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,960
Yes, in the pocket, yes

159
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,560
Just take it if I tell you to

160
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,200
sorry

161
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,240
Where is the stock market on Saturday afternoon? There is only horse racing

162
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,040
You are all lying to me, okay

163
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,800
Let's die together

164
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,480
Shaolong, hurry up, it’s about to explode.

165
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,160
It's useless, it will explode if you dismantle it.

166
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,720
You and I will die together

167
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,000
What happened? You Hunan boys

168
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,440
Charge me so much money and sell me a fake

169
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,480
You stinky Hunan boy, you lied to me and sold me fake goods.

170
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,640
I won't patronize you next time, Hunanzi

171
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,200
Drink a glass of water first. Thank you.

172
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,000
Why don't you leave?

173
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,440
will die

174
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,120
If I leave, who else will save you?

175
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,560
Brother Long, Sir Huang is looking for you

176
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,400
Thank you, take a rest

177
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,400
Why don't we get married?

178
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,720
I'm just joking, I won't stop you from doing anything

179
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,000
Are you going to Ocean Park next week?

180
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,920
Just remember to talk about it

181
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,440
Then I'll call you tonight

182
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,840
Will I really not remember it?

183
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,920
Excuse me…

184
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,360
Could you please take a photo for us?

185
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,880
OK…

186
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,480
Could you please take a photo for us?

187
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,840
There are so many varieties of ice cream now

188
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,160
It smells like taro again

189
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,840
I wonder if there will be durian flavor later?

190
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,000
Seven years later, everything has changed

191
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,600
No, you have looked the same beautiful for seven years

192
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,080
Nothing has changed

193
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,960
What are your plans for the future?

194
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,600
What's the plan?

195
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,560
Just like what happened at the last exhibition, it was originally fine

196
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,160
The day before that Sir Huang retired

197
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,800
Everyone is playing tricks on me and putting the blame on me.

198
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
And also belittle my evaluation record

199
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,360
But luckily he's retired now

200
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,720
I won't be so annoyed anymore

201
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,840
After the exhibition

202
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,520
I will ask the company for a month's leave

203
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,240
Okay, after that incident at the exhibition

204
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,800
You should take a holiday too

205
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,720
Otherwise, everyone will be very nervous

206
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,200
Not only that, I also contacted Jenny’s travel agency

207
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,040
Booked flights and hotels

208
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,080
I also asked Father Nelson to book a church for me.

209
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,120
I just haven't told you yet

210
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Next time you have to discuss such a serious issue with me first

211
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,400
I really can't ask for leave because of your suddenness.

212
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,560
I don't think it's necessary, and Peter won't mind either.

213
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,080
Which Peter?

214
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,960
Did you fail or did I fail?

215
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,520
I'm about to marry Peter Wong

216
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,960
You don’t even know who Peter is?

217
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,040
What? Marriage? Ah Qing…

218
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,680
You suddenly told me out of the blue

219
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,400
You want to marry that Peter

220
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,920
I don't even know who Peter is

221
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,200
Do you understand or not?

222
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,680
I've been waiting, waiting for so many years

223
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,640
I can't wait aimlessly forever

224
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,520
I know

225
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,320
But if you do something wrong, you have to give me a chance

226
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,440
I didn't give you a chance?

227
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,640
Every time I mention marriage to you

228
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,680
You always find a reason to delay

229
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,600
Or just change the topic

230
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,960
At first I thought you had some difficulties

231
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,200
But slowly I realized

232
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,520
You have no intention of marrying me

233
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,120
It's not that I haven't thought about marrying you

234
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,560
Just think it's my fault, okay?

235
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,000
That day you saved me even at the risk of your own life.

236
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,760
I'm really happy

237
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,360
But why can't you do it for me

238
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,200
With me?

239
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,720
How could I say not to be with you?

240
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,560
Frankly speaking, there is nothing wrong with us now

241
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,040
you are a man

242
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,160
There can be many different women around you

243
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,920
Has there ever been a woman around me?

244
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,640
You don't understand at all

245
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,680
The problem is not here

246
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,240
You never thought about marrying me

247
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,200
Are you going to get married? I'll marry you

248
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,640
Are you satisfied?

249
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,160
sorry

250
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't have time to take your call now

251
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,480
please leave a message

252
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,280
Mr. Xiang

253
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,720
You don't seem to be a resident here

254
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,960
How come they are so similar?

255
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,800
我的名片

256
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,000
这样也叫作名片?乌有博士

257
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,360
我是代表李先生来找你的

258
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,920
李先生?      是呀

259
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,920
李小超

260
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,440
是呀, 李先生很欣赏你的身手

261
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,000
所以请你…

262
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,960
我没兴趣做李先生的保安

263
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,160
项先生…

264
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,120
我现在心情不好, 再见

265
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,640
我现在没空听你的电话

266
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,600
请你留下口信

267
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,520
阿青, 你何时游出来了?

268
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,000
What did you do?

269
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,240
Turn off the phone and don't listen to what others say

270
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Can you listen to a few words from me?

271
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,200
Did you turn on the phone without saying anything?

272
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,680
Don't lie to me

273
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,640
I don't have time to take your call now

274
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,240
Please leave a message. Did you really lie to me?

275
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,640
He is Peter Wong

276
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,760
If he is so fat, let him join the waist slimming program.

277
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,160
Like a banana, far different from me

278
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,320
can you remember

279
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,240
That Peter Wong I told you about last time?

280
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,960
He asked someone to send a bouquet of flowers to my office today

281
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,480
Yeah?

282
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,800
come over…

283
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,200
What to do?

284
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,560
Give me some lemon tea

285
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,320
Is it done?

286
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,720
not yet

287
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,640
Did you buy this crystal dolphin?

288
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,000
No, it was that Peter Wong who bought it

289
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,400
They all told him not to spend the money.

290
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Peter Wong again?

291
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,920
Aren't you jealous? Eat

292
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,640
Is it done?

293
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,800
Thanks

294
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,960
Look

295
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,720
Where are you taking me?

296
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,040
Left...Take two steps to the left...

297
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,000
What to do?

298
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,200
Not yet...it's ready...get ready

299
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,440
One, two, three, look quickly...

300
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,400
Like it or not…

301
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,280
So cliche

302
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,720
Cliche?

303
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,240
Yeah, so cliché

304
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,840
In other words, if you don’t like it anymore, forget it.

305
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,840
No, I like it

306
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,800
What do you like?

307
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,440
that

308
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,640
If you like that, you don't like me, so forget it

309
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,040
No, I like it

310
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,480
Like? What do you like?

311
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,520
like there

312
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,720
Do you like it? Then go for a walk yourself

313
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,320
It’s amazing, this menu hasn’t changed in seven years

314
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,040
The singer is still here singing Carmen, so sentimental

315
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,880
I feel that some things are always better to be still than to move.

316
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,520
Yes, nothing has changed, just think that I have changed

317
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,160
I am no longer that ignorant girl

318
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,040
I don't want these things

319
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,800
It's no use if you try all these tricks again

320
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,400
Do you understand?

321
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,320
I don't understand, what do you want?

322
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,360
It's not what I want, it's what you want?

323
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,200
I want to be the same as before, nothing will change

324
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,360
It's useless. Do you want me to wait for you for another seven years?

325
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,040
Then I was very disappointed, and then we broke up again.

326
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,640
I know your personality best, you won’t change

327
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,240
I think this chain is not suitable for me. I'll give it to you.

328
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
I really don't understand

329
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,800
Are we not good now?

330
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,840
Don't you understand yet?

331
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,000
You can be content with the status quo

332
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,680
Be your diamond queen happily

333
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,920
but i can't

334
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,000
I want someone like Peter

335
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,600
Can sync with me

336
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,200
A husband who can give me a sense of security

337
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,520
I have decided next Sunday

338
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,280
Get married at St. John's Church

339
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,560
If you still consider me a friend

340
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,920
You are very welcome to come and watch the ceremony

341
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,160
Gone

342
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,200
goodbye

343
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,120
So late? Leave first

344
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,400
Mr. Xiang

345
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,440
Mr. Xiang, you misunderstood

346
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,120
I don't want you to be a security guard

347
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,680
I don't care what you do to me

348
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,400
Anyway, I'm in a bad mood now

349
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,880
Mr. Xiang, this way please

350
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,920
What do you want?

351
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,560
If Mr. Xiang is willing to go to a place with me

352
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,960
I believe you will change your opinion and maybe

353
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,280
Why should I go with you?

354
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,880
Do you think I come to you again and again?

355
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,280
Really no curiosity at all?

356
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
What do you want?

357
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,440
nothing

358
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,000
Don't you need to press the elevator button?

359
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,120
Need not

360
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,080
Come on, come on

361
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,880
Mr. Li

362
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,120
Dr. Wu

363
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,200
Mr. Xiang, I finally waited until you showed up.

364
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,200
let's get started

365
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,840
Do you know what I majored in in college?

366
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,480
It's space physics

367
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,520
my greatest wish

368
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,520
It is the study of using space energy to travel through time and space.

369
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,280
Is this what it is?

370
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,160
Yes, it is the fruit of my hard work

371
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,640
I thought your company just issued technology stocks

372
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,960
It turns out that I also invested in making science and technology films.

373
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,360
a week ago

374
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,760
We pass through the time shuttle

375
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,240
Successfully sent a monkey back to ancient times

376
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,520
Successfully brought it back again

377
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,920
Just take out a monkey and say it's traveling through time and space.

378
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,200
Then has it met its ancestor Sun Wukong?

379
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,640
Or you can ask whether it has gone back to ancient times.

380
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,680
So I hope to find a volunteer

381
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,360
Conduct this time travel experiment again

382
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,880
I really want to ask you

383
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,960
What on earth am I capable of?

384
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,760
If you don’t look for others, why do you have to look for me?

385
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,880
In fact, you are so rich

386
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,080
Just take some money out

387
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,040
I think there's a huge queue of people waiting to do it

388
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,400
The reason why I can become super rich

389
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,160
It's because I'm very cautious about investing

390
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,520
Xiang Shaolong was born on August 25, 1975

391
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,080
Unfortunately, your parents were robbed and died when you were two years old.

392
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,360
In the second grade of elementary school, you wrote an essay

393
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,160
Say your ambition is to become a scientist

394
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,880
I hope you can go back in time and save your parents

395
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,240
Early testing shows

396
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,120
You are highly qualified in scientific mathematics

397
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,680
Moreover, motor nerve conditioned reflexes are also very developed.

398
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,960
in 1994

399
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,960
You get a scholarship and go to college

400
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,200
Majored in physical science

401
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,880
Because your parents' experiences have a great impact on you

402
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,040
So at the age of twenty-three

403
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,600
You decided to give up further education and join the police force

404
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,840
because of your outstanding performance

405
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,760
Therefore, we make an exception and use one year of seniority

406
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,680
Selected as the elite G4 of the police force (Dignitary Protection Group)

407
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Xiang Shaolong, you are my best candidate

408
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,640
It really looks more and more similar the more I look at it

409
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,240
Don’t you think that Qin Terracotta Warriors look a lot like you?

410
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,000
Is it weird? He looks a lot like you two too

411
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,200
The strangest thing is the place where the Qin Terracotta Warriors were excavated

412
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,360
Found one at the same time

413
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,840
High-tech products that transcend today's science

414
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,640
The local government has conducted secret research

415
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,880
But it's a pity that we can't get the research data

416
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,880
This high-tech product

417
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,360
Appeared in the world two thousand years ago

418
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
does it mean

419
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,920
Has anyone successfully traveled through time and space?

420
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,800
The scientific concept is to make bold assumptions and verify carefully

421
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,960
In fact, money is just a bunch of numbers to me

422
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,280
It's hard for me to find another ideal in life

423
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,600
I really need you to cite it for me.

424
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,800
Sorry, I'm not interested

425
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,320
he would be interested

426
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,040
I can see that

427
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,480
Dude, are you okay?

428
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,160
It's okay, I'll leave

429
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,760
It's okay. If it's okay, just leave.

430
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,560
What are you writing?

431
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,600
What exactly is it?

432
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,760
I love you

433
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,840
Me too

434
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,520
I really want to be with you

435
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,040
Is there a ring?

436
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,600
Sir, what style of ring do you want?

437
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,640
Marriage kind

438
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,400
I do

439
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,080
Ah Qing...I really want to marry you

440
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,120
I mean seriously, don't exchange rings, don't

441
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,560
Ah Qing, wait for me

442
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,000
Prague?

443
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,760
Jenny, could you be mistaken?

444
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,000
How could I have gotten it wrong?

445
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,600
I personally helped her issue air tickets and book hotels.

446
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,280
Ah Qing also said that Father Nelson promised her

447
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,440
will be in St. John's Church in Prague

448
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,800
Officiate her wedding

449
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,600
Why didn't she tell you?

450
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,240
Let me declare first, if we get married in the future

451
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,240
I must go to Prague

452
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,560
St. John's Cathedral wedding

453
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,160
Why go to St. John's Cathedral in Prague?

454
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,560
Because I was baptized there

455
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,160
Don't go, Ah Qing

456
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,560
Ah Qing, I will marry you

457
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,480
In fact, I have long wanted to marry you.

458
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,680
Don't go, Ah Qing, don't go

459
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,080
Are you crazy?

460
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,440
Do you think rich people are great?

461
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,640
Do you believe that I will sue you for violating my privacy?

462
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,760
What do you need?

463
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,200
I don't need anything

464
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,360
I just need my girlfriend, okay?

465
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,280
Yes, as long as you are willing to help me

466
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,560
Have you ever thought about what it would be like to travel through time and space?

467
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,440
You can go back to before your girlfriend left you

468
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,800
Find a way to remedy it

469
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,040
Are you crazy?

470
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,080
Are you mentally ill?

471
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,640
No, I'm serious

472
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,600
We take the Qin State in the Warring States Period

473
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,080
As the destination for this time traveling experiment

474
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,520
To help you complete your tasks

475
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,400
starting from today

476
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,400
You need to undergo a series of special training

477
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,800
I promise you that after this mission is completed

478
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,080
I will send you back to meet your girlfriend

479
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,120
How do you like it? Are you satisfied or dissatisfied?

480
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,680
Is it done?

481
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,600
Isn’t it? Put a barbecued pork bun on your head

482
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,520
Is it okay not to?

483
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,240
That's it

484
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,680
This is a signal transmitter, it's already activated

485
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,880
In the year when King Qin Yingzheng ascended the throne,

486
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,800
That is, any day in 247 B.C.

487
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,680
As long as you are in Xianyang City

488
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,840
Within a radius of one hundred miles

489
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,000
We can all calculate your correct position

490
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,800
Take you back to this space today in 2001

491
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,400
This instrument is so small

492
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,120
In case something breaks down or the power goes out

493
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:01,960
Wouldn't that mean he's dead?

494
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,560
Don't worry, this is the latest technology product

495
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,200
Enough power to last two years

496
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,680
This digital camera is for you

497
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,400
Flashbangs, pistols

498
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,040
There are also two pills inside for your emergency use.

499
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,880
I want to emphasize again

500
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,400
your mission this time

501
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,280
Just go back and witness

502
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,240
The historical moment when King Qin Yingzheng ascended the throne

503
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,960
Take a series of historic pictures for us

504
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,200
Other things must not be done rashly

505
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,760
Because every time you did something in ancient times

506
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,760
Very likely to change history

507
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,000
What will happen?

508
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,720
The reason why you and I exist in this space is history

509
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,720
What do you think would happen if history changed?

510
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,840
That is to say, everything in this space

511
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,280
will disappear

512
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,240
But don't worry

513
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,040
This time you will only be back for about half an hour

514
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,600
If you follow the plan, you should be fine

515
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,640
This is life and death. You can see it.

516
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,800
If it's okay, just sign it.

517
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,320
The satellite will enter orbit in thirty seconds

518
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,680
Each unit prepares

519
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,400
Time travel, official countdown

520
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,200
Giant fireworks released for countdown

521
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,600
This year's fireworks display has reached its climax

522
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,840
Next is the Li Xiaochao Group

523
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,440
Sponsored laser fireworks to welcome the new year

524
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,760
Please enjoy

525
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,240
Shaolong

526
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,360
Ah Qing, are you back?

527
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,360
Who are you?

528
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,400
Why did it suddenly appear here?

529
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,440
hateful
