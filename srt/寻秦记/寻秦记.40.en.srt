1
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,640
Lu Buwei, how dare you appear in front of all the civil and military officials of the dynasty

2
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,160
The following committed a crime and attempted to usurp the throne.

3
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,200
The truth doesn’t matter whether your Ying Zheng is real or fake.

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,360
Now I am holding a tiger talisman in my hand

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,200
The three armies inside and outside Yongdu must obey the truth

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,680
You're just asking for death this time

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,600
In other words, Lu Buwei, you are now showing your plans.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,320
Are you going to kill the king to seize the throne?

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,080
So what?

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,360
The position of king has always been occupied by those who are capable.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,080
I, Lu Buwei, now regret that I waited in vain for more than ten years.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,320
Stop talking nonsense, Wang Jian

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,320
If you don’t catch this traitor immediately, he will be punished on the spot.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,280
Quickly capture the rebellious officials and traitors

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,200
Wang Jian, are you crazy?

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,440
Wang Jian Ruoran obeys orders like you, a rebellious minister and traitor

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,720
It's really crazy

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,720
Since Wang Jian was ordered by the king

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,600
I will only take orders from the real king

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,200
It’s not just a tiger charm

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,160
Your Majesty, all Lü Meng’s followers outside Yongdu City

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,400
Already caught in one swoop

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,560
Well done, Lu Buwei

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,600
Do you think you have a tiger talisman in your hand?

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,240
Can you just try to replace me?

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,400
You underestimate my ability too much

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,560
Wang Jian, general Lu Buwei and all the rebels

28
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,320
They were escorted back to Xianyang together to wait for their fate.

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,240
Yes, Your Majesty

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,360
impossible…

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,600
impossible…

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,480
From now on, I want to control the world of Qin

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,160
Forever and ever, year after year

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:11,160
Long live, long live, long live

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,280
I, Lu Buwei, am the king of Qin.

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,000
I, Lu Buwei, can be said to live forever.

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,040
Eternal life?

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,200
I think it's probably because he's about to die soon.

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,840
Is it you?

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,720
You all stand down

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,360
No one is allowed to enter without my order.

42
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,680
I want to say goodbye to my good father-in-law.

43
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Yes, Your Majesty…

44
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,840
I, Lu Buwei, really didn’t expect that

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,880
I have been in power and opposition for so many years

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,800
Not even half as cunning as you, Ying Zheng

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,400
Prime Minister Lu is too generous, if it comes to cunning

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,440
It’s really beyond my reach

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
If it weren’t for Xiang Shaolong and Wang Jian

50
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,160
Loyal to others

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,200
Prime Minister Lu has already taken his place.

52
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,040
If Lao Ai hadn't acted recklessly,

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,000
Xiang Shaolong interferes with it

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,360
You would have died in the inn hotel a long time ago

55
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,680
Is there still life left to be so high-spirited?

56
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,840
As the saying goes: a slight difference is a thousand miles away

57
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I am the true emperor who was appointed by heaven

58
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,760
Do you think you can kill so easily?

59
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,160
you…

60
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,280
What I regret most is that I thought I had a rare commodity.

61
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,440
I never imagined that I have worked hard for so many years

62
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,560
Actually she was just marrying someone else

63
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,920
Lu Buwei, I hope you will die soon.

64
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,440
Let me tell you one more secret

65
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,440
Let you go to hell after death

66
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,960
It's not like I'm a fool

67
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,360
Not only am I not your biological flesh and blood,

68
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,680
I am not Ying Zheng at all.

69
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
What Zhao De said that day was right

70
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,160
From the very beginning, Xiang Shaolong rescued from the State of Zhao...

71
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,120
He's just a rogue boy from Handan City

72
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,360
My original name is Zhao Pan

73
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,640
Your Majesty, please order an escort

74
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,240
It's just a little short of you being able to change the government

75
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,720
Become a king

76
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,760
Do you feel very unwilling?

77
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,720
Give poisonous wine

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,720
King, if you want to kill me, then kill me. Please let my father go.

79
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,200
King

80
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,760
Mr. Xiang, don’t forget

81
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,680
You once said to me

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,920
Everything is already doomed

83
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,720
What are the consequences of arrogantly changing history?

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,080
You should know best

85
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Now the country is protected

86
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,720
Taifu Xiang really made an indispensable contribution

87
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,560
Mr. Xiang asked me how to reward the widow, just ask

88
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,160
In fact, the king now has great power

89
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,320
I think it’s time for Xiang Shaolong to retire after his success.

90
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,160
Retire after success? Didn’t Taifu Xiang promise to the widow?

91
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,720
Do you want to help a few people accomplish their great cause and unify the world?

92
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,920
Nowadays, there are many things in front of me

93
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,880
Taifu Xiang is asked to make plans for the few people.

94
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,760
Just like the traitor Lao Ai

95
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Still haven't surrendered

96
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,760
What the king means

97
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,680
Do you want Xiang Shaolong to help you catch Lao Ai with his own hands?

98
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,200
That's not necessary, Lao Ai is very cunning.

99
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,320
It will not be easy to catch this man

100
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,520
But I have my own way to make this person fall into a trap.

101
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,600
I beg you, give me the baby back

102
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,640
Please, give me the baby back

103
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,000
Give me the child back, Your Majesty

104
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,320
Your Majesty, although Lao Ai has done many evil things,

105
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,880
But using this baby as bait would be too cruel

106
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Has Taifu Xiang forgotten?

107
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,720
How did your princess die tragically?

108
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,520
Who destroyed Tingfang's innocence?

109
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,960
This person, Lao Ai, is full of evil.

110
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,600
Are you still begging for mercy on his behalf?

111
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,320
No matter how wrong you are, it's okay

112
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,440
It's all Lao Ai's problem

113
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,840
Could it be that the king does nothing but do this?

114
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,240
Is there no other way?

115
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,040
There is no need to say more, Mr. Xiang

116
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,240
This is already the best method

117
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,120
King, I beg you

118
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,240
You can cut me to pieces with a thousand knives

119
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,160
Please let my child go

120
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,400
Now in front of you, I am your biological flesh and blood

121
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,480
Hanging on a long pole outside

122
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,720
Just a wild species of unknown origin

123
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,840
It shouldn't exist in this world at all

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,320
King

125
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,560
I don’t want to hear any more unnecessary words

126
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,080
Now I just want to watch a good show

127
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,080
Your Majesty, Lao Ai has appeared outside the gate of Dazheng Palace.

128
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,000
Lao Ai…

129
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,240
The king tried his best to get me to come

130
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,600
I'm here now

131
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,000
Lao Ai, I have been waiting here for you for so long

132
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,480
You are too callous to your bastard

133
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,840
The king can do such a cruel thing to a baby

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,800
When it comes to ruthlessness, I can't compare to you.

135
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,480
You know it's a trap this time

136
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,960
You still have the guts to show up, that’s really cool

137
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,160
I already knew I would die when I arrived.

138
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,800
I just want to trade my life for my child's life

139
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,960
You keep saying it's your child

140
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,800
Can a eunuch also have children?

141
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,680
The common people of Zhao State at that time

142
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,120
You can become the king of Qin today

143
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,600
Why can't a eunuch have children?

144
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,560
Today my body returns to my homeland

145
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,840
His imperial body is also the same

146
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,480
Zhao Pan in the past was a bit arbitrary

147
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,800
But finally my conscience remains intact

148
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,920
I didn't expect that he would become like this today

149
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,440
If I hadn’t forced him to fake Ying Zheng

150
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,800
He won't take this road at all

151
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,480
It won't become like this

152
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,360
Shaolong, you don’t need to blame yourself too much

153
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,200
In fact, everything is determined by fate

154
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,680
Power corrupts

155
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,920
But the result may be the same

156
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,080
But there are exceptions to everything

157
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,480
Just like Shaolong, this is an exception

158
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,600
He has now made great achievements

159
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,120
Just opening your mouth can sway the government and the opposition

160
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,280
But he is not attached to any power

161
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,440
It’s really admirable…

162
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,840
Shao Long is actually corrupting

163
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,800
not necessarily in power

164
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,280
The most important thing is whether the person has evil intentions

165
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,760
In short, everything is destined

166
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,120
Shaolong, you don’t have to blame yourself too much.

167
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,520
Brother, what are your plans for the future?

168
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,200
Now only we know

169
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,120
The real identity of the fake Ying Zheng

170
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,920
with his character

171
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,680
He will never let us go

172
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,000
Big brother is saying... Ying Zheng will deal with us?

173
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,160
You forgot that I once told you in the history books

174
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,560
From beginning to end, there is no such word as Xiang Shaolong.

175
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,640
No, Shaolong, you'll be fine

176
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,520
Don't worry, I've already expected this day

177
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,480
So I have already exchanged news with Lord Wu Bao very early on.

178
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,760
Think of a way to leave Xianyang

179
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,160
Where is Tingfang?

180
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,360
Brother Xiang, although Lian Jin has been punished

181
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,520
But this person left a shadow in Tingfang's heart

182
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,320
indelible

183
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,000
Tingfang is no longer innocent

184
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,040
It is my lifelong wish to stay with Brother Xiang

185
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,640
Can only hope for the afterlife

186
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,400
Tingfang, don’t go

187
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,280
Just let go...

188
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,440
I made it very clear in my letter

189
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,040
Why are you still chasing after me?

190
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,040
I'll get it for you

191
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
But I'm no longer perfect

192
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,000
Sorry, it's my fault

193
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,440
If I hadn't left before

194
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,880
You wouldn't do this either

195
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,560
you listen to me

196
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,560
I promise you, I will protect you in the future

197
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,400
I won't let anyone hurt you again

198
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,400
I will take care of you forever

199
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,680
It turns out that after all, you just want to be responsible

200
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,200
That's not what I meant

201
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,880
Isn’t that what you mean?

202
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,760
Even though I have become a spent flower and a willow

203
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,040
Same thing?

204
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
Yes, in my time

205
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
No one would mind this kind of thing at all

206
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,520
I really like you

207
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,120
No matter what you become, I won't mind

208
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,600
I will accept it

209
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,400
give me some time

210
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,400
Time can make people forget everything

211
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,800
Give me some time to prove it to you

212
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,560
I really like you

213
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,960
I'm not from your era

214
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,480
No matter how much you love me or like me

215
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,640
I'm not even worthy of you

216
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,920
Since time can dilute everything

217
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,240
Just use this time to forget me

218
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,200
I love you

219
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,880
Let go I love you

220
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,920
Let go, I really love you

221
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,280
I don't know what you are talking about

222
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,520
I love you…

223
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,480
I love you

224
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,400
You understand, I love you

225
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,320
Brother Xiang

226
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:46,440
I love you…

227
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,440
I want to hear it again

228
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,320
What to listen to again?

229
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,960
I want to hear you say it again

230
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,040
The sentence "I love you" just now

231
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,520
I've just said it many times, isn't it enough?

232
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,600
I want you to say it again, okay?

233
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,400
Yes, you told Tingfang so many times

234
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,480
But you haven’t told me, I want to listen too

235
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,480
Do you know what the top secret is in these three words?

236
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,960
It comes from the heart and is not just said casually.

237
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,720
Then you just said it so smoothly

238
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,240
Just now because the situation was critical

239
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,760
So I have to use these three words to coax her.

240
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,400
Anyway, you know that my heart is thinking about

241
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,080
Just treat you like these three words

242
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,360
That's what you really think...

243
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,200
How come there is a rainbow?

244
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,320
Shanrou, when were you here?

245
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,840
You only care about me and me

246
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,640
Even if everyone from Xianyang City comes

247
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,880
You won't know either

248
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,000
So are you envious?

249
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,600
Honestly, how does it feel to have two women working together with one husband?

250
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,480
What it feels like when two women work together with one husband

251
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,720
Not bad

252
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,640
Have you ever considered having three women working together with one husband?

253
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,320
Three women working together with one husband?

254
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,200
Think about it…

255
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,880
you said it

256
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Are you serious?

257
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,800
Do you think I'm a fool?

258
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,160
Three women working together with one husband, you are willing but I am not willing

259
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,360
Besides, there are only these two silly women

260
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,560
Only then do I think you, Mr. Xiangchong, are a dragon.

261
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,720
Me? I wouldn’t be that stupid

262
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,600
Luckily you were joking

263
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,080
I was almost scared to death by you

264
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,440
If he one day

265
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,120
If Shaolong bullies the two of us

266
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,040
Kind and gentle girl

267
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,080
You must stand up for us and teach him a lesson

268
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,240
But don’t charge so much in terms of price.

269
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,680
See if we get to know each other

270
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
I might as well give you two a trick

271
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,240
What if he did something wrong toward Xiang Shaolong?

272
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,760
Or if he wants to marry another wife

273
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,680
You might as well learn Lu Buwei’s method of dealing with Lao Ai

274
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,960
castrate him

275
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,920
Are you still not a human being?

276
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,160
How can anyone teach others to castrate their husbands?

277
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,200
Why are you so cruel?

278
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,880
If you treat my two sisters badly

279
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,640
There are more vicious methods

280
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,360
No wonder people say: three women make one ruin

281
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,400
This sentence no matter in my time

282
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,360
Or it may be very useful now

283
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,160
Tingfang, take care of yourself

284
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,840
Xiang Shaolong, the same goes for you

285
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,560
Taifu Xiang, do you really want to leave?

286
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,600
The king now has great power

287
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,720
Besides, everyone who wanted to be eradicated by you has already been eradicated.

288
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,440
It's time for me to leave too

289
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,160
Mr. Xiang, come over to me.

290
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,120
OK

291
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,000
It seems that the widow has been there for a while

292
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,400
I have never sparred with Tai Tu

293
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,440
Your Majesty, do you still remember what I once taught you?

294
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,000
Everything the master has taught me

295
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,040
Everyone keeps it in mind

296
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,640
I still remember the first thing my tutor taught me

297
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,760
It's an interesting Kung Fu called "Judo"

298
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,200
Let's discuss it again

299
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,040
OK

300
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,120
Come on

301
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,560
The king is indeed the king

302
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,880
I can no longer defeat you, my king.

303
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,680
It's just Master who deliberately gave in to Pan'er.

304
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,520
I can't beat you now, my lord.

305
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,440
The king is now far beyond my imagination

306
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
I have nothing more to teach you.

307
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,160
I am now a defeated general under the king.

308
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,800
Master, do you really want to leave?

309
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,080
I have completed my task

310
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,960
I don't think I need to stay anymore.

311
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,200
Master, don’t you think you can leave like this?

312
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,440
Not worth it?

313
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,680
Pan'er finally lived up to his expectations and became the real King of Qin

314
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,480
Doesn't Master want to share the results with Pan'er?

315
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
Master, come here with Pan'er

316
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,800
Master, have you seen it?

317
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,840
The throne of the king in front of you

318
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,440
Half of it belongs to Master

319
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,640
Pan'er will never mind sitting with Master

320
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,400
Master, sit down

321
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,240
Your Majesty, you have always known that I have no ambitions.

322
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,360
What I hope most now

323
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,120
I just can go back to my hometown with my two wives.

324
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,600
Plowing the fields, planting flowers

325
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,840
Live the rest of your life happily

326
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,720
I'm already satisfied with this

327
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,160
Master, please stay

328
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,720
Pan'er really needs you

329
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,800
Didn't you say

330
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,280
In the future, Pan'er will annihilate the six countries and unify the world.

331
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,960
Become the First Emperor of Qin?

332
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,600
But if there is no master to help

333
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,640
Pan'er can't do it on her own.

334
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,680
you said it wrong

335
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,400
You also have Li Si and Wang Jian by your side.

336
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,040
As long as you use them well

337
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,120
I will definitely win in the future

338
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,360
Master, there is more

339
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,800
King, you will become a

340
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,280
Destroy the six kings and unify the world.

341
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,960
It doesn't make any difference whether I stay or not

342
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,720
Also, the former Apan is dead

343
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,880
The rest is King Qin Yingzheng

344
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,880
Has Master really made up his mind?

345
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,320
I hope your Majesty will fulfill your wishes

346
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,640
Since everyone has his own ambitions

347
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,320
I listen to Mr. Xiang, please do as you please. It is not convenient for me to force each other.

348
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,560
Take care of yourself

349
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,520
In order to avoid a long night and many dreams, it is better for us to leave early

350
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,440
Don't worry

351
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,320
As long as we go to Wujiapu and meet my dad

352
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,400
we will be safe

353
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,160
Shaolong, what's going on?

354
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,200
It's okay, you stay here

355
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,480
The king has a destiny

356
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,760
No one can wait without the King's handwriting

357
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,520
No one is allowed to leave Xianyang

358
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,320
I think General Wang has some misunderstandings.

359
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,320
I just want to go to Wujiapu to visit my friends

360
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,920
I don’t want to leave Xianyang at all

361
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,080
Taifu Xiang doesn’t need to make excuses

362
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,480
Anyway, you don’t have a handwriting

363
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,000
I won't let you leave the city

364
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,920
I just want to leave this place of right and wrong

365
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,720
Just live some happy days

366
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
I don't want to rebel at all

367
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,000
I really don't understand why General Wang wants to stop me?

368
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,600
Wang Jian was just following the king's orders.

369
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,160
Please forgive me, Mr. Xiang

370
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,720
That's right, the king has a loyal subordinate like you

371
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,680
Sooner or later the six countries will be unified

372
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,840
Since Taifu Xiang has great ambitions

373
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,000
why not stay here

374
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,000
Serve the king together with Wang Jian

375
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,280
What about achieving a great cause together?

376
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,040
Even if my eldest brother is willing to stay

377
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,360
I'm afraid that the king may not be able to accommodate others.

378
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,400
I'm totally different from you

379
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,640
You still want to help the king conquer the world

380
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,000
But I don't need to leave my name in history at all

381
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,320
If you consider me a friend

382
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,280
I really hope you can let us go

383
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,800
The king's order cannot be violated. Wang Jian really has no other choice.

384
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,080
I see

385
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,440
I remember Wang Jian and Xiang Taifu competing in the school field that day

386
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,240
Wang Jian could not defeat Taifu Xiang

387
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,760
It seems that I can’t win today either

388
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,080
General Wang

389
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,200
Wang Jian has the king's destiny

390
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,400
I can never let you go

391
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,720
But it's a pity that my skills are not as good as others

392
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Lost to your sword again

393
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,000
As a result, Taifu Xiang escaped

394
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,320
Wang Jian was helpless

395
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,000
Mr. Xiang, you can rest assured

396
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,920
I brought it today

397
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,800
All of them are my cronies.

398
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,440
Never leak a word

399
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,440
Thank you, General Wang

400
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,640
Wang Jian let Taifu Xiang escape today

401
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,400
I'm afraid the king may not give up here.

402
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,680
If you don't leave

403
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,760
I'm afraid you will be killed

404
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,280
thank you

405
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,240
It's really unfilial to ask a father to worry about his daughter.

406
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,480
Fang'er, dad is very happy to see you back safely.

407
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,560
Castle Lord, how is the excavation of the secret passage going?

408
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,560
Since the last time I received your confidential letter

409
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,120
I will immediately mobilize manpower to dig

410
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,760
It's a pity...

411
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,000
so far

412
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,280
秘道是由雅夫人的衣冠塚

413
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,920
Stretching all the way to the back mountain

414
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,400
It’s a pity that we haven’t been able to dig it out yet.

415
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,960
Big brother

416
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,880
Then can’t we leave through the secret passage?

417
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,400
Brother, remember last time

418
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,120
When Miss Qinqing developed fork electricity for you

419
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,120
There was an explosion

420
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,920
Can we use it to blast open the secret passage?

421
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,000
No, if it explodes like that

422
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,760
The crust on the secret passage will collapse

423
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,920
We have no way to go

424
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,680
Don't worry, there is no perfect way

425
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,640
You can't take the secret path, there are always other ways

426
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,320
What if instead of frying the end portion, the middle portion is fried?

427
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,680
Report to the Lord

428
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,520
I just received a message from the flying pigeon at the sentry post at the foot of the mountain.

429
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,120
King Qin Yingzheng has personally led the army

430
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,400
Heading to Wujiapu

431
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,560
Okay, let's go out of the back mountain through the west gate

432
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,760
There is a path in the back mountain that leads to the riverside

433
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,920
Let's go by water

434
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,560
Lord of Uborg, Big Brother

435
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,840
The mountain behind Ximen has been heavily surrounded by Yingzheng’s army.

436
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,080
Damn it, bro

437
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,040
A large number of soldiers and horses gathered at both the south gate and the north gate.

438
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,200
Is it true that we are destined to die?

439
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,720
Lord of the castle, let's take the secret path

440
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,240
But the secret passage has not yet been opened

441
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,080
take a gamble

442
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,560
The second brother, the third brother, and the castle master are leaving.

443
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,640
Yes, brother…

444
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,240
follow me

445
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:36,880
OK, let's go

446
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,520
I have something to do, you go first

447
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,280
Shaolong…

448
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,280
So late?

449
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,120
Lord of the castle

450
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,280
Shaolong

451
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,120
How long will it take to dig?

452
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,760
If my estimate is correct,

453
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,080
The secret passage should be opened soon

454
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,200
The king

455
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,640
The entire Wujiapu has been heavily surrounded by the army.

456
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,960
There are so many people waiting inside the fort that it will be difficult for them to fly.

457
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,400
You two help dig, I'll go out and take a look

458
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,360
Shaolong…

459
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,880
Go ahead and dig it, I'll be back soon

460
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,040
I love you

461
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,200
Shaolong, what are you doing?

462
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,280
It's nothing, you go back downstairs first

463
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,720
I'll come find you later, go ahead

464
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
What are you doing?

465
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,480
Give me

466
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,560
Give it to me, it's very dangerous

467
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,560
Ah Qing, take her back down there, Ah Qing

468
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,400
you won't come back

469
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,040
Even if you plant the explosives, you won't come back.

470
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,840
You didn't let us use explosives to open the secret passage at first.

471
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,800
It's because you knew it was going to collapse

472
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,840
Are you planning to die alone with Ying Zheng?

473
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,160
I don’t know what you said? Give me...

474
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,160
Do you believe me?

475
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,040
I will definitely come back to you after I finish it.

476
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,120
Give it back to me

477
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,240
we won't leave

478
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,080
I won't let you die alone

479
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,360
I won't leave you alone

480
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,520
if you really want to die

481
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,560
Let's rush out together and die together with Ying Zheng

482
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
Very dangerous

483
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
No give it to me

484
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,800
I won't give it. Give it to me.

485
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,560
Shaolong

486
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,160
Listen to me and leave quickly, okay?

487
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,880
Listen to me, I won’t leave

488
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,040
Calm down

489
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,240
I won't leave. Calm down.

490
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,920
There's no way I can leave with the three of us together.

491
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,400
I still have to take care of you

492
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,320
Trust me, I'll be fine, I won't die

493
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,120
I'll be fine

494
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,800
I don't believe it

495
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,480
Go ahead and be obedient

496
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,320
you lied to me

497
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
I won't lie to you, I won't leave

498
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,640
I don't want to lose you

499
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,520
Let's go

500
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,400
Shaolong, I don’t want to…

501
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,000
I love you

502
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,360
If we have to die, the three of us will die together

503
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,640
Your Majesty, within the entire Wujiapu

504
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,200
Only the tomb in front of me has not been searched

505
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,720
daughter?

506
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,240
King

507
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,800
Your Majesty, do you, your ministers, want to attack with fire?

508
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,960
Li Si, order someone immediately...

509
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,880
Look, I can't see myself in the mirror

510
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,600
Actually even you, Taifu Xiang...

511
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,200
Could it be that I really want to contact Xiang Shaolong?

512
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,240
Li Si, you stay

513
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,560
Everyone else will listen to orders outside the tomb

514
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,320
Yes, Your Majesty…

515
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,720
Li Si, if you are a widower

516
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,640
I don’t want anyone to mention Xiang Shaolong again in the future

517
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,840
Any tips?

518
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,920
from now on

519
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,360
Your Majesty does not want anyone to mention Xiang Shaolong again

520
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,520
Return to your Majesty, it is actually not difficult to do this.

521
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,680
Just wait until the king unifies the six kingdoms

522
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,000
issue an edict

523
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,160
Whenever Xiang Shaolong is recorded,

524
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,520
The books and records of his deeds must be burned

525
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,040
If someone collects these classics privately,

526
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,280
Or mentioned Xiang Shaolong

527
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,440
Always trap and kill

528
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,320
Burning books and trapping scholars?

529
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,840
If so, after more than ten years

530
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,440
No one will ever remember Xiang Shaolong again

531
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,760
It's really a good idea

532
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,200
No wonder Xiang Shaolong recommended you to others

533
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,960
Thank you King

534
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,840
Xiang Shaolong, I don’t want to see you again in the future.

535
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,040
You take care of yourself

536
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,960
I never thought he would let us go

537
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,120
Unexpectedly, Qin Shihuang burned books and harassed Confucians

538
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
It's for me

539
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:05,200
Long live, long live, long live…

540
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,440
Dad, look, I shot a big eagle

541
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,200
That’s awesome, you’ll have another year and a half

542
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,400
Maybe more powerful than your bearded second uncle

543
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,440
How can I use it for a year and a half?

544
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,600
I am now an invincible cumshot all over the grassland

545
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,000
Don't be so loud

546
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,600
If your mother hears this and says you don’t have a tutor,

547
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,480
Have you cut the watermelon? Qin Qing...

548
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,840
Here we go, be careful not to scare the baby by making such a loud noise.

549
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,360
Sorry, wife

550
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,000
How is it? Baby

551
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,320
Are you scared by me? Baby

552
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,560
You're still so loud

553
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,680
Mrs. Xiang, when do you have free time?

554
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,280
How about giving birth to another baby for me?

555
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,960
You only had one in ten years

556
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,760
I'm not free, I'll talk to you later

557
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,120
Have you been busy lately?

558
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,120
none of your business

559
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,720
Let's do this, find a time to come out

560
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,640
Do you have any questions about the details about having a baby?

561
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,600
It's okay if you want a baby

562
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,080
Let’s fix this “BB” Q first and then talk about it

563
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,000
You said everyone should make a portion

564
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,400
It's "BBQ" not "BB" Q

565
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,440
I've said it several times

566
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,760
Isn’t it also BBQ? It’s the same

567
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,400
hurry up

568
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,840
Do you think you can really become an uncle if you go back to ancient times?

569
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,560
Let's go...hurry up

570
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,400
If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have told you that there is equality between men and women.

571
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,880
Do you want watermelon?

572
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,840
apple

573
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,400
I don't want roast lamb, I want heart-shaped steak

574
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,920
Want to act coquettishly?

575
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,320
Okay, heart-shaped steak, right? Wait a minute

576
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,080
Fang'er has heart-shaped steak, I want heart-shaped chicken wings

577
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,040
Is it okay to use chicken wing-shaped chicken wings?

578
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:17,920
no

579
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,720
“Daddy”…

580
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,400
What to do?

581
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,680
I want to change my name

582
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,520
Change your name? It’s not easy for Boa to change her name.

583
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,160
In my time, Bao'er was very popular

584
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,320
There is also a singer named David Bowie

585
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,680
"Daddy", I just want to be a big hero

586
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,960
I want to change my name to a more prestigious one

587
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,480
What name do you want to change?

588
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I want to change it to something simple and easy to remember

589
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,640
I also need a name that’s impressive enough.

590
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,120
I've already changed your father's impressive name.

591
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,840
Ignore him, what name do you want to change?

592
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,320
I think it's like a big eagle

593
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,160
Fly freely in the sky

594
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,640
I want to be called Ayu

595
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,120
"Yu" is also good, Xiang Yu

596
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,360
Xiang Yu? Are you Xiang Yu?

597
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,400
Yes, from today on I will be called Xiang Yu

598
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,360
Not so scary, right?

599
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,480
The Overlord of Western Chu is my son?

600
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,680
Who is the Overlord of Western Chu?

601
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,480
Before that it was Qin Shihuang

602
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,640
Now he is the overlord of Western Chu again

603
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,600
How many things are you hiding from us?

604
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,280
Yes, is there anything left unsaid?

605
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,080
shut up

606
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,560
Son of a bitch, what can't you do to be Xiang Yu?

607
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,160
You really have no virtue in your previous life.

608
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,480
Let's change it to another name.

609
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,800
Stinky son...

610
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,600
206 BC

611
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
Xiang Yu, the overlord of Western Chu, burned Xianyang

612
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,360
Killed Qin's young emperor Zi Ying, and in the same year Qin died.
