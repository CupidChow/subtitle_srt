1
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,720
No matter how powerful this person is

2
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,920
You have to point him out in public

3
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,000
I want to become the prince of the Qin Kingdom

4
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,680
The position of prince was originally within easy reach

5
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
If it weren't for your appearance, Ying Zheng

6
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,080
How could I be reduced to such a situation?

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,120
Cheng Xi, you haven’t answered me yet

8
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,640
I'm really unwilling

9
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,880
I just want to take back the throne that belongs to me

10
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,560
Listen, Ying Zheng

11
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,960
This incident was entirely planned by me alone

12
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,080
Be indifferent to others

13
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,960
Cheng Yu, what kind of hero are you trying to be?

14
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,200
Why cover up the mastermind?

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Since Cheng Xi failed,

16
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,720
Behead or kill, please do as you please

17
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,440
you…

18
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,600
Come, take him out

19
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,560
Tomorrow morning, he will be executed together with all the people involved in the case.

20
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,160
Retreat from the court

21
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
How unreasonable

22
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,480
Lu Buwei is clearly the mastermind behind the assassination.

23
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,320
I really don’t understand

24
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,200
Why is Chenglong so stubborn?

25
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,320
He's actually willing to take the blame on his own

26
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,000
King

27
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Could it be that Lu Buwei has something to do with Cheng Xi?

28
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,120
Chenglong has already subdued the law

29
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,280
What's there to fear when it's already a death sentence?

30
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,360
But Wei Chen still feels strange

31
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,960
Since Lu Buwei was able to capture all the Chenggan family members in one fell swoop,

32
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,960
Why did Cheng Yu let his wife, who was pregnant with Liujia, escape?

33
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,760
Lu Buwei did it on purpose

34
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,040
Collect Chengyu's pregnant wife

35
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,000
To threaten

36
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,040
In order to protect the safety of his wife and children, Cheng Xi

37
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,320
He will also bear all the charges

38
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,760
Unexpectedly, this old fox Lu Buwei

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,640
So cunning

40
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,120
It's rare to lure a snake out of its hole this time

41
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,120
But we have to let the tiger go back to the mountain again

42
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,960
The more I think about it, the more unwilling I am.

43
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Your Majesty, why don't you let me take action?

44
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,040
Get rid of this old fox Lu Buwei

45
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,800
Your Majesty, Lu Buwei not only monopolizes military and political power,

46
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,880
Moreover, there are party members all over the government and the public, and this person will not be eliminated in one day.

47
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,920
It is really difficult for the king to control the political power, so he shows his ambitions

48
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,560
Lao Ai is willing to make another contribution to the king

49
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,080
I also want to put Lu Buwei to death

50
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,680
But Taifu Xiang...

51
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,360
It's better to wait for Taifu Xiang to recover from his injuries before making long-term plans.

52
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,880
See Mr. Lu and General Meng...

53
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,240
Lu Buwei

54
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,960
Open the door Yes

55
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,640
It's none of your business here. You go out and take good care of it.

56
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,080
No idlers are allowed in

57
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,920
yes

58
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,520
Lu Buwei

59
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,720
Isn't this my wife's?

60
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,360
What have you done to my wife?

61
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,160
Your Majesty asked me to bring this hairpin to you.

62
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,840
She wants to tell you the truth

63
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,440
Now I have the truth to take care of me, everything is fine

64
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,920
Tell you not to worry about her

65
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,920
You can rest assured

66
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,920
As long as you don't talk nonsense in front of the king

67
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,720
Your wife and belly fat

68
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,640
It will be safe and sound, otherwise...

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,920
You must not hurt my wife and children

70
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,360
It is not a pity to die as an adult, but the young son is innocent

71
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,840
Mr. Lu, just treat it like a dragon, please.

72
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,160
Do you think of it for the sake of the late king?

73
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,560
Leave this bit of blood for me

74
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,520
Cheng Xi only hopes that someone can inherit the incense lamp for me

75
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,640
It will not lead to the end of having no children or grandchildren.

76
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,880
Then Chenglong will die without regrets

77
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:44,920
Cheng Xi... I never imagined that you have deep feelings for your wife and children.

78
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,720
Lu Buwei, you have to remember

79
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,600
The promise between you and me

80
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,760
If not, Cheng Xi will go to hell after his death.

81
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,640
I won't let you go even if I'm a ghost

82
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,880
Have you finished cursing your true nature?

83
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,200
Once the curse is over, you can die peacefully

84
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Lu Buwei

85
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,960
Lu Buwei, you must remember what you and I said

86
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,760
Otherwise, I want you to die badly

87
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,920
I really can't believe it

88
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,640
He dared to curse even when he was about to die.

89
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,760
Meng Ao, after he has completed the Dharma rectification

90
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,600
Get rid of his wife immediately

91
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,080
In his wife’s womb…

92
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,960
To cut weeds, we need to get rid of the roots to avoid future troubles.

93
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,240
But... Prime Minister, you just promised him

94
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Even the king is not afraid of this

95
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,040
Are you afraid of a curse from this person?

96
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,800
Brother Xiang... wake up quickly

97
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't make the one who loves you sad

98
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,440
Brother Xiang…

99
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,440
Brother Xiang…

100
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,240
Xiang Shaolong, are you dead? Wake up

101
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,120
Brother Xiang, what should I do if he’s still awake?

102
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,240
His pulse has strengthened

103
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,480
Maybe because of too much blood loss before

104
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,840
This made him weak and he still hasn't woken up yet

105
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
Do you think he knew it was us who sent him here?

106
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,040
What exactly do you want him to know?

107
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,120
Do you decide to stay here with him or come with me?

108
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,120
Do you really want to leave?

109
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
certainly

110
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,800
The assassination attempt on Ying Zheng and Xiang Shaolong failed.

111
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,640
Of all the assassins, I'm the only one who's okay

112
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,640
Sooner or later, my lord will find out that it was me who betrayed the organization.

113
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,200
I must leave Xianyang

114
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,280
You can wait until Brother Xiang wakes up before leaving

115
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,560
It doesn't even matter whether he wakes up or not

116
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,160
The person he wants to see is not me at all

117
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,600
But as for you…

118
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Maybe he has already forgotten me

119
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,640
I believe Xiang Shaolong is not someone who is greedy for the new and forgets the old.

120
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,840
It's a pity that I am no longer the Wu Tingfang of the past

121
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
Someone, go

122
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Brother Xiang…

123
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,400
Brother Xiang, you must recover

124
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,680
I won't let you break your promise

125
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,960
Since I remember Xiang Shaolong’s words,

126
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,280
You should go back

127
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,080
I...I'm afraid

128
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,120
What else are you afraid of?

129
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
It used to be because Xiang Shaolong had a princess beside him

130
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,480
Now the princess is dead

131
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,800
Are you still worried so much?

132
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,400
But I am no longer...

133
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,240
Anyway, I don’t know how to face him again.

134
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,960
Although I don't know about you

135
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,600
What happened

136
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,160
But no matter what

137
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,400
That day you also ran away from home because of Xiang Shaolong

138
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,720
So much suffering

139
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,280
If Xiang Shaolong is a kind and righteous person

140
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,440
no matter what happened to you

141
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,240
He will love you more

142
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,200
I really don't know what to do

143
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,600
Shanrou, how dare you betray the organization?

144
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,480
The Lord has ordered us to take you back

145
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,960
Handle according to door rules

146
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,120
This operation failed

147
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,840
I will go back on my own and explain it to the lord

148
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,520
As for you saying I betrayed the organization?

149
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,120
I'm afraid there's some misunderstanding

150
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,040
You don't have to act pretentious here

151
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,440
The person who will act with you this time

152
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,760
The entire army was wiped out

153
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,360
Are you the only one okay?

154
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,280
Okay, I'll go back with you now

155
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,440
Tell the boss the whole story

156
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
Never hurt innocent people

157
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,760
Walk

158
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,960
Look at the arrow

159
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,000
Walk

160
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,120
The organization has started sending people to hunt me down.

161
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,800
In order not to inconvenience you, we will go separately

162
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,520
No, if I hadn't ruined your big deal

163
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,320
You won't be hunted by the Assassins

164
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,720
After all, I am the one who has caused you trouble.

165
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,200
How could I abandon you at this time?

166
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,360
What about Xiang Shaolong?

167
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,760
Since his life is no longer in danger now

168
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,440
Things between me and him

169
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,680
It’s not too late to talk about it slowly in the future

170
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,960
The most important thing right now is to leave this city as soon as possible

171
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,720
Shaolong, please don’t let anything happen to you

172
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,880
By God, as long as Shaolong can recover

173
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,920
Qin Qing is willing to sacrifice everything

174
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,360
I have made up my mind

175
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,280
I will never escape again

176
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,480
As long as Shaolong is by my side

177
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,960
I want to make him happy

178
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,040
clear

179
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,800
Shaolong, are you awake?

180
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,120
Do you still remember that I promised you before?

181
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,600
For you, I will never die

182
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,160
I know you won't leave me alone

183
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,960
don't leave me again

184
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
I promise you

185
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,840
Even if these days are only ten or eight days

186
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,200
Let’s also spend time happily, okay?

187
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,280
Shaolong, what are you doing?

188
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,480
I'm practicing the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms

189
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,080
Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms?

190
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,400
After lying down for so many days

191
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,560
If I don’t practice again, I will really die.

192
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,400
I don't allow you to say the word "death"

193
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,120
Barker

194
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,120
Barker?

195
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,480
It means you are stupid

196
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,000
If I could hit the target, I would have been rich a long time ago

197
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,200
Anyway, I don’t want to hear the word death in the future.

198
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,320
come with me

199
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,360
For your speedy recovery

200
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,040
My godfather and I brewed it specially for you

201
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,640
This kind of barilla wine

202
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,080
It is brewed with many kinds of medicinal materials.

203
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Drink quickly

204
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,400
Drinking in broad daylight is too boring, right?

205
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,600
Let's do this, I'll teach you how to play Bee Buzz

206
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,800
Little bee?

207
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,840
very simple

208
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,400
Two little bees flew into the flowers, flying...

209
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,160
Stop playing and drink quickly

210
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,160
Right

211
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,000
I planned to give this chain to the person I love the most

212
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,280
I wonder if you would mind being the master of this chain

213
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,640
Aren't you going to give it to your beloved Qin Qing?

214
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,040
In fact, when I first met you

215
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,040
I really thought you were Qin Qing

216
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
But you are you, Qin Qing is Qin Qing

217
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,360
It's impossible to mistake it for anything

218
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,840
when i first came here

219
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,320
I really can't let go of Qin Qing

220
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,000
But there is a saying that is right

221
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,600
Time can really dilute everything

222
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,800
I know clearly now

223
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,920
There is only you in my heart

224
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,640
I know better

225
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,760
No one is more suitable to wear this necklace than you

226
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,240
Miss Lu, if you are doing it for your third brother’s benefit

227
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,080
You shouldn't associate with him anymore

228
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,400
Brother Teng, what did I do wrong?

229
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,240
You want to stop me from interacting with Jing Jun

230
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,520
you are right

231
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,240
The mistake is that you are Lu Buwei’s daughter

232
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,240
I don't know what my dad did

233
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,320
I only know that I am me and my father is my father

234
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,680
What did my father do to interact with me and Jing Jun?

235
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,680
It doesn't matter at all

236
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,200
Yes, second brother, don’t be so unreasonable

237
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,560
Am I being unreasonable?

238
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,040
Lu Buwei almost killed our eldest brother

239
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,000
all in all

240
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
Our Taifu Mansion does not welcome anyone named Lu.

241
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,280
Please leave immediately

242
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,080
you…

243
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,320
Niangrong third brother

244
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,200
let her go

245
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,080
Second brother, you are going too far

246
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,760
How could you treat Miss Lu like this?

247
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,800
Third brother, I am also doing it for your own good.

248
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,280
you should know very well

249
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,280
Lu Buwei was the mastermind behind Cheng Yu's rebellion.

250
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,320
He even hired someone to kill our eldest brother.

251
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,760
If Lu Buwei and his eldest brother meet each other in battle one day,

252
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,680
I ask you, are you going to betray your elder brother?

253
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,040
Or do you want Miss Lu to kill her relatives out of justice?

254
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,400
I will never betray brother

255
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,000
But I won’t force Miss Lu either

256
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,120
Second brother, I can distinguish between public and private matters.

257
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,720
easy to say

258
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,760
I'm afraid that it will be difficult for you to distinguish between public and private affairs.

259
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,920
Now, Cheng Yu's rebellion has failed and the nine clans have been punished.

260
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,320
If Lu Buwei makes the same mistake again in the future,

261
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
So what do we do?

262
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,720
Do you want to be beheaded with him?

263
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,480
I…

264
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,640
Second brother, what did you just say?

265
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,360
Because Cheng Yu refused to confess

266
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,080
Lu Buwei is the mastermind behind the scenes

267
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,800
He took the blame alone and was executed at noon today.

268
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,240
Li Si, read out to everyone the charges against Cheng Xi.

269
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,600
Yes, Your Majesty

270
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,120
The traitor becomes a dragon and commits rebellion

271
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,560
The crime of assassinating the king should be punished

272
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,600
Cha Chengqiu has already harbored evil intentions

273
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,880
In the past, they fought for the position of prince

274
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,320
Buying murder and killing brother fails

275
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,040
Spread rumors and slander again

276
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,200
Cheng Xiu failed to accomplish his plan many times, but actually committed the crime himself

277
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,520
To correct the party and rebel, to assassinate the king

278
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,280
Only the emperor has eyes, and he will be captured if he fails.

279
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,520
He said: The crime of becoming a dragon is so heinous that he and his nine tribes

280
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,640
and be sentenced to death by beheading

281
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,600
They were all pulled out of the palace and circled around the city, paraded through the streets.

282
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,960
Then he beheaded him in front of the east city gate.

283
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,720
Your Majesty, can you please listen to what I have to say?

284
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,560
Mr. Xiang, please speak

285
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,960
If he rebels, he should be executed.

286
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,640
But his family and relatives are all innocent

287
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,600
Why did you kill them all?

288
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,160
Xiang Taifu

289
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,480
Do you think the reason why I want to execute them is

290
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,160
Is it because I am murderous?

291
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,160
You might as well look at the eyes of Cheng Yu and others

292
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,440
The look in each of their eyes

293
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,760
Full of hatred and spite

294
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,280
If I don’t kill the weeds as soon as possible today,

295
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,080
There will be revenge one day

296
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,240
So...there is no other way

297
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,240
They must be sentenced to death to eliminate future troubles

298
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,200
If your Majesty can conquer the people with virtue,

299
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,880
Why should we be afraid that they will retaliate?

300
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,320
Damn it, I'm the king of a country

301
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,920
The majesty of the monarch must not be shaken

302
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,760
I just want to take advantage of today's events

303
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,800
Warning to all those who intend to rebel

304
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,080
Anyone who betrays me

305
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,520
There is only a dead end in the end

306
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,880
Regal power does not necessarily require killing people.

307
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,120
Forgiving people also has royal power

308
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,800
There is no need to say more, Mr. Xiang, I have already made up my mind.

309
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,280
What's more, it has just been announced to the world

310
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,080
Is there any reason to take back the destiny?

311
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,440
This is unreasonable, Ying Zheng is simply arrogant

312
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,680
Those words just now were clearly referring to Sang and Huai.

313
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,120
Judging from the situation, it seems that the king has already understood the assassination.

314
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,360
Related to the prime minister

315
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,360
So what?

316
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,880
Now Chenglong has been executed, and there is no evidence of his death.

317
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,800
He can't do anything to me at all

318
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,600
It’s just that with the king’s character

319
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,160
Even if he is in the Ming Dynasty, he will not be able to deal with the Prime Minister

320
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,840
But there is no guarantee that he will not secretly murder the Prime Minister.

321
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,400
Ying Zheng's throne is not yet stable and he is still in his infancy.

322
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,000
Forgive him for not daring to act rashly

323
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,360
I miss you, Lu Buwei, who knows the world and has three thousand diners.

324
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,720
As long as I, Lu Buwei, give the order

325
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,800
Naturally, there are people inside and outside the government who are making comments for me.

326
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,560
As long as the trend of the king being humble and the minister being respectful is established,

327
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,800
Even if Ying Zheng doesn't want to abdicate in favor of someone more worthy, he can't

328
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,680
Ying Zheng, I want you to see clearly

329
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,920
Who is the real one in the world today?

330
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,400
What? You told me to let Lu Buwei go for now?

331
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,680
Mr. Xiang, you should know very well

332
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,800
Lu Buwei is so ambitious

333
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
If I don’t get rid of him today,

334
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,560
I'm just afraid that sooner or later he will bite me back

335
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,040
Also, don’t forget, Taifu Xiang

336
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,400
You almost died this time

337
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,840
It’s also thanks to him

338
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,800
To be honest, Lu Buwei and I actually

339
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,400
There's no deep hatred

340
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,440
He wants to kill me this time

341
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,320
I just want to use this matter to attack you, the king.

342
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,160
In short, since Lu Buwei wants to go against me,

343
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,320
I will never let him go

344
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,160
Taifu Xiang, you said

345
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,480
Are you willing to help others get rid of Lu Buwei?

346
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,240
Your Majesty, it’s not that I don’t want to help you deal with Lu Buwei

347
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,480
But what I care about now is more

348
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,840
Your Majesty, what path should you take in the future?

349
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,280
Lu Buwei has always been eyeing the throne of others.

350
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,640
As long as this person is not eliminated for one day

351
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,520
I walk on thin ice every day

352
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,640
What future is there?

353
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,840
Lu Buwei has been the prime minister for so long

354
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,920
Whether internally or externally

355
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,640
All have certain influence

356
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,200
Besides, Your Majesty, you have just ascended the throne.

357
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,800
Even the throne is not yet secure

358
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,440
In fact, you really need it

359
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,200
Use Lu Buwei to calm people's hearts

360
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,160
This will be good for you in the future

361
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,400
So how long do we have to wait?

362
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,200
History has actually been doomed for a long time

363
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,640
The king will definitely annihilate the six countries in the future

364
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,960
Unify the world

365
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,600
And Lu Buwei will also have a dismal ending.

366
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,320
Your Majesty, why are you still in a hurry?

367
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,040
I almost forgot

368
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,200
Taifu Xiang is a person from the future world

369
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,360
You must know about the future world

370
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,560
When can I get rid of Lu Buwei?

371
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,960
When will we be able to rule the world?

372
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,880
Become the Qin Shi Huangdi in the mouth of Taifu Xiang?

373
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,920
In fact, things in the future

374
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,960
It is not convenient for me to reveal too much to the king.

375
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,400
Because I'm afraid it will affect history

376
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,800
affect the results

377
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,600
But looking at it the other way around, if I tell you

378
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,920
This will only make you, my king, do nothing

379
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,920
What Taifu Xiang said also makes sense

380
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,760
But no matter what

381
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,640
As long as Taifu Xiang can know the past and the future,

382
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
beside the widow

383
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,960
I believe that I will be able to dominate the world in the future

384
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,320
This is the most important thing

385
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,880
Taifu Xiang has made great contributions to others many times

386
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,400
I will definitely order someone to record it in the history books.

387
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,800
What do you think would happen if history changed?

388
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,960
Come, pass on Li Si

389
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,440
Li Si meets the king

390
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,920
Li Si, I order you to bring Taifu Xiang immediately

391
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,120
The merits of helping others many times

392
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,400
Recorded in detail in history books

393
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,400
So that Taifu Xiang’s name will remain in history

394
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,240
The king really ordered Li Sijiang’s eldest brother’s deeds

395
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,840
Is it recorded in history books?

396
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,160
It’s rare for the king to put his elder brother in such high regard

397
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,560
Why does eldest brother still seem so unhappy?

398
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,440
The problem is the history books I read in my time

399
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,160
There are mentions of Ying Zheng, Lu Buwei, and Li Si

400
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,720
Even Mr. Zou’s "Theory of the Five Virtues from the Beginning to the End" mentioned it

401
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,120
But the three words Xiang Shaolong

402
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,400
Never mentioned it

403
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,120
Shaolong

404
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,040
Will it be the history book you read in the 21st century?

405
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,280
Because the records are too complicated and numerous

406
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,200
So what if you haven’t read yourself yet?

407
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,040
yes

408
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Maybe when big brother returns to the future world

409
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,400
I will see my name in the history books again

410
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,800
It would be nice if it was

411
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,080
At least you don’t have to worry so much

412
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,160
But I'm just afraid before I go back

413
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,560
Something has happened

414
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,440
Big brother means...

415
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,200
Will Lu Buwei still harm you?

416
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,680
I'm not worried about Lu Buwei

417
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,520
Now I'm most worried about one person

418
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,920
It's all my fault, I said not to mention the word "death"

419
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,040
Don't be unhappy

420
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,720
I traveled a long way that day and came back with some courage.

421
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,040
All to fulfill your wish to return to the future world

422
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,880
But I don't know why, when I think of you leaving

423
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,320
I can't help it anymore

424
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,520
Stop it, it's not my decision whether to go or not.

425
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,440
Just let it take its course.

426
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,400
But as you said

427
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,800
You stay in ancient times for one more day

428
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,040
You will become more and more dangerous

429
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,920
I don't want anything to happen to you

430
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,960
Go back

431
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,880
Give it to you

432
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,120
What is it?

433
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,240
lucky star

434
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,040
Lucky star?

435
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,440
I'll watch the stars with you that night

436
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,040
Didn't you say that you really want to pick the stars from the sky?

437
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,160
I can't pick off the stars in the sky and give them to you

438
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,160
Now I will give you a lucky star instead

439
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,800
in our countryside

440
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,560
Think lucky stars can bring people luck

441
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
What's wrong?

442
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,960
I don’t know why every time I feel happy

443
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,320
I'm afraid I'll lose everything suddenly

444
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,360
In fact, happiness is momentary

445
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,440
As long as you're happy at this moment, that's fine

446
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,880
Who knows what will happen in the future?

447
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,960
Shaolong

448
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,080
These days are the happiest in my life

449
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,280
I hope I can keep it forever

450
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,880
The sunset is infinitely beautiful, but it’s almost dusk

451
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,640
If the sun never sets today

452
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,520
You said how good that would be

453
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,000
Did you know that the sunset is infinitely beautiful?

454
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,200
What does it mean that it's almost dusk?

455
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,480
Of course I know

456
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,800
Then why are you saying such things at this time?

457
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,120
What does it matter whether the sun goes down or not?

458
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,000
If you go down today, you will rise again tomorrow.

459
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,640
Although the sun rises and sets, it remains unchanged

460
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,680
But the change of personnel is always unpredictable

461
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,120
I'm afraid I'll be separated from you after today

462
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,840
It’s so rare to wait for thunder and lightning

463
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,160
Big brother is not here at all, which is really annoying

464
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,040
Brother, it would be nice if you came back, follow me

465
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,120
missed this opportunity

466
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,240
I don’t know how long I have to wait

467
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,280
What happened?

468
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
You will know if you come with me, come on

469
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,440
Come on, look, Brother Teng

470
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,440
Big brother

471
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,200
Thanks

472
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,280
Brother, have you seen it?

473
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,600
I added a dozen more copper coils

474
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,560
When thunder and lightning comes from the sky

475
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,080
Those fish shreds were intact

476
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,080
Stop talking so much and get the communicator

477
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,000
Shaolong, you can finally go back to the 21st century

478
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,280
Brother, what are you waiting for?

479
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,640
Such big thunder and lightning doesn't happen very often.

480
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,680
Come here quickly

481
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,600
Brother, it worked

482
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,280
Shaolong, please go back

483
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,200
missed this opportunity

484
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,440
You may never go back

485
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,720
But after I go back

486
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,040
I'll never come back again

487
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,320
That's where you belong

488
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,680
But you are not there

489
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,480
Shaolong, when you love someone, you want them to be happy

490
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,240
You have gone through all kinds of hardships just for this day

491
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
Since I love you

492
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,480
I can't even force you to stay here.

493
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,320
You go

494
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,880
Brother, the communicator is responding

495
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,320
Does it mean that the future world has received your signal?

496
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,480
Shaolong, let’s go

497
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,480
You go

498
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,520
You go

499
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,680
Brother, let’s go, it’s too late if it’s too late

500
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,160
Shaolong, let’s go. We’re almost out of time.

501
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:27,920
Shaolong, let's go. We can't make it in time. Let's go.

502
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,440
Shaolong, take care of yourself

503
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,520
Shaolong

504
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,120
Big brother

505
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,840
Shaolong

506
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,960
Unexpectedly, there was a big thunder and lightning

507
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,360
They actually created a match made in heaven

508
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,480
It’s hard for me, I spent so much effort

509
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,520
In the end, being a villain is useless

510
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,560
What's wrong with being a villain?

511
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,640
If it weren’t for my second brother, you are smart

512
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,200
How can you force your eldest brother to decide to stay?

513
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,600
Our future sister-in-law

514
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,160
How can I be as happy as I am now?

515
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,920
Are you laughing from the bottom of your heart?

516
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,760
I said, second brother, you have been their matchmaker this time.

517
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,080
By the way, brother, what should I do with this communicator?

518
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,800
I have decided not to go back

519
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,440
If you like it, take it

520
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,960
Otherwise, just throw it away

521
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,600
No, throw it away if one day he

522
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,280
Shaolong, if you regret it, what should you do?

523
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,880
I will keep this communicator for the time being.

524
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,520
I will keep this communicator for the time being.

525
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,160
Qing'er, according to godfather, you are not interested in keeping

526
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,120
but to prevent future

527
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,360
What if the young dragon cannot leave when he wants to?

528
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,600
Even my godfather, you make fun of me

529
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,640
I think Mr. Zou must have been stunned by the electric shock.

530
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,160
You are stupid, you can leave even if you don't want to

531
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,600
I would rather stay here and be an ancient person

532
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,240
Qing'er, let's talk about it

533
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,880
You should toast Mr. Teng with a glass of matchmaking wine

534
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,560
As long as everyone is happy, I'm happy to be the host

535
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,880
Are you good at drinking?

536
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,560
Of course this kind of thing is done by men

537
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,760
Third brother, go get some wine

538
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,160
Stop fighting, brother

539
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,480
In short, one meal per person will never fail

540
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Future sister-in-law, are you right?

541
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,040
Yes...one meal per person

542
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,080
good

543
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,240
Third brother, you really have a way

544
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,640
Even Jixiang Winery

545
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,040
You can also buy Daqu Zunjiu that has been treasured for many years

546
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,280
Of course, it’s rare that today my eldest brother thanks the media

547
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,760
Are we going to drink bad wine?

548
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,480
Second brother

549
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,000
A lot of gold, go and take a look...

550
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,280
Second brother, he said there is a lot of gold ahead

551
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,280
Go over and have a look

552
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,400
A word of gold? What is it?

553
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,240
Brother, do you know what it is? Brother

554
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,960
I don't know, brother

555
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,000
A word worth a thousand dollars?

556
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,280
Second brother, what word is this so valuable?

557
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,880
"Valuable" is not a word

558
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,600
They are all the talented people under the leadership of Prime Minister Lu

559
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,440
The astonishing masterpiece "Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals" compiled by

560
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,560
Lu's Spring and Autumn Period?

561
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,840
This set of Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals is truly incisive and unique.

562
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,680
Every word is a pearl

563
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,840
So Prime Minister Lu specially rewarded

564
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,640
As long as anyone can change any word in the book

565
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,240
You can get a thousand gold reward

566
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,920
Come and see, one word is worth a thousand taels of gold

567
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,760
Let's go and see

568
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,520
Li Taishi

569
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,480
Brother Teng, Brother Jing

570
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,080
Li Taishi, I really didn’t expect that

571
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,160
Even you want to get Lu Buwei's thousand gold reward

572
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,480
You two don't know anything

573
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,800
Li Si used to be under the Prime Minister's door

574
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,240
Lu's Chunqiu also contributed to the writing

575
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,760
According to Taishi's opinion

576
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,840
Is it true that not a single word of Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals can be deleted or modified?

577
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,760
It's not as simple as it seems

578
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,840
More than one word of Lu's Spring and Autumn Period is worth a thousand pieces of gold

579
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,120
This Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals dares to boast that every word is worth a fortune

580
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,000
There must be some extraordinary opinions contained in the book

581
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,800
I still can't believe that not a single word in it can be changed.

582
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,040
You don’t know something anymore

583
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,120
Lu's Spring and Autumn Period is Prime Minister Lu

584
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,200
It was compiled by combining the strengths of hundreds of his disciples.

585
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,040
It’s really every word.

586
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,120
Not to mention anything else, it was just what Lu Shi Chunqiu proposed.

587
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,880
Talented people should be elected to govern the country

588
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,120
Just what he said in the minds of the people all over the world

589
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,280
Now we have been fighting for many years, and we have just completed our military service

590
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,760
We have to rush to build the Great Wall again

591
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,960
The monarch who works so hard for the people

592
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,760
May I ask who is capable?

593
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,160
It's a pity that the current king is not only ignorant of the people's sentiments

594
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:02,360
They even forced a wedding during the period of observing filial piety, regardless of filial piety.

595
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,400
Eliminate dissidents and kill your own brothers

596
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,240
It’s true that both humans and gods are angry

597
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,880
Therefore, Lu's Spring and Autumn Period also proposed

598
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,680
If the king is foolish and unprincipled

599
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,600
We should choose more talented people and return the government to the people

600
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,120
Really insightful

601
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,080
You're right...choose a worthy person...

602
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,240
Words are tools to express emotions

603
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,120
How could it not be possible to change it?

604
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,000
It’s just about the relationship between the Lu family and

605
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,760
So no one dares to change

606
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,440
I really bow down to Lu Buwei

607
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,360
To be able to act like this

608
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,920
Thinking about the time when I was under the sect of Lu Mansion

609
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,000
He also participated in the writing of Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals

610
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,680
The reason why Lu Buwei wanted to write Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals

611
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,320
The purpose is only to spread bad words against the king.

612
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,000
Make a move for him

613
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,600
I have just read this volume of Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals

614
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,880
Although it combines hundreds of political theories into one

615
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,360
But in the final analysis

616
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,320
The focus is always on advocating the idea that the king is humble and the people are valued

617
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,040
and the abdication system that promoted Yao and Shun

618
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,680
Lu Buwei used this to create public opinion

619
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,400
Praise yourself, belittle the king

620
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Obviously he wants to take his place as king

621
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,440
Mr. Xiang, if we don't stop this immediately,

622
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,160
I'm afraid Lu Buwei will become more and more popular.

623
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,800
The time of great achievement

624
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,080
At that time, only the monarch and his ministers will change their positions.

625
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
The status of the king is not guaranteed

626
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,560
Don't worry

627
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,120
No matter how powerful Lu Buwei's power is,

628
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,160
History is always doomed

629
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,360
He always ended up miserable.

630
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,200
Why is this so?

631
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,640
Godfather, what happened?

632
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,560
Just now I watched the stars

633
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,480
Found that the new star of the emperor was dim

634
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,720
And there is a faint tendency of decline

635
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,760
This is a sign of great evil

636
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,440
How could it be?

637
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,920
Brother, Eunuch Zhao is here

638
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,600
Eunuch Zhao is here

639
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,080
Taifu Xiang, I don’t know what happened to the king.

640
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,360
I have been locking myself in the palace bedroom today.

641
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,320
Don't let the slaves in

642
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,000
I just ordered my servant to invite Taifu Xiang into the palace as soon as possible.

643
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,440
Report to the king, Taifu Xiang has arrived

644
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,360

Xiang Taifu

646
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,800
This time it's amazing

647
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,280
Look, I can't see myself in the mirror

648
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,280
Actually even you, Taifu Xiang...

649
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,160
Tell me quickly

650
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,960
