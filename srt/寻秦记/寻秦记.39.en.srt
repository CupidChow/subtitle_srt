1
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,040
Taifu Xiang, you must not enter the palace

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,040
The Ying Zheng in the palace is fake

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,680
Why does the king want to put Qing'er under house arrest for no reason?

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,760
Because he wants to deal with me

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,200
Xiang Shaolong failed to protect the city, causing the city to fall

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,760
I hope your Majesty will forgive me

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,400
The Battle of Qicheng resulted in numerous casualties

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,240
Could it be that you just asked the king to forgive me?

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,800
Just want to muddle through?

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,200
Of course not, my lord, have you forgotten?

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,360
Your Majesty and I once had an agreement

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,640
I just pretended to be defeated and retreated to Qicheng.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,600
Then wait for Wang Jian's army to arrive

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,640
Are they attacking Li Mu's army from both inside and outside?

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,600
So what?

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,360
It's strange, I waited for ten days

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,080
I didn’t see Wang Jian’s army arriving either.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,320
Don't know what the reason is?

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,240
Because this period coincided with the Dongshao Civil Rebellion,

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,760
That's why Wang Jian was just a few days late.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,640
It's just because it's a few days late

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,800
That's why I lost the battle

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,720
Fortunately, Li Mu kept his word and did not massacre the city.

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,160
Otherwise, the number of casualties would have been even greater.

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,400
How unreasonable

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,200
Taifu Xiang's words are just blaming me.

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

28
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,560
Xiang Shaolong dare not

29
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,560
Xiang Shaolong just hopes that the king understands

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,440
The defeat of this battle is not my responsibility alone.

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,040
I'm already satisfied

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,240
Xiang Shaolong

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,200
I feel that you are becoming more and more unruly towards the king

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,920
Queen Mother, please don’t misunderstand

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
In fact, it’s not that Xiang Shaolong is impudent

36
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,960
It’s just that the king spoke in a particularly royal manner today.

37
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,040
Xiang Shaolong, you must remember

38
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,280
If the king is not a king, the minister is not a minister

39
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,400
How can we govern the country and bring peace to the world in the future?

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,480
Xiang Shaolong understands, by the way, Your Majesty

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Do you still remember before I went to war?

42
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,560
You once promised me something

43
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,040
What did I promise you?

44
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,040
Your Majesty, have you forgotten?

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,440
The king takes care of everything

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,640
Is it any wonder that one or two things have been forgotten?

47
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,360
What on earth is going on? Just tell me

48
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,040
Error 504 (Server Error)!!1504.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,800
If I say that the king promised Xiang Shaolong before

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,760
Wouldn't it be outrageous to pass the throne to me?

51
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,600
Xiang Shaolong, you...

52
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,520
Bold Xiang Shaolong

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,280
Don't rely on the fact that you have saved my mother and son.

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,600
Becoming more and more presumptuous

55
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,480
Based on what you just said

56
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,240
The king can punish you to death

57
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,880
Xiang Shaolong, this time you are really guilty of death.

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,440
Long blessings, King and Queen Mother

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,080
Prime Minister Lu, you have worked so hard and mobilized so many people.

60
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,880
What happened?

61
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,840
The truth is that we are here to capture the traitor Xiang Shaolong.

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,080
What exactly did Xiang Shaolong commit?

63
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,840
Ask Prime Minister Lu to personally lead people to arrest him

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,320
The truth is that Xiang Shaolong is a spy of Zhao State

65
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,200
The defeat of Qicheng was basically a premeditation between him and Li Mu

66
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,960
Don't just talk nonsense, what evidence do you have?

67
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,000
If you don't want others to know, you have to do nothing unless you do it yourself

68
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,520
Xiang Shaolong, when you were in Qicheng

69
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,160
I once met Li Mu when I was out of the city alone. Could this be the case?

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
Yes, I even drank with him

71
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,000
Return the Feihong Sword to him, what's the problem?

72
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,120
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

73
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,880
The city was lost

74
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,160
This is too much of a coincidence

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,760
Also, the truth has been tipped off

76
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,520
The reason why Qicheng fell so quickly

77
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,640
All because a group of Mohists opened the city gate

78
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,960
He personally recruited this group of Mohists

79
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,240
What's your explanation?

80
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,800
I don't think I need to explain anymore

81
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,160
I see you have nothing to say.

82
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,800
Come, escort the traitors back and wait for them to be punished.

83
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,800
Okay, no need, I will go back with you myself

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,960
I'm afraid the king and the queen mother won't intercede for me either.

85
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,840
Please, my lord, please tell Mr. Qin.

86
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,280
I will definitely visit her later

87
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,400
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, Your Majesty, and the old ministers will take your leave first.

88
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,160
Lu Buwei really accused Zhao Guo of being a spy

89
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,720
Take Xiang Shaolong to prison

90
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,960
We haven't had time to punish Xiang Shaolong yet

91
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,800
I didn’t expect Lu Buwei to take a step ahead of us.

92
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,960
Bring all his men into the palace to capture Xiang Shaolong

93
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,200
Xiang Shaolong has always been an enemy of Lu Buwei

94
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,080
And Lu Buwei also wished that

95
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,400
Get rid of Xiang Shaolong and then quickly

96
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,440
This time we summon Xiang Shaolong into the palace

97
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,920
I just want to kill him

98
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,160
Now Lu Buwei is taking care of it

99
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Things will be much easier to handle

100
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,440
Xiang Shaolong is indeed not easy to deal with

101
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,200
Just now, I was robbed by him

102
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,840
Almost showing off

103
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,280
Not only can we borrow a knife to kill people this time,

104
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,040
And I stayed out of it. God helped me.

105
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,000
This time it's bad...

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,360
Third brother, what news did you hear?

107
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,160
I received the message

108
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,360
Said that the eldest brother was taken to the prison by Lu Buwei

109
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,280
How could this be?

110
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,240
Lu Buwei, this thief

111
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,160
Slandering the eldest brother as a spy of the State of Zhao

112
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,960
He also said that the reason why the battle of Wucheng was defeated

113
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,280
It’s all because of the conspiracy between the eldest brother and Li Mu of Zhao State

114
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,160
Isn’t this reasonable? Everyone knows that Qicheng was defeated in the battle.

115
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,040
It was caused by Lu Buwei delaying reinforcements.

116
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,480
It's so bloody squirting

117
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,600
What about the king? Could it be that the king

118
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,880
He actually allowed Lu Buwei to arrest Brother Xiang at will.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,240
Yes, what is the king's reaction?

120
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,760
The king showed no reaction at all from beginning to end.

121
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,120
I suspect that the king and Lu Buwei had planned it in advance.

122
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,840
The eldest brother and the king have always had a close relationship

123
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,400
Logically speaking, it is impossible for your Majesty to refuse to save you even if you die.

124
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,120
This time the king put Qing'er under house arrest in the palace first

125
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,520
He also allowed Lu Buwei to arrest Shaolong later.

126
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,960
It seems that the relationship between the king and Shaolong

127
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,760
Something unknown must have happened

128
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,000
What to do?

129
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,080
Lu Buwei has always hated Brother Xiang deeply.

130
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,000
Now Brother Xiang is in his hands

131
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,280
He will definitely be disadvantageous to him

132
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,440
We must find a way to rescue Brother Xiang as soon as possible

133
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,920
Miss Tingfang, let’s rush to Wujiapu immediately

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Please help me, Master Wubao

135
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,320
No, there is a distance between Wujiabao and Xianyang

136
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,680
I'm afraid I may not be able to make it in time if I come back once.

137
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,240
It is difficult to put out a fire near by water far away

138
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,680
Who else can help us now?

139
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,880
good and gentle

140
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,280
Shanrou said that she would not leave so soon

141
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,320
She is probably still in Xianyang City now

142
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,520
I'll contact her as soon as possible and ask her to help rob the prison

143
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,360
Wait a minute

144
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,640
Since Lu Buwei intends to capture Shaolong,

145
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,120
He knew we were going to rob the prison

146
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,160
Therefore, the guards inside and outside the prison must be tight.

147
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,720
It seems that Shaolong will not be saved so easily this time.

148
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,800
Do we just sit back and wait for death?

149
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,680
Let Brother Xiang be beaten by Lu Buwei... wait a minute

150
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,440
I know someone else who can help us

151
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,040
What? You want me to steal the cell seal?

152
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,720
Not bad, Ronger

153
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,600
I know it's unfair to you

154
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,200
But we really have no choice

155
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,920
Otherwise, I would never let you take this risk.

156
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,000
Imprisoning Taifu Xiang was my father’s intention

157
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,480
You want me to help you save him

158
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,280
Doesn’t it mean that I am going against my father?

159
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,680
My elder brother's life may be in danger at any time

160
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
Ronger, I beg you, please help me

161
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,800
Why must I be between you and my father?

162
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,240
Can only choose one

163
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,640
Jing Jun, can you understand my situation?

164
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,760
It never occurred to me to be inconsiderate of your situation

165
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,360
But I never thought about it

166
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,520
I want you to be an enemy of your father for me

167
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,160
Ronger

168
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,000
I just hope you can tell right from wrong

169
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,040
You should know the current situation best.

170
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,840
Ronger, I absolutely believe it

171
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,680
You won't be a person who doesn't distinguish between right and wrong.

172
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,920
Now your father has become the Prime Minister of a country

173
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,520
But still failed to satisfy his power and desires

174
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,240
The reason why he wants to eliminate my eldest brother

175
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,800
He's just afraid that my eldest brother will hinder him

176
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,800
The wolfish ambition to usurp the throne

177
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,600
For you to betray your father is called treason.

178
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,760
Then he intends to rebel

179
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,360
What does it mean to be disloyal to your Majesty?

180
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,760
if you can

181
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,840
I'd rather not care about anything and stay out of it

182
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,800
My elder brother also thought this way

183
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,400
It's just that your father won't let him stay out of it

184
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,200
Ronger, you always know your father’s temperament best.

185
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,560
If we don't try to rescue my brother soon

186
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,520
There is only one way for him to die

187
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,320
I…

188
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,480
Rong'er, I know you feel sad

189
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,960
But you know what?

190
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,120
When I decided to say this to you

191
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,240
My heart is no better than yours

192
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,320
I really didn’t expect our guy to be so smart.

193
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,560
The wise and brave Taifu Xiang

194
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,720
There will be a day when I will become a prisoner of my subordinates.

195
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
Xiang Shaolong, why are you laughing?

196
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,000
Originally, I thought you were smart, Mr. Lu.

197
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,960
But I didn’t expect that you would also be fooled.

198
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,720
Who was fooled by the truth?

199
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,560
He is the king who is currently enjoying life in the palace

200
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,840
But even if you don't take action

201
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,720
I don't think he will let me go either

202
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,000
Xiang Shaolong, you don’t need to force your words to confuse the truth.

203
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,320
The king always obeys your words

204
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,360
How could it harm you?

205
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,480
Of course the real king would not

206
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,880
It's a pity that the one in the palace now is a fake king

207
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,400
What? Is this king a fake?

208
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,040
I thought you were very smart, Mr. Lu

209
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,840
Can't you see that this king has no opinion?

210
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,240
Do you need the Queen Mother to be your spokesperson for everything?

211
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,880
Xiang Shaolong, don’t think that I am so stupid

212
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,480
I believe you just based on your few random words

213
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,520
Mr. Lu, of course you are not stupid.

214
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,760
if you are stupid

215
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,840
You wouldn't hire an assassin to pretend to be a Mohist.

216
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,800
As a result, I was attacked first

217
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,280
Give you a chance

218
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,720
Use the name of treason and fraud to convict me.

219
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,200
But there's one thing you might not know

220
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,720
Before you enter the palace to catch me

221
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,040
The king is having a headache. How should I be convicted?

222
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,800
Who knew you would sacrifice yourself automatically?

223
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,000
I think your Majesty, he is really smiling from ear to ear now.

224
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,080
Xiang Shaolong

225
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,120
You have repeatedly said that this king is a fake

226
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,800
What evidence is there?

227
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,840
Lao Ai

228
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,600
Lao Ai? What does Lao Ai have to do with this matter?

229
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,360
Don't you find it strange?

230
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,920
How could the king suddenly

231
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,800
He actually had an affair with this Queen Mother

232
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,680
Having no power, no relatives, and no martial arts skills

233
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,040
And people who are completely worthless

234
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,600
Suddenly so valued?

235
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,600
Also, why did the king suddenly

236
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,560
Have no feelings for someone

237
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
And the queen mother who made her family scandal public

238
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,680
Become inseparable, mother and son have deep love?

239
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,120
If Mr. Lu, you are smart,

240
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,640
You also know there must be something fishy going on

241
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,960
All quit

242
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,040
Yes, Mr. Xiang...

243
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,720
If this king is fake

244
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,880
So where is the real king now?

245
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,240
Now that Lao Ai has found a fake king to replace the real king,

246
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,680
I think the real king should be dead

247
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,000
I don’t believe the truth

248
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,840
Lao Ai is looking for someone to come back and replace the king.

249
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,000
You can fight and win the truth

250
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,240
Mr. Lu, don’t forget

251
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,920
It won't be long before the king will hold a formal crowning ceremony.

252
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,640
On that day you will be successful and retire

253
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,280
You must return your military power to the king with both hands.

254
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,480
Also, when Lao Ai has the power

255
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,360
With his style and the grudge between you and him

256
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,080
I don’t think I need to say more

257
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,080
You also know what will happen to you

258
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,240
Just him? I'm afraid this so-called king

259
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,200
We may not be lucky enough to wait until the day of the crowning ceremony

260
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,480
It turns out that you have been planning to usurp the throne for a long time

261
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,200
before that

262
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,200
Does Ben really want to eradicate Ying Zheng?

263
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,640
I was still worried about it

264
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,520
Now that we know this king is fake

265
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,600
The truth can finally fulfill your wish

266
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,800
Your plan is good, but there are still loopholes

267
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,720
Vulnerability?

268
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,800
Mr. Lu, have you ever thought about it?

269
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,520
If the king is before the crowning ceremony

270
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,680
What will be the consequences if there are three long and two short sides?

271
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,760
There will be two consequences, first

272
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,000
As Mr. Lu said

273
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,000
Because the Ying family has no heirs

274
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,600
Your situation is stronger than others

275
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,640
When the time comes, people will naturally elect you to be the king.

276
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,280
Today, apart from the true nature

277
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,960
Who else in the DPRK can... Maybe

278
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,080
This will happen in the second possibility

279
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,600
It was after Lao Ai found out that the king was dead

280
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,320
Point the finger directly at you

281
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,960
Goddamn

282
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,280
Could it be that the truth is afraid of him?

283
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,960
Mr. Lu, don’t forget

284
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,560
There is a Queen Mother behind Lao Ai

285
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,760
Can you get rid of the suspicion and successfully ascend the throne?

286
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,520
It’s also an unknown number

287
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,080
in case you are unlucky

288
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,000
What if Lao Ai took advantage and became a king?

289
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,520
Wouldn't that be a bad deal for you?

290
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,080
You are so scheming

291
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,280
There's no reason to take such a big risk

292
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:28,520
But if someone accidentally kills the king

293
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,080
That's another matter

294
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,560
you mean…

295
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,480
If someone accidentally lets Xiang Shaolong go,

296
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,280
And this Xiang Shaolong has a grudge in his heart

297
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,960
Run and kill this king

298
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,440
Won’t all your problems be wiped away by then?

299
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,640
Xiang Shaolong, you know the truth and want to kill you

300
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,320
Why do you keep saying things?

301
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,720
What is your purpose?

302
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,080
Because of a person, Qin Qing

303
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,560
Why should I believe you?

304
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,280
except me

305
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,720
Only Qin Qing knows the secret of this king

306
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,720
Lao Ai wants to threaten me

307
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,600
Qin Qing has already been placed under house arrest in the palace.

308
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,840
I think after I die

309
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,040
Lao Ai will also kill Qin Qing

310
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,320
Mr. Lu also knows the relationship between me and Qin Qing very well.

311
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,320
I want to save her

312
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,280
Only if I am forced to cooperate with you

313
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,080
Xiang Shaolong

314
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,560
I never thought you could be such a passionate person

315
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,880
I know it's hard to make you believe me based on one-sided words

316
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,880
So be it, you have many chances to kill me anyway

317
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,800
Why don't you go back to the palace to investigate first?

318
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,160
Is this king real or fake?

319
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,560
Then consider whether to cooperate with me

320
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,200
Unknown Prime Minister Lu asked to see him late at night

321
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,280
Why?

322
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,280
The old minister wants to discuss with the king

323
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,920
How to deal with Xiang Shaolong's matter

324
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,520
How to deal with Xiang Shaolong?

325
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,040
This matter is of great importance

326
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,360
Let's wait until tomorrow to summon Marquis Changxin and the Queen Mother

327
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,560
Think about it in the long term

328
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Dealing with a mere Xiang Shaolong

329
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,880
Why bother with so much effort?

330
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,440
What Prime Minister Lu said is true

331
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,840
It is unknown what Prime Minister Lu wants to discuss with me...

332
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
After being tortured by the old ministers

333
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,240
Xiang Shaolong has confessed

334
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,320
He is indeed a spy of Zhao State

335
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,080
Did Xiang Shaolong seriously admit his crime?

336
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,880
Prime Minister Lu is really shrewd and admirable

337
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,400
According to the laws of the Qin Dynasty, Xiang Shaolong’s crime should be punished

338
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,440
Now we can only wait for the king's fate

339
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,840
Now that the evidence is conclusive

340
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,800
Everything is done according to the wishes of Prime Minister Lu

341
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,240
But Xiang Shaolong has saved the king many times

342
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,040
If he were to beheaded

343
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,880
Your Majesty, are you not afraid of attracting criticism?

344
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,040
Xiang Shaolong doesn't know what's going on

345
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,840
He has betrayed the trust that the widow has always placed in him.

346
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,640
Prime Minister Lu doesn’t have to worry too much

347
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,920
Kill this person as soon as possible to serve as a warning to others

348
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,160
With these words from Your Majesty, I feel relieved.

349
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,000
Then do as the king wishes

350
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,320
father

351
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,920
Ronger, it’s already late at night and you haven’t gone to bed yet

352
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,760
What are you doing in dad's study?

353
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,320
I don’t know why my daughter couldn’t sleep all night

354
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,080
So I came to my dad’s study to read Lu’s Spring and Autumn Annals

355
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,040
Aren’t you always afraid of reading?

356
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,120
People will change

357
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,360
That's best

358
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,160
But reading is reading

359
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,640
Don't mess with dad's sigil

360
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,240
I know, how could my daughter mess around?

361
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,760
Although these talismans are not used for dispatching troops and generals,

362
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,520
But in and out of the palace

363
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,280
They are needed everywhere

364
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,200
Especially in the prison cell

365
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,560
Error 504 (Server Error)!!1504.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

366
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,840
This talisman cannot be lost.

367
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,040
Ronger, you should go to bed early after reading.

368
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,960
My daughter knows

369
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,960
Dad, you should go to bed early and I’ll send you off

370
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,120
Prime Minister Lu is destined to kill Xiang Shaolong in advance

371
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,760
Xiang Shaolong, you will also have today

372
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,880
As soon as there is any news about Xiang Shaolong, please inform me immediately

373
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,640
Yes, Mr. Hou...

374
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What's wrong? Don't you really want to see me?

375
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,080
You are so brave, as a felon in the imperial court

376
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,640
How dare you break into the Hou Mansion without permission?

377
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
Are you really not afraid of death?

378
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,960
Bold? In terms of boldness, I am never as good as you.

379
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,120
Even the king can be your puppet

380
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,960
I don't quite understand what you mean

381
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,920
I don't know about others

382
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,440
Do you think I can’t see through the fact that you are looking for someone to replace the king?

383
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,840
The great king you speak of

384
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,320
Basically, you asked Zhao Pan to come back and replace him that day.

385
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,720
That's of course false

386
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,600
You don't have to act anymore

387
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,480
Pan'er has already died in your hands.

388
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,120
Who is that king now?

389
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,720
You know best

390
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,080
I really can't hide anything from you

391
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,520
But it's a pity that Ying Zheng has no bones left

392
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,360
How can you get me?

393
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
then you are wrong

394
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,280
If Lu Buwei knew

395
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,640
If the king you are now is a lie

396
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,720
How long can you continue to be the Supreme Emperor?

397
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,240
The position of King Qin

398
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,560
Lu Buwei wants to sit down as much as you do

399
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,200
You said that Lu Buwei was on the day of the crowning ceremony?

400
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,000
Will the military power be handed over so easily?

401
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,520
The king of all times

402
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,800
After the crowning ceremony, they will personally take control of the military power

403
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,840
At that time, even if Lu Buwei has thousands of unwillingness

404
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,680
I'm afraid he can't help but object.

405
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,800
I thought you were smart

406
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,360
Turns out he’s that stupid too

407
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,160
Does Lu Buwei have to be on the day of the crowning ceremony?

408
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,760
Only then can I object?

409
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,960
He had already planned it before the crowning ceremony

410
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,520
Just kill your so-called king

411
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,840
You took such a big risk to sneak into the Hou Mansion?

412
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,640
Is that what you want to say to me?

413
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,280
Of course not

414
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,280
I want to use this news to exchange Qin Qing with you

415
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,280
Where did you get this news?

416
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,160
No need for me to say more

417
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,640
You also know the relationship between Lu Niangrong and my third brother

418
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,120
To be honest

419
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,840
If it weren’t for Lu Niangrong helping me get the talisman this time,

420
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,360
I don't think it will be so easy for me

421
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,240
Can escape from the prison

422
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,840
How could Lu Niangrong be possible?

423
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,760
Tell you the news that her father wants to assassinate the king?

424
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,560
When a woman falls in love with a man

425
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,000
This woman can be a man

426
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,000
Do something you can't imagine

427
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,440
I believe you don’t need to say this, you know it very well

428
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,120
According to what Lu Niangrong said

429
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,440
Before rushing to Yongdu, Lu Buwei would

430
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,480
Kill your king

431
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,760
My deal with you is one life for another

432
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,720
How to exchange one life for another?

433
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,840
As long as you are willing to play the piano

434
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,920
I can guarantee you that your king

435
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,760
You can reach Yongdu safely

436
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,600
Shaolong

437
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,640
Does Marquis Changxin really agree to your terms of exchange?

438
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,600
He couldn't help but refuse

439
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,680
because he knows

440
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,160
If that king is killed by Lu Buwei

441
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,360
He also has nothing

442
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,520
How could he have imagined

443
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,080
The eldest brother has already reached an agreement with Lu Buwei

444
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,760
I would have known that Lu Buwei had long wanted to let his eldest brother go.

445
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,280
I don’t have to waste my time talking

446
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,880
Went to persuade Ronger to help us steal the talisman.

447
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,520
Otherwise

448
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,720
How do you know that Miss Lu is passionately devoted to you?

449
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,800
By the way, will Miss Lu go with you?

450
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,880
Ronger, she knows if this continues

451
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,120
Her father will also end badly.

452
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
She couldn't bear to watch her father commit suicide with her own eyes

453
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,800
So I decided to leave Xianyang with me

454
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,040
By the way, Shaolong, what are your next plans?

455
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,680
Lu Buwei will personally escort the king tomorrow morning

456
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,240
Go to Yongdu to prepare for the crowning ceremony

457
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,600
On your way to Yongdu

458
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,160
I'll pretend to be an assassin and cause chaos

459
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,320
Then the real person can take the opportunity to kill the fake king.

460
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,880
Put all the blame on you alone

461
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,120
Then Prime Minister Lu can do it on the day of the crowning ceremony

462
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,440
Announcing the death of the king to everyone

463
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,720
In the end, you can ask for favors from others and become your own king.

464
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,280
Lu Buwei would never have imagined that

465
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,600
I actually sent the real king to Marquis Changxin

466
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,000
Used in exchange for Qinqing

467
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,600
Then Chang Xinhou

468
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,520
He will rush to Yongdu with the king he thinks is fake

469
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,960
Expose Lu Buwei's conspiracy

470
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,880
He didn't even think about the king beside him

471
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,040
It's true

472
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,920
Then the two traitors can be dealt with together

473
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,920
Such a seamless way to kill two birds with one stone

474
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,880
It's a shame you thought about it

475
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Xiang Shaolong, you are really amazing

476
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,760
I also follow the development of the plot

477
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,160
Actually there is another screenwriter behind the scenes

478
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,080
But no matter what, after this matter is over

479
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,520
we will get out of here

480
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,040
Live the life we ​​want

481
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,600
Brother Xiang, you really are too

482
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,440
He hid the truth about the false king from us

483
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,960
Keep us in the dark

484
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,280
I just don't want to alert others

485
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,360
It is said that Lao Ai has always been cunning and cunning.

486
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,040
The less people know about the King’s death, the safer it will be

487
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,680
Lao Ai?

488
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,280
Lao Ai is Marquis Changxin

489
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,840
Lao Ai's martial arts skills

490
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,120
We must be careful when dealing with him then

491
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,040
It used to be

492
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,280
But since his martial arts was abolished by Lu Buwei,

493
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,360
If there wasn't a group of experts around him,

494
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,240
I'm afraid it will be difficult for him to protect himself

495
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,800
Then let’s decide

496
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,560
Tomorrow Lu Buwei will spend the night at the inn outside the city.

497
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,560
We will act accordingly

498
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,720
Prime Minister Lu

499
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,200
The old minister came specially to invite the king to go to Yongdu immediately

500
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,680
Your Majesty, please leave immediately

501
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
Your Majesty, please

502
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,520
Prime Minister Lu, why did you break into the widow's dormitory at night?

503
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,200
The king is about to die

504
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,440
Of course I want to give the king a ride

505
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,800
You are all punctual

506
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,240
You are also quite ruthless, Lu Buwei

507
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,720
Don't do great things with a single thought

508
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,040
You know what to do next, right?

509
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,320
Don't worry, I won't disappoint you

510
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,640
Someone's coming, there's an assassin

511
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,040
Report to the Lord

512
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,240
Xiang Shaolong and others have rescued the king

513
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,120
Shaolong

514
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,200
Taifu Xiang is indeed a man of his word

515
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,560
Do I still have a choice now?

516
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,680
Have you said anything to Lu Buwei?

517
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,680
No word has been leaked, Lord Marquis, please rest assured

518
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,760
Lao Ai, you won’t go back on what you said, right?

519
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
Let go of the piano girl

520
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,320
If I let Qin Qing go

521
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,000
You can really guarantee to stay out of it from now on

522
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,680
Yes, but I want to remind you one thing

523
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,960
Lu Buwei has now rushed to Yongdu

524
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,720
you are a smart person

525
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,800
You shouldn't be guilty of dealing with me

526
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,200
And wasted your precious time

527
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,760
thank you for reminding me

528
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,840
Shaolong

529
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,440
let's go

530
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,320
Are you okay?

531
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,080
Big brother

532
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,920
Let's go back first

533
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,600
Qing'er

534
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,400
godfather

535
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,160
See you safe and sound

536
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,560
Godfather is finally relieved

537
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,360
I really didn’t expect Lao Ai to let us go so easily.

538
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,000
He only cares about Lu Buwei now

539
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,200
How can you have time to deal with us?

540
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,040
No matter what, we finally got through it

541
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,320
Why hasn't Tingfang arrived for so long?

542
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,360
Ronger

543
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,080
Taifu Xiang, Rong'er just went to Taifu's Mansion

544
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,520
Wanted to meet Miss Tingfang, but couldn't see her

545
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,680
There is only one person named Miss Shanrou

546
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,120
I left a letter and asked me to hand it over to you.

547
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,560
Tingfang vowed to kill Lao Ai for revenge, but he quickly came to help after seeing the words

548
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,240
Wait for the crowning ceremony

549
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,440
I want you to do it in front of all the civil and military officials of the dynasty

550
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,400
Expose Lu Buwei's conspiracy to rebel

551
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,080
The villain knows

552
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,880
At this point you are still calling yourself a villain

553
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,360
Few people know

554
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,520
you have to remember

555
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,760
I will use this tone to refer to myself from now on.

556
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,760
Do you know?

557
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,080
Lu Buwei still has a bad move.

558
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,080
Fang'er Tingfang

559
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,920
Lian Jin?

560
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
You are not...

561
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,160
Of course you thought I was dead

562
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,640
I don’t care whether you are Lao Ai or Lian Jin.

563
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,640
I'm going to kill you today

564
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,320
To avenge my innocence

565
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,840
King, are you okay?

566
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,440
I'm fine

567
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,520
You answered very fluently, but it’s a pity that you forgot

568
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,160
How could the fake Ying Zheng know Wu Tingfang?

569
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,520
Kill him for me

570
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,680
Taifu Xiang, save the widow

571
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,560
Miss Tingfang…

572
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,280
Tingfang

573
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,760
Save Tingfang

574
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,320
Taifu Xiang, you can't go

575
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,520
You have to rush to Yongdu to stop Lu Buwei

576
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,560
I can't ignore her

577
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,960
Don’t forget that Great Qin’s hegemony is now in danger

578
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,960
Do you want to ask me to rush to Yongdu alone?

579
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,880
Shaolong, it’s important to save Miss Tingfang

580
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,120
Second brother and third brother, accompany the king to Yongdu

581
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,360
I'll come to you later

582
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,560
Xiang Shaolong

583
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,800
Are you okay?

584
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,800
I didn't mean to hurt you

585
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,440
I have no choice but to

586
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,640
Lian Jin, I can't kill you today

587
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,160
If you become a ghost in the future, I will definitely kill you

588
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,160
I'm sorry for you

589
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,120
I have killed the real Lao Ai for you

590
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,040
I finally avenged you

591
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,480
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be able to...

592
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,560
You don't have to be pretentious here anymore

593
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,280
You'd better kill me

594
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,840
Otherwise, you will regret it one day

595
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,360
stop

596
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,240
let her go

597
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,600
Fang'er

598
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,520
let her go

599
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
Stop talking nonsense

600
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,360
I can leave here safely today

601
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,960
I will naturally let her go

602
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,120
I asked you to let her go

603
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,040
If you don't get out of the way, I'll kill her.

604
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,720
If you have ever liked her

605
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
Just let her go

606
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,320
Yes, Fang'er is the woman I once loved deeply

607
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,560
But it's a pity that you are the only one in her heart.

608
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,040
I really don't understand what's good about you

609
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,360
Why do all women fall in love with you

610
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,840
But the most pity is

611
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,080
Every woman who falls in love with you

612
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,960
Neither will end well.

613
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,120
The same goes for Fang'er, Zhao Ya and the princesses of Zhao Kingdom

614
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,080
Fang'er ran away because you regretted your marriage.

615
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,400
Only then will he be insulted by the real Lao Ai

616
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,000
Zhao Ya is also because of you

617
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,880
Forced by Zhao Mu into desperation, he committed suicide by taking poison.

618
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,000
The same goes for the princess of Zhao State

619
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,280
If it weren't for you, she wouldn't have died at all

620
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,400
What did you say?

621
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,520
Of course, if it hadn't been for her that day

622
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,720
Exposed my plot to assassinate you

623
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,520
I won't kill her at all

624
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,280
Did you kill Xiaoqian?

625
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,760
good…

626
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,600
But you are the culprit

627
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,440
It was you who forced me to despair

628
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,240
It's you who makes me unable to choose

629
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,360
I will have this day

630
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,920
All thanks to you

631
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,320
If you want revenge, come to me

632
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,320
She is innocent, please let her go

633
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,040
If you are willing to let Miss Tingfang go

634
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,120
I'm willing to use myself as a hostage

635
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,120
Shaolong, let me go

636
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,160
If you don't save her, she will die, Shaolong

637
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,080
It's me who's going, not you

638
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,160
If you are willing to let her go

639
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,720
I'm willing to cut my hand off

640
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,640
No...

641
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,040
You don't have to worry about me anymore

642
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,680
Tingfang doesn’t want to be a burden to you anymore.

643
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,200
If you let go, I'll kill you

644
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,280
No, we must advance and retreat together

645
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,520
Fang'er... how are you?

646
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,640
She's bleeding a lot. We need to stop her bleeding immediately.

647
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,320
Why are you so stupid?

648
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,280
Shaolong, Tingfang has no face to see you again.

649
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,040
Don't say these words again at this time

650
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,440
The most important thing is to rest

651
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,600
Let’s send her back to Wujiapu quickly.

652
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,280
I, Lu Buwei, cannot protect you well.

653
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:23,640
The king was unfortunately assassinated on his way to Yongdu.

654
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,360
The death of the king is really a misfortune for our country, Qin.

655
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,320
I think that my king is young and promising, and is wise and courageous.

656
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,840
If you can inherit the Qin Dynasty,

657
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,360
His dynasty will definitely be able to unify the world

658
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,240
It's a pity that today I am jealous of talents

659
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,800
The king was assassinated

660
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:04,680
I, Lu Buwei, did not protect me well, and I really deserve death.

661
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,000
Prime Minister Lu, for the death of the king

662
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,960
It is inevitable for everyone to feel sad and sad

663
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,560
But as the saying goes, a country cannot live without a king for a day

664
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,120
If the news of the king’s death reaches the ears of the six countries,

665
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,560
I'm afraid they'll take the opportunity to march straight in.

666
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,800
By then, Da Qin’s foundation will be in jeopardy

667
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,440
Damn it, the army and people of Qin are united as one

668
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,320
How can we allow the six countries to bully us?

669
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,360
If they dare to challenge Da Qin,

670
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,960
I, Lu Buwei, was the first to lead the troops to face the enemy.

671
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,280
Even if the six countries dare not invade

672
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,000
But there must also be someone to handle the affairs of the DPRK, both large and small.

673
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,440
There is no need to delay the appointment of a new king.

674
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,560
Please make your decision

675
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,600
Lu Buwei was highly regarded by the king during his lifetime

676
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,560
We must not sit back and watch the Qin Dynasty be destroyed in one fell swoop.

677
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,040
It's a pity that the king died

678
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,880
The bloodline of the Ying family has been exhausted and there is no way to continue it.

679
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,760
Finding a suitable candidate is not easy

680
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,120
Everyone, please listen to Montessori’s words

681
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,920
Now the Great Qin Ying family lineage has been severed

682
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,000
In order to prevent the six countries from taking advantage of

683
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,600
We must find a capable person

684
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,960
To inherit the throne of the king

685
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,920
There is someone in front of me who can take on such an important responsibility

686
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,880
Looking at the world, there is only Mr. Lu

687
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,880
For the sake of Great Qin’s eternal foundation, I am Meng Ao’s proposal

688
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,920
Recommend Prime Minister Lu to assume the position of king

689
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,520
Please ask Mr. Lu to take over the position of king. No.

690
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,720
How virtuous and capable is Lu Buwei?

691
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,240
How to assume the position of king

692
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,680
If we talk about virtue

693
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,520
Prime Minister Lu worked hard for the two kings one after another.

694
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,120
It can really be said that he devoted himself to death and died.

695
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,520
On talents

696
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,520
It can be said that it is unprecedented and unprecedented.

697
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,640
All in all, looking around today’s China

698
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,560
Talking about the person most qualified to become the king

699
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,720
It’s none other than Prime Minister Lu

700
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,280
Please ask Prime Minister Lu to assume the position of our Qin State King

701
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,160
General Mongolia's move made Lu Buwei ashamed.

702
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,200
If only someone like Lu Buwei could become the king

703
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,320
That's really shameful

704
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,240
King? Yes, the King is not dead.

705
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,760
You are so bold

706
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,960
How dare you use a fake Ying Zheng to pretend to be a widower?

707
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,280
Plot to seize the throne

708
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,160
Why don't you just arrest the rebellious ministers and traitors?

709
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,440
Damn it, the king has obviously been assassinated

710
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,880
How dare you pretend to be the king?

711
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,800
Outside the door, Wang Jian obeys orders

712
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,320
Immediately arrest this traitor for his true nature

713
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,360
Lu Buwei, how dare you appear in front of all the civil and military officials of the dynasty

714
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
The following committed a crime and attempted to usurp the throne.

715
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,600
The truth doesn’t matter whether your Ying Zheng is real or fake.

716
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,840
Now I am holding a tiger talisman in my hand

717
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,680
The three armies inside and outside Yongdu must obey the truth

718
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,040
You're just asking for death this time

719
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,120
In other words, Lu Buwei, you are now showing your plans.

720
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,640
Are you going to kill the king to seize the throne?

721
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,480
So what?

722
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,800
The position of king has always been occupied by those who are capable.

723
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,520
I, Lu Buwei, now regret that I waited in vain for more than ten years.

724
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,360
This time you are seeking death

725
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,560
If you want to blame, just blame your late king for being in hell

726
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,560
I didn’t bless you properly

727
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,200
Stop talking nonsense, Wang Jian

728
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,600
If you don’t catch this traitor immediately, he will be punished on the spot.

729
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,120
Quickly capture the rebellious officials and traitors
