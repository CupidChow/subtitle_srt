1
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,160
Dead

2
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,960
Are you looking for me?

3
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,000
What's up?

4
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,880
have

5
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,280
What's up?

6
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,640
No

7
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,760
No? Yes or no?

8
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,640
have…

9
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,240
What's the matter?

10
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,520
I always carry this piece of jade with me

11
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,560
Can turn bad luck into good luck

12
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,600
If you want to compete with Lian Jin, take it with you.

13
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,200
It will bless you and turn disaster into good luck

14
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,560
Thank you

15
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,200
You can stop yourself from liking someone else

16
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,280
But I'm afraid it may not be so easy for you

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,800
Prevent others from liking you

18
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,720
Thank you, I want to practice sword practice a little more

19
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
It's so hot, you should go back first

20
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,920
I'll practice for a while and then go back

21
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,240
Then I won't hinder you

22
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,120
What a good husband and concubine

23
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,800
You are so blessed

24
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,240
What poem were you reading early in the morning?

25
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,280
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

26
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,840
Ridicule?

27
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,320
How's it going? Has your injury recovered?

28
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,880
You don't have to pay attention to my injury

29
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,800
By the way, how is your sword practice going?

30
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,360
No progress, you're dead this time

31
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,720
You will have a competition in two days

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,240
You must try your best

33
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,200
It’s not like I have to hand in my homework and try my best?

34
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,360
How could I not know? I really can’t imagine

35
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,680
What if I lose the sword fight with Lian Jin?

36
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,400
Master has no face and I have no face either

37
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,960
All your efforts to help me recruit Lian Jin have been in vain.

38
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,920
It won't help if you say these things.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,160
Just let me use Lian Jin's sword style

40
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,720
You try your best to attack me

41
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,960
Isn’t it good? You’ve just recovered from your injury

42
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,680
Stop talking nonsense

43
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,760
All right…

44
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,960
What is this?

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,560
juziling

46
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,920
The great order that can command all the Mohists in the world

47
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,680
No wonder everyone is rushing to grab it

48
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,040
I don't even know what to do

49
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,480
What if I get killed in a duel with Lian Jin?

50
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,000
I haven't helped my master find a successor yet

51
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,560
I don't know what to do with this huge piece of money

52
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,360
The Juzi Order is so important. Could it be that there is a secret in it?

53
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,160
Mozi's swordsmanship is full of strange things

54
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,960
Use defense as offense to defeat the enemy

55
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,000
Use offense as defense to seize the enemy's opportunity

56
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,280
Integrated, both offensive and defensive

57
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,080
Across the world, invincible

58
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,200
Please wait for a long time, madam

59
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,640
I don’t know that the Marquis has urgently summoned the slave family to visit the house.

60
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,440
Is there something important?

61
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,240
I miss my wife and just want to see her.

62
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,440
Mr. Hou, please stop joking.

63
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,040
There are so many beauties in the Marquis's house

64
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,560
There's no one like you, madam

65
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,120
Lord Marquis, my family is feeling unwell today.

66
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,480
Please forgive me, Lord Marquis

67
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,920
This prince did not summon his wife to come over because of his impatience.

68
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,280
I really have something important to ask my wife for help.

69
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,400
Xiang Shaolong and Lian Jin will have a sword duel tomorrow

70
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,600
You will entertain Xiang Shaolong tonight

71
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,760
Put this packet of medicine into Xiang Shaolong wine

72
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,480
Master Hou wants to poison Xiang Shaolong?

73
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,840
No, this medicine will not kill him

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,920
It’s just that I hope to have a sword fight in front of the emperor tomorrow

75
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,880
Can Lian Jin take his life?

76
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,160
Do you think you can really do Qinggong?

77
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,920
I didn't expect you to be so cruel

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,760
While I'm asleep...

79
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,480
What is it? A bomb?

80
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,960
If you doubt it, I'll take it away

81
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,160
Just kidding

82
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,960
It's roast chicken, my favorite thing to eat, it's awesome

83
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
After you finish eating, go back to bed.

84
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,440
No, I just went back to sleep in a hurry

85
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,720
I want to practice a little more

86
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
You know you will lose

87
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,120
You have to forget about food and sleep, and fight for it with your life

88
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,840
If the eldest lady of the Wu family knew

89
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,560
She will be very touched

90
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,840
if you lose

91
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,360
I'm afraid she will die for you

92
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,720
If you two are in love, why not elope?

93
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,200
Then there will be no need to make unnecessary sacrifices

94
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,360
I know this. Do you think I want to duel?

95
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,480
If I don't fight, I'll be dead. If I do,

96
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,480
At least the chance of life and death is half.

97
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
You are not competing this time to marry the eldest daughter of the Wu family.

98
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,400
Were you forced?

99
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,840
Why do you like to inquire so much?

100
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,120
I'm not going to answer this kind of personal question for you.

101
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,520
But from my personal standpoint

102
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,320
Of course I don’t want Lian Jin to marry the eldest daughter of the Wu family

103
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,280
Do you think it's really a joke?

104
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,520
Are you trying to make a name for yourself?

105
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,200
Of course not, you won't understand anyway

106
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,800
You can't help me even if I tell you

107
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,480
I'm always helping you

108
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,520
I know, why are you so serious?

109
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,240
At worst, after my sword duel with Lian Jin,

110
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,760
I can treat you to a meal as compensation, right?

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,080
Someone is coming, I'll go first

112
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,200
Neuropathy

113
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,160
There is really someone

114
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,160
Brother Xiang, you are only practicing your sword and haven’t eaten yet

115
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,880
I personally cooked your favorite roast chicken

116
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,880
I was hungry just now

117
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,840
So I specially asked someone to buy a roast chicken.

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,920
let me fill my stomach

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
Don't worry...roast chicken is my favorite

120
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,000
No matter how much I eat, I can finish it

121
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,080
Then eat it while it's hot

122
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,800
After eating, go back to rest and refresh yourself.

123
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,640
No, I just took a nap

124
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,440
Don't worry, when I used to work

125
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,080
The same goes for not sleeping for three days and three nights.

126
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,240
I can support it

127
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,560
How can you have strength without rest?

128
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,560
Originally, Mrs. Ya's mansion sent someone to invite you to come over.

129
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,520
I don't think you need to pay attention to it

130
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,400
Before the sword duel, please come to my house

131
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,120
Besides, she belongs to Zhao Mu, so she must have bad intentions.

132
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,840
It's really rich

133
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,600
Shaolong, please enjoy, you're welcome

134
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,600
Madam, honestly, are you scared?

135
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,160
After I lose the sword duel with Lian Jin tomorrow,

136
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,080
No chance to eat such good food?

137
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
So cook so much food to keep me full

138
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,160
Master, my mother and I both think

139
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,920
You can definitely defeat Lian Jin

140
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,760
Today, in addition to strengthening my reputation for Master,

141
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,440
I also wish Master in advance that he will win without a doubt

142
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,360
These words still sound like human words

143
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,840
Shaolong is extremely witty and brave, tomorrow's competition

144
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,600
You will surely be rewarded with victory and marry a beautiful woman.

145
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,720
I hope so, don’t talk about these unhappy things

146
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,000
Come, have a drink, come

147
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,640
Shaolong, drinking alcohol on an empty stomach is not good for your body.

148
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,760
Why don't you try today's barbecue first?

149
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,000
Don’t let this barbecue get so burnt next time.

150
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,800
Everything seems to be bordered with black

151
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
good

152
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,520
master

153
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,120
Do you know how much Zhao De and Zhao Jia go overboard?

154
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,000
What's wrong?

155
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,280
It turns out that everyone bets heavily on winning streaks

156
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,720
But they said that if you buy a parlay and win, you can only pay one for one.

157
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,680
But if you win, I'll lose three thousand

158
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,600
Three thousand for one? Even more unpopular than that day?

159
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,840
What happened? They really treat me like a cripple.

160
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,560
As if I will never win

161
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,600
No, I have already placed a heavy bet on Master to win

162
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,200
Yeah?

163
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,320
I also asked my friends to buy it together

164
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,840
So Master, you must win

165
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,880
Let Zhao De and Zhao Jia lose so much that even his mother has to sell them

166
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,560
This is decent

167
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,720
Are you gambling again?

168
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,720
Stop scolding him

169
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,280
I think he just bought one worth tens of thousands for fun.

170
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,640
Come, I’m so happy today, come, have a drink

171
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,080
Lian Jin, I would like to wish you the best

172
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,040
Tomorrow we will compete with swords, and we will win with open arms

173
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,560
Thank you, Mr. Hou, for your kindness.

174
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
But the sword fight is about to begin

175
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,760
Subordinates should stay calm and sober

176
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,160
Wouldn’t it be too disappointing to not drink even if there is good wine?

177
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,880
I just don’t want anything to go wrong

178
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,720
In fact, I have already made a move for you

179
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,880
You will definitely not lose tomorrow

180
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,840
I’m afraid that when the time comes, Xiang Shaolong

181
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,680
Will turn into a soft-hoofed horse with weak limbs

182
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,040
Why is it poisoned?

183
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,280
This is really bad

184
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,160
Don’t be poisoned early, don’t be poisoned later

185
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,160
Tomorrow we will compete with each other, but today we are poisoned, so we will definitely lose.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
It must have been poisoned by Mrs. Ya

187
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,400
I told you before that that whore is not a good person

188
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,760
Are you still going to the appointment?

189
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
I'll go find her and get the antidote

190
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,120
Fang'er, calm down

191
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,480
Since she was poisoned, how could she give you the antidote?

192
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,120
That's right

193
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,120
No, Brother Xiang, don’t go to the competition tomorrow

194
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,760
Sister, how can this be done?

195
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,240
The king opened the mouth of gold and promised a thousand gold coins

196
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,760
Violators are punishable by death

197
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,960
But I will definitely not be able to defeat Lian Jin in the competition tomorrow.

198
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,040
Wouldn't it be better to die?

199
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,800
In short, if you go this time, you will die. If you don’t go, you will die.

200
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,280
Brother Xiang, why not leave Handan tonight?

201
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,760
Find a place to hide, and then seek treatment from a doctor

202
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,720
No, I must go to the competition tomorrow

203
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,960
Victory or defeat is a small matter, life or death is a big matter

204
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,520
If you go, won't it mean you're going to die?

205
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,000
Miss

206
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,960
If Brother Xiang doesn’t keep the appointment,

207
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,160
You are going to marry Lian Jin

208
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,640
I said life or death is a big deal, as long as Brother Xiang is fine

209
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,920
What does it matter whether Fang'er is married or not?

210
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,920
Don't worry, maybe I caught a cold when I came back just now

211
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,160
Just a little cold

212
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,120
Just sleep for one night and you'll be fine

213
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,960
But if something happens to you, then... Fang'er

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,400
Let Shaolong take a rest and go out first

215
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,560
See the king...

216
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,160
You two don't need to be polite

217
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,040
The two of you are not only competing in front of me today.

218
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,840
Or is it a competition for beauties and ladies?

219
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,000
for the sake of fairness

220
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,880
I have already found someone who is recognized as the best swordsman in the world.

221
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,320
Mr. Cao Qiudao

222
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,400
As the verdict and testimony of today’s competition

223
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,400
The contest begins

224
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,520
General Li Mu?

225
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,120
The last general Li Mu, see the king

226
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,480
General Li, there is no need to be polite.

227
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,720
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

228
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,840
General Li, long time no see. You seem to have lost your temper.

229
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,280
General Li suddenly returned to the palace. Is there an emergency at the border?

230
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,960
Julu Hou, don’t worry

231
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,720
Li is in the border area

232
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,920
We have been resisting the Huns for more than ten years

233
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,200
The borders are very stable now

234
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,640
That’s why I came back to Handan to visit relatives.

235
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,560
General Li is really helpful in border defense.

236
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,520
I hope General Li will pay more attention to

237
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,760
You are also very worried about the affairs of the DPRK and Central Government.

238
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,280
I think you'd better do your part.

239
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,400
I have my own sense of proportion, General Li doesn't have to worry about it

240
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,240
General Li, you came back just in time.

241
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,960
Today two warriors competed to win a bride

242
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,240
Your Majesty, I am truly honored to meet you.

243
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,600
Give me a seat

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,280
Thank you very much, Your Majesty.

245
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,840
This sword competition is to decide who is the beauty.

246
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,800
It can be said to be a gratifying thing

247
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,240
It will also become a good story in the future

248
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,160
I’ll propose two people below, and that’s it for now.

249
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,840
It can avoid hurting your harmony and hurting your life.

250
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,920
King

251
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,040
All those who compete in martial arts will try their best and fight with all their strength

252
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,960
It’s really hard to hit the spot

253
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,720
What Juluhou said is true

254
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,720
Your Majesty, anyone who is highly skilled in martial arts will be able to freely control

255
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,320
Xiang and Lian are both highly skilled martial artists.

256
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,120
Moreover, talents are rare

257
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,360
What if one of them is injured?

258
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,480
It’s all our Zhao country’s loss.

259
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,320
What Lord Wu Bao said is not unreasonable.

260
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,360
King

261
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,600
Two warriors, a fair fight today

262
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,560
Just make the decision and stop it, so as not to hurt your harmony.

263
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,560
The contest begins

264
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,200
The Marquis said he was poisoned

265
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,280
Why is there no vision at all?

266
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,640
You'll know later

267
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,720
poisonous

268
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,000
poisonous?

269
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,520
There's poison in the wine

270
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,080
Is there poison in the wine?

271
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,640
Sorry, Shaolong

272
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,080
You don't have to be sorry

273
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,840
I've already guessed that this wine is poisonous

274
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,800
Did you already guess that the wine was poisonous?

275
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,680
I'm just guessing, okay?

276
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,240
Mother, you actually poisoned Master?

277
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,240
I have no choice but to

278
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,680
Please don't be so cruel to your mother

279
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,560
Look at her

280
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,120
I was simply forced to the point of desperation.

281
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,760
It must be that thief Zhao Mu

282
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,960
Let's do it this way, let's just follow the plan

283
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,720
Take the sword

284
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,400
The winner has been decided, there is no need for the two warriors to compete anymore

285
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:08,920
Shaolong, are you okay?

286
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,640
General Li, this sword is very heavy. Help me hold it.

287
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,800
Borrow and use

288
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,440
This flour is salty, why is it so weird?

289
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,840
Master, are your hands okay?

290
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,240
It's okay...it's just a small matter

291
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,840
Lian Jin, you are so despicable and shameless

292
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,600
As long as it's a good deal, you're trying to kill me

293
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,160
Fortunately, my master has a heart-protecting copper

294
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,000
Otherwise ten lives would not be enough to die.

295
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,080
Lian Jin, your hand tendon is broken?

296
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,520
Xiang Shaolong, you are so bold, just say what you say

297
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,440
You actually cut off Lian Jin's hand tendons?

298
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,160
My master almost died too

299
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,680
Your master's skills are inferior to others

300
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,280
Mr. Hou, even if you are not as skilled as a human being, it is better to hurt someone with a cold arrow.

301
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,160
I believe that Lian Jin will not really attack him

302
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,440
Lord Marquis, can you guarantee that Lian Jin will not be struck down?

303
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,360
You two gentlemen, there is no need to argue.

304
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,120
We might as well ask Mr. Cao Qiudao to seek justice.

305
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,960
Just now, Warrior Xiang took away Warrior Lian's sword.

306
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,320
It is indeed superior in skills

307
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,280
Besides, Warrior Xiang can do it right when he wants it.

308
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,720
It's always a win

309
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,240
At that time, there was no clear winner or loser.

310
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
Xiang Shaolong cuts off Lian Jin's hand tendons

311
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,480
Not something a gentleman would do

312
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,560
I said Xiang Shaolong defeated him

313
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,000
fart

314
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,280
Mr. Hou, you are simply arrogant.

315
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,320
Your Majesty, please be fair.

316
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,600
King

317
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,960
Julu Hou, you don’t have to quibble anymore.

318
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:36,200
I just saw that Xiang Shaolong's sword was broken

319
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,000
But Lian Jin is still aggressive, which is really despicable

320
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,280
Brother Tao, please give me the sword, please...

321
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,920
General, thank you for lending me your sword just now.

322
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,800
This flying rainbow sword can fight in both the south and the north

323
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,200
Followed me for many years

324
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,040
Okay, today I will give you this sword

325
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,880
I want you to always win

326
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,840
No, this sword must be very expensive

327
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,000
How can I bear it?

328
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,240
Swords for heroes

329
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,320
Come on, warrior, you don't have to be polite

330
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,000
Okay, then I'll keep it for now

331
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,920
If you need it in the future

332
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,600
You can ask me for it back at any time

333
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,680
Now that the outcome has been decided

334
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,000
The Lord of Wubao’s daughter was naturally betrothed to Warrior Xiang.

335
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,720
It’s a joy to see a hero paired with a beauty.

336
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,040
Thank you King

337
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,880
After Lord Wubao and Warrior Xiang decide on a wedding date,

338
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,920
I will naturally give you generous gifts

339
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,960
I wish you a perfect marriage

340
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,280
Thank you King for your grace

341
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,240
Miss…

342
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,360
Are they back?

343
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,880
The young master is back

344
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
How is the outcome?

345
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,080
It really pisses me off

346
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,520
Did Brother Xiang lose?

347
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,240
Your brother, I lost money

348
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,840
I never thought that Lian Jin would be so bad

349
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,800
Brother Xiang defeated Lian Jin?

350
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You didn't lie to Fang'er, did you?

351
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,640
Although brother, I don’t like Xiang Shaolong to be my brother-in-law.

352
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,840
But I still congratulate my sister on your wish.

353
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,600
That's great, miss.

354
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,840
Castle Lord, actually I promised to duel with Lian Jin before.

355
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,840
I agreed to you because I had no other choice.

356
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Having said that

357
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,760
Our eldest lady is indeed a good girl

358
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,840
Match you again

359
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,800
Brother Xiang, why do you firmly refuse this marriage?

360
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,280
I know, but I have my reasons

361
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,080
Even if I tell you, you won’t understand.

362
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,520
Well, since Shaolong you have your reasons

363
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,240
Wu Mou is no longer reluctant

364
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,400
That's good, I'm finally relieved

365
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,880
But this marriage was granted by King Zhao Jinkou

366
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,760
How do we explain to King Zhao?

367
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,360
Otherwise, so be it, the wedding date hasn’t been decided yet anyway.

368
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,600
Let's find a way to postpone it temporarily.

369
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,880
That can only delay it for a while

370
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,280
Otherwise, let's rescue Ying Zheng as soon as possible

371
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,680
Then he immediately rushed back to Qin

372
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,800
Then there is no need to explain to King Zhao

373
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,280
The eldest lady knows about the marriage

374
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,800
You win but refuse to marry, then the eldest lady...

375
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Otherwise

376
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Let me explain it to the eldest lady at the head office.

377
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,240
no

378
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,920
If you explain it, Fang'er will be even more sad

379
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,960
It's up to me to explain this matter to Fang'er myself.

380
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,480
So beautiful, miss.

381
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,400
It fits well, yes.

382
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,680
So beautiful Fang'er

383
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,040
father

384
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,800
How come you have a new wedding dress so soon?

385
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,720
It was sewn by my mother when she was still alive.

386
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,680
Did your mother sew it?

387
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,560
Niangjianfang'er has only liked horse riding since she was a child

388
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,680
Dancing with swords

389
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,360
I can never sit still and learn needlework.

390
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,120
He said he was afraid that his daughter would not be able to get married.

391
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,520
So I had already prepared my daughter’s wedding dress.

392
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,960
I hope I can get married soon

393
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,960
Now the lady can not only get married

394
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,760
You can also marry a good man

395
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,040
Moreover, it is a marriage granted by the king, which is really gratifying and congratulatory.

396
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,560
Even you girl makes fun of me

397
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,440
The slave dare not

398
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,360
Dad, do you have a problem with your daughter?

399
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,440
Dad came here to talk to you.

400
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,280
Regarding the marriage granted by the king

401
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,400
My daughter already knows

402
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,080
Just let the father make the decision for his daughter.

403
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,520
My daughter will listen to her father’s arrangements

404
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,600
Fang'er, what dad means is... dad doesn't want to...

405
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,240
Dad, you don’t want to?

406
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,840
But it was you who chose Brother Xiang for your daughter.

407
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:21,400
Yes, what dad means is... dad doesn’t want you to get married too soon.

408
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,720
Let’s postpone this marriage, okay?

409
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,560
It turns out that the father is reluctant to let go of his daughter

410
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,120
I'm afraid that my daughter will forget her father after she gets married.

411
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,720
Don't worry, after my daughter gets married,

412
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,080
I will definitely come back to visit you from time to time

413
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,840
The slave family has prepared wine and food for the Marquis.

414
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,280
Invite the Marquis to try the newly brewed sorghum wine

415
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,000
Believe in the madam’s baby son

416
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,320
I have already reported the results of the competition to my wife.

417
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,840
The lady did not follow my orders.

418
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,920
Could it be that Madam and Xiang Shaolong have already hooked up?

419
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,920
So you are reluctant to kill your lover?

420
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,400
The slave family did obey the Lord Marquis’s orders.

421
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,640
Ask Xiang Shaolong to drink poisonous wine

422
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,240
That's strange, since you drank poisonous wine

423
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,000
How could Lian Jin be defeated?

424
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:31,000
The slave family is also puzzled

425
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,480
you bitch

426
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,800
Defending Xiang Shaolong is betraying me.

427
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,120
Xiang Shaolong is a gentleman

428
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,680
He and I are innocent

429
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,240
A gentleman matches a whore, what a match

430
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,600
let go

431
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,240
What a filial son

432
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,520
Why does the Marquis need to be angry?

433
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,760
If Mr. Hou doesn’t believe me

434
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,640
Why do you need to tell me to do things?

435
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,160
The Marquis can control the wind and rain in Handan City

436
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,160
I'm insignificant

437
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,120
Madam, there is no need to be modest, Madam is always the royal sister

438
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,760
But let me give you a piece of advice

439
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,960
You, mother and son, want to live peacefully in Handan City

440
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,360
Don't go against me

441
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,200
The consequences of betrayal and betrayal

442
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,320
Madam should know best

443
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,400
daughter

444
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,160
Go quickly, our Lord Marquis won't see you

445
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,440
I must see Mr. Hou

446
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,800
Brother Lian Jin, why do you have to make it difficult for us brothers?

447
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,920
presumptuous

448
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,280
Lord Marquis, General Manager Han has sent an order

449
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,360
Said that the Marquis wanted to find another job in Jin Dynasty

450
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,280
I want to know if this is true?

451
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
good

452
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,400
Lian Jin was ordered by Lord Chun Shen

453
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,280
From Chu State to Zhao State to follow the Marquis

454
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,480
I once promised your Majesty

455
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,920
Said that he would help Mr. Hou achieve his great cause

456
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,920
Nothing big has happened yet

457
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,840
How can I go back and give orders to you?

458
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,520
I will explain this matter to you

459
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,720
I have followed Mr. Hou for many years and have always been loyal.

460
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,240
Mr. Hou, there is a saying that there is work without merit.

461
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,080
What you're doing is too heartless.

462
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,320
Last month you sent my secret letter to the State of Chu

463
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,320
Stealing a dragon and turning it into a phoenix, hiding it privately

464
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,200
He believes that he has the leverage to threaten me in the future.

465
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,720
It's a pity that the secret letter has fallen into my hands.

466
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,720
I am thinking that you are from Chu State

467
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,160
Sparing you death is already an extra mercy

468
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,600
The Marquis's words made Lian Jin suddenly enlightened.

469
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,120
Thank you Mr. Hou for your continued care.

470
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,000
Lian Jinhui will keep it in mind

471
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,920
Good morning

472
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,880
Good morning

473
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,920
Are you OK?

474
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,800
good

475
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,000
There's something I want to discuss with you

476
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,040
What's up?

477
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,240
It's not convenient to talk here

478
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,680
But I made an appointment

479
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,680
How about waiting for me to come back later and chat with you?

480
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,880
I'm leaving first, bye

481
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,640
What? I asked you something and you didn’t say anything

482
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,960
Is anyone following?

483
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,920
No, are you kidding me? Maer

484
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,120
Are you looking for me?

485
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,760
Didn't I just say that I have something to discuss with you?

486
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,040
What's going on? There's no one here. Tell me.

487
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,960
It's about my dad

488
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,400
Did he tell you?

489
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,240
Although he didn't make it clear

490
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,480
But the daughter also understands his intentions

491
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,320
That's good

492
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,080
I'm afraid you'll be unhappy if this matter can't be resolved

493
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,400
Dad always loves me very much

494
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,120
I can't bear to leave dad either

495
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,960
So if Brother Xiang, you can always stay at the ranch

496
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,560
Then the whole thing can be solved satisfactorily

497
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,320
Although a wife

498
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,760
You should follow and obey your husband

499
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,760
But dad’s ranch really needs someone to take over.

500
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,560
We as husband and wife can work together

501
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,680
You must never be like this again in the future

502
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,960
always bully me

503
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,600
Wait a minute, what did your father say to you?

504
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,200
You have to figure one thing out

505
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,680
It's the same thing that Lian Jin and I compete in martial arts

506
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,560
It's another thing for me to get married to you.

507
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,920
Your father's understanding ability is really problematic.

508
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,760
I don’t know what nonsense he is talking to you about?

509
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,120
do you mean...

510
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,040
I mean

511
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,320
In short, it can’t be as simple as getting married to you.

512
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,120
Is there something wrong with me?

513
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,560
No, you are not good...no...I am good but you are not good

514
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,680
Whatever, you are good and I am not good

515
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,560
Anyway, it’s really not possible to get married.

516
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,720
Why?

517
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,080
What should I tell you?

518
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,600
Have you seen the things I've seen?

519
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,600
Do you understand the things I understand?

520
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,800
Do you know what a "UFO" is?

521
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,400
I like playing game consoles at home

522
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,080
Can you play with me? Are you okay?

523
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,080
That's right, you can't do it at all

524
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,120
This means we can't get along

525
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,320
Do you understand that we are not compatible?

526
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,640
You said before that you don't like princesses

527
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,360
Because I love someone else, it turns out to be true

528
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,400
Who is that girl?

529
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,680
Yes, I have another girl

530
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,680
I will introduce it to you now

531
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,120
A handful of vegetables, come out

532
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,760
Come here

533
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,160
You come here first

534
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,880
I don’t think I need to say more

535
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,440
You also know what my relationship is with her, right?

536
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,600
You actually like a man

537
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,400
No, she is a woman, she is just pretending to be a man

538
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,960
I don't believe it, he is obviously a man

539
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,600
Feel it yourself

540
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,800
Do you believe it now? Are you convinced that you lost?

541
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,440
Xiang Shaolong, I hate you forever

542
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,040
Such a big reaction?

543
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,640
You still won’t chase?

544
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,080
No more chasing

545
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,880
Oops, did I go too far just now?

546
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,880
Yes, it's too much for me

547
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,160
The girl's family was so humiliated

548
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,000
It's easy to commit suicide

549
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,560
No way?

550
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,760
Girls are very thin-skinned

551
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,120
No, she usually rides like a man

552
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,840
He speaks loudly and rudely

553
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,320
If she can support her, everything will be fine

554
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,880
Although she grew up on a horse

555
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,600
I hope girls who grow up on horses will be stronger

556
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,880
By the way, I have a new task

557
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,400
I will leave Handan City tomorrow

558
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,600
You've been walking around all day

559
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,120
What are you telling me to do?

560
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,520
I just want to remind you

561
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,280
Zhao Mu has already started murdering you.

562
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,680
This time you defeat Lian Jin

563
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,160
He will definitely deliberately harm you

564
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,880
you have to be careful

565
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,960
Okay…

566
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,480
Wei'er, take a few more people to search in the back mountains.

567
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Dad, Tao Fang has already gone

568
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,920
Then go search along the Yinma River immediately. Go immediately

569
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,600
Yes, dad, come with me

570
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,800
What's going on? Lord of the castle

571
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,520
Fang'er is missing

572
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,120
I'm really afraid something might happen to Fang'er

573
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,840
Accident?

574
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,120
We who grew up on horses

575
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,600
The best relationship with horses is that the horse is with you and the person is with you

576
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,040
Now Fang'er's horse comes back alone

577
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,760
And the horse was injured

578
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,320
It's very possible that Fang'er had an accident

579
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,040
So the horse came back and reported

580
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,200
master

581
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,240
how?

582
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,760
The subordinate took the young lady's horse and searched everywhere.

583
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,440
But the horses refused to leave when they reached the edge of the cliff

584
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,680
And there was no trace of the lady around.

585
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:14,960
Wu Tingfang, where have you been?

586
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,000
Didn't you say you were leaving yesterday?

587
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,400
Why are you here?

588
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,960
I heard you shouting along the way

589
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,800
So come over and see what you're doing

590
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,960
Follow me?

591
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,920
Is the eldest daughter of the Wu family missing?

592
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,920
I just said I went too far yesterday and you still said no

593
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,040
Love is tiring

594
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,680
If you like her then marry her

595
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,480
It won't cause so much trouble.

596
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,280
Do you even say that?

597
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,480
If they are really brothers, please help find someone.

598
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,280
At worst, I'll give you money after I find it.

599
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,720
I'm a killer, I only do murder.

600
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,720
not your brother

601
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,800
Let me lend you your huge gift

602
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,000
What happened?

603
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,000
how?

604
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,840
Is there any trace of Fang'er?

605
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,840
Dad, although there is no trace of Fang'er

606
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,240
You don't need to be too sad

607
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,640
Where did she go?

608
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,720
Just think about it, we've looked everywhere

609
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,520
Although there is no trace of Fang'er

610
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,720
But her body was not found

611
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,080
That means she's not dead, maybe she just walked away.

612
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,040
Yes, maybe she was rejected

613
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,800
I feel like I have no face to come back.

614
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,360
Will you go to Lian Jin's place?

615
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,920
Or was he captured by Lian Jin?

616
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,960
I believe not, Lian Jin was driven away by Zhao Mu

617
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,840
I heard someone saw him leaving Handan City

618
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,960
He can't even protect himself

619
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,720
Come on, drink before you go on your way

620
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,680
drink, come, have a drink

621
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,520
Sir, what do you want to eat?

622
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,840
Give me a steamed bun

623
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,320
OK, wait a minute

624
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,200
Brother, what a coincidence?

625
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,320
The bereaved dog that was driven out by the Hou Mansion

626
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Rush back to the countryside to plow the fields?

627
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,080
Dressed in noble clothes and equipped with a famous sword

628
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,920
How can he be like a farmer?

629
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
That's right

630
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,600
The two of you are helping Mr. Hou on a business trip.

631
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,520
Just stop causing trouble.

632
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,760
Even my brother has broken one of his hands and is still so arrogant?

633
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,000
Of course, Broken holds a sword and pretends to be a hero

634
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,120
How can such a loser deserve this famous sword?

635
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,920
Just cut off his hands and feet

636
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,160
Let’s see how he puts on airs in the future

637
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,280
kill me

638
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,200
Kill you? Wouldn’t it be an advantage to you?

639
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,480
Take away all his belongings and take away his horses

640
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,000
good

641
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,480
Let’s see how you show off your authority in the future?

642
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,400
Should I be the general who gives birth to a bride?

643
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,600
Not bad, General Xiang

644
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,600
This time the princess married far away from the Kingdom of Wei

645
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,440
It’s all thanks to General Xiang that you escorted us all the way.

646
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,360
Your Majesty, you'd better find someone else.

647
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,080
General Xiang

648
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,240
Are you afraid of missing Miss Wu's wedding date with you?

649
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,040
no

650
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,880
Able to escort the princess to get married

651
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,840
It is a highly coveted and honorable job.

652
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,320
Why did General Xiang refuse?

653
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,320
I don’t know how to hold a happy event when you get married.

654
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,320
I can't even understand any of your words.

655
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,640
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

656
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,560
No need to decline, General Xiang

657
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,600
You rescued He Shibi earlier

658
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,640
Now he defeated Lian Jin again

659
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,120
It's obvious that you are a talented warrior

660
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,320
You are the one who escorts the princess to her wedding.

661
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,520
General Xiang, I tell you the truth.

662
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,480
This trip actually has another purpose

663
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,920
General Xiang can use this to make great achievements

664
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,400
It turned out that they were using the excuse of sending the princess to get married.

665
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,520
Ask me to help them steal the "Secret Records of Duke Lu"

666
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,560
It turns out that the secret records of Duke Lu have been lost for many years.

667
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,280
Falling into the hands of Lord Xinling

668
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,000
No wonder Zhao Mu wanted to make you the general of the Jin Dynasty.

669
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,160
It seems you are the only one

670
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,440
Only then can we get rid of this old fox, Mr. Xinling

671
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,400
Stealing Lu Gong’s Secret Records

672
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,040
Shaolong, the stakes are high

673
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,320
You must not refuse this job

674
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,480
I know, after all, the princess and I also met each other

675
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,720
How could I see her fall into the fire pit and not help her?

676
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,440
Also, we must find a way to get Lu Gong’s Secret Records

677
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,200
By the way, Lord of the Castle

678
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,800
In fact, what exactly is Lu Gong’s Secret Records?

679
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,360
Lu Gong's secret record is a famous craftsman of that time.

680
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,080
Luban’s brainchild

681
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,040
It is said that various metallurgical iron-making methods are recorded in it.

682
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,920
and the manufacture of various weapons

683
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,480
and various ingenious methods of making siege weapons.

684
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,760
So I got this secret book

685
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,880
Conquering a city is like adding more power to a tiger

686
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,240
Nowadays, monarchs from all over the world want to get it

687
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,480
Castle Lord, this matter really has nothing to do with me

688
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,080
Of course it's relevant. If you get this secret book,

689
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,320
Can be used as a condition for exchanging protons with Zhao Guo

690
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,040
That’s right, you won’t have to spend a lot of time then

691
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,280
Losing troops and generals, we have to fight Zhao Mu head-on

692
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,320
Also, we can make a copy of the secret notes in advance

693
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,800
Then give it to Prime Minister Lu

694
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,360
It will be helpful for Qin to unify the world in the future

695
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,800
Brother Xiang, I need to trouble you to go to Wei State this time.

696
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,840
But Lord, your daughter has not been found yet

697
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,320
How can I rest assured?

698
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,160
Shaolong, you can rest assured about this matter

699
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,440
Fang'er has news

700
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,400
Tao Fang, there's a letter over there

701
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,480
What letter?

702
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,760
It turns out that Fang'er came from our Wushi Bank

703
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,280
Withdrawal of silver

704
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,040
She also said that she would go back to Qin first

705
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
Yeah?

706
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,280
That was a blessing from God. I finally felt at ease.

707
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,560
Shaolong, it's getting late

708
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,080
We will discuss the matter of going to Wei State in a long term tomorrow

709
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,680
Okay, then I'll go back to sleep

710
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,640
I'll come find you again tomorrow

711
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,560
good

712
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,200
Sir, there is still no news about the young lady.

713
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,600
Why did you deceive Brother Xiang?

714
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,560
If not, how could Shaolong go to Wei State with peace of mind?

715
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,200
I hope you will assist Xiang Shaolong

716
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,680
Steal Lu Gong's Secret Records from Lord Xinling

717
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,160
After it’s done…

718
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,400
Poisoning Xiang Shaolong

719
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,000
Things are difficult and dangerous, I'm sorry I can't do it

720
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,160
For the sake of Madam and Pan'er's comfortable life

721
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,360
Madam will do her best

722
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,480
you…

723
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,560
Madam, if things fail this time

724
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,680
You return to Handan City

725
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,560
Just help your precious son Xiaopan collect the body.
