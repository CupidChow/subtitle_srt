1
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,360
Brother, can I come in?

2
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,040
Come in

3
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,880
What's up?

4
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,680
nothing

5
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,240
I know brother will not be able to sleep tonight

6
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,880
Instead of drinking alone

7
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,480
Why don't I drink with you?

8
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,240
OK come

9
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,280
Second brother, do you mind if I ask you a question?

10
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,560
Brother, just ask

11
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,480
Today, do you still miss your wife?

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Although my wife and I are separated by yin and yang,

13
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,800
But I often dream about her

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,720
Whenever I wake up from a dream

15
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,120
There is always a feeling of heartbreak

16
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,800
When I captured Zhao Mu in Zhao State,

17
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,200
I know the princess really wants me to promise her personally

18
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,880
You can come back and marry her

19
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,840
Just such a simple sentence

20
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,960
I never said

21
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,400
When I came back, the princess was dead

22
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,240
I will never have the chance to say this

23
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,840
Since eldest brother has already made a mistake once

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,680
And I have always regretted it

25
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,720
Then brother must not make the same mistake again.

26
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,320
Godfather, have you packed your bags?

27
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,600
That's almost it

28
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,440
Aqing

29
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,800
Qing'er, my godfather still has a few pieces of clothing that he hasn't packed yet.

30
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll go in and clean up

31
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,880
Shaolong, you accompany Qinqing

32
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,120
where you go?

33
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,800
sorry

34
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,280
I think there is a misunderstanding between Qin Qing and General Xiang

35
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,760
Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding?

36
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,600
Fortunately, General Xiang's expedition this time

37
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,960
Qin Qing finally understood

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,120
What I cannot forget in my heart is my late husband

39
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,520
The only thing Qin Qing loves most in her heart is my late husband

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,680
I don't believe it, I know you lied

41
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,160
Are you lying?

42
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,560
Since General Xiang attaches great importance to important matters,

43
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,880
There is no emotional baggage like Qin Qing

44
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,800
You can be carefree

45
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,440
Wouldn't it be better to continue doing your big things?

46
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,880
What do you mean by that?

47
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,160
If General Xiang had misunderstood before,

48
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,640
Qin Qing hereby apologizes to you

49
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,520
You lie, I know you lie

50
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
What you said is not true, you are lying

51
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,880
you tell me you're lying

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,920
Whether General Xiang believes it or not

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,760
To prevent General Xiang from misunderstanding any more,

54
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,560
Qin Qing decided to leave Xianyang with her godfather

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,120
Godfather, let’s go, okay

56
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,680
I won't let you go, you come with me

57
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,760
Let go, why did you drag me here?

58
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,840
Do you still remember? You once told me that day

59
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,600
The happiest days for you are these days

60
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,200
You really want to keep this moment

61
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,600
You also said that you hope the sun never sets

62
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,080
do you remember?

63
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,240
So what? The sun still sets

64
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
What does it matter if the sun doesn't set?

65
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,160
I only know that I really like you

66
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,120
Whether the sun goes down or not, I won’t change

67
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,360
Are you willing to be a deserter for me?

68
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,840
You know I won't, but I can promise you

69
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,960
I will definitely come back alive to see you

70
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,760
What I'm most afraid of is hearing you say these words

71
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,160
I'm afraid you'll do it for this promise

72
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,760
And to carry a heavy burden on the battlefield

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,440
I'm afraid you will follow in the footsteps of my late husband

74
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,640
To save life

75
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,080
As a result, he lost his mind and died on the battlefield.

76
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,840
I'm afraid that after you leave

77
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,680
i can never see you

78
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,240
Shaolong

79
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,520
I, Xiang Shaolong, swore that day

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,840
I will definitely come back alive and marry Qin Qing as my wife

81
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,920
I promise you

82
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,720
As long as I think of you waiting for me in Xianyang

83
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,040
I will come back even if I die

84
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,560
I don't allow you to say the word "death"

85
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,320
Then will you wait for me?

86
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,080
I will definitely wait for you to come back

87
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,760
Xiang Shaolong

88
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,240
I now officially appoint you as the general to protect the country.

89
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,640
You should remember it well

90
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,400
This time the coach of Zhao State is Li Mu

91
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,560
No matter what kind of friendship General Xiang had with this man in the past,

92
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,600
Now Qin and Zhao are at war

93
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,320
You must not be the least bit soft-hearted

94
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,160
Yes, Your Majesty

95
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,320
Scrambled eggs, steamed buns

96
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,320
Are you two? Sir, would you like to sit over there?

97
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,800
OK here…

98
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,960
Second brother, please

99
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,840
A plate of beef and four steamed buns

100
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,920
And a pot of soju

101
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,920
Okay...will be there soon

102
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,480
This is already the border of Qin State

103
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,040
It seems that no one from your organization is chasing you anymore.

104
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,320
It’s better to be careful

105
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,240
The organization sent people to hunt us down along the way.

106
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,240
Although I left Qin

107
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,520
But it doesn’t mean it’s absolutely safe

108
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Food and drinks arrived…

109
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,120
Please use it with caution, two guests.

110
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,600
careful

111
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,720
Do you need to be so careful?

112
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,480
If I hadn't been careful in everything

113
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,640
I'm afraid we won't have the chance to sit together today

114
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,080
It's ready to eat

115
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,440
If this continues

116
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,920
I'm afraid we haven't been poisoned to death, but we've starved to death.

117
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,240
What are your plans after leaving Qin?

118
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,200
As far as I know

119
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,400
The organization's power in Qi is the weakest

120
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,160
First we leave Qin

121
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,520
Then take a detour to Wei State, and finally to Qi State

122
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,160
Don't worry, although Qi is a little far away from Qin

123
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,320
But after a year and a half,

124
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,520
Then we can go back to Qin

125
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,600
Then you can meet your Brother Xiang

126
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,160
Did I say I wanted to see him?

127
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,120
Some things don’t need to be said clearly, I am also a daughter’s family

128
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,600
Gentlemen, what's going on?

129
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,520
It's nothing, little brother, we still have to go on our way

130
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,000
Could you please wrap up the steamed buns?

131
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,360
Sorry, I just thought...

132
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,520
Our identities have been exposed

133
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,560
Get out of here as soon as possible

134
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,280
Sir, please help me with your steamed buns.

135
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,800
Collect all the items and don’t miss anything

136
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,880
Click now, be careful

137
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,920
I said, as long as we come to this dock

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,080
You can leave Qin

139
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Do you know that they will definitely be willing to take us?

140
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,320
Don't worry, I will definitely convince them

141
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
This uncle

142
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,640
Where will your boat go?

143
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,840
That boat was used to carry cargo to the big ship

144
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,960
That big ship will go to Qi via Wei State

145
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,960
What's up?

146
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,480
My husband and I have urgent matters and we have to go to Qi State.

147
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,080
Could you please give us a ride?

148
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,120
I can't decide

149
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,320
The ship was chartered by a song and dance troupe

150
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,000
Find another one

151
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,080
Can you be kind and accommodating? We are in a hurry.

152
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
They all said no

153
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
What's up?

154
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,720
It just so happens that this is Sister Feng, the leader of the song and dance troupe.

155
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,520
Tell her yourselves

156
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,000
Is this Sister Feng?

157
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,520
That's it

158
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,280
Our couple's son got seriously ill in Qi State

159
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,640
we want to visit him

160
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,080
Could you please give us a ride, Sister Feng?

161
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,960
Take you?

162
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,040
We'll do menial work for you on the ship and pay for it as ship's money.

163
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,480
We can do any hard work

164
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,320
Uncle Qi

165
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,000
Didn't you mean that there were two less people on the ship doing laundry and cooking?

166
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,200
Yes, Sister Feng

167
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,400
So are you two willing to do it?

168
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,640
Yes yes, of course yes

169
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,840
As long as Sister Feng is willing to let us board the boat

170
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,440
We are willing to do anything

171
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,040
Okay, I'll ask Mr. Ma to arrange for you to get on the boat.

172
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,920
Thank you, Sister Feng

173
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,440
follow me

174
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,720
Mr. Ma, the couple got on the boat with us.

175
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,320
Arrange work for them to do

176
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,760
Okay, follow me Okay

177
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,360
You guys first help carry the grain onto the barge.

178
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,320
Go to the big ship later

179
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,360
What will I tell you to do again?

180
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,640
Yes

181
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,080
Is there any need to be so groveling?

182
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,880
If you don't act like one, you will easily be suspected

183
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,560
work

184
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,080
Manager Ma, why hasn’t Feng Fei shown up yet?

185
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,640
If she doesn't come, we can't set sail.

186
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,360
Sister Feng, I was just about to tell you this.

187
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,440
Last night Fengfei said she would go ashore to visit relatives and friends

188
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,480
Who knew that once I went there, I still haven’t come back yet?

189
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,480
How can this be? She is our pillar

190
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,600
If she doesn't come, we can't sail the boat

191
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,080
I believe this must be Sister Feng

192
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,200
Who are you…

193
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,080
That's it

194
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,360
My master told me to bring fifty taels of gold

195
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,720
It’s to help Miss Feng Fei redeem herself.

196
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,520
What? Your master wants to redeem Feng Fei’s life?

197
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,760
Yes, Miss Fengfei is married to my husband

198
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,200
She will never come back again

199
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,000
Feng Fei got married without even saying hello.

200
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,760
Wouldn't this kill me?

201
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,280
How can I go to Qi without Fengfei?

202
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
How should I explain to King Qi?

203
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,160
There's really nothing I can do for this little guy.

204
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,960
Sister Feng, please accept these fifty taels of gold first

205
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,840
My master will not default on each other's debts with you from now on.

206
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,560
farewell

207
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,400
etc…

208
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,720
Sister Feng, forget it

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,400
The so-called married daughter, the water thrown out

210
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,080
Now that the rice has become cooking pot, how can you pursue it?

211
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,840
I also know that I am not stopping her from getting married.

212
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,960
But she can go to Wanqi with me and remarry

213
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,920
I was really killed by her

214
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,760
So what? Can we sail the boat?

215
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,680
This time I went to the State of Qi to congratulate the King of Qi on his birthday.

216
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,680
if we lose

217
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,920
Even if I have ten heads, I can’t bear it.

218
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,600
There's nothing we can do about it now

219
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,640
Let’s talk about it when we get to Qi, let’s go...

220
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,960
Dear boatmen, come over for dinner.

221
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,400
Anyway, it’s going well today, I’ll hold on after eating

222
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,400
OK, it’s time to eat…

223
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,960
Sorry, let me wipe it for you

224
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,720
I have cloth, I'm so sorry

225
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,600
It doesn't matter...I'll wipe it myself

226
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,800
good and gentle

227
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,200
Fortunately I found it early

228
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,800
Otherwise it will be us who die today

229
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,040
How do you know he is an assassin?

230
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,280
Do you still remember when we delivered the meal today?

231
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,200
Sorry, let me wipe it for you

232
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,120
I have cloth, I'm so sorry

233
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,440
It doesn't matter...I'll wipe it myself

234
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,200
When I wiped his hands with a cloth

235
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,920
I found that only his right hand was calloused

236
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,160
But not the left hand

237
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,800
Because you need to use both hands to rock the oar

238
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
If he is really an ordinary boatman

239
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,600
He should have calluses on both hands

240
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,240
He just has a callus on his right hand

241
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,320
It proves that he is no ordinary boatman

242
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,280
And he's most likely a right-handed swordsman.

243
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,240
Fortunately Shanrou is alert enough

244
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,160
The most important thing now is to dispose of the body

245
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,920
Just send him to see the Sea Dragon King

246
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,560
Just unaware of the ghost

247
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,840
Will they realize that a boatman is missing?

248
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,720
It’s okay even if you notice it

249
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,040
Just when he accidentally fell into the sea while urinating at night

250
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,600
Don't worry, we won't be suspected

251
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,240
The blood stains on your body should be removed while everyone is sleeping

252
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,360
Let's wash ourselves

253
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,360
Manager Ma, just in time to come...

254
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,160
Sister Feng, please stop drinking

255
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,800
It's better to go to bed early

256
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,720
Manager Ma, how can I sleep?

257
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,720
Lord Tian Dan invited us to go to Qi State

258
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,000
Performing songs and dances for King Qi is to celebrate King Qi’s birthday

259
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,360
I even accepted the deposit

260
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
Suddenly it was said that the pillar was missing

261
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,240
It seems that I am really dead this time

262
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,720
It's still some time until King Qi's birthday

263
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,720
Maybe you can find someone else to replace you in time

264
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,920
But they asked Fengfei to perform

265
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,080
Where can I go to find Feng Fei?

266
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,760
You don't have to worry, as the saying goes, everything will go straight when it reaches the bridge.

267
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,920
Since Sister Feng led the song and dance troupe to travel around the world

268
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,040
Been through a lot of storms

269
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,000
Will it be impossible to pass this level?

270
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,080
Now I can only hope that Lord Qi will have a large number of

271
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,560
King's amnesty

272
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,560
Otherwise, there is really no other way

273
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,120
Forget it, the so-called worry about tomorrow will come tomorrow

274
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,000
If you have any questions, let’s talk about it tomorrow

275
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,600
you…

276
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,920
I didn’t expect my parents to save us two sisters.

277
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,680
He was beaten to death by bullies

278
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
He won’t let us go after that

279
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,560
He wants us to be his seventeenth and eighteenth concubines

280
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,680
Sister Feng, where do you think the law of heaven lies?

281
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,720
We sisters are really desperate

282
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,520
Only then will he disguise himself and run away.

283
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,120
Hope to avoid the persecution of bullies

284
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,920
If Sister Feng really wants to drive us off the boat,

285
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,920
We really have nowhere to go

286
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,680
If you really want us to marry those two bullies

287
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,360
We would rather jump into the sea and die

288
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,240
How can we explain so many misfortunes that happen to women in the world?

289
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
You can rest assured

290
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,240
When we go out to travel around the world, the most important thing is the word righteousness.

291
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,400
My Sister Feng will never be so inhumane

292
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,280
Driving you off the boat

293
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,600
Sister Feng, do you really want us to stay on the boat?

294
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,160
Why don't you thank me soon, Sister Feng?

295
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,600
Thank you Sister Feng for your life-saving grace

296
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,160
You are too serious

297
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,400
Manager Ma, although they are beautiful

298
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,400
You don’t have to look at them intently

299
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,120
No, Sister Feng, look at her carefully

300
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,280
Do you think she looks like the same person?

301
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,160
Really? Come on…

302
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,440
You look at her left profile from the side

303
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:54,760
You see, she really looks a bit like Feng Fei

304
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,680
Yes, you don’t think so even if you don’t say it

305
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,840
They look really similar.

306
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,160
But Fengfei is not as tall as her, and her complexion is fairer

307
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,080
if i read correctly

308
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,560
As soon as she put on makeup and dance clothes

309
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,640
It looks more like

310
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,640
Yeah?

311
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,000
Okay, put on your makeup and take a look

312
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,560
Come and see

313
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,440
Really much more beautiful

314
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
How is it? Manager Ma

315
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,680
She really looks like Feng Fei.

316
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,600
Although it cannot be said that they are 100% similar.

317
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,480
Anyway, King Qi has never seen the real Feng Fei.

318
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,520
This time it really saved our song and dance troupe

319
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,240
Sister Feng, who is this Feng Fei?

320
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,200
Fengfei was originally our pillar

321
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,560
This time we went to Qi State to perform

322
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,720
Who knew that I would suddenly get married in the middle of the journey?

323
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,520
God is really blessing me now

324
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,880
Let me meet you, you look so much like Feng Fei

325
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,360
If you are willing to take her place

326
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,720
It's like saving our song and dance troupe

327
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,840
No, I can't sing or dance at all

328
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,400
Okay, who says no, it’s just singing and dancing

329
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,920
You are so smart, you will be able to do it if you practice for a few days

330
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,600
but…

331
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,280
It’s rare that Sister Feng is willing to take us in

332
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,200
We must repay thanksgiving

333
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,800
Sister Feng, I will do everything as you say

334
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,000
so good

335
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,920
good and gentle

336
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,160
We are leaving this time

337
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,040
Nothing more than running away from that bully

338
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,760
It’s a rare opportunity to join a song and dance troupe

339
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,440
Why not?

340
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,880
I'll try my best

341
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,160
you can rest assured

342
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,760
It's still more than half a month away from Qi State.

343
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,680
I have confidence

344
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,800
I can definitely train you to become the second Feng Fei

345
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,800
Sister Feng, why don’t you accept me as your disciple?

346
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,760
I can also dance a little, let me dance for you

347
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,560
good

348
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,640
Not bad, really unexpected

349
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,120
Okay, I will arrange for you to perform on the same stage in the future

350
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,440
Thank you, Sister Feng

351
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,920
We will definitely study hard

352
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,800
I won't let you down

353
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
that's great

354
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,280
Ayi

355
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,120
Have you checked whether there is enough food in the city?

356
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,000
I've ordered all the food

357
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,080
It should be enough to defend the city for ten days.

358
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,440
What we are facing this time

359
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,080
It’s Li Mu who has never lost a battle

360
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,320
And he is Apan’s godfather

361
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
This sword was also given to me by him that day.

362
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,680
So things are unpredictable

363
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,720
I didn't expect to have to fight with him today

364
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,600
Brother, if you feel embarrassed

365
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,560
When the two armies clash, let me deal with Li Mu

366
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,760
No

367
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,720
When a war breaks out, even father and son are ruthless

368
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,960
Do you know the city

369
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,640
Are there any famous swordsmiths?

370
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,400
Yes, there is a swordsmith named Mo in the city.

371
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,080
Good at making various weapons

372
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,640
You go find him and get a knife right away

373
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,040
Once it's done, you'll know what it is.

374
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,960
Report to the general, report from the spies

375
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,520
The Zhao army is stationed ten miles east of the city

376
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,680
I didn't expect Li Mu to arrive at the city so quickly.

377
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,600
Don't worry, I've already made an appointment with Wang Jian

378
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,480
His reinforcements will arrive in three days

379
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,040
As long as we wait until three days

380
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,720
Then you have a chance to win

381
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,680
A civil uprising occurred in Dong County? Why?

382
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,080
King Hui

383
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,440
Anyi in Dongjun was once under the rule of Wei State

384
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,960
Therefore, old Wei people often used stories to stir up trouble.

385
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,240
Corrupting the party and committing crimes led to this popular uprising.

386
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,680
Your Majesty, in order to prevent the civil unrest from spreading.

387
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,320
The chaos must be quelled quickly

388
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,160
Wei Chen suggested that the king rush to send an order to Wang Jian.

389
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,400
Change route and rush to Anyi to quell the chaos

390
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,480
Order Wang Jian to rush to quell the chaos

391
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,720
Your Majesty, this is absolutely impossible

392
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,040
Wang Jian is leading his troops to Qicheng

393
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,000
Cooperate with Xiang Shaolong inside and outside to attack Zhao Jun

394
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,560
without delay

395
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,000
It is not appropriate to temporarily mobilize Wang Jian's army at this time

396
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,760
Go to Dongjun to quell the chaos

397
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,200
Your Majesty is aware of this, and if so, he will send troops to quell the chaos.

398
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,960
It will take ten days at the earliest to reach Anyi

399
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,360
As the saying goes, water far away cannot put out fire nearby.

400
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,920
Once the civil unrest spreads

401
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,680
Will shake the foundation of national governance

402
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,520
But if there were no reinforcements from Wang Jian,

403
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,880
Xiang Shaolong can fight alone

404
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,200
May not be able to defend the city

405
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,840
If this happens, wouldn't it put Xiang Shaolong in danger?

406
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,680
Wang Jian's army is near Anyi

407
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,760
As long as the king gives the order

408
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,200
We can arrive in Anyi within a few days to put an end to the chaos.

409
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,400
After Wang Jian's army put down the civil uprising,

410
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,240
It’s not too late to rush to Qicheng

411
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,960
Your Majesty, as the saying goes, before we fight against the outside world, we must first make peace at home.

412
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,280
Prime Minister Lu is indeed right.

413
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,520
What's more, rushing from Anyi to Qicheng

414
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,080
It’s only three days

415
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,840
With Xiang Shaolong’s ability

416
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,760
There's no way he can't hold on for three days

417
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,960
Prime Minister, although we took advantage of the Dongjun civil uprising this time

418
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,880
Successfully delayed Wang Jian's army

419
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,240
But Xiang Shaolong is not an ordinary person either.

420
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,920
If he can really defend Wucheng

421
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,080
Isn't it...

422
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,280
Don't worry, the truth has already been arranged.

423
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,000
As long as there is wealth

424
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,040
Nature can buy anything

425
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,840
Including Xiang Shaolong’s head

426
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,080
The prime minister is indeed thoughtful and careful

427
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,760
It really convinced Meng Ao

428
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,880
What I am worried about now is Lao Ai.

429
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,200
He also agreed with the prime minister's proposal just now

430
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,720
Mr. Xiang, what are you worried about?

431
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,360
This person has ulterior motives

432
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,000
Just now he openly supported the truth, which is really suspicious

433
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,840
But no matter what

434
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,840
He finally gave me a helping hand

435
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,000
As long as Xiang Shaolong is eliminated

436
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,080
Lao Ai is nothing to be afraid of.

437
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,640
How is it? General Xiang

438
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,960
Did you find any problems?

439
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,880
I just went to see the city tower

440
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,840
With our military strength, we must resist Li Mu's army

441
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,080
No problem for several days

442
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,000
If General Wang Jian can really arrive in time

443
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,280
I am absolutely confident that I can defeat them

444
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,080
Do you have any news about General Wang Jian?

445
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,560
The general is worried about this matter

446
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,200
According to the spies' reports, so far

447
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,480
I haven’t seen Vice General Wang’s reinforcements pass by yet.

448
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,440
Could it be that something happened to Wang Jian on the way?

449
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,200
No way, under this situation

450
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,720
If Zhao Bing launches a massive attack

451
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,080
Wouldn't we...

452
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,360
Don't worry, Li Mu's army has not moved at the moment.

453
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,680
I believe they won’t launch an offensive against us for the time being.

454
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,040
What I'm most worried about now

455
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,440
I just don’t know what happened to the court.

456
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,000
Preventing General Wang Jian from coming

457
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,480
Report to General Xiang

458
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,840
Zhao Jun coach Li Mu sent someone to deliver the ultimatum

459
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,200
say what?

460
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,360
Li Mu asked you to meet outside the city at sunset

461
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,400
Listen, everyone, get out of here

462
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,600
General Li, hello

463
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,360
That day I said goodbye to General Xiang in Handan

464
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,360
I never imagined the day you and I would meet again

465
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,760
It was actually the time when the soldiers met each other

466
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,920
But that's fine, no matter what

467
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,360
General Xiang is willing to meet me alone

468
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,600
It’s not in vain that I got to know you, my old friend

469
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,080
If General Li really considers me a friend

470
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,680
Xiang Shaolong has a request

471
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,080
You rescued Pan'er from the tiger's mouth back then

472
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,840
It is kind and righteous to us

473
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,600
If I, Li Mu, had the ability

474
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,960
Will definitely agree

475
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,480
In fact, this time the two countries are at war

476
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,640
There will definitely be many casualties

477
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,200
speaking of

478
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,280
I'm also a bit too ambitious to let others down, which destroys my own prestige.

479
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,000
But if General Lee

480
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,520
If one day we really conquer the city,

481
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,840
I hope you won't kill innocent people indiscriminately

482
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,760
I didn’t expect General Xiang to be so kind-hearted.

483
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,600
I promise you, if our army really breaks through Qicheng

484
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,080
I will never kill anyone indiscriminately

485
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,920
Thank you General Li

486
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,360
This Feihong Sword was given to me by you that day

487
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,400
This sword represents the friendship between us

488
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,160
If you really want me to use this sword

489
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,960
If we fight each other on the battlefield

490
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,000
I really can't do it

491
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,520
Xiang Shaolong is indeed a man who values ​​love and justice

492
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,520
Prepare wine

493
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,400
I, Li Mu, also have something to ask of you.

494
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,520
General Li, please speak

495
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,800
I want to know how Pan'er is doing now?

496
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,320
I won’t hide anything from General Li either.

497
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,520
Apan lives in Xianyang anonymously

498
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,240
He was obsessed with everything in the past

499
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,560
Have completely forgotten everything

500
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,560
I can in my lifetime

501
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,280
Knowing that I, Pan'er, have found my own world

502
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,160
I'm really comforting

503
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:31,600
General Xiang, you are so kind to me Pan'er.

504
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,000
I, Li Mu, am unforgettable

505
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,400
After we drank this glass of wine here today,

506
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,840
From now on, we will never owe each other anything.

507
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,480
Big brother

508
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,400
good

509
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,080
Wherever the blade passes, leaving no trace

510
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,920
It is indeed the work of a famous teacher.

511
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,760
But it's a pity

512
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,120
I actually want to use the knife I made myself

513
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,680
Fight against General Li Mu's Feihong Sword

514
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,560
Brother, why are you acting on a whim?

515
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,120
Order me to have someone make this strange knife

516
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,800
Because of my Mozi swordsmanship

517
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,000
The focus is on offense as defense, focusing on moves

518
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,640
It means fast, ruthless and accurate

519
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,200
The swords you use all weigh more than ten or twenty kilograms.

520
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,480
Fighting is such a waste of energy

521
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,520
And this knife

522
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,400
It is modeled after the Japanese Oriental sword.

523
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,560
Fully meets the requirements of Mozi's swordsmanship

524
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,280
Tomorrow we will fight Zhao Guo

525
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,120
Although there is no help from Wang Jian

526
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,720
But if you have this knife

527
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,880
At least I can save some energy and fight for an extra day or two.

528
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,560
Please rest assured, General Xiang

529
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,720
The general has mobilized all the people in the city

530
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,240
Vow to defend Qicheng to the death

531
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,520
Are you crazy?

532
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,440
I tell you, I would rather abandon the city if necessary

533
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,760
I don’t want to hurt any common people, you know?

534
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,480
Yes, General

535
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,920
Report to General Xiang, there are some Mohists outside the city who want to see you.

536
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,920
They expressed their willingness to assist General Xiang in defending the city

537
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,560
He is really the seal supervisor of Juziling

538
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,120
Who gave you this confidential letter?

539
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,800
We don’t know either, but as Mohists we

540
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,920
It has always been his duty to eliminate wars and help others defend the city.

541
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,360
As soon as we received the secret letter, we rushed to Qicheng

542
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,600
Help General Xiang against Zhao Jun

543
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,000
There are so many Mohists helping to defend the city

544
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,800
This time Qicheng can be saved

545
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,840
Okay, let's discuss what to do right away, follow me

546
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
yes

547
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,960
Start attacking

548
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,600
Kill

549
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,520
Oops, brother, those Mohists opened the city gate.

550
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,440
Go down and have a look

551
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,160
Brother, I can't hold on anymore, let's go

552
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,360
careful

553
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,560
Let's go, Wings

554
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,520
Ayi, let's go separately

555
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,920
You lead the others that way

556
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,640
I am responsible for diverting Zhao Bing away

557
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,080
Brother, let’s go together

558
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,080
Shut up, this is an order

559
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,960
If you don't listen, you'll be dead

560
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,040
Teng Yi obeyed

561
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,080
spread

562
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,120
General Li is so powerful, Xiang Shaolong is really impressed by you

563
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,440
General Xiang, you are also a talented person

564
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,680
If you are willing to serve Zhao Guo

565
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,280
I, Li Mu, will definitely protect your life

566
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,760
Xiang Shaolong will not admit defeat

567
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,400
Even if I die today, I will not surrender

568
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,680
General Xiang is indeed a good man

569
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,960
Okay, if I, Li Mu, am outnumbered and outnumbered,

570
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,480
It’s really hard to win with force

571
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,360
Obey, this person can only be captured alive

572
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,120
everyone listen

573
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,040
We must move forward bravely and regard death as home

574
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,280
Walk

575
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,040
Taifu…

576
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,400
Mirror…

577
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,480
How could this happen? Could it be Taifu Xiang...

578
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,360
Your Majesty, Taishi Li has something urgent to see you.

579
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,640
Li Si

580
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,880
Quick pass

581
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,880
Your Majesty, something bad is going on

582
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,360
Did something happen to Taifu Xiang?

583
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,600
How did the king know?

584
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,160
Tell me, is Taifu Xiang alive or dead?

585
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,680
Yes, Wei Chen just received the report from the spies.

586
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,640
The city has fallen

587
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,560
General Xiang's whereabouts are unknown and his life or death is uncertain.

588
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,920
King…

589
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
Xiang Taifu

590
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,200
May the king be blessed

591
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,120
All the ministers have a normal family life

592
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,640
King

593
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,320
You don't look good today. Are you feeling unwell?

594
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,080
Now the city is lost

595
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,320
Taifu Xiang’s life, death and whereabouts are unknown

596
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,760
I don’t know what good strategies the ministers have to deal with?

597
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,840
If the king trusts the minister

598
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,000
Let Wei Chen be responsible for this matter

599
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,440
Weichen is absolutely confident

600
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,960
Not only can it clean up the mess

601
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,560
They can even launch a massive counterattack to retake Qicheng.

602
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,800
Leave this matter to Prime Minister Lu?

603
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,800
Great King, if King Meng does not give up

604
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,440
Why don't I take charge of the expedition personally this time?

605
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,280
to revitalize the military

606
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,800
Lord Changxin, although you are good at swordsmanship

607
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,920
But fighting on the march is no better than fighting alone

608
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,040
The reason why Xiang Shaolong’s entire army has been wiped out now

609
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,640
It’s just that he failed because he was too confident and had no practical experience.

610
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,680
Could it be that Chang Xinhou wanted to follow in his footsteps?

611
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,960
Prime Minister Lu is just a businessman

612
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,600
Could it be that he is also good at dispatching troops and generals to fight on the battlefield?

613
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,800
The truth is that there are generals and talents around

614
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,760
In addition, now that the civil unrest has subsided,

615
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,560
Wang Jian's army can rush to Qicheng at any time

616
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,280
Even if we use old general Wang Hao to put on his armor again,

617
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,680
It’s far better than trusting you forever

618
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,960
Your Majesty, in handling state affairs, the most important thing is to know people and assign them well.

619
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,440
Back then, the king had his own way and misused Xiang Shaolong.

620
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,800
Now we can't make the same mistake again and again. Okay...

621
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,680
There's no point in arguing anymore.

622
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,920
How will Prime Minister Lu handle this matter?

623
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,040
Although he made his own decision, he retired from the imperial court

624
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,360
Mr. Zou...

625
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,360
Is there any news about Qicheng in the DPRK?

626
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,400
Yes, but it's bad news

627
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,480
Could it be...

628
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,680
Because Wang Jian's reinforcements failed to arrive in time,

629
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,680
Zhao Jun finally captured Qicheng

630
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,320
How about Shaolong?

631
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,280
My eldest brother and my second brother are both alive and dead now.

632
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,240
In this way, the hexagram I obtained is absolutely correct.

633
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,840
What divination did Mr. Zou make?

634
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,720
Is there something wrong with my eldest and second brother?

635
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,800
I just asked for a hexagram, this is the master hexagram

636
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,040
The five lines before this hexagram are all bad

637
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,360
Only the last line is auspicious

638
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,160
It's a pity that this is the auspicious line

639
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,480
This is where things change again

640
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,880
Is that good or bad?

641
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,960
There is no explicit statement in the hexagram

642
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,000
I only hope that Shaolong and the others

643
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,280
Can auspicious people and heaven, escape this disaster

644
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,680
Where is Taifu Qin?

645
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,920
But I can promise you

646
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,400
I will definitely come back alive to see you
