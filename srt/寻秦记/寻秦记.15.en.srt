1
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,240
kill

2
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,040
Chase

3
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,040
Come on...go on, go and search

4
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,920
hurry up…

5
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,320
Yes... Search everywhere

6
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,400
Your Majesty, Master

7
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,080
Your Majesty, Master

8
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,560
It's a pity that there was cloud cover last night

9
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,360
Unable to observe stars

10
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,800
It's a clear day today with no clouds in the sky

11
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,240
I believe the stars will be very clear tonight

12
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,520
In this way

13
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,800
Students can get a glimpse of the new Saint's horoscope tonight

14
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,480
good

15
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,120
I am Xiao Wei Mou from Xinling Lord's Mansion

16
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,240
Following the order of Lord Xinling, I caught the thief.

17
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,440
It is now suspected that the thief entered the waterside pavilion

18
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,000
We need to search the waterside pavilion

19
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,640
Who dares to stop me from searching for the thief?

20
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,720
Aren't you afraid that Lord Xinling will blame you?

21
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,960
If you delay further

22
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,600
Don't blame me for being merciless with my sword.

23
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,200
How to show no mercy with a sword?

24
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,080
It turned out to be the general manager of Xinlingjun Mansion, Wei Mouxiao.

25
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,960
No wonder he is so arrogant

26
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,840
It's not that I mean to disturb you

27
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,360
It was just stolen from Lord Xinling's house

28
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,320
The thief is most likely hiding in the waterside pavilion

29
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,680
Long Yangjun, just make it easier for you

30
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,520
Let me search inside

31
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,280
Be bold, this waterside pavilion is where I entertain guests

32
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,200
How can I allow you to search as you say?

33
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,600
What does the theft of Lord Xinling's Mansion have to do with me?

34
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
Everyone comes here to search if they have something stolen.

35
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,880
Aren’t you in peace?

36
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,520
I'm just following orders

37
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,240
Mr. Long Yang, if you don’t make it convenient for me,

38
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,280
It’s hard for me to explain to Lord Xinling

39
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,120
This is your business

40
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Please leave quickly and stop causing trouble

41
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,480
push around

42
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,720
You are obviously deliberately harboring the thief.

43
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,200
Well, it certainly lives up to its reputation.

44
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,480
Worthy of being the number one swordsman in the Wei Kingdom

45
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,160
Don’t think you are Lord Xinling’s favorite general

46
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,360
He is arrogant and proud of his master.

47
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,000
Even your master, Mr. Xinling, is afraid of me.

48
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,320
Please come back

49
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,960
Listen up, everyone, every mile around the waterside pavilion will be searched.

50
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,600
to prevent thieves from escaping

51
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,040
yes…

52
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,080
godfather

53
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,560
The thief that everyone was talking about just now

54
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
I wonder if I can actually sneak into the waterside pavilion?

55
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,400
Master, I have ordered people to step up inspections.

56
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,080
We must step up inspections

57
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,200
To prevent my goddaughter from being frightened

58
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,520
good

59
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,720
Goddaughter...are you okay?

60
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,160
What does the godfather want to do with his daughter?

61
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,480
My daughter is getting ready to take a bath and change clothes

62
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Inside the waterside pavilion, an uninvited guest came

63
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,320
If you are fine, you should pay attention to the door

64
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,920
Never move around

65
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,440
My daughter knows

66
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,680
sorry

67
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,160
I don't know who you are, please leave immediately

68
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,320
Ah Qing?

69
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,600
Ah Qing

70
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,880
Please leave immediately

71
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,560
Otherwise my shouting will alert others

72
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
You are not Ah Qing, it is impossible

73
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,040
godfather

74
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,880
You continue to patrol around and don't let up.

75
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,120
yes, know

76
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,680
It's unreasonable that a thief escaped

77
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,040
Long Yangjun was determined not to let his subordinates search the mansion.

78
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,000
If you are selfless and show your selfishness, you must be shielding a thief.

79
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,800
Mr. Long Yang has been against me many times, which is really hateful.

80
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,280
If it weren't for his many obstructions, the thief would have been caught long ago

81
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,560
Long Yangjun has ulterior motives

82
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,880
According to what his subordinates saw, Lord Long Yang protected the thief

83
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,400
The house was stolen, it must have been under his instigation

84
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,160
Yes, it must be him

85
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,400
When the slave family enters the city

86
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,880
I just think he looks annoying everywhere

87
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,000
He is a man but behaves in an artificial way

88
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,360
With a charming face, she looks like a little girl

89
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,080
He must have ordered someone to steal your Majesty's treasure.

90
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,400
Only the masters under Long Yangjun

91
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,560
Only with such martial arts

92
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,640
An Ran can come and go freely in Lord Xinling's mansion

93
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,760
Long Yangjun is indeed worthy of doubt

94
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,360
But I saw Mrs. Ya

95
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,000
It reminds me of another person with great martial arts skills.

96
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,680
Your Majesty, why did Xiang Shaolong come to the house to steal?

97
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,200
absolutely impossible

98
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,440
It will be known soon whether Xiang Shaolong committed the theft or not.

99
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,520
Search the entire villa

100
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,840
Subordinates obey orders

101
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,000
Your Majesty, this room has not been searched yet

102
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,800
search

103
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,840
Yes wait a minute

104
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,760
That room is Princess Zhao Qian’s bedroom

105
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,720
No one should be allowed to break in casually.

106
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,960
Lord Xinling, the princess is worth a thousand pieces of gold.

107
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,520
This would damage her innocence

108
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,360
Mrs. Ya wants to keep the princess innocent

109
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,360
Or is it Xiang Shaolong’s innocence?

110
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,440
Search Yes

111
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Unexpectedly, General Xiang is a general who protects the bride.

112
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
He actually had an affair with the princess

113
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,520
It has nothing to do with the princess, it's my fault

114
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,080
I couldn't help it for a moment

115
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,560
Do you know the consequences of spreading this matter?

116
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,440
I know

117
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,040
But I have already explained it to Mrs. Ya

118
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
She knows that I am sincere to the princess

119
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,720
She didn't blame me

120
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,760
Now only you, Mr. Xinling, know

121
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,040
I hope you can help me keep this secret

122
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,520
Do you want me to keep your secret?

123
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

124
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,320
There is still a verbal agreement between you and me

125
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,120
Now your meat is on the chopping board

126
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,440
If you want to cooperate, let your roommate go first.

127
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,080
No problem, I'll write you a letter later

128
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,080
You can send your men

129
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,520
Go pick up the mother and son back

130
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,760
But our top priority now is

131
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,040
Just to discuss how to kill King Wei

132
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,880
Because the princess's wedding is coming soon

133
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,960
Besides, I now have something to hold on to by you.

134
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,560
You don’t have to be afraid that I will leave

135
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,080
It seems that I really have no reason to refuse you.

136
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,000
Okay, let's make it a deal

137
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,280
Thank you Mr. Xinling, I'll go first then

138
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,000
please please

139
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,920
Your Majesty, do you really believe what Xiang Shaolong said?

140
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,760
Secret recording is life-threatening

141
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,480
But stealing the princess is a crime of beheading

142
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,960
There is no contradiction between Xiang Shaolong’s preface and last sentence.

143
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,720
It seems that what he said is credible

144
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,120
So Lu Gong’s Secret Record…

145
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,760
Now the most suspicious person is always Long Yangjun

146
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,080
Immediately send people to monitor the movement of the waterside pavilion day and night.

147
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,680
Subordinates obey orders

148
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,800
Long Yangjun

149
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,200
Lord Xinling really has no doubt?

150
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,160
He also wants to use me

151
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,000
Now I have something to catch him

152
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,720
I don't think he's going to tell this story.

153
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,160
I don’t think he would do anything that harms others but does not benefit himself.

154
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,520
I thought I could have a smooth sailing

155
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,440
Put the blame on Long Yangjun

156
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,080
Unexpectedly, there are so many words and many mistakes

157
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Instead, it aroused Lord Xinling’s suspicion.

158
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,200
I was really frightened when I searched the house just now.

159
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,680
Fortunately, Shaolong, you are smart enough

160
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,440
If it hadn't been for the situation just now

161
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,880
I won't be forced into the princess's room

162
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,800
Makes it seem like I really have an affair with her

163
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,600
As long as you don't have to marry that bastard

164
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,760
Nothing else matters to me

165
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,640
Brother Xiang, you have stolen the secret record now

166
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,680
Can we leave here right now?

167
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,800
It's a pity that the secret record is still in the waterside pavilion.

168
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,920
But it's lucky

169
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,520
If I hadn't left that thing over there

170
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,320
When Lord Xinling was searching this place just now,

171
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,760
It's really a case of both people taking the stolen goods.

172
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,560
Shaolong, retrieve the secret record as soon as possible

173
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,040
The princess's lifelong happiness is entrusted to you

174
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,440
Welcome...please take a seat

175
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,520
Sir, what would you like to eat?

176
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,880
One plate of beef, one plate of braised pork, and ten steamed buns

177
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,440
Uncle, can you eat so much by yourself?

178
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,920
If you can’t eat it, you can feed it to the dog.

179
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,200
Anyway, someone will pay the bill for me

180
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,880
Why don't you hurry up and prepare?

181
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,560
OK…

182
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,680
You two gentlemen, what would you like to eat?

183
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,320
Give us some steamed buns and water

184
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,960
OK...please wait a moment

185
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,080
Sir, please sit down

186
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,880
Please sit down

187
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,480
Uncle, what would you like to eat?

188
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,920
Two steamed buns and a plate of beef

189
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,520
OK, please wait a moment

190
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,280
With your hands like this, you can still imitate others in holding a sword?

191
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,360
Lao doesn’t want to eat in front of a dead body

192
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,960
Lao Ai, stop

193
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,400
You've gone too far

194
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,160
since days

195
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,120
In order to show his sincerity in becoming a disciple, Brother Lian

196
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,080
I will work as your ox or your horse, and I will be your slave.

197
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,160
It’s not just about taking care of food and housing

198
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,960
I will also bury the dead body for you

199
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,800
Lao didn't force you

200
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,520
Are you willing to accept eldest brother Lien as your disciple?

201
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,680
You should also make it clear

202
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,080
Why do you need to torture people like this?

203
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,840
I want to be my disciple

204
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,000
It’s not just about being a cow, a horse, a slave, a maid

205
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,400
I also want to see if you have the ability

206
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,720
Really climb up with him?

207
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,640
Let me go, I'll kill you

208
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,440
No, we must advance and retreat together

209
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,760
You two are as slow as ants climbing a tree

210
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,520
Senior, I have passed the first level.

211
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,840
No

212
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,240
Do you want to regret it?

213
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,560
Lao didn't say anything about climbing to the top of this cliff.

214
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,360
Even if you pass the first level

215
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,680
The first level is to jump from here

216
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,960
The first condition for being a swordsman is not to be afraid of death

217
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,160
Because every day you may encounter stronger opponents

218
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,520
kill you

219
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,480
If you have the guts to jump from here

220
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,880
Even if you pass the first level

221
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,280
If you jump from here, you will be shattered into pieces.

222
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,600
Please feel free to jump or not

223
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,920
Lao is also happy to be quiet

224
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,400
I don’t have to be bothered by you two boring people anymore.

225
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,200
It turns out you were teasing us all along

226
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,200
I am willing to accept the test of my seniors

227
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,200
Brother Lian, are you crazy?

228
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I have already put my life and death at risk

229
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,160
Senior, if Lian Jin can pass this level by luck,

230
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,280
I hope you won’t break your promise, senior

231
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,800
Brother Lian

232
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,720
Brother Lian, are you awake?

233
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,960
You passed the first level

234
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,680
Senior Lao

235
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,800
You don’t have to be too happy, there are still two levels to pass.

236
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,520
The cesspool smells so bad

237
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,680
Not everyone has the ability to withstand it

238
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,320
Could it be that you want to eat the eldest brother...

239
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,360
That's not necessary, just be in it

240
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,440
Physical and limb disabilities all the time

241
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,600
To face cold looks and ridicule and suffer humiliation

242
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,800
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

243
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,560
Able to endure all kinds of shame and humiliation

244
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,240
Senior is right

245
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,400
If you can wait until noon tomorrow

246
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,880
Even if you pass the second level successfully

247
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,680
Madam, the afternoon meal is ready

248
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,280
After having a meal, continue your leisure activities

249
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,240
Your Majesty, they are waiting for you

250
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,600
Be careful, madam

251
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,240
Madam? Long Yangjun is gay

252
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,360
General Xiang

253
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,560
Why do you always appear behind others?

254
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,600
Why are you in my waterside pavilion?

255
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,080
I just saw that your back door was not closed

256
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,200
No one is here, so I came in to take a look.

257
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,080
You forgot what I said last time

258
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,560
Will you come to your house to swim when you have time?

259
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,160
Is General Xiang happy today?

260
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,160
Why not take a dip in the blue waves first?

261
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,920
No thanks, I’ll just paint landscapes today

262
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,920
Recite poetry and compose, right?

263
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,400
Reciting poetry correctly?

264
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,120
General Xiang is indeed an elegant scholar with all-round talents in both civil and military affairs.

265
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,640
I've been familiar with this since I was young

266
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,240
Now that the general is here

267
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,720
Let's all drink together and get drunk together

268
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,280
OK

269
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,320
Teacher, we have a distinguished guest at the waterside pavilion today.

270
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,400
Zhao Guo married General Xiang Shaolong

271
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,800
General Xiang

272
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,720
Hello…

273
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,920
Last time I was outside Daliang City

274
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,800
It’s also thanks to General Xiang’s intervention.

275
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,640
To avoid the verbal dispute between us and Mr. Xinling

276
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,880
General Xiang is truly extraordinary

277
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,000
You're welcome...

278
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,080
This is my mentor Zou Yan, Master Zou

279
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,280
Hello Mr. Zou

280
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,920
polite

281
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,480
My mentor is well versed in the art of divination and astrology.

282
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,080
Everything from astronomy to geography

283
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,840
So capable and awesome...

284
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,640
Just kidding…

285
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,040
Qingmei, let me introduce it to you.

286
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,600
Zhao Guo married General Xiang Shaolong

287
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,400
Ah Qing, why are you here?

288
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,960
Do you know my junior sister Qin Qing?

289
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Qin Qing?

290
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,960
I might have the wrong person

291
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,240
I heard that General Xiang once appeared in front of King Zhao

292
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,160
Compete in martial arts with Lian Jin, the best swordsman of the Zhao Kingdom

293
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,560
As a result, the opponent was defeated

294
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,760
General Xiang's swordsmanship must have reached its peak

295
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,240
extraordinary

296
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,600
I just got lucky for a while

297
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,880
The general is too humble

298
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,320
I have always loved studying swordsmanship

299
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,800
General, if you don't mind

300
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,440
Let's discuss it with you.

301
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,640
Isn’t it good? It’s so lively and happy today

302
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,080
Just have a glass of water and wine.

303
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,880
Drinking wine with the general is one of the joys of life

304
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,200
Wouldn't it be great if you could compete with the general on swordsmanship?

305
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,800
Good suggestion...I can open my eyes today

306
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,120
Both the teacher and Qingmei want to see the general's extraordinary swordsmanship

307
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,400
Really? Qingmei

308
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,480
The sword has no eyes, you two should be careful

309
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,680
The sword has no eyes?

310
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,280
General Xiang and I are just discussing matters.

311
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,760
How could there be any damage? Really? General Xiang

312
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,840
OK

313
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,480
Hello, General

314
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,360
General Xiang, I'm here to show my disgrace.

315
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,640
Okay, you first

316
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,560
good…

317
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,000
Sorry...General Xiang please

318
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,120
OK

319
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,960
Good swordsmanship, really wonderful

320
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,160
Thank you...Qingmei

321
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,800
General Xiang's swordsmanship is truly superb

322
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,040
General Xiang's sword skills

323
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,360
It seems to have originated from the disciples of the famous Mozi

324
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,200
But the Mohist family only defended but did not attack

325
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,600
The general's swordsmanship is both offensive and defensive

326
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,720
I am really puzzled and admired

327
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,440
In fact, I am just self-taught

328
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,800
General Xiang is indeed a genius

329
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,080
Your swordsmanship is more powerful

330
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,400
Playing as if she could dance

331
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,160
You two compliment each other and appreciate each other

332
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,600
It doesn't look like a sword show at all.

333
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,720
It's really nice to be able to have a wine and sword discussion with General Xiang.

334
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,360
Okay, today we won’t get drunk and won’t get home, please

335
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,840
OK

336
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,640
General Xiang

337
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,360
I'll prepare a carriage to take you back to Wuji Yashe

338
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,360
No need, I want to go back by myself

339
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,200
But just now the general drank a lot of wine

340
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,680
One or two glasses of wine can't get me drunk

341
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,560
General Xiang, what is it that makes the general unhappy?

342
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,360
There is a saying that goes: Passionate since ancient times, there is no room for hatred.

343
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,800
This hatred lasts forever

344
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,840
Since ancient times, passion has left no room for hatred, and this hatred lasts endlessly

345
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,840
It means knowing that you must not have any wrongdoing towards this person.

346
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,560
But I really want to see her, I really want to find her

347
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,280
If this really continues, something will happen sooner or later

348
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,840
Like someone?

349
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,240
Why is the general so troubled?

350
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,480
In short, the person I like is not something I should like.

351
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,360
If someone knows

352
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,960
It must make me laugh so hard that I lose all face

353
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,760
In fact, if you like someone, as long as it is out of true love

354
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,720
There is no need to pay attention to secular norms

355
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,080
As long as they are in love

356
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,240
Don’t worry about the eyes of outsiders

357
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,480
Like General Xiang, I am both a dashing person.

358
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,680
Will not be bound by the shackles of the world

359
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,400
Just find what you love

360
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,000
Will move forward courageously without hesitation

361
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,720
General Xiang, good brother

362
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,960
In fact, I absolutely understand this kind of thing about feelings.

363
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,480
But you also have another half

364
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,880
Don't ever feel sorry for me

365
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,080
There is a lot of gossip outside

366
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,360
I said that I have an ambiguous relationship with the king.

367
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,080
Relying on ulterior motives to gain the king's trust

368
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,400
It's all nonsense

369
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,160
He is an incompetent person who is jealous of the talented people below.

370
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,640
Only when you have been favored by the king can you slander me.

371
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,920
General Xiang, you must not listen to this

372
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,800
I also know how to analyze this kind of thing.

373
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,240
In fact, everyone’s sexual orientation is somewhat different

374
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,040
Stop talking about such things

375
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,320
But all in all

376
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,680
You shouldn’t have any wrong thoughts towards others

377
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,160
Maybe I drank too much and spoke a little incoherently.

378
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,360
I hope you won't be offended

379
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,720
Long Yangjun hopes to have the opportunity to share the worries of General Xiang

380
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,000
I hope I have a chance to drink with General Xiang again

381
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,680
If there's a chance... I'd better go first

382
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,040
General, walk slowly

383
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,000
Brother Xiang

384
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,600
Why haven't you slept yet?

385
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,600
Qian'er saw you went to the waterside pavilion and still didn't come back.

386
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,600
I'm worried that something will happen to you, so I'm waiting for you here

387
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,040
Now that I see you are back without incident, I feel relieved.

388
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,600
Shaolong

389
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,280
Has the secret record been obtained?

390
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,120
Any obstacles?

391
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,960
Brother Xiang has been running around all day

392
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,600
I believe they haven’t eaten yet

393
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,600
Shaolong ran away all day

394
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,240
The princess had been worried all day. She had not eaten yet.

395
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,000
Why haven't you eaten yet?

396
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,960
I'm not hungry at all

397
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,440
Wouldn't it make me more worried if you were hungry?

398
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,840
Come on in and have something to eat, come on

399
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,840
Shaolong only said one word, and the princess obeyed.

400
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,920
There is no doubt about the princess's affection for you

401
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,640
On the contrary

402
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,840
I wonder how deep Shaolong's affection for the princess is?

403
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,080
The princess is waiting for you to come back, and she doesn’t even think about food or tea.

404
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,600
Shaolong went there all day and smelled of alcohol.

405
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,360
I believe I enjoyed the meal just now.

406
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,040
My whereabouts were discovered by Long Yangjun

407
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,920
That’s why I stayed and had a meal with him to socialize.

408
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,520
Lord Long Yang?

409
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,720
I thought I lived in a waterside pavilion

410
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,120
That talented girl Qin Qing disrupted Shaolong's formation

411
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,920
I heard that this talented woman has outstanding talent and beauty

412
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,080
Every man sees her

413
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,800
No one falls for her

414
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,960
Madam Ya, don’t worry

415
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,200
I still know exactly what I want to do

416
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,040
I hope so

417
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,320
Shaolong, don’t live up to the princess’s expectations of you.

418
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,080
Lord Xinling has been summoned to the palace by King Wei

419
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,800
Discussing an early wedding

420
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,840
We can't delay the secret recording any longer.

421
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,840
I have established a good relationship with Long Yangjun

422
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,760
As soon as I get a chance, I will go to Shuixie to steal secret records

423
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,200
Without further ado

424
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,960
Girl, I asked you to pick fruits to quench my thirst

425
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,000
What are you doing standing over there?

426
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,600
Senior Lao

427
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,880
Brother Lian has been soaked in the cesspool for a day and a night

428
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,480
Not even a drop of water touches it, so it’s better to…

429
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,320
being tested

430
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,040
Still want someone to serve him and eat fruits?

431
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,440
Nonsense, I can't even stand a little hunger and thirst

432
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,040
There is no need to mention the matter of learning the left-handed sword

433
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,360
If you want to eat or drink, eat the feces in the pond and drink the urine in the pond.

434
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,120
Girl, go get some water to wash my hands.

435
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,280
My feet are also very dirty. Wash them for me.

436
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,680
Finished washing

437
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,320
Senior Lao, Brother Lian is really not touched at all

438
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,400
Let's give him a bowl of water

439
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,880
Just a bowl

440
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,280
It's so annoying, so verbose

441
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,040
Do you want to drink water? Drink my foot washing water

442
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,800
Brother Lian...it's almost noon

443
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,360
You must continue to support

444
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,200
You've endured it day and night

445
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,520
Now it's the last moment

446
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,440
You must never admit defeat

447
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,840
Brother Lian

448
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,480
At the last moment, you died of stinking in the cesspit

449
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,640
This will be a waste of effort, you must cheer up

450
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,640
Senior Lao, it’s already noon

451
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,600
The stinky boy is indeed a stinky boy

452
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,720
Brother Lian, congratulations, you have passed another level.

453
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,400
Brother Lian

454
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,880
There is only one more level left before you can officially become Lao Ai’s teacher.

455
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,080
Yes, there is still one step left before I officially become his teacher.

456
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,160
Please change into these two sets of clothes.

457
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,320
Senior, what is the third level like?

458
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,280
senior

459
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,440
Do you want to pass the third level?

460
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,280
Yes, senior

461
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,480
I'm afraid you can't do the third thing

462
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,760
I can even put aside my life and dignity

463
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,200
Nothing in the world can defeat me

464
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,960
not necessarily

465
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,240
At the first level, I want you to put aside life and death

466
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,120
The second level, I want you to put aside your dignity

467
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,760
The third level, I want you to put aside friendship

468
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,840
As long as you let me enjoy this girl next to you

469
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,360
I will teach you the peerless left-handed sword

470
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,520
It's just one night, everyone gets what they want

471
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,600
You don't have to be wishful thinking

472
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,920
Lian Jin

473
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,400
If life, dignity, and friendship can all be let go

474
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,480
Just invincible

475
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,680
you…

476
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,080
I would never do such a despicable thing

477
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,560
You can lose your reputation, but you don’t have to lose your dignity.

478
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,480
But I can never betray the woman I love

479
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,960
Why are you so entangled with each other?

480
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,320
Wouldn’t it be a pity to fall short of the goal?

481
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,440
Think it over again

482
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,920
No need to consider

483
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,600
Want to betray Fang'er

484
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,440
I would rather never hold a sword again in this life

485
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,880
let's go

486
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,480
let's get out of here

487
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,560
I will never learn any left-handed sword skills again.

488
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,600
I thought Lao Ai just had a weird personality

489
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,040
I didn't expect him to be so mean

490
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,600
Fang'er

491
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,000
He must have underestimated the friendship between us

492
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,360
You and I share life and death and adversity.

493
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,520
How could I betray my most beloved woman?

494
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,040
I don’t want to be a swordsman anymore

495
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
I would rather go back to the countryside and farm the fields

496
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,320
Be a peaceful farmer

497
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,840
As long as you are by my side it's enough

498
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,360
Brother Lian, maybe you misunderstood

499
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,360
I share life and death with you, and we go hand in hand with each other in adversity.

500
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,760
It's out of friendship, not love between a man and a woman

501
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,160
I really want to see you cheer up

502
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,840
I really hope you can return to your previous fighting spirit

503
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,880
I care about you, not because I like you

504
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,200
It's because I think you're so down and out

505
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,400
It's all because of me

506
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,440
If it doesn't make you re-energize your life

507
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,800
I will feel guilty for the rest of my life

508
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,160
So everything you did for me

509
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,360
To make amends, to pity me

510
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,320
Brother Lian…

511
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
Brother Lian

512
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,120
Wu Tingfang, why are you teasing me?

513
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,840
Since you have no love for me

514
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,480
Why did you suffer so much for me again?

515
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,000
Just like I am hungry and cold

516
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,560
You handed the buns into my hands with your own hands

517
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,160
But when I put this steamed bun in my mouth

518
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,080
You suddenly took it away again

519
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,400
Why are you doing this?

520
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,240
I didn't mean to make you misunderstand

521
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,120
If it weren't for you, I would never learn to sword again

522
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,800
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have suffered all the humiliation

523
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,880
Sorry, Brother Lian

524
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,640
I understand, you want Lao Ai to teach me the sword technique with my left hand

525
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,960
I just want to kick this annoying baggage away from me as soon as possible

526
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,800
So you don't have to feel so guilty

527
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,120
There is always a friendship between you and me

528
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,040
What did I do wrong?

529
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,040
I do everything for you

530
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,880
I'll never be able to impress you

531
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,280
Have you ever liked me?

532
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,680
Emotional matters cannot be forced

533
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,040
This is Xiang Shaolong, in your heart

534
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,760
There is always only one Xiang Shaolong

535
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,680
Emotional matters are often beyond your control

536
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,360
You and I have suffered this too

537
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,040
Brother Lian, you are good at everything

538
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,960
I believe you will find your true love one day

539
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,840
What if you find true love?

540
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,240
It's no longer something you need to care about

541
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,960
You still refuse to forgive me?

542
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,040
you're right

543
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,360
Emotional matters are often beyond your control

544
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,720
You and I have nothing to do with each other

545
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,920
How can I have the right to have inappropriate thoughts about you?

546
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,240
I promise you

547
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,040
I will take good care of myself in the future

548
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,800
I won't let myself get hurt again

549
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,720
You can go with peace of mind

550
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,200
Brother Lian, you finally figured it out

551
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,680
Can we have a meal before we leave?

552
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,040
Brother Lian, what are your plans for the future?

553
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,320
After this battle

554
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,040
I know that I should plan everything for myself

555
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,680
You don't have to worry about me

556
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,720
Maybe we will have a chance to meet again someday

557
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,320
You should take good care of yourself

558
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,760
I will

559
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,120
I know you don't know how to drink

560
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,800
I substituted tea for wine and drank this cup with you

561
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,600
you…

562
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,960
Children can be taught

563
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,320
Brother Lian

564
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,160
No...

565
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,320
No
