1
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,760
Since you two know my name,

2
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,840
I've seen you take action again

3
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,960
I can only be the dead soul under Lao Mou's sword.

4
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,400
We met by chance, and we also gave you steamed buns

5
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,240
You are the one who repays kindness with hatred

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,520
I hate it most when people show too much sympathy and concern for me.

7
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,760
But as a swordsman you

8
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,400
Kill a helpless woman

9
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,480
Don't you feel ashamed?

10
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,480
Anyone who has seen Laomou's right hand will inevitably die.

11
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,880
This is God's will

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,160
It's not God's will at all

13
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,240
It's just you cowardly shameless person

14
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,720
Excuses used to justify murder

15
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,200
You and I have no grudges

16
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,200
But he must kill us before he will give up.

17
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,920
It's because we've seen your broken hand

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,200
I've seen your mutilated hands, what's the crime?

19
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,720
Are you afraid of being laughed at and despised by others?

20
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,080
Stinky girl

21
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,400
If everyone you kill deserves to die

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,160
Then the person who deserves the most damn should be you

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,200
Because even if you kill everyone

24
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,240
seal all their mouths

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,000
But you can't contain your inner demons either

26
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,160
The person in the world who cares most about your broken hand is you yourself

27
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,280
The person who looks down on you the most is yourself

28
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,880
You are simply a poor person with low self-esteem.

29
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,400
You should end it yourself

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,400
Smelly girl, do you really not want to live?

31
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,320
No, everyone dies eventually

32
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,400
But if I die by your sword, I won’t accept it.

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,520
No one in the world has ever dared to be so presumptuous towards Lao

34
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,680
I will make an exception today and not kill you.

35
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,280
let's go

36
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,160
But you...have to leave a head

37
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,760
Fang'er, you go first, don't worry about me

38
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,000
No, we have to go together

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,360
I told you to go

40
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,600
Want to be a pair of mandarin ducks with the same destiny?

41
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,200
Brother Lian was originally very skilled in swordsmanship

42
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,120
Just because there is something wrong with sword competition with others

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,600
As a result, the tendon of the right hand was severed

44
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,720
Now he is a man with a missing right hand just like you.

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,280
Fang'er

46
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,640
His skills were not as good as others, so much so that his tendons were severed by others

47
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,400
How else can you live an ignoble existence?

48
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,400
I am not a person who is afraid of death

49
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,600
If my right tendon is not broken, I can give you a fair fight

50
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,240
If my swordsmanship is not as good as yours, I have nothing to say

51
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,920
You are now bullying the weak, but you cannot win with force.

52
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,240
I'm not willing to give in

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,520
Okay, I will give you a chance

54
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,880
Let you die willingly and die with peace of mind

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,440
You and I both have missing right hands

56
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,400
Let's have a fair competition with our right hands

57
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,800
If you win, I will let you live.

58
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,600
If you lose, there is only one way to die.

59
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,040
Okay, how to compete?

60
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,920
Which of us can grab this sword with your right hand first?

61
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,960
Just kill the opponent

62
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,160
Girl, you give the orders

63
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,000
start

64
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,800
No

65
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,840
Girl, do you have something else to say?

66
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,200
Don't kill him

67
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,640
Lao has already achieved his wish

68
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,520
Give him a chance to save his life

69
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,400
However, he is too helpless and indifferent to others

70
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,280
If you want to kill, kill me first

71
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,680
But you promised not to kill me

72
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,640
If you kill me, you will break your promise

73
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,080
Lao has something to say first

74
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,160
Girl, you want to force me to break my promise and get fat

75
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,080
You're such a cunning girl.

76
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,560
I'm willing to admit defeat. Just kill me.

77
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,120
No, if you want to kill him, kill me first

78
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,040
What a good husband and concubine

79
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,520
You don't even care about your own life to protect your husband

80
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,880
Brother Lian is not my husband

81
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,760
But his tendon was broken because of me

82
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,360
So, you have made up your mind

83
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,320
Lao is not a person who breaks his word

84
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,640
As a swordsman, I can’t even hold the sword steady.

85
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,320
What else is there to enjoy?

86
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,160
As a man, I can’t even protect myself.

87
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,920
It takes a woman to open her mouth and beg for mercy on his behalf

88
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,840
How can you be so shameless?

89
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,200
Living an ignoble life is more painful than death

90
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,880
Brother Lian

91
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,280
You don't need to pay attention to me, I should die

92
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,960
What's so hard about asking for death?

93
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,000
Survival is the most difficult thing

94
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,520
Brother Lian

95
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,840
Why should you be depressed for someone who has nothing to do with you?

96
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,720
Brother Lian was originally very skilled in swordsmanship

97
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,480
Just because there is something wrong with sword competition with others

98
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,000
As a result, the tendon of the right hand was severed

99
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,120
Now he is a man with a missing right hand just like you.

100
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,600
His skills are not as good as others, so his tendons are broken by others

101
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,640
How else can I live an ignoble existence?

102
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,400
As a man, I can’t even protect myself.

103
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,280
It takes a woman to open her mouth and beg for mercy on his behalf

104
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,320
How can you be so shameless?

105
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,280
Brother Lian

106
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,240
Fang'er

107
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,280
Are you going to hit the road?

108
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,600
yes

109
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,160
If you are rushing to join your uncle

110
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,400
I'll give you a ride

111
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,240
No need

112
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,680
Lao Ai is right, living an ignoble life is more painful than death.

113
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,040
What this weirdo said makes no sense.

114
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,600
Why bother taking crazy words to heart?

115
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,960
Crazy words also have their reasons

116
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,960
Lao Ai is right, as a swordsman

117
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,800
I can't even hold my own sword firmly.

118
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,640
It is indeed lifeless

119
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,520
as a man

120
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,880
I can't even save my own life

121
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,920
What's the use of living an ignoble life?

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,040
Brother Lian

123
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,080
Don't worry, I'm not asking for suicide

124
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,080
I want to worship Lao Ai as my teacher

125
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,240
Learn his left-handed sword technique

126
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,440
Worship Lao Ai as your teacher?

127
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,640
Yes, since God wants me to meet him

128
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,280
He just wants me to learn his left-handed sword technique

129
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
To become a disciple of someone who wants to kill you?

130
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,760
Are you crazy? Before becoming a master, you were already dead by his sword.

131
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,680
What's the use of leaving this remaining life behind?

132
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,920
my right hand

133
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,160
It makes me unable to do it even if I want to be an ordinary farmer

134
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,800
If I could take Lao Ai as my teacher

135
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,480
Learned his left-handed sword technique

136
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,960
I can be a swordsman again

137
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,160
If you die by his sword, it will be an end.

138
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,560
This time we say goodbye, I wonder if there will be another chance to see you again

139
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,920
Take care of yourself

140
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,120
After days of long journey

141
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,080
We finally arrived outside Daliang City

142
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,320
I wonder if Daliang City is very backward?

143
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,560
Why not just send the princess into the city?

144
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
Do you want to wait here for someone to pick you up?

145
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,480
This is how it should be etiquette

146
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,920
I have ordered people to come to the city to report

147
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,400
we are stationed here

148
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,920
I believe Lord Xinling will come to greet the princess soon.

149
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,240
Where is the princess?

150
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,880
Brother Xiang

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
Why come out alone?

152
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,320
Ahead is Daliang City. It's easy to get into the city but difficult to get out.

153
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,600
Don't worry, I promise you

154
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,800
I will definitely take you away safely

155
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,240
Brother Xiang

156
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,440
Why not leave before we enter the city?

157
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,360
Because I must steal Lu Gong’s secret records

158
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,200
Is Lu Gong’s Secret Records really so important?

159
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,320
Originally before coming to Daliang

160
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,200
Qian'er can still comfort herself, the tiger's mouth is still far away

161
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,320
But now Daliang City is already in front of us

162
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,800
I'm really afraid when I go in

163
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,720
Qian'er's fate is unlucky

164
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,520
Even if it's a tiger

165
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,320
I won’t let a tiger carry you away either

166
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,520
As soon as we get Lu Gong's Secret Records, we will leave immediately

167
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,720
But what if…

168
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,680
No buts, no ifs, no what-ifs

169
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,600
You believe me, I promise you something

170
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,280
I will definitely do it

171
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,960
Brother Xiang

172
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,800
Is he Lord Xinling?

173
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,920
He is not Lord Xinling

174
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,920
He is Wei Mou, a subordinate of Lord Xinling.

175
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,760
Mrs. Ya, General Xiang

176
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,800
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

177
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,120
This young man with extraordinary appearance

178
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,680
It must be among the rumors

179
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
General Xiang Shaolong with superb martial arts skills

180
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,080
Don't say that

181
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,840
I have heard a lot about General Xiang

182
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,400
About your majestic history, Mr. Xinling

183
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,760
I'm so happy to see you today

184
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,560
Madam Ya, are you okay?

185
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,480
I trust you, Lingjun Hongfu, everything is well.

186
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,960
The last time we said goodbye, half a year has passed in the blink of an eye.

187
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,560
This time I see my wife again, it seems that the money has been reduced

188
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,320
Yeah?

189
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,400
Madam came to Daliang this time

190
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,680
I must invite my wife to my house.

191
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,200
Have a good time reminiscing

192
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,080
Mr. Xinling always treats guests as if they are at home.

193
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,640
This princess wedding

194
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,560
I want to disturb the peace of Xinfu again

195
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,000
By order of the king

196
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,600
We have already prepared the bed room at Fuzhong Villa

197
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,000
Before the princess' wedding

198
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,520
Greeting all distinguished guests and my sister-in-law, Mrs. Pingyuan, mother and son

199
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,280
Why don't you see Mrs. Pingyuan?

200
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,040
She's a little uncomfortable

201
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,160
Her son is with her and will be here soon

202
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,520
This letter was written by her to you.

203
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,320
It's clearly written in it

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,920
After a long journey, I am naturally exhausted.

205
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,800
Please help me to take care of my roommate, mother and son along the way.

206
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,240
Don't say that...

207
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,600
General Xiang, because the place where he lives is shallow and narrow,

208
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,320
General Xiang could only bring a few followers into the city

209
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Others will just have to camp here.

210
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,560
please forgive me

211
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
Don't say that...

212
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,120
I also regret not bringing too many people into the city to disturb you.

213
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,720
General Xiang is truly outstanding

214
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,600
It's getting late. Princess, please get up.

215
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,560
OK, I'll inform the princess

216
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,120
It's been two hours

217
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,000
Yes, if you don’t let him go again

218
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,800
My wife is about to lose her support.

219
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,520
I haven't let him go after waiting for so long.

220
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,400
Yes, it's so hot today

221
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,160
What happened?

222
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,560
Get out of the way, I'm leaving the city

223
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,320
Please forgive me. I was just following orders.

224
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,640
Whose order is it?

225
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,800
Lord Xinling is destined, Princess Zhao is about to enter the city

226
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,000
The city will be closed for two hours for the solemn event.

227
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,120
Just goddamn

228
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,440
Not even a shadow of Zhao Guo’s wedding party was seen.

229
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,760
It requires many people to be exposed to the scorching sun

230
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,200
It's a shame you can think of such a plan to disturb the people.

231
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,720
Unlock and release immediately

232
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,680
Lord Xinling has your destiny, and the villain dare not disobey it.

233
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,440
I don’t dare to disobey Lord Xinling’s orders.

234
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,560
Can I, Lord Longyang, disobey my order?

235
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,200
Now I am leaving the city

236
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Welcome my mentor Zou Yan into the city, get out of the way

237
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,800
Teacher, please forgive me for keeping my teacher and Qingmei waiting for a long time.

238
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,360
What's the crime?

239
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,480
Thanks to Mr. Long Yang for coming to greet me

240
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,320
This is really a huge favor for me, Zou Yan

241
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,160
Hearing my mentor’s loud laughter

242
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,520
Just know that my mentor is here and safe

243
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,560
Kiyoshi sister

244
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,440
Senior brother

245
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,680
Please forgive me for not being able to salute my senior brother in the car.

246
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,120
Why bother with formalities?

247
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,640
How long do we have to wait before we can enter the city?

248
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,440
There are students here and we can enter the city immediately

249
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,280
The people arrived earlier than me, and they were tortured by the scorching sun.

250
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,160
People should be allowed to enter the city first

251
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,480
What the teacher said makes sense

252
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,160
Now that the lockdown has been lifted, everyone can enter the city freely

253
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,320
careful

254
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,440
Report to your Majesty

255
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,640
The subordinates had already obeyed the orders of the king

256
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,280
Road closures inside and outside the city gate

257
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,600
But Long Yangjun intervened

258
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,960
How unreasonable to interfere with my order?

259
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Does Mr. Long Yang still take me seriously?

260
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,600
Isn’t Long Yangjun the one recorded in Chinese history?

261
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,520
A man who likes men, let me see

262
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,760
There was chaos inside and outside the city

263
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,640
It turned out to be a good deed done by Long Yangjun

264
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,440
Of course what Long Yangjun did was a good thing

265
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,520
The city is being closed under the scorching sun

266
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,320
Exposing many people to the sun and waiting

267
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,640
Such disturbing and abusing the people

268
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,240
What is the crime for causing chaos and trouble?

269
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,720
Nonsense, I am following the king's orders

270
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,480
Welcome Princess Zhao into the city

271
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,280
Now the princess's trip has been delayed, which is unseemly

272
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,840
What is your crime?

273
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,640
The princess is naturally aloof

274
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,080
But the life and death of the common people cannot be ignored.

275
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,160
As a princess, you should also be sensible and love your people as yourself.

276
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,600
No complaints

277
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,040
Your Excellency closed the city early

278
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,200
Cause crowds to gather outside the city gate, causing nuisance

279
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,920
Mr. Xinling, you made improper arrangements.

280
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,640
Really the culprit

281
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
you…

282
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,720
In fact, what you two said is very reasonable.

283
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,920
One is for the good of the princess

284
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,120
One is for the good of the people

285
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,160
But no matter how reasonable you say it, it’s useless

286
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,480
The crowd has been evacuated now

287
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,720
We'd better go into town for tea and snacks

288
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,320
Then talk slowly, okay?

289
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,760
In fact, the princess is also very easy-going

290
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,040
We came all the way here

291
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,120
I believe the princess will not wait an extra hour or two

292
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,440
And many complaints

293
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,120
Mr. Xinlingjun, don’t worry

294
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,480
I think you must be the general who is marrying Zhao Guo.

295
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,840
General Xiang Shaolong

296
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,680
Yes

297
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,760
Your Majesty, may I enter the city?

298
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,040
Yes, mentor

299
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,080
The princess carriage should go first

300
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,400
No need to argue. Do you have any friends coming?

301
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,280
I'm a guest too, why not let him go first?

302
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,240
I am not an immeasurable person, go

303
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,800
General Xiang, see you when you have the chance

304
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,400
Each other, goodbye...

305
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,320
Three people, please

306
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,480
Very big

307
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,440
You guys stand down?

308
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,320
Take us to live in his villa

309
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,240
It’s also for the convenience of monitoring us.

310
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
We have now arrived at Daliang

311
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,520
We should plan what to do next.

312
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,200
You said you had been here before

313
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,800
Where do you think they will hide the Secret Records of Lu Gong?

314
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,400
Lord Xinling is an unfathomable person

315
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,600
And his mansion is so big

316
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Lu Gong’s secret records are so important

317
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,200
I'm afraid we need to spend some time and effort

318
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,800
Only then can we find out

319
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,800
Then hurry up

320
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,040
Otherwise Mrs. Pingyuan's letter won't last long.

321
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,960
If they get suspicious, that's it.

322
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,600
But the princess’ wedding is not far away either

323
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,520
So we should gain Lord Xinling’s trust as soon as possible

324
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,400
This will at least make things easier

325
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,800
After all, I also had a relationship with Mr. Xinling

326
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,600
It is easier for a woman to test a man

327
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,120
I believe he will send someone to pick me up soon.

328
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,720
Auntie, maybe we can find another way

329
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,040
Who?

330
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
Forgive Wei Mou for being rude

331
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,520
General Xiang, Mr. Xinling invites you

332
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,280
I'm sorry for disturbing General Xiang's rest.

333
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,360
Don't say that

334
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,960
I wonder what Mr. Xinling wants to see me for?

335
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,080
nothing

336
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,720
I just want to treat General Xiang to a drink.

337
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,600
drink wine?

338
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,960
Is General Xiang interested in Wei's fine wine?

339
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,560
OK

340
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,120
Thanks

341
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,200
Really good wine

342
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,440
Does General Xiang find it strange?

343
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,200
Why would I suddenly invite you to drink?

344
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,480
I feel a little strange

345
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,520
But with my limited wisdom

346
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,280
It's a bit difficult to guess your intentions

347
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,280
I wonder, Mr. Xinling, if you would mind telling me?

348
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,160
OK, I'll tell you

349
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,640
The wine you just drank was highly poisonous

350
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,000
I never thought that Mr. Xinling, you are quite good at joking.

351
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,000
General Xiang, you show no fear

352
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,680
Do you think that I am telling lies?

353
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,240
I don’t know if it’s nonsense or not.

354
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,400
But I really didn't expect it

355
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,760
Lord Xinling, you are so virtuous and respectable

356
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,240
He would actually use such despicable means

357
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,160
Such a fragrant wine, don’t waste it even if it’s poisoned

358
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,960
Do you mind if I have another drink?

359
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,800
I really want to know

360
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,960
Are you arrogant or courageous?

361
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,640
It doesn't matter, I just know

362
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,920
If you kill me you will regret it very much

363
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,720
Bold Xiang Shaolong

364
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,000
What happened to my sister-in-law, Mrs. Pingyuan, mother and son?

365
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,520
Where are you now?

366
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,280
The letter you wrote to me is completely false.

367
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,680
Why do you think it's fake?

368
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,800
Even if my roommate is really sick

369
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,160
She won't fail to send a confidant here.

370
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,880
There must be some fraud

371
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,720
Yes, that letter is indeed fake

372
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,880
I forced Mrs. Pingyuan to write it.

373
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,920
Xiang Shaolong, you are so bold

374
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
The bold one is not me, but Mr. Shao Yuan

375
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,760
He was on my way to get married

376
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,520
He actually captured the princess and wanted to rape her

377
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,760
Fortunately, I caught him on the spot

378
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,400
Mrs. Pingyuan also told me all your tricks.

379
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,480
Ridiculous, I am aboveboard, where is the conspiracy?

380
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,480
I don't know if it's aboveboard or not.

381
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,440
All I know is that you want me to fail in my duty

382
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,400
You want me to surrender to you

383
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,280
Then he helped you kill King Wei, right?

384
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,800
The two of them did such a heinous thing

385
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,160
If I don't put them under house arrest

386
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,440
It wouldn’t be good if you still carry it with you and spread it around.

387
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,040
Xiang Shaolong, what do you want?

388
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,160
It's simple, I just want to take refuge in you

389
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,400
You also know that after I defeated Lian Jin

390
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,600
I have offended Julu Hou Zhao Mu

391
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,600
In Zhao State, I have no place at all

392
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,560
Are you willing to assassinate the King of Wei on my wedding day?

393
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,200
Yes, but after it's done

394
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,920
I want to get what I want

395
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,400
I'm afraid General Xiang wants to get

396
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,160
Isn't it as simple as fame and fortune?

397
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,440
Why should you care what I want?

398
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,200
Anyway, as long as I'm willing to cooperate with you, that's fine

399
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,200
If you want to cooperate with me, let your roommate go first

400
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,840
Do you think I'm a fool?

401
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,680
What if I finish helping you and you want to kill someone?

402
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,200
If I let them go, wouldn't I have no protection?

403
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,920
Xiang Shaolong, you are indeed no ordinary person

404
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,720
If I were an idle person

405
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,400
You won't choose me to cooperate with you

406
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,640
Okay, it’s rare for General Xiang to be so candid.

407
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,400
Then I wish our cooperation success

408
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
please

409
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,840
So beautiful, come and see, so beautiful

410
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,120
Sir, come and take a look

411
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,400
Brother, have you ever seen a person with a disabled right hand?

412
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,600
A man holding a sword in his left hand?

413
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,840
No, didn't notice

414
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,720
Come and take a look…

415
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,640
Brother, have you ever seen a person with a disabled right hand?

416
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,040
A man holding a sword in his left hand?

417
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,840
Want to find a swordsman? You should go to the Samurai Hall

418
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,640
It's too much

419
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,360
Just glanced at his right hand

420
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,840
Not only did they kill him, but they also dug out his eyes.

421
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,000
Lao Ai is so arrogant

422
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,800
After killing someone, he threatened

423
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,920
Give the deceased's relatives and friends three days to seek revenge against him.

424
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Now I am still at the lake at the foot of the mountain.

425
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,960
Brother Zhang died so tragically

426
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,760
I'm going to seek justice for him

427
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,560
Brother Li, you still have a wife and children at home

428
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,200
Why risk your life to die in vain?

429
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,760
Don't be impulsive. You can't afford to offend this person.

430
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,800
Then let's collect Brother Zhang's body quickly.

431
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,840
ok come

432
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,120
Only one person can avenge Zhang San?

433
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,120
It turns out that he, like Lao, doesn’t have many friends.

434
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,520
Is it you?

435
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,920
I'm not here to avenge anyone

436
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,680
I'm here to ask Mr. Lao Ai to teach me the sword technique with my left hand.

437
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,640
Do you want Laomou to accept you as his disciple?

438
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,280
Yes, I want to be a swordsman again

439
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,880
Why does Lao want to accept you as his disciple?

440
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,360
Because like my predecessors, my right hand is disabled

441
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,160
Only those with disabled right hands

442
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,720
Only then can you appreciate the essence of left-handed swordsmanship

443
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,520
If senior is willing to accept me as his disciple

444
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,000
I will definitely carry forward the sword skills of my left hand

445
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,640
I will never forget the kindness my seniors showed me in rebirth

446
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,320
Such bullshit, you can't even say it out loud

447
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,960
Do you think you could say a few compliments?

448
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,080
You can coax Lao to teach you the left-handed sword

449
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,400
Not so cheap

450
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,640
Senior, I am indeed determined to learn art.

451
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,000
If senior is willing to accept me as his disciple

452
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,680
I am willing to be a cow or a horse

453
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,920
Senior, please accept me as your disciple

454
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,280
Be a cow or a horse? Willingly?

455
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,680
Okay, let me see how sincere you are

456
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,240
First kowtow to me a hundred times

457
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,800
interesting…

458
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,240
so interesting

459
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,680
Brother Lian, don't be fooled by this bastard again.

460
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,440
He has no intention of accepting you as his disciple

461
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,160
It's just a hundred ringing noises, but I can still endure it

462
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,960
One hundred rings, I have finished kowtowing

463
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Now I can call my senior...Master

464
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,880
Did I say I would be your master?

465
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,880
I just want to see someone

466
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,120
How much ability do you still have when you are in a desperate situation?

467
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,680
now i see

468
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,120
Despicable and dishonest

469
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,600
Breaking your promise?

470
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,520
Lao just asked him to kowtow a hundred times first

471
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
to show sincerity

472
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,160
I didn't say that I would definitely accept him as my disciple.

473
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,040
you're right

474
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,400
I just want to fool this fool

475
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,640
If senior is unwilling to accept me as his disciple

476
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,400
In other words, I can’t be a swordsman again.

477
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,480
Please ask senior to help me put an end to it.

478
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,360
kill me

479
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,440
Brother Lian

480
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,440
It's really ridiculous, even death must be done by someone else's hands

481
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,560
What qualifications do you have to be a swordsman?

482
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,120
If you want to die, just kill yourself.

483
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,520
Brother Lian, stop being so stupid

484
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,760
I can't learn left-handed swordsmanship

485
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,600
There's no point in leaving your life behind

486
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
No

487
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,440
Taeya...

488
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,600
Taeya...

489
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,680
Lao Ai didn't kill me twice

490
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,320
Maybe it’s just because you are in the same boat as me

491
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,760
If I beg him once and it doesn't work, I can beg him a second time.

492
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,320
If you don't succeed if you beg him a second time, you can beg him a third time.

493
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,160
One day he will take me as his disciple

494
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,960
I have surveyed the entire Xinling Lord's Mansion

495
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,520
This is the map there

496
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,880
There are three entrances and exits in the entire Xinlingjun Mansion.

497
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,560
But every entrance and exit is heavily guarded.

498
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
Except for the pool in the backyard

499
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,200
This pool should have a water channel

500
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,520
Right here?

501
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,280
good

502
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,640
We use this waterway to steal Lu Gong's Secret Records

503
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,960
should be the safest

504
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,720
Because the guards there are the weakest

505
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,760
Do you already know the location of the Secret Records?

506
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,120
not yet

507
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,160
The most important thing to know is where the secret record is

508
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,720
The hardest thing to know for sure is also where the secret record is.

509
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,440
I know, but Lu Gong’s secret records are so small

510
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,080
It's not easy for me to find out where it is hidden.

511
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,840
But unless Lord Xinling tells me personally,

512
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,440
How could Mr. Xinling tell us personally?

513
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,880
So we have to come up with a trick to scare the snake away.

514
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,440
Alarm Lord Xinling first?

515
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,080
In this way, we take greater risks

516
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,960
I know, but this method is the best

517
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,680
Come in

518
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
General Xiang, Mrs. Ya

519
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,920
The prince of Wei forced his way into the princess's bedroom

520
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,000
What?

521
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,760
get out of the way

522
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,400
Princess is polite

523
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,280
The prince broke in without permission and was inconsistent with etiquette.

524
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,320
The beauty of the princess is indeed better than that of a fairy

525
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,040
Come, let me kiss you first

526
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,760
The prince must not be rude

527
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,480
Princess, why do you need to be ashamed?

528
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,760
Sooner or later you will also be the wife of this prince.

529
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,800
Now let's have a meeting and greeting first

530
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,480
Everyone is close

531
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,280
Princess, don't be shy, come

532
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,360
Get out of the way, what's going on?

533
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,960
Who are you?

534
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,640
Who are you?

535
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,520
Of course I am the Crown Prince of Wei

536
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,240
I am Xiang Shaolong, the general of Zhao State’s wedding ceremony.

537
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,920
Turns out he was just a soldier guarding a general in name only.

538
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,680
I thought it was something so great

539
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,520
This prince came to see his unmarried wife

540
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,480
Why not?

541
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,480
You can say it yourself

542
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,360
If you haven't walked in yet, it means she's not your wife yet.

543
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,400
You come here so late to do anything

544
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,480
Do you know that it is inconsistent with etiquette?

545
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,640
If you don't leave

546
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,000
Don't blame me for being rude.

547
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,320
Do you dare to do the following?

548
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,560
My duty is to protect the princess

549
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,160
If someone is rude to her

550
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,120
I will be even more rude to him

551
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,520
Madam Ben also wants to know

552
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,800
In the end, it was Prince Wei who ignored etiquette.

553
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,320
Or does the King of Wei not take our Zhao country seriously?

554
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,760
This is the place of Wei State

555
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,760
It should be up to us, Wei State, to decide

556
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
If this is the case

557
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,520
Then we will take the princess back to Zhao Kingdom

558
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,920
Okay, I will definitely remember this.

559
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,520
The State of Zhao had such an outstanding general Xiang Shaolong

560
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,840
Walk

561
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,960
Princess, are you scared?

562
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,520
Brother Xiang

563
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,160
Don't worry, I will send more people to protect you day and night

564
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,600
you'll be fine

565
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,040
As long as she does not leave Wei territory, the princess will be in danger

566
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,840
The matter of secret recording cannot be postponed any longer.

567
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,600
I know

568
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,440
What's the point of being so heavily guarded?

569
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,280
If you know how to dive, you can come and go freely

570
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,240
Ah Qing?

571
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,400
Ah Qing

572
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,280
General Xiang

573
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,320
I saw it on a hot day

574
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,440
So I came here specifically to take off my clothes and cool down.

575
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,720
Come here for a swim

576
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,920
Sorry

577
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,320
sorry…

578
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,520
Swimming in blue waves is indeed a beautiful thing

579
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,960
The lake where I live

580
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Clearer than the river here

581
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,000
Yeah?

582
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,480
yes

583
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,400
I really want to visit it if I have a chance.

584
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,800
I am free now

585
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,920
Are you free? But I'm not available right now

586
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,560
It’s better next time. I’ll ask you out next time

587
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,920
I'm leaving first

588
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,680
next time?

589
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,640
Senior brother knows that his godfather is not used to living in Fanhuo Mansion.

590
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,120
specially prepared for us

591
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,760
Living in such a quiet waterside pavilion

592
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,160
I can't thank you enough

593
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,680
Qingmei is so polite

594
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,960
Teacher, if you and Qingmei like this waterside pavilion,

595
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,600
Just live here for now

596
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,680
You can even live here forever

597
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,720
This place is quiet and elegant, I like it very much

598
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,480
It's a pity that I'm used to having no fixed place

599
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,240
There’s no need to live here forever.

600
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,560
But one day, when I am laid to rest,

601
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,440
Then you can choose a place to live permanently.

602
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,400
The mentor joked again

603
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,240
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

604
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,080
Teacher can watch the stars here at night

605
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,440
My teacher recently watched the stars at night

606
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,680
Discover a bright new star

607
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,720
This is why when gentlemen change, there must be visions in the sky

608
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,520
The emergence of a bright new star

609
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,720
It represents the birth of a new saint

610
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,680
A man who saves the common people

611
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,560
The new Mingjun who quelled the wars in the seven kingdoms

612
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,840
And this new star represents the new saint

613
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,920
Now appearing in the sky over Wei State

614
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,960
I have been paying attention to the movements of this star

615
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,600
So this time I pursued this with Qing'er.

616
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,560
Students also hope to catch a glimpse of the new saint

617
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,880
The new situation brought about by the seven countries

618
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,120
In two days, the students will be called their mentors

619
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,840
Scholars held discussions on politics here at Shuixie

620
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,520
Send out invitations widely and invite talented people from all over the world.

621
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,320
Come and discuss political affairs

622
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,440
Then there may be a chance to discover a new saint

623
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,160
I hope so

624
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,880
There must be a lively scene then

625
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,160
Qingmei, I don’t know if I will be able to fight with the heroes again.

626
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,880
Make all the heroes bow to your Qiluo skirt?

627
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,640
Thanks for being an important minister of a country

628
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,600
He actually made fun of a woman

629
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,040
I'm most afraid that Qingmei will be unhappy

630
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,240
Offending Qingmei is a heinous crime

631
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,960
At that time, a large group of subordinates will come to punish me.

632
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,880
There is really no peace

633
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,360
Brother, feel free to make fun of me

634
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,720
If you are trapped by love again

635
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,880
Never ask Qingmei for advice

636
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,120
Teacher, please comment

637
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,680
The argument between your senior brothers and sisters is really unreasonable.

638
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,680
Sorry, I'm sorry...

639
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,200
Sir, please forgive me.

640
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,840
Full of colors...a good sign...

641
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,800
Could it be that you just dived for too long?

642
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,920
Are you seeing the wrong thing due to hypoxia and dazzling eyes?

643
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,480
Will this also cause dizziness due to lack of oxygen?

644
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,920
The one just now was obviously a person

645
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Is it possible to see ghosts in broad daylight?

646
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,720
Could it be because Dr. Wu was bored when he saw you alone?

647
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,480
I can't send you back

648
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,960
So why did you send Ah Qing to accompany you?

649
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,200
Thank you for wanting to do this

650
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,280
You can really say that you are crazy

651
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,760
Ah Qing is already married, how can he have time to accompany you?

652
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,440
So who is that person? Shaolong

653
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,080
How do I know?

654
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,800
Shaolong

655
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,480
You are so...

656
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,480
You said you were going to inspect Lord Xinling's mansion today

657
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,320
Is it possible to escape from the waterway exit?

658
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,280
I've investigated and it's really possible to escape

659
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,120
Is there any plan to alert the snake?

660
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,720
Found the location of the secret record?

661
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,240
No

662
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,560
Are you still so calm until now?

663
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,840
Do you know Prince Wei

664
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,240
I have a grudge because my last night break-in failed.

665
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,880
Proposed to the King of Wei to change the date of the wedding

666
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,760
Marry the princess early

667
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,960
No? When?

668
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,560
The eighth day of the lunar month is the wedding day

669
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,000
So fast?

670
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,760
The princess trusts you completely

671
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,680
Do you still have time to stay in your house and daze?

672
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,040
You don't pay any attention to the princess's life or death.

673
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,720
It's not that I don't pay attention to it

674
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,320
But we have to find opportunities

675
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,040
Mr. Xinling has always been thinking about me.

676
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,840
It's better for me to attack him

677
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,240
I'm going to visit Fuzhong tonight for an excuse.

678
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,160
no

679
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,360
Last time I saw him looking at you intently

680
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,400
If you meet him... No, it's better not to do it

681
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,240
The most important thing now is to steal the secret record

682
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,040
A little sacrifice, no matter what

683
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,360
Is this also called Shao Shao?

684
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,960
Well, let me wait until I find a chance to sneak in.

685
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,280
Let's use that trick again to frighten the snake.

686
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,920
Even if you alert someone, there still needs to be one more person to take care of it.

687
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,040
That's true

688
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,280
But it would be bad if you really go to him.

689
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,440
What if he is really perverted?

690
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,200
Aren't you in danger? It's better not to give up

691
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,280
Come in

692
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,200
Madam Ya, Lord Xinling ordered this to be delivered to you.

693
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,280
What to write about?

694
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,680
He invited me to meet him at his house

695
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,520
drink

696
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,640
Such a good wine, such a good time

697
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,040
There is such a beautiful woman accompanying me to drink and talk heart-to-heart

698
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,880
What a joy in life

699
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,800
The sanctimonious Lord Xinling in front of others

700
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,520
After having two drinks, I started to behave erratically.

701
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,360
Such a beauty

702
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,960
I wonder who among the men in the world is not tempted?

703
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,680
Since the last farewell to Handan

704
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,160
I've been thinking about you, Mrs. Ya.

705
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,280
When a man wants a woman

706
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
He will definitely be able to talk nicely.

707
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,560
The most beautiful words have been heard a lot by the slave family.

708
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,960
I'm sincere to you

709
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,360
No rhetoric at all

710
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,720
Why are you so impatient?

711
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,840
When the princess gets married, you will return to Zhao with the team

712
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,240
Then it will be another man who holds you in his arms.

713
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,320
How can I hold back now?

714
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,440
Beauty, beauty

715
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,440
You must take care of my lovesickness tonight

716
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,480
Come in

717
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,000
Put out the fire...

718
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,800
Your Majesty, there was a sudden fire in the study in the east wing for no apparent reason.

719
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,120
Manager Xiao said that an outsider had sneaked into the house.

720
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Why is it broad daylight?

721
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,000
Will an assassin sneak into Jun Shang's mansion?

722
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,200
Aren't the guards in the mansion extremely tight?

723
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,640
Madam, there is no need to panic. Manager Xiao is a shrewd man.

724
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,960
We can definitely catch the assassin. I'll go out for a while.

725
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,200
Your Majesty

726
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,920
You'd better take me to a safe place to hide.

727
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,400
This is the safest place

728
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,440
Protect Mrs. Ya well yes

729
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,720
Someone...catch the thief

730
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,280
He still wants to leave, catch him...
