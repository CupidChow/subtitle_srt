1
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,680
Your Majesty, the map of the Seven Kingdoms has been drawn.

2
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,960
Our territory, Great Qin, is far less rich and fertile than the six kingdoms.

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,040
Sooner or later, the territories of the Six Kingdoms will become the king's treasure.

4
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,240
Li Si, how much longer do you think it will take for the widow to

5
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,720
Can we achieve unification and hegemony?

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,880
Less than fifteen years

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,920
Fifteen years? Too long

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,600
Within ten years, we will have the territory in front of us

9
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,160
All the soles of your feet

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,720
To be a truly united people

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,000
The unprecedented emperor

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,200
The king will definitely rule the world

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,200
To rule the world…

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,120
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, Your Majesty...

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,200
Lord Marquis...it seems that the Queen Mother is going to give birth prematurely.

16
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,200
Is it ready for production?

17
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,640
It's not time yet

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,360
I want her to give birth before the time comes.

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,720
King

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,360
What a fun and cute baby

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,640
But it's a pity your noisy voice

22
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,280
It's too noisy

23
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,720
Zhao Gao, has everything been done?

24
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,880
Everything is done, Niujia Village has been reduced to scorched earth

25
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,920
I want to see the king

26
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,360
I want to see the king, the king...

27
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,360
Queen Mother, please wait a moment

28
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,720
Your Majesty, please give me the child back

29
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,680
I beg you, Your Majesty

30
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,360
It has nothing to do with you here. All of you, please leave.

31
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,120
Yes, Your Majesty…

32
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,600
stand up

33
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,800
Your Majesty, you promised us

34
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,040
Give our family of three a way out

35
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,480
I beg you to return the child to me

36
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,680
The king has made a promise worth a thousand pieces of gold, how can he go back on his word?

37
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,920
I have no choice but to

38
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,960
Leaving this evil behind will only make the scandal public.

39
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,560
The baby in your arms is finally your brother

40
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,840
Give him a way out

41
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,880
I beg you, my king

42
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,080
Your Majesty, have you forgotten what Lao Ai said?

43
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,880
Of course I remember it very clearly

44
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:18,440
Thanks to Marquis Changxin for reminding me to eradicate the weeds

45
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,080
baby…

46
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,760
You could feed this dead baby to dogs and cats.

47
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,600
In short, don’t stay in the palace and be embarrassed

48
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,440
Killing your brother and killing your mother is a treasonous act.

49
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,440
If the king hadn’t made this move,

50
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,840
I won't be forced to do this either.

51
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,040
What do you want?

52
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,880
I just want the king to personally escort your mother back to Dazheng Palace

53
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,200
The king doesn’t think about his mother

54
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
You should also think about it for yourself

55
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,040
Lord Marquis, please let your servant accompany the king to escort the queen mother.

56
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Otherwise, it will arouse the suspicion of the palace guards.

57
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
May the king be blessed

58
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,960
The Queen Mother is ill, the widow and Marquis Changxin

59
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,960
Now send the Queen Mother back to Dazheng Palace to have a good rest.

60
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,640
Do you want to humble yourself and prepare a carriage?

61
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,080
No need, leave

62
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,200
yes

63
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,880
Your Majesty, please

64
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,320
Lao Ai, what exactly do you want?

65
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,120
Your Majesty thinks that I am treating a man who killed his own son

66
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,160
How will it be dealt with?

67
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,760
Lao Ai, do you dare?

68
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,920
Just see if I dare?

69
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,400
Your Majesty, run for your life...

70
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,200
Your Majesty, run for your life...

71
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,840
Your Majesty, run for your life...

72
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,880
King, there is no way to escape, what should I do?

73
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,520
Zhao Gao, are you a lucky star for me?

74
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,800
Just this once

75
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,600
Search for me at the bottom of the cliff, no matter life or death

76
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,240
We must find Ying Zheng’s whole body

77
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,520
Brother Xiang knows he loses

78
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,280
Why lose your temper and knock over the chess pieces?

79
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,920
Xiang Shaolong is simply absent-minded

80
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,840
I'll take a rest first

81
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,920
sorry

82
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,080
It doesn't matter

83
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,360
Are you okay?

84
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,880
Just clean the wound and it'll be fine

85
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:27,920
Lao Ai, our child, you must give him a good burial

86
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,720
You don't have to worry about this

87
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,720
Our child is not dead at all

88
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,880
My child, my child

89
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,680
Is he really my child? Don’t lie to me

90
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,000
I didn't lie to you, I had expected it

91
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,560
The king will not care about the love between flesh and blood

92
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,040
It will definitely be detrimental to our children

93
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,960
Just as I expected

94
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,520
He really ordered our children to be taken away

95
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,600
So I had already arranged for a pregnant woman

96
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,280
Raising a fetus in this secret room

97
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,160
Wait until you give birth

98
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,520
I'll switch the two babies right away

99
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm so tired that my liver is broken

100
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,040
Lao Ai, you are so cruel

101
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,120
If I hadn't concealed the truth from you in advance

102
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,680
When you questioned the king just now

103
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,880
It can't be so realistic

104
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,080
You deliberately want me to question the king

105
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,920
So that he thinks our child is dead?

106
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,960
yes

107
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,320
Our children are indeed an embarrassment to the king

108
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,080
If we want to raise him well

109
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,680
Must leave the palace and live in seclusion elsewhere

110
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,680
I don't need to watch anymore

111
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,520
There are many eyes and ears in the palace, I'm afraid the king will always know

112
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,560
I don't want to see them brothers fighting each other

113
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,160
They are not brothers at all

114
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,920
This is not my child? Have you lied to me again?

115
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,360
I'm not lying to you, this is indeed our biological child

116
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,240
The fake one is the king

117
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,320
It was Xiang Shaolong who came back to pretend to be Zhao Pan.

118
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,760
real?

119
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,360
When you think back to the past, you can tell the truth from the lies

120
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,440
The king wants to eradicate not only our own flesh and blood

121
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,360
And me and you

122
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,320
Sooner or later the king will be unfavorable to us

123
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,600
Rather than sit back and wait for death, it is better to fight back

124
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,080
Xiang Shaolong can create a fake Ying Zheng

125
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,400
We can also create a fake king

126
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,120
Create a fake king?

127
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,840
Yes, when you're in labor

128
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,000
Come to Dazheng Palace to visit your king in person

129
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,640
He looks the same as the king you saw in the palace

130
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,480
Even if there is a fake king

131
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,160
But there is a king in the palace

132
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,840
The king in the palace fell off a cliff and died just now

133
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,600
Things are too complicated, I'm afraid...

134
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,160
You don't need to be afraid, I'm by your side

135
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,280
Besides, the king is now under my control

136
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,720
No, there is another Lu Buwei

137
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,520
Yes, he has always had a deep hatred for us.

138
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,160
And Lu Buwei

139
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,240
We can't fight him

140
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,840
Once the crowning ceremony is over, the king regains military and political power

141
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,160
Why should we worry about not being able to deal with Lu Buwei then?

142
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,120
Even so, we still have to be sneaky?

143
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,360
Listen to me and be patient for a while longer

144
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,640
When power and status are consolidated

145
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,200
Then with the help of the puppet's mouth

146
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,200
Pass the throne to our children

147
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,000
Then we will really have peace of mind

148
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,920
Now I am not only attached to fame and fortune

149
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,680
And our children and you

150
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,720
You have to know that we have reached the point of no return

151
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,960
Even if we are willing to leave now

152
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,240
Our enemies will not let us go either

153
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,160
Ying Zheng is like this, Xiang Shaolong is like this

154
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:26,600
Lu Buwei is like this, we have no choice

155
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,880
What did you say? The king is not in the palace?

156
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,240
When will he leave the palace?

157
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,200
Returning to Prime Minister, the Queen Mother did not know why yesterday

158
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,880
Come to the king's palace and make a scene

159
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,720
Later, the king personally sent the queen mother back to Dazheng Palace

160
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,640
Haven't come back yet

161
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,000
It's been a whole day and night, why haven't the bodies been found yet?

162
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,560
His body was not found for a day

163
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,240
Can't find his seal

164
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,960
Even if we have the same king

165
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,920
It's no use either

166
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,640
Could he still be dead?

167
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,040
Lord Marquis, Queen Mother

168
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,800
Come in

169
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,600
Prime Minister Lu said that he would welcome the king in person

170
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,040
Prime Minister Lu suddenly visited, and Zhu Ji was in an unexpected situation.

171
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,080
I heard that the king sent the Queen Mother back to the palace to rest yesterday.

172
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,880
Lu Buwei is also prone to accidents

173
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:06,360
Why is it strange that one's own child is sent back to his mother's bedchamber?

174
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,560
It’s not surprising that children serve their mothers

175
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,440
But the Queen Mother and the King have an unusual mother-son relationship

176
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,720
Although the people in the palace keep it secret

177
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,040
But the Queen Mother gave birth secretly

178
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,920
Things that made King Longyan furious

179
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,920
It is no longer a big secret to Lu Buwei

180
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,360
Even when the Queen Mother was pregnant

181
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,360
It was also Lu Buwei’s good intention to convey to the king

182
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,360
Lu Buwei…

183
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,800
The Queen Mother broke into the palace and started crying, which was really inappropriate.

184
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,840
How I lose my composure has nothing to do with Prime Minister Lu

185
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,080
It really has nothing to do with Lu Buwei

186
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,840
Lu Buwei now only cares about the whereabouts of the king

187
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,640
Yesterday, the King respectfully welcomed the Queen Mother back to Dazheng Palace.

188
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,480
I never returned to the palace

189
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,400
Lu Buwei wants to know what happened

190
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,360
The king just wants to stay in Dazheng Palace

191
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Accompany your mother

192
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,760
The King was ill just now and is resting now

193
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,560
It is even more serious that the king is ill

194
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,240
Wei Chen wants to visit him in person

195
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,480
The king doesn't want to be disturbed

196
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,600
It's the king who doesn't want to be disturbed

197
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,800
Or maybe the Queen Mother has something else up her sleeve that she doesn’t want Lu Buwei to know about?

198
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,640
What does Lu Buwei mean by saying this?

199
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,560
Lu Buwei wants to see the king

200
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,160
Ask him if he is unwilling to return to the palace?

201
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,200
By saying this, you are implying that I have put the king under house arrest.

202
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,360
Only the Queen Mother knows whether she is under house arrest or not

203
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,600
Now Lu Buwei only knows

204
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,560
Yesterday, the King sent the Queen Mother back to Dazheng Palace

205
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,520
Just don't know where to end

206
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,120
The king should still be in Dazheng Palace, search

207
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,840
Be bold, Lu Buwei, you are very presumptuous

208
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,600
I'm afraid that someone else is presumptuous

209
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,520
Prime Minister Lu

210
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,040
See the king

211
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,960
You've had enough nonsense

212
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,520
King, are you okay?

213
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,320
If you just take a break, what will happen?

214
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,280
Since the king is fine, he should not indulge in leisurely pleasures

215
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,320
There are still many matters in the palace that the king needs to handle personally.

216
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,960
I just want to serve the Queen Mother one more day

217
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,320
Family affairs and state affairs, which one is more important?

218
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,840
The king should be able to distinguish

219
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,040
We have prepared our carriages and horses to welcome you.

220
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,200
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

221
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,680
Your Majesty, I want your Majesty to review these official documents immediately.

222
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,320
There are so many?

223
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,560
Many of them are rushing to implement decrees in various places.

224
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,160
Your Majesty, please stamp your seal immediately and approve it for verification.

225
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,680
I am exhausted

226
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,400
It's not too late to take a look at it when everyone cheers up

227
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,120
The decree cannot be postponed

228
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,680
Your Majesty, please waste no more time.

229
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,160
Didn't you hear me say that I was feeling unwell?

230
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,960
I need to rest first

231
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,720
It's just a seal, the rest is not just for a while

232
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,760
I just want to rest

233
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Isn't it even possible to take a break?

234
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,280
I also want to know

235
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,000
Which is more important, the dragon body or the government order?

236
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,240
Rest is not just for a moment

237
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,800
Does it mean that reviewing official documents only lasts a while?

238
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,960
Wei Chen did not mean this

239
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,120
The minister is only concerned about why the king is ill?

240
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,120
It seems that the King became unwell after visiting the Queen Mother

241
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,080
What I hate most is when someone keeps making trouble

242
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,640
To sow discord between the widow and the Queen Mother

243
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,160
The widow has done too many unfilial things

244
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,200
Empress Dowager Wa...

245
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,160
After all, the widow and the Queen Mother are mother and son.

246
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,440
Please remember, Prime Minister Lu, I need to rest first.

247
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,960
Marquis

248
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,320
Listen, burn these two corpses immediately

249
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,240
I now grant you three thousand food fiefs to Marquis Changxin.

250
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,280
Thank you King

251
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,160
May I ask why the king suddenly granted the title of Marquis of Changxin?

252
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,880
I would like to hear the details

253
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,920
I only reward people based on their merits

254
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,120
Doesn’t it require Prime Minister Lu’s prior approval?

255
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,760
Discussing merit and reward? What merits does the Marquis of Changxin have?

256
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,400
Isn’t it clear to me whether Marquis Changxin has meritorious service?

257
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,200
Long before the widow ascended the throne

258
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,640
Chang Xinhou has served the Lord three times and four times.

259
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,280
Isn’t this the greatest achievement?

260
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,800
Now I only grant three thousand food towns to Marquis Changxin.

261
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,480
What's wrong with this?

262
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,120
Prime Minister Lu actually questioned my actions

263
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,400
This is not what Weichen meant

264
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,960
Since that’s not what Prime Minister Lu meant,

265
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,160
The matter of bestowing the title of Changxin Hou as a city has been decided.

266
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,560
Thank you King for your grace

267
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,400
Brother Xiang, our ship is about to enter Qin territory.

268
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,120
Home is like an arrow, look how happy you are

269
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,120
Of course, we will see dad and eldest brother soon

270
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,120
There is also Mr. Tao, and he is about to arrive at Wushi Ranch.

271
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,880
Yes, we will see Big Brother and Manager Tao soon

272
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,440
And you can ask your father to make the decision

273
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,480
Choose a good and auspicious day to visit the church and get married.

274
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,320
I am about to get married, why am I smiling so hard?

275
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,280
Brother Xiang must still remember

276
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,680
The blurry image in the bronze mirror

277
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,240
You want to say that you are connected with Ying Zheng?

278
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Also, what 21st century are you from?

279
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,880
These incredible things?

280
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,040
It's not unbelievable, I'm telling the truth

281
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,920
Brother Xiang has been thinking about returning to the 21st century before.

282
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,200
But now that I have decided not to leave, what else is there to worry about?

283
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,520
Are you afraid that something will happen to Ying Zheng?

284
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,920
But you're still safe and sound, that means it's okay

285
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,520
What you say makes sense, Brother Xiang, don’t worry about it

286
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,120
I'm afraid that the closer you get to Qin, the more anxious you will be

287
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Just because you feel guilty

288
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,400
I don’t know how to explain it to others

289
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,320
Do you know I'm thinking of Ah Qing?

290
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,360
What kind of guilt does Brother Xiang have in his heart? Who should he explain to?

291
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,360
Xiang Shaolong is the defeated general

292
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,920
Of course I'm afraid of confessing to King Qin

293
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,280
There's yours

294
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,280
It is not one person's responsibility to lose the battle

295
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,280
How can you blame Brother Xiang alone?

296
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,720
I'm not blaming your brother Xiang

297
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,000
Why are you so anxious to put in a good word for him?

298
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,400
When you have a husband in the future, you will do the same

299
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,080
How could she have a husband like she did in my time

300
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,600
She must be a strong woman

301
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,320
How could any man tie her up?

302
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes, I like to wander the world

303
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,680
Home all over the world, feel free and at ease

304
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,560
If you want to make a career in the world, never marry

305
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,840
I plan to pass the Ju Zi Ling to you

306
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,800
It's better for you to be the successor of Mozi than for me to be the successor

307
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,520
Besides, you are Cao Qiudao’s disciple.

308
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,120
I also have a close relationship with Mohist

309
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,880
Your words are also far-fetched

310
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,160
In fact, you are a descendant of Mozi

311
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,880
Those who order the world to be ink are also right

312
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,760
Just think of me as the big brother Bangxiang.

313
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,560
Or think of it as helping the seniors

314
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,520
He hoped that I could

315
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,880
Find a trustworthy successor for him

316
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Please help me or help the elders, please

317
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,640
good

318
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Xiang Shaolong, you are the disciple of a senior veteran.

319
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,240
That means you are a Mohist

320
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,680
Now Shanrou is in charge of Juziling

321
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,320
This means that Xiang Shaolong will take orders from me in the future.

322
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,640
Xiang Shaolong, listen, from now on

323
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,400
You can't be sorry to Tingfang

324
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,360
Otherwise, I will give the order

325
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,240
All the Mohists are chasing you

326
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,440
Tingfang, if he bullies you

327
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,840
Come to Xianyang City to find me within a month

328
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,720
Judging from your tone, could it be after arriving in Xianyang?

329
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,440
Will you break up with us?

330
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,760
I like to be carefree

331
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,520
Are you really not with us?

332
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,880
All the feasts in the world come to an end

333
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,400
It’s true that all feasts in the world come to an end

334
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,400
Because of my status, it is inconvenient for me to appear in Xianyang.

335
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,640
Sending you thousands of miles away, we must say goodbye eventually

336
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,320
The day I spent with Brother Xiang was short-lived.

337
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,760
clear

338
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,120
You guys talk slowly

339
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,080
Tingfang, help me go in and pack my luggage.

340
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,320
You're too kind. I've known you for a short time.

341
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,760
But I'm already very happy

342
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,560
Do you really think so?

343
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,040
Although we are not the same people

344
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,480
But I, Xiang Shaolong, respect your friendship, Long Yangjun

345
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,280
This sword once fought alongside Brother Xiang

346
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,640
Deal with Cao Qiudao

347
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,520
Now I give it to you as a souvenir

348
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,440
The sword you carry with you is too valuable. Thank you.

349
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,080
I regard Brother Xiang as a confidant, I hope you know

350
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,560
What is valuable is not the value of the sword itself

351
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,480
It’s the intention of the person who gave the sword

352
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,040
Thanks

353
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,760
The most difficult thing to endure in the world is the word "love"

354
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,920
As suave as Brother Xiang, he is naturally merciful everywhere

355
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,320
timidity near hometown

356
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,000
Is Brother Xiang’s anxiety related to this?

357
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Return to Xianyang City

358
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,880
Please give my regards to my junior sister Qin Qing.

359
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,520
Qin Tai Fu

360
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,240
Ryoyo?

361
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,040
Do you see what fruits I brought?

362
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,240
Very sweet

363
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,800
I'm sorry to ask you to bring me fruit every day

364
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,400
Don't say that. Frankly speaking, just wait any longer.

365
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,280
Liangrong is afraid that sooner or later you will turn into a husband-looking stone

366
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,280
If it were you, something happened to Jing Jun

367
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,520
You won’t let it go either, right?

368
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,200
God really likes to play tricks on people

369
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,920
It's very difficult for you and General Xiang to be together

370
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,360
The king decided to send General Xiang to the expedition

371
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,080
In the end, you two will always have to live apart.

372
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,280
Shaolong once promised me that he would definitely come back

373
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,920
He will definitely

374
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Mr. Qin, we just received news, brother...

375
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,200
How is Shaolong?

376
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,240
What happened?

377
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,800
He has arrived safely in Xianyang

378
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,520
real?

379
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,840
Really, brother is not dead

380
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,240
Big brother... Big brother

381
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,560
Brother, I already knew that brother would come back safely

382
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,640
Now I say I knew it already

383
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,000
You were as frightened as I was at first

384
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,320
Especially Mr. Qin

385
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,600
Brother Xiang

386
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,520
Brother Xiang…

387
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,680
Brother Xiang

388
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,080
I believe these two must be you on the ship

389
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,400
The sworn brother I keep mentioning day and night

390
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,000
This is Teng Yi, this is Jing Jun

391
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,640
This girl is…

392
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,520
Her name is Qin Qing, and this is Tingfang

393
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,600
Miss Qin Qing

394
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,640
It turns out to be the eldest lady of the Wu family

395
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,880
Is she the daughter of Lord Wu Bao?

396
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,000
I heard Lord Wu Bao say

397
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,520
The eldest lady of the Wu family is traveling around

398
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,440
Unexpectedly, I came back with my eldest brother

399
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,200
Actually, Tingfang and I met again in Qi State.

400
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,320
It's really a long story.

401
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,760
In this case, why not take a break at Yashe

402
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,400
Then let’s talk slowly

403
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,280
Godfather is still waiting for us

404
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,440
Miss Tingfang seems to be better than what Shaolong said.

405
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
More elegant and refined

406
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,840
Thanks

407
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,040
Although this is the first time I meet you

408
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,280
But Shaolong often mentioned you in front of me

409
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,560
Really? Why did Brother Xiang never

410
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,320
Mention Miss Qinqing in front of me?

411
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,720
Maybe you will meet again after a long absence

412
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,680
There is a lot to say when we meet

413
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,720
That's right, a period of time on the ship

414
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,200
There really is never enough to say.

415
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,880
Shaolong is like this

416
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,440
From astronomy to geography

417
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,160
There are always endless topics to talk about

418
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,760
I believe that Shaolong will tell your story later

419
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,760
Tell me everything

420
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,440
What happened between me and Brother Xiang

421
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,360
Do you really know everything?

422
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,400
Yes, I also know that you have many misunderstandings

423
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,480
Our misunderstanding has been cleared up

424
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,600
Really? That’s great, I’m happy for you too

425
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,400
Brother, have you been on the boat for more than ten days?

426
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,040
Have you even forgotten how to ride a horse?

427
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,320
I see you seem to be riding slower and slower

428
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,560
If this horse refuses to go, what does it have to do with me?

429
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,120
It's a pity that Mr. Long Yang can't come to Xianyang

430
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,640
Otherwise, you can catch a glimpse of his style.

431
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,080
Shaolong Mr. Zou...

432
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,920
Fortunately you can come back safely...

433
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,120
Don't worry, Mr. Zou

434
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,040
I am blessed with great fortune and will not die

435
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,040
Now you are smiling

436
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,320
It’s hard for Qing’er to worry about you day and night

437
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,360
Godfather is exaggerating again

438
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,320
Miss Tingfang, Qinqing will introduce you to you.

439
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,440
This is my godfather Zou Yan, and this is Miss Tingfang

440
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,840
Miss Tingfang

441
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,160
Mr. Zou

442
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,960
I met Miss Tingfang in Qi State

443
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,520
Anyway, it’s the same sentence, it’s a long story

444
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,120
Since it’s a long story, let’s talk about it later.

445
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,960
Let’s have lunch first and then catch up on old times

446
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,800
Qin Qing goes in to prepare the dishes

447
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,440
I'm going to get a drink right away, by the way, brother

448
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,640
This meal is for you to wash away the dust. Do you want to kill the chicken?

449
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,200
If so, I'll ask my second brother to prepare it

450
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,200
No need... Qing'er has already prepared

451
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,040
Shaolong’s favorite dishes

452
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,520
Anyway, I must have a big meal today

453
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,520
Celebrating Shaolong’s safe return

454
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,520
Miss Tingfang, you can watch it at your humble residence.

455
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,200
Take a break, you're welcome

456
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,200
Then I'm welcome

457
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,000
He has read a lot of books, and he also knows how to paint and play the piano.

458
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,800
Miss Qinqing is not only well-educated, but also a talented woman

459
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,840
actually…

460
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,120
In fact, my father has wanted me to read more poetry since I was a child.

461
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,520
Be polite, but unfortunately my qualifications are limited

462
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,760
I only care about playing all day long. I grew up on a ranch.

463
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,320
I don’t know much about literacy, but I see a lot about horses.

464
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,120
Not like Miss Deqinqing

465
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,080
In fact, everyone’s lifestyle is different

466
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,640
Reading a lot doesn’t mean you’re great

467
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,840
I didn’t tell you about the problem between Qin Qing and me.

468
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,800
Actually I don't know what to say to you

469
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,200
It's not that I don't want to tell you, understand?

470
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,480
Yes, I am engaged to you

471
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,880
But Qin Qing and I are also engaged

472
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,040
But the nature is very different

473
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,120
By the way, do you understand?

474
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,800
I am sincere in marrying you

475
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,280
But I can't let Qin Qing down

476
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,240
Because she helped me charge the communicator

477
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,520
Almost died

478
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,480
Just like when you blocked a sword for me, do you understand?

479
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,360
I see

480
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,480
Actually, I really want to solve the problem between the three of us.

481
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,000
But I really don't know how to solve it

482
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:08,200
It would be better to split me in half if you can

483
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,840
By the way, do you understand?

484
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,200
I see

485
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,360
Do you really understand?

486
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,800
Miss Qinqing is generous, decent and considerate.

487
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,200
In order to fulfill your wish, she did not hesitate to sacrifice herself

488
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,480
Noble sentiments, very great

489
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,040
You also sacrificed a lot

490
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,360
Shaolong, so you are here

491
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,200
Qin Qing is too busy, please go over and help her.

492
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,120
OK…

493
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,880
I see

494
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,760
I mean Tingfang and I

495
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,920
You always want to get her understanding and see her again

496
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,920
Now that I got what I wanted, I am really happy and congratulated.

497
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,400
Are you telling the truth or irony?

498
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,560
I prepared heart-shaped steak for you

499
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,840
You can try it later

500
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,000
OK

501
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,440
By the way, how did you meet Miss Tingfang again?

502
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,000
Just like when I was filming, I was hit by an arrow

503
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,720
Just fell into the sea

504
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
Fortunately, she met me, so I saved her...

505
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,840
Is anything wrong?

506
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,680
It's okay, you continue

507
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,600
No more talking, just finish it first, otherwise you’ll get hurt again

508
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,800
I won't tell you until later

509
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,960
Miss Tingfang has suffered a lot for you

510
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,280
Don't let her down

511
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,840
I won't let you down either

512
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,960
The most uncomfortable feeling is the feeling of gaining and losing again

513
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,360
First give hope, then ruthlessly take it away

514
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,280
Qin Qing asked herself if she could bear it

515
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,720
Actually, I don’t want you two to be unhappy.

516
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,880
if you can

517
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,400
I'd rather split myself in half

518
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,520
Do you understand how I feel?

519
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,800
I see

520
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,800
Do you really understand?

521
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,640
I really understand, don't hold me back, you get out

522
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,680
Do you understand both? It’s hard to understand.

523
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,640
There are fish, meat, chicken, and vegetables

524
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,760
Miss Qinqing, you don’t need a quarter of an hour

525
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,520
You can prepare many different dishes

526
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,880
No wonder the second brother keeps praising Miss Qinqing, both...

527
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,120
Where is the second brother? Where is the second brother?

528
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,240
Second brother, he is feeding the horses

529
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,880
He told us to eat first without waiting for him

530
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,400
Brother Teng is really unlucky

531
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,320
Why is your plate of beef so special?

532
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,640
I specially designed it for Brother Xiang

533
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,280
You've been working all morning and you're already sweating profusely

534
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,920
I'll give you a piece of chicken leg as a reward

535
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,520
Sister Qinqing’s cooking skills are top-notch, really enviable

536
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,640
I just know how to sit and wait to eat

537
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,520
I only know how to sit and wait to eat

538
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,920
You are too thin. Eat a piece of chicken leg as a supplement.

539
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,840
Brother, the two pieces of chicken drumsticks were shared with others, I...

540
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,480
Just eat the chicken butt

541
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,800
It's been a long time since I've been this busy

542
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,520
How about everyone having a drink and reciting poems?

543
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,280
Okay, drink order

544
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,760
Each person has one sentence. It is very interesting to recite verses.

545
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,680
Okay, let's do the drinking order after dinner, okay?

546
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,800
Have a meal…

547
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,360
Does Shaolong have a good suggestion?

548
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,080
Well, let me teach you a new game

549
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,280
It's very simple, I just say one thing

550
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,320
You follow the last word and say another one

551
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,520
For example, TVB’s B

552
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,680
B’s son, son’s daughter

553
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,560
Lu Buwei’s Wei, do you understand?

554
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,680
It's indeed interesting...but what is TVB's B?

555
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,480
B’s boy?

556
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,640
You don't need to understand the meaning of these words

557
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
Anyway, I say a word, and you follow up with the last word

558
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,800
Just say another sentence

559
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,120
interesting

560
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,280
Brother, you go ahead and tell me

561
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,960
Do you really understand?

562
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,800
Okay, I'll start first

563
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,800
Starting with Xiang Shaolong’s dragon, you continue

564
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,320
Xiang Shaolong's dragon, the god of dragon and horse spirit

565
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,880
Xiang Shaolong's dragon, the god of dragon and horse spirit

566
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,600
The great and powerful one

567
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,040
Xiang Shaolong's dragon, the god of dragon and horse spirit

568
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,040
The great one with vast supernatural powers, the great truth

569
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,960
Xiang Shaolong's dragon, the god of dragon and horse spirit

570
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,800
The great one with vast supernatural powers, the great truth

571
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,880
What next?

572
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,560
Then you lose

573
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,480
you lose

574
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,080
Is this the residence given to you by the king?

575
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,160
yes

576
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,920
The scale is indeed not small

577
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,280
The wing in the east wing is currently unoccupied.

578
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,600
You can stay in the east wing first.

579
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,880
Second brother, take Tingfang with you...

580
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,600
No need, I also want to browse around

581
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,000
I'll find it myself

582
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:14,000
So weird? No reason, so happy?

583
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,480
Yes, everyone was very happy after the meal

584
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,400
Qin Qing is not here, what can be explained?

585
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,600
Qinqing is here now

586
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,120
The two of them are like sisters and are not jealous at all

587
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
What does jealousy mean?

588
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,800
Is there something strange? Still standing still

589
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,600
Or is it just talking and laughing and fighting?

590
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,000
What are you talking about? You seem to be talking about fighting.

591
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,680
There is no reason. They should fight each other?

592
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,640
how so?

593
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,080
Brother, why do you say that?

594
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,160
Do you think Miss Qinqing and Miss Tingfang

595
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,960
Don't you like each other?

596
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,880
No, think about two women and a man

597
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,720
Even if it doesn’t make you blush

598
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,680
It should be a big fight

599
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,480
There is no smell of gunpowder, and it is very harmonious.

600
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,760
Harmony is a good thing

601
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,360
They won’t fight for me? Should I ask them to abstain all together?

602
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,960
Or do I take myself too seriously?

603
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,080
Brother, what are you worried about?

604
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,920
I didn't know how to explain it to them at first.

605
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,280
Now I really don’t know what they think

606
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,360
Maybe both girls plan to marry you

607
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,920
Bigamy is illegal

608
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,520
Why not?

609
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,840
What is possible?

610
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,800
All men in the world are like this, why not?

611
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,440
It is common for two women to work together with one husband

612
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,320
Maybe Miss Tingfang and Miss Qinqing

613
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,560
There has been a tacit understanding for a long time, so what's wrong with that?

614
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,520
You're crazy, I already said bigamy is illegal

615
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,560
I am a modern person, how can I do this?

616
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,120
Brother, if there’s nothing else, please forgive me.

617
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,600
Second brother, are you leaving?

618
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,680
Brother, I've gone back to my room too

619
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,160
You want to leave too?

620
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,760
I don't know if you two understand what I said

621
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,960
Or do I not understand what I am saying?

622
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,160
Mr. Xiang, the king has ordered you to come to the palace to see him immediately.

623
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,880
I'll go change clothes and you prepare the carriage for me

624
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,760
King?

625
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Taifu Xiang...you must not enter the palace

626
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,160
Ying Zheng in the palace is fake

627
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,560
Why are you here?

628
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,720
When Taifu Xiang went to Xianyang,

629
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,920
Lao Ai wants to frame me

630
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,400
The widow was almost killed

631
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,600
If he hadn't been hiding in Taifu Xiang's house all this time,

632
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,840
Now I have no chance to see Mrs. Xiang anymore.

633
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,800
I originally wanted to take away Lao Ai’s bastard

634
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,720
Unexpectedly, this thief Lao Ai would take the opportunity to attack

635
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,520
Want to put the widow to death

636
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,040
If Zhao Gao had not loyally protected the Lord,

637
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,680
I'm afraid I'm already on the road to hell.

638
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,240
I never expected that Zhao Gao would be so loyal

639
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,120
However, I and Zhao Gaoming should not give up.

640
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:34,040
Rescued by two fishermen, we will use it to our advantage

641
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,640
Make these two my scapegoats

642
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,920
Did you kill them?

643
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,240
Death may be lighter than a feather, or it may be heavier than Mount Tai.

644
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,320
For the sake of Da Qin Jiangshan

645
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,240
These two finally deserved their death

646
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,480
Later, I got in touch with Li Si

647
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,640
Only then did we know that Lao Ai is a thief

648
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,440
He actually found someone who looked like a widower and pretended to be a widower.

649
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,520
That means Lao Ai has been prepared for a long time.

650
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,000
But the emperor has eyes

651
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,960
Let me wait until Taifu Xiang comes back

652
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,240
Taifu Xiang, you will follow me into the palace immediately.

653
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,640
Expose Lao Ai's conspiracy in person

654
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,080
Never

655
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,800
Why?

656
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,320
You and I both know what Lao Ai is like.

657
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,280
Besides, he now has the Queen Mother supporting him.

658
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,280
If we really enter the palace

659
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,760
When he arrived, he insisted that the current king was real.

660
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,560
There's nothing we can do against him

661
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,960
Besides, I just returned to Xianyang

662
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,840
This fake king summoned me to the palace right away

663
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,640
They were obviously prepared

664
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,640
If we really enter the palace, we will be seeking death.

665
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,600
What do you think a widow should do?

666
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,200
If Lu Buwei knew that this Ying Zheng was fake

667
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,680
He will definitely go crazy, we will wait and see what happens

668
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,400
Let them kill each other

669
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,800
We reap the benefits of fishermen

670
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,120
Taifu Xiang really has a clever plan

671
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,160
It's not in vain for me to take a big risk and wait for you to come back.

672
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:15,080
The strategy is good, but we need to find a way to get the best of both worlds

673
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,240
Not easy either

674
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,640
Only Taifu Xiang is by my side

675
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,040
I believe that nothing in the world can trouble us

676
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,960
Big brother…

677
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,440
hide first

678
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,240
Big brother

679
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,640
Coming

680
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,360
Big brother

681
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,480
What's up?

682
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,680
Mr. Zou suddenly visited

683
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,280
Said something happened to Mrs. Qin
