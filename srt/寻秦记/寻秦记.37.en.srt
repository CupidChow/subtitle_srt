1
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,640
Now we have to see the true nature

2
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,520
What skills will you have in the future?

3
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,440
You can have fun with that bitch again and castrate him

4
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,600
No...

5
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,160
Don't come over, or I'll jump down right away

6
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,520
Do you really have the heart to leave Zhu Ji behind?

7
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,600
Just think I'm sorry for you

8
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,680
I can no longer let you live a happy life

9
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,840
Only death is the best relief

10
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,400
Well, if you really want to die

11
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,960
I will die with your flesh and blood

12
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,680
What did you say?

13
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,960
In a few months, you will be a father

14
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,320
Me as a father?

15
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
Can I really be a father?

16
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,040
Can I still have my own flesh and blood?

17
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,680
Ever since I knew I had your flesh and blood

18
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,280
I'm afraid I will become a burden to you

19
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,760
So I never dared to tell you

20
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,240
For this bit of blood, Zhu Ji would risk her life

21
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,200
I won’t let the king abort your child.

22
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,560
For the sake of me and our children, you must never seek death in the future.

23
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,000
I promise you, I will never seek death again

24
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,520
Because I have to shoulder the responsibility of raising my wife and children

25
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,600
Never again

26
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,080
Queen Mother…

27
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,200
The king is coming

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,560
King

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,240
What a pair of crazy men and resentful women, it’s hard to leave

30
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,360
Abortion medicine? I would rather die than drink it

31
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,400
Does the mother want the child to leave as a last resort?

32
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,040
The last move the king pointed out

33
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,000
Are you going to execute me and the Queen Mother together?

34
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,040
if it's true

35
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm going to have a good talk with the king.

36
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,000
The topic may be more shocking than the Queen Mother’s pregnancy

37
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,680
The king can choose to listen or not

38
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,440
All retreat

39
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,360
Queen Mother, please wait here.

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
Believe in the secret of the king’s true identity

41
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,520
Still a thorn in the side of the king

42
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,160
Now you are worse than a dog

43
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,160
All you need is to label it as an affair with the Queen Mother

44
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,040
Even an unfounded crime can kill you

45
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,840
Do you think I am still under your control today?

46
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,040
That's right

47
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,640
But that day I witnessed Zhao Pan become Ying Zheng

48
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,720
When entering Xianyang

49
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,960
I already know how to make the most of this opportunity

50
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,880
I have long since put my life on the line with Ying Zheng

51
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,360
That is, Zhao Pan, connected in a line

52
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,360
I'm fine, Ying Zheng will be fine too

53
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,240
But if I die

54
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,240
The emissary I arranged outside the palace in advance

55
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,080
The true identity of the king will be announced to the world.

56
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,520
Now I have become a useless person

57
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,080
No soldiers, no power, even no martial arts

58
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,800
I just want to be with the woman I love

59
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,640
Spend the rest of my life with my only bloodline

60
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,040
If the king refuses to give me a way out

61
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,040
Then I have no choice but to risk it

62
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,680
I underestimate you

63
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,680
each other

64
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,560
Hello

65
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,040
It's very windy here, and it won't be good if you catch a cold.

66
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,840
Why do I see you everywhere I go?

67
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,640
How big is this boat? There is only one bow

68
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
We will definitely meet you

69
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Do I look disgusting? You don't want to see me?

70
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,320
If you weren't still recovering from your injuries, I would have chased you ashore

71
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,800
Don’t you really want to see me?

72
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,880
You'd better jump into the river right away and disappear in front of me

73
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
That would be easy

74
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,680
Brother Xiang

75
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,280
Brother Xiang…

76
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,440
Brother Xiang…

77
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,200
Brother Xiang, don’t play

78
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,840
I don't really want you to jump

79
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,440
Brother Xiang...where are you?

80
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,040
Don't scare me, don't die

81
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,680
Stop the boat and let people come...

82
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,920
Are you looking for me? Sister Feng said the pickles are too salty

83
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,240
You want me to throw it into the river and take a dip

84
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,360
You just said you didn't want to see me

85
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,200
Why did you shout so loudly just now?

86
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,520
Xiang Shaolong, I have never seen such a disgusting person

87
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,880
Just for fun, such a small thing

88
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,840
I just want to make you happy

89
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,080
stop…

90
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,960
sorry

91
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,480
Fengfei, this dance has been rehearsed dozens of times

92
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,640
Why are you still dancing like a mess?

93
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm really sorry

94
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,080
Now you are our pillar

95
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,120
It's up to you to perform at King Qi's birthday banquet.

96
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,160
Your dancing skills

97
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,800
How can our song and dance troupe lose face?

98
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,120
Sister Feng, dancing requires time for immersion and training.

99
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,880
If you let her practice a few more times, she will definitely make progress.

100
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,680
We have two days to go to Qi State

101
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,240
King Qi’s birthday banquet is imminent

102
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm afraid that my performance in front of the palace will turn into a show of shame in front of the palace.

103
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,760
At first I thought I could replace you when I met you like Feng Fei

104
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,080
Do you really want me to come back to the world now?

105
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,840
Forget it... no more dancing...

106
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,520
No wonder she is so angry

107
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,800
You really jumped to a mess again, it's scary

108
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,800
Tingfang, I'll give you water to drink

109
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,960
It's you who makes her feel uneasy, and you haven't even said a good word to her

110
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,280
Tingfang

111
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,200
Why do you have to struggle so hard?

112
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,160
Sorry, but if I hadn't come to see you dance

113
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,160
It may not make you jump to the point where there is no right step

114
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,600
But seriously, I didn't mean to

115
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,400
Criticize your dancing skills

116
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,800
I just want to care about you

117
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,920
See if I can help you

118
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,920
Whether my dancing is good or not has nothing to do with you

119
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,200
King Qi’s birthday banquet, I performed in front of the palace

120
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,840
not performing for you

121
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,440
Well, let me perform with you now, come on

122
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,920
bring it on

123
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,000
Let go...

124
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,520
By the way, just smile and you’ll be sulky all day long

125
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,920
You come again, you come again and I want you to dance your head

126
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,040
I actually want to help you

127
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,880
Do you think I want to harm you? Be careful

128
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,440
Well, let me teach you how to dance "Carmen"

129
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,400
Sister Feng, Mr. Tian has arrived.

130
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,640
Tian Dan was an important minister of the Qi State and had great power in both the government and the public.

131
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,800
Sister Feng came to pick up the boat in person this time. It was really not easy for Sister Feng.

132
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,040
Sister Feng kowtows to Master Tian

133
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,480
Good...look through the autumn water

134
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,120
Finally I can see Sister Feng’s beauty again

135
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,200
It’s really Tian’s blessing

136
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,960
I want Mr. Tian to come and greet him personally.

137
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,080
Sister Ling Feng was really flattered

138
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,280
Sister Feng Song and Dance Troupe is famous all over the world

139
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,240
He was also the main guest performer at the King’s birthday banquet.

140
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,520
How dare Tian dare to wait?

141
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,040
What's more, Miss Fengfei, the mainstay of the Fengjie Song and Dance Troupe

142
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,760
Her beauty reputation spreads far and wide, and Tian really wants to see her beauty in person

143
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,800
Mr. Tian, ​​you have really good taste.

144
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,640
That is Miss Feng Fei

145
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,760
Yeah?

146
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,320
Fengfei, come and see Mr. Tian.

147
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,680
Fengfei met Mr. Tian

148
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,640
Well...it really lives up to its reputation.

149
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,880
Miss Feng Fei shines brightly and is indescribably beautiful.

150
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,360
Sister Feng, when will we move the suitcases to the shore?

151
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,760
No need for the time being, I’m here to celebrate my birthday this time

152
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,160
Several of them are foreign dignitaries

153
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,160
Long Yangjun of Wei State arrived soon

154
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,960
Tian needs to go pick him up

155
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,000
If Sister Feng doesn't mind

156
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,800
Tian wanted to visit Sister Feng’s boat very much.

157
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,520
I wonder if Tian has such good eyesight?

158
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,680
It’s a rare visit from Mr. Tian

159
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,400
It's our honor

160
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,080
Mr. Tian, ​​let me lead the way.

161
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,760
good

162
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,240
please please

163
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,840
Sir please

164
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,120
Mr. Tian, ​​our ship is crude and crude.

165
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,000
No entertainment, just a drink at the bar

166
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,400
No need...if I could rehearse it for Tian

167
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,680
It's the best gift

168
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,920
Sir, it's up to you

169
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,960
good…

170
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,480
Last time Tian saw Miss Feng Fei dancing to the big dance

171
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,160
Wonderful and unforgettable

172
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Awarded

173
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,640
This dance must be performed at the King’s birthday banquet.

174
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,840
Big drum dance is the main repertoire of the song and dance troupe

175
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,920
The adults have lives, how dare we not jump?

176
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,360
good…

177
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,040
But is the big drum used this time the same as before?

178
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,240
Master Tian, ​​our drums are exactly the same as before

179
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,760
Wink, there must be something going on inside

180
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,400
Come, come and sit, sit...

181
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,800
Miss Fengfei, Tian had seen it years ago

182
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,720
Your superb performance is still fresh in my memory

183
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,120
I never thought we would meet again today

184
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,000
This is Mr. Tian’s reward

185
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,520
Last time I was watching Feng Fei from afar

186
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,160
Looking closer this time, Miss Fengfei is really a little different.

187
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,800
Fengfei is Fengfei, how could it be different?

188
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,000
No... Miss Feng Fei is much more beautiful

189
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,440
The pervert showed up. Did you think he was going to a nightclub?

190
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,760
Tian Dan is simply a lustful ghost

191
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,440
If you take a step too late, you will suffer a big loss

192
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,920
Not just a hungry ghost in sex

193
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,880
It's simply a great pervert

194
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,000
How do you know?

195
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,480
No, once you come out, don’t go back again

196
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Also, you don’t want to go to that birthday banquet of King Qi

197
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
I'm sure there must be something fishy in it

198
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,280
Why are you so nervous?

199
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,120
I'm afraid you won't know if you've suffered a loss.

200
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,760
Mr. Tian is actually just warm and kind.

201
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,520
It's not as bad as you said

202
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,960
Is this considered warm and cordial?

203
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,720
I said his purpose is to make money, is that true?

204
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
I don't think there's anything wrong with him

205
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,960
Is this no problem?

206
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,240
Unless you naturally like to be touched by others

207
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,680
Listen, what is in front of you now

208
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,240
It's Fengfei, not Wu Tingfang

209
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,840
Everything about Fengfei has nothing to do with you

210
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,360
I don't care if you are Feng Fei or Wu Tingfang

211
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,520
Anyway, it’s not OK if you are touched by others.

212
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,000
I like to be touched, it has nothing to do with you

213
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,120
Don't speak too loudly

214
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Does it have nothing to do with me? You've been touched enough, right?

215
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,480
It turns out that you are famous all over the world

216
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,760
Brother Cao Qiudao, Sword Master of Qi State, disrespectful...

217
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,000
Your Majesty, you are so grateful for your exquisite swordsmanship.

218
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,880
Cao has been famous for a long time

219
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,120
Sister Feng wishes the king eternal blessings and a long life.

220
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,240
Well...Unknown Sister Feng this time

221
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,480
What exquisite songs and dances have been arranged?

222
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,560
Hurry up... Hurry up and perform for everyone to enjoy

223
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,120
To congratulate the king on his immortal life

224
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,920
Sister Feng has arranged a large-scale encouragement

225
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,760
The person responsible for this dance is our mainstay Feng Fei

226
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,880
Quick show

227
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,400
The King of Qi congratulated him on his birthday, but it turned out that he was entertaining a pervert to look at women.

228
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,120
Escort…

229
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,880
Capture them and keep them alive

230
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,840
King, the assassin is dead

231
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,080
Please forgive me, Your Majesty

232
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,640
Tingfang

233
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,800
The sword is poisonous

234
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,680
Tingfang

235
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,080
Tingfang

236
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,560
Brother Xiang

237
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,680
How is she?

238
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,160
This girl is poisoned

239
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
Although the toxicity is temporarily suppressed,

240
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,960
If not treated early, poisonous blood will spread throughout the body

241
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,200
I'm afraid there is no way to return to the soul

242
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,640
Your Majesty, this is the rejuvenation pill that detoxifies you.

243
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,000
Hope you can use it

244
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,400
Do you know what kind of poison this girl was poisoned with?

245
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,080
If you don’t know and take medicine indiscriminately

246
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,960
I'm afraid it will have the opposite effect

247
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,440
What else can be done? Should Tingfang be allowed to die?

248
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,400
She can't die, she must not die

249
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,400
Please save her, I beg you to save her

250
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,680
Brother Xiang

251
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,120
Tingfang

252
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,440
Is Tingfang dying?

253
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,280
No, you'll be fine...

254
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:25,200
When I was dying, Brother Xiang was by my side and offered him comfort.

255
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,600
It's all my fault

256
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,840
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't be reduced to a singer

257
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,480
if not for me

258
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,960
You may still be the eldest lady in Wujiapu now

259
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:53,120
It's all my fault, why are you blocking this sword for me?

260
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,920
Brother Xiang came to Qi Palace also to save me

261
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:08,320
As long as you're fine, I'm content

262
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,640
I have no regrets about blocking this sword

263
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,280
I just regret not admitting it frankly

264
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,400
In fact, I have never forgotten my love for you

265
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,840
Now Tingfang is leaving

266
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,960
If I don't say it, I'm afraid I won't have the chance to say it.

267
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,320
don't say these words

268
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,000
You'll be fine, you know?

269
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,840
Brother Xiang already knows Tingfang's thoughts

270
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:01,360
But I really want to know if you have ever liked me?

271
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:09,120
Yes... What I regret most is that I regretted my marriage to you.

272
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,520
If you can recover this time, I will definitely marry you

273
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,600
I must want you to be my wife

274
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,040
You can't have anything happen to you, you really can't...

275
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,560
There are these words from Brother Xiang

276
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,200
Tingfang is satisfied

277
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,400
Tingfang, take a rest

278
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,040
Xiang Shaolong was defeated by Li Mu and died on the battlefield.

279
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,640
Why did it suddenly appear in Qi State?

280
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,640
Xiang Shaolong came to Qi State... Lord?

281
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,760
If he spoils my big things, I will make him unable to fly.

282
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Lord Tian, ​​there is no need to be angry, even though the matter failed this time

283
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,000
But we can still wait for the next opportunity

284
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,360
Waiting for the next opportunity?

285
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,400
The King of Qi has been alerted, and the King of Qi has taken precautions

286
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,880
Immediately mobilize the palace guards for personal protection

287
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,720
As a result, it will be difficult for us to have another chance to take action

288
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,840
It's all your fault

289
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,880
The so-called masters and dead warriors are simply trash.

290
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,000
Nearly captured in the melee

291
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,280
Fortunately, Cao Qiudao shot them to death by mistake.

292
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,840
To avoid this trouble

293
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,080
Otherwise, Tian’s situation would be unimaginable

294
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,080
Mr. Tian, ​​you can rest assured

295
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,360
All the dead soldiers who have been trained by me

296
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,400
If you fail, you must die to apologize.

297
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,920
If you rebel, you will have to die.

298
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,760
The King of Qi is exhausted

299
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,560
Next time I will do it myself

300
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,040
Mr. Tian, ​​I will go back and arrange everything first.

301
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,840
Then he conspired with Mr. Tian to assassinate the King of Qi.

302
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,440
careful

303
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,880
Cao Qiudao, stop

304
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,560
It is indeed Cao Qiudao, I recognize your martial arts

305
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,560
Take off the mask

306
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,280
Do you think I can't recognize you if you wear a mask?

307
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,920
Xiang Shaolong, you are really amazing

308
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Act like a good person in front of others

309
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,800
It turns out that the so-called sword master is the leader of the assassins.

310
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,640
Now that you know my true identity

311
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,760
Can't escape death

312
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,600
Cao Qiudao, if you want it

313
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,600
Ju Ziling's secret recipe, let her go

314
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,200
The one you got last time was a fake

315
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,560
I still have the original copy in my hand

316
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,400
Fake tips, I haven’t settled the score with you yet

317
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,920
You let her go, let her go and I will give it to you

318
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,880
Stop talking nonsense, do you think Cao will believe it?

319
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,760
Can you not believe it? The secret is so powerful

320
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,680
You can tell just by looking at me, my qualifications are so poor

321
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,200
You can become a master by learning three Kung Fu skills

322
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,440
Also, if you don't want tips

323
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,080
You don’t need to keep making secret checks all the time.

324
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,840
Let her go, now only I know the whereabouts of the secret book

325
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,040
If you let her go, I'll give it to you

326
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,040
Okay, you immediately get the huge order to exchange it

327
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,520
Wait a minute, the secret is just to exchange Shan Rou's life.

328
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,680
Seems so unfair

329
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,800
At this point, do you dare to bargain with me?

330
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,720
Shanrou didn't dare, but she had been following her master for a long time.

331
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,120
Always know what it means to sell at a good price

332
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,080
Xiang Shaolong, the purpose of our visit this time

333
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,840
It's to get the antidote to save Wu Tingfang

334
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,520
We will not give up until the antidote is obtained.

335
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,000
Do you want me to give you the antidote?

336
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,920
Shanrou is willing to stay as collateral

337
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,440
As long as Wu Tingfang is saved

338
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,480
Xiang Shaolong must trade the secret book for Shanrou’s life

339
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,680
You risked your life and betrayed me for this brat

340
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,040
Not only could he not be favored by him,

341
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,040
Do you want to make wedding clothes for others?

342
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,240
Shanrou and Xiang Shaolong are good brothers who show sincerity to each other

343
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,960
She and Wu Tingfang are also good sisters who share weal and woe.

344
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,000
Treat each other with sincerity and share weal and woe

345
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,640
Not everyone has this kind of friendship

346
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,120
The lord will not understand

347
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,880
Friendship is more important than life?

348
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,280
Everyone has his own ambitions

349
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,880
Well, well, everyone has his own ambitions

350
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,240
Cao Qiudao, do you still want to change the secret book?

351
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,240
The secret is that Cao is determined to win

352
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,840
In exchange for the lives of two mere little girls

353
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,600
Still a good deal

354
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,320
The antidote to save Wu Tingfang is here

355
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,040
Tomorrow at noon you will bring me the tips

356
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,680
Go to the top of the box cliff to exchange for Shanrou's life

357
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,800
Xiang Shaolong, I hope you

358
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,320
Don’t live up to Shanrou’s friendship for you

359
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,560
Miss Wu has vomited out the poisonous blood in her body

360
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,280
Will be well soon

361
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,320
Brother Xiang, what worries you?

362
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,360
I'm thinking about how to save Shanrou

363
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,280
I didn't expect Cao Qiudao to be so treacherous

364
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,640
Brother Xiang, I’m afraid there’s a scam.

365
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,080
There must be some fraud

366
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,320
If the secret book really falls into Cao Qiudao's hands,

367
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,120
I'm sure he will kill me and Shanrou then.

368
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,160
Brother Xiang and Miss Shanrou join forces to

369
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,720
Not as good as Cao Qiudao?

370
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,760
If I could beat him, I would have done it long ago

371
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,120
But Cao Qiudao deliberately planned to

372
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,360
The secret to getting the big money is always in your hand

373
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,360
You should learn the sword moves in the secret manual

374
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,640
His martial arts should be stronger than his

375
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,960
The worst thing is that I usually neglect to practice

376
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,280
I told him I have the secret to the three successful powers

377
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,000
He was also lied to

378
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,080
With that said, tomorrow’s battle…

379
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,880
Defeat is inevitable, but it’s okay even if it’s inevitable

380
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,160
I will definitely save Shanrou

381
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,800
Brother Xiang is indeed affectionate and righteous

382
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,560
I will accompany Brother Xiang to the meeting tomorrow.

383
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,080
The strength of the two of us

384
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,640
Maybe we can turn the situation around and turn danger into safety

385
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,720
Instead, I hope you can do me a favor now

386
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,400
Take care of Tingfang for me

387
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,920
If unfortunately something happens to me tomorrow

388
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,440
At least I have you to take care of her for me

389
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,640
But you and Miss Shanrou...

390
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,920
Don't worry, I will find a way

391
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,960
It's better to act by ear now than to die together

392
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,560
This sword has been with me for many years, sharpening iron like clay.

393
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,440
Dealing with Cao Qiudao is better than using an ordinary sword.

394
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,760
No, it's too expensive

395
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,360
I am unable to fight alongside Brother Xiang

396
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,960
I'll borrow this sword from Brother Xiang.

397
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,720
Brother Xiang, don’t turn away people thousands of miles away.

398
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,680
Thanks

399
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,960
I hope I can return the sword to you with my life then.

400
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,480
wind?

401
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,680
All the cloth and pennies are on board.

402
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,360
Thanks

403
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,080
Xiang Shaolong really kept his promise

404
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,760
Where are Xiang Shaolong and Tingfang? How is she now?

405
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,360
Don't worry, she's fine

406
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,920
What’s the secret?

407
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,040
You let her go, hand to hand

408
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,120
good

409
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,960
It is indeed the handiwork of our ancestors

410
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,960
I finally got the secret to the Ju Zi Ling

411
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,440
Cao Qiudao, if you are brave enough, come down and fight me yourself.

412
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,040
I'm not a gentleman at all

413
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,680
My master is Yuan Zong

414
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,280
Since we are all from the same sect, why should we kill each other?

415
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,840
We are also helpless

416
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,560
We have no choice but to obey Ju Zi Ling

417
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,640
The dead soldiers of the Mohists obeyed the orders and killed them all.

418
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,280
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

419
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,640
If you don’t leave a head behind, you can’t even think of leaving.

420
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,920
Cao Qiudao, you don't even let your own disciples go.

421
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,480
Shanrou is really sorry

422
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,480
You have always used me as a killing tool

423
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,920
What is the use of repenting before death?

424
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,320
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

425
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,040
Those who do many injustices will be punished by God

426
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,520
Xiang Shaoxia is right, as a Mohist

427
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,240
You shouldn’t be ignorant of right from wrong and act as a harbinger of evil

428
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,320
Cao Qiudao is basically a traitor to Mo Zhe

429
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,360
He deceived his master and destroyed his ancestors, then killed them quickly

430
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,320
It's a pity that many Mohists have died

431
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,080
Xiang Shaoxia

432
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,640
Go quickly

433
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,240
Search Yes

434
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,000
What to do now?

435
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,680
run forward

436
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,360
Run forward? There is a cliff ahead.

437
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,640
Hold on, get ready, one, two, three

438
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,160
Don't be afraid, hold on tight, you won't fall

439
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,320
Tingfang

440
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,120
Brother Xiang, Tingfang is not dead...

441
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,760
Nothing will happen to me, and I won't let anything happen to you either

442
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,800
I don’t want you to get hurt or worry about me anymore...

443
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,040
My child, now my mother is sewing new clothes for you

444
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,520
I believe it won’t be long before you are born wearing

445
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,520
It must look good

446
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,880
Your father came to see you

447
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,600
Zhu Ji, look who's coming

448
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,760
Mom, you should be careful and take care of yourself when you are pregnant.

449
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,680
No need to be polite, be careful

450
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,640
Mom, please sit down

451
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,960
My mother is about to give birth, so she naturally needs to take care of herself.

452
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,040
Later, the child will be ordered to be an imperial physician.

453
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,040
Prescribe some tonic medicine for my mother

454
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,920
The King really takes good care of the Queen Mother

455
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,440
The Queen Mother is the widow's mother

456
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,280
If a widower doesn’t care about his mother, who should he care about?

457
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,800
It’s just that the child has been busy with political affairs

458
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,840
That’s why you neglect to take care of your mother

459
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,680
Your Majesty, the noble man is really busy with things

460
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,760
From now on, Lao Changxinhou will take more care of the Queen Mother.

461
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,600
Mom wants to give me a good brother

462
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,040
Thank you, Your Majesty, for the tip.

463
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,640
Your Majesty, it's getting late now

464
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,360
You should go back to the palace to do business. Please come back, Your Majesty.

465
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,960
Mom, take a good rest and don’t work too hard.

466
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,680
Your Majesty, the Queen Mother is about to give birth.

467
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,760
I hope the king can come to visit

468
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,400
I am also worried about my mother's condition

469
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,480
Go see her now

470
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,400
Going right away? Your Majesty, don’t you have to deal with political affairs?

471
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,200
Political matters need to be dealt with, and my mother also needs to visit.

472
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,160
It would be better to ask Changxinhou to handle political affairs on my behalf.

473
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,080
So that the few can have time to separate themselves

474
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,600
Should I handle political affairs?

475
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,720
I don’t know what Chang Xin Hou’s intention is?

476
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,400
Lao Ai thinks this is too much for the king to do.

477
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,560
As the king of Qin

478
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,880
Make contributions and consolidate your power

479
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,080
It is his biggest ambition now

480
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,000
How could Ying Zheng be like you?

481
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,560
Give up your power to others

482
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,600
The villain knows that his imitation has shortcomings

483
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,360
Unable to grasp the king’s essence

484
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,280
You have to remember, it’s not just about looks

485
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,560
Even the thoughts and ideas must be exactly the same

486
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,960
right

487
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,680
Now I am tired and want to rest

488
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,800
Marquis Changxin, please retreat first.

489
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,560
This is a bit interesting
