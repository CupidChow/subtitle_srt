1
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,560
I promise you, I will come back alive to see you

2
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,440
Shaolong, I believe

3
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,560
No matter how great the danger you experience

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,120
Your will will conquer everything

5
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,400
You once said, even if God wants us to separate

6
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,960
You also have to go against the will of heaven

7
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,920
Shaolong, I know you will hear me

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,960
you have to be strong

9
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,960
You promised me that you would never die

10
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,560
You will definitely come back to me

11
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,120
I won't die, I must go back to see Ah Qing

12
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,280
Look how unique this hairpin is

13
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,520
It will be on board soon, do you still want to buy it?

14
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,440
You don't know something, ever since we fled

15
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,400
I haven’t been so happy shopping for a long time.

16
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,880
You also said that as soon as you landed, you went shopping here and there.

17
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,360
Sister Feng said that the ship was at the border of Wei State

18
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,160
He only stayed for two hours to replenish supplies for us.

19
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,000
We have to rush to Qi State

20
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,520
I'm just replenishing supplies now

21
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,520
Thanks to my alertness that day, I took advantage of the situation

22
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,000
Become a member of the song and dance troupe

23
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,600
Otherwise we would still be running around today

24
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,880
What do you mean, there are so many places you won’t go to?

25
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,440
I want to come to this song and dance group

26
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,200
Nowadays, people have to sing and practice dancing every day

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,800
This is called hiding in the city

28
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,840
We follow such a famous song and dance group

29
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,200
Swaggering around everywhere

30
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,600
Think about it, how could the killer expect that?

31
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,680
That's true

32
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,600
The busier the place, the safer we are

33
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,320
Why are you talking so much? Hurry up and replenish supplies.

34
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,080
Quickly catch those two Qin deserters, don't run away

35
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,440
Have you found any traces of Xiang Shaolong over there?

36
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,120
No

37
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,560
Let's look for it separately. Okay

38
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,760
Your Majesty, you came uninvited and you don’t know why?

39
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,800
But your Majesty rushed here in a hurry

40
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,680
What's the purpose?

41
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,560
Where do I want to go?

42
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Do we need to know in advance whether the king will succeed?

43
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,640
I don’t dare. We might as well open the skylight and speak frankly.

44
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,880
Your Majesty is on this trip

45
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,320
It was because of the information received from Zhao State

46
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,160
Xiang Shaolong was defeated by Li Mu's army

47
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,600
It is very possible to escape into the territory of Wei

48
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,800
So I came all night to capture Xiang Shaolong.

49
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,600
Did I make a mistake?

50
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,960
Xiang Shaolong was last in the palace

51
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,640
He openly kidnapped the princess of Zhao and brought shame to Wei.

52
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,120
So what if everyone gets it and kills it?

53
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,160
It seems that your Majesty

54
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,840
It’s because Xiang Shaolong stole Lu Gong’s Secret Records

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,200
I feel dissatisfied and want to catch him myself.

56
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,720
Then your Majesty suddenly appeared here

57
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,040
Could it be that I came here for your old acquaintance again?

58
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,600
Your Majesty's words are wrong. Have you forgotten?

59
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,240
I am going to Qi State on the order of the king.

60
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,760
Congratulations to King Qi on his birthday?

61
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,880
Your Majesty is deeply favored by the King

62
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,720
How dare I forget

63
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,320
Since your Majesty has such an important mission,

64
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
Then I don’t dare to delay your trip.

65
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,000
If your Majesty really catches Xiang Shaolong,

66
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,920
Could you please let me know?

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,200
So that I can be happy for your Majesty and take my leave.

68
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,480
General Xiang

69
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,080
General Xiang, why are you here?

70
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,840
There are assassins…

71
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,560
Who are you? Kill him

72
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,120
There is an assassin, search

73
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,280
Report to the king

74
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,480
My subordinates just discovered someone who looks very much like Xiang Shaolong

75
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,040
Are you really sure that person is Xiang Shaolong himself?

76
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,400
I just heard it

77
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,400
The Qin soldiers all called him General Xiang in unison.

78
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,200
Okay, send the order immediately, without my permission

79
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,760
No one is allowed to leave the camp, search

80
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes, everyone, follow me

81
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,280
it's you

82
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,040
It's not a good place to stay for a long time, come with me

83
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,520
Brother Xiang, please

84
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,640
Please, sir

85
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,920
How come I meet you here by such a coincidence?

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,840
That's it

87
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,360
I am sent as an envoy to the State of Qi to congratulate you on your birthday.

88
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,600
I didn't expect to see you here

89
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,480
I'm really ashamed to say it

90
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,360
If I hadn't lost the battle, I wouldn't be here

91
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,720
Your Majesty, do you have any news about Qicheng?

92
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,920
Brother Xiang, you can rest assured

93
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,680
Although Wucheng fell into Li Mu's hands,

94
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,160
Because Wang Jian's army arrived in time,

95
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,440
Under the confrontation between the two sides

96
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,400
Li Mu also did not dare to rush forward with his troops.

97
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,880
The crisis on your country’s border has finally been resolved for the time being.

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,760
Then I'll be relieved

99
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,960
Your Majesty, I just heard you say

100
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,760
Will your ship be bound for Qi?

101
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
If Brother Xiang doesn’t dislike it

102
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,360
I can personally give Brother Xiang a ride

103
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
I really don’t know how to thank you sir

104
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,920
Brother Xiang is serious

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,880
Have the opportunity to chat with Brother Xiang over wine

106
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,400
I don't know how happy I am, but it's a pity...

107
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,520
Your Majesty is of good character, kind-hearted, and powerful.

108
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,480
I believe you will find your perfect one soon

109
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,040
Don't say spoiler words

110
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
As the saying goes, when you meet a close friend, a thousand cups is too little.

111
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,520
Brother Xiang takes a break here

112
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,640
Wait for me to go out and get some jugs of wine.

113
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,800
Drinking with Brother Xiang

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,960
Your Majesty, this is incredible

115
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,280
What's all the fuss about?

116
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,560
Returning to your Majesty, Lord Xinling brought a large army of soldiers and horses.

117
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
He said he wanted to capture Qin’s spies

118
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,040
Now they are forcing people to board the ship and search them.

119
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,840
Is this really happening?

120
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,480
Your Majesty, we have…

121
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,400
Xinlingjun

122
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,800
You seem to be paying less and less attention to me.

123
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,680
I only want to capture Qin’s spy Xiang Shaolong

124
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,680
If there is any offense, please forgive me, Mr. Long Yang.

125
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,520
Goddamn

126
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,040
How can I harbor Qin spies on my ship?

127
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,920
I see that you are clearly deliberately trying to make things difficult for me.

128
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,400
no matter what you say

129
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,520
In short, Xiang Shaolong is a repeat offender of the imperial court.

130
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,880
I must catch him. Who is coming?

131
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,640
search ship

132
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,160
Be bold, who dares to search my ship without permission?

133
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,920
I will chop off his head first

134
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,120
Long Yangjun obeys orders

135
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,320
Long Yangjun is here

136
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,680
This is the gold medal given by the King

137
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
May I ask Mr. Long Yang if he still wants to stop me from searching the ship?

138
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,640
Long Yangjun doesn’t dare

139
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,760
I'm sorry you don't dare. Someone comes to search the ship. Yes

140
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
don't want

141
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,400
don't want

142
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,400
Deal with some old clothes

143
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,400
Why does Lord Xinling need to work so hard?

144
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,040
If it were just a few old clothes

145
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Why was Long Yangjun so nervous just now?

146
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,040
These clothes were given by the king

147
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,880
I am just worried about Lord Xinling

148
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,760
How to explain to the king

149
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,040
The suspect jumped into the water and escaped

150
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,080
Shooting arrows is

151
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,960
Immediately launch the boat into the water to chase

152
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,560
Listen up, everyone, if you catch this person, shoot him without mercy.

153
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,520
yes

154
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,360
Qin Tai Fu

155
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,000
The sun is going down soon, let's go back

156
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,360
I want to wait a little longer

157
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,720
Qin Tai Fu

158
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,760
There's no way you can wait here every day.

159
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,320
General Xiang...

160
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,720
Shaolong promised that he would come back

161
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,400
He'll be fine

162
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,880
These lucky stars are the ones Shaolong taught me to fold

163
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,560
He said it would bring me good luck

164
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,360
So I know he must be fine

165
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
He will definitely come back

166
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,480
Taifu, please stop doing this

167
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
Yes, Mr. Qin, don’t worry

168
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,880
General Xiang is blessed with great fortune and fortune, and he will definitely be a lucky man and a good fortune.

169
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,920
Maybe he will come back tomorrow

170
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
Really? You won’t lie to me?

171
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,600
Trust me, I'll go back with you and rest first

172
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,160
You don’t want to see General Xiang tomorrow with a tired face, do you?

173
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,880
Shaolong will not lie to me

174
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,640
He must come back safe and sound

175
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
You buy so many things every time you dock

176
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,440
Now you are the mainstay of the song and dance troupe

177
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,840
Don’t buy more gold and silver jewelry, rouge and gouache

178
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,120
How can you be worthy of our sister Feng Fei?

179
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Also, it’s all because of you

180
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,960
That's why I dress like this

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,120
How good is this

182
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,560
I was at the market just now

183
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,880
Those people were so anxious to catch the Qin spies

184
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,000
Who is he?

185
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,960
Why were so many Wei soldiers dispatched?

186
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,200
Stop being troublesome and get on the boat quickly.

187
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,760
Be careful, Sister Feng is not waiting for us

188
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,000
Don't worry, how dare she wait for you?

189
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,000
put him down

190
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,760
Is he dead?

191
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,680
Still breathing

192
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,400
Xiang Shaolong

193
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,640
Shanrou, how is he?

194
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,640
Is he seriously injured? Will he die?

195
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,560
You ask this question in one breath, how should I answer you?

196
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,160
How injured was he?

197
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,000
He was injured so badly last time and survived.

198
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,600
It shouldn't be so easy to die this time

199
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,520
Why don't you discuss it with Sister Feng?

200
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,080
Find a doctor on shore

201
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,200
If you want Sister Feng to drive the three of us off the boat,

202
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,840
You can just ask her

203
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,160
It seems that you care about Brother Xiang very much

204
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,280
Where did you go?

205
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,320
He already has a confidante

206
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,320
What relationship do I have with him?

207
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
It’s better if you tell the truth

208
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,680
good and gentle

209
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,000
Tingfang

210
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,920
You got the wrong person

211
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,520
I am not Tingfang, my name is Fengfei

212
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,960
Now that he's awake, I'm out

213
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,440
Tingfang

214
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,640
Your wound hurts badly

215
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,160
If you want to heal quickly, don't move

216
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,440
What happened?

217
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,200
How come you are with her?

218
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,000
It's a long story

219
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,440
Anyway, what happened to her?

220
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,720
I really don't know

221
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,680
But it won't be a good thing

222
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,600
It's all my fault, I hurt her

223
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,880
If it weren't for me, she wouldn't be like this

224
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,880
It's not too late for you to realize your mistake now

225
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,360
But she refused to recognize it was Tingfang

226
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,280
As the saying goes, nothing is difficult in the world, only those who are willing can

227
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,720
You have all met, there will always be opportunities in the future

228
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,360
The most important thing is what you think

229
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,600
See the king

230
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,760
Mr. Qin is ill, so there is no need to be polite.

231
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,520
I want the king to come to Yashe in person

232
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,400
Qin Qing really can't afford it

233
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,200
Mrs. Qin is too serious

234
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,120
The most important thing right now is to take good care of your body

235
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,320
Otherwise, when Taifu Xiang comes back...

236
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,920
It's been so long and there's still no news from him

237
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
I'm just afraid that he has...

238
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,640
Silly girl

239
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,360
Young dragon is blessed with good fortune and will be fine.

240
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,120
Mr. Zou is right

241
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,600
I have sent people around to make inquiries.

242
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,280
As soon as there is news about Taifu Xiang,

243
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,560
I will inform Mrs. Qin immediately

244
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,560
You don't have to worry too much

245
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,720
Since Shaolong promised you

246
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,200
He will definitely come back to see you

247
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,280
If it weren't for Lu Buwei's obstruction,

248
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,840
Forcibly mobilize troops and horses, and the city will not be lost.

249
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Taifu Xiang will not...

250
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,040
In short, I am absolutely confident

251
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,320
Taifu Xiang will definitely be able to return to Xianyang safely

252
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,600
Join me and deal with this old fox Lu Buwei

253
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,800
stop…

254
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,480
Fengfei, what happened to you today? All the dances were wrong.

255
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,120
Forget it, I won’t schedule it for now, let’s take a rest.

256
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,640
Tingfang

257
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,560
I told you

258
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,720
My name is Fengfei, not Tingfang as you called me

259
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,600
Who are you? Why haven't I seen you?

260
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,800
Sister Feng, I forgot to tell you

261
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,640
This is a fellow villager of our sisters, his name is Aaron

262
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,800
How could a fellow countryman be on my boat?

263
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,720
That's it

264
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,400
Our fellow villager is being hunted by the enemy

265
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,960
We met him at the ferry

266
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,400
A fellow villager, so I left him behind

267
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,360
You don’t mind, do you? Sister Feng

268
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,040
Do you want me to take him in?

269
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,640
What do you think my boat is? An inn?

270
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,120
What should I do if an enemy comes to my door?

271
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,800
No way

272
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,000
As long as he leaves the border of Wei State, he will be safe

273
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,120
I see

274
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,040
Just now, so many officers and soldiers from Wei State were searching

275
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,800
Turns out I wanted to find you

276
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,840
If you want me to take him in, I will be beheaded.

277
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,720
No way

278
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,240
Sorry, if your ship docks, I will leave

279
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,080
It's none of my business, he said he wanted to leave

280
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,520
Since Aaron is leaving, let's go together

281
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,520
What?

282
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,040
I remember Sister Feng said

283
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,400
When you go out to travel in the world, you must be loyal.

284
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,080
We sisters once promised this Aaron

285
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,560
Take him in no matter what

286
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,360
Now I have broken my trust

287
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
How else can we meet people?

288
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,840
Aaron, let's go, Fengfei

289
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,520
No, you can't leave

290
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,400
How can I explain to King Qi after I leave?

291
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,840
In short, if you want to leave, let’s go together. If you want to stay, let’s stay together.

292
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,480
The three of us are of the same mind

293
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,680
I'm really pissed off, forget it...

294
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,480
If you want to stay, just keep enough.

295
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,680
I tell you, arrange this dance carefully

296
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,320
Got it, Sister Feng, I said Sister Feng is loyal

297
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,840
Tingfang

298
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,520
What? It’s hard to sleep thinking about others?

299
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,000
Why should I not be able to sleep because of him?

300
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,000
How do you know who I'm talking about?

301
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,240
Now I'm very annoyed

302
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,880
It's so rare to meet, so why are you bothered?

303
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,000
You didn't object to him getting on the boat just now.

304
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,120
Prove that you still remember him in your heart

305
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,920
Anyway I don't know what to do?

306
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,840
Tingfang

307
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,320
I go to the deck

308
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,040
Take your own chances

309
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,640
Tingfang

310
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,400
I hope you will remember well, my name is Fengfei

311
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,000
You are obviously Wu Tingfang

312
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,920
Why do you want to call yourself Fengfei?

313
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,920
I don't know what your relationship is with this Wu Tingfang

314
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,520
In short, I am definitely not the person you say you are.

315
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,960
I hope you won’t admit the wrong person again in the future

316
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,080
Okay, you don’t have to admit it

317
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,360
But one thing will never change

318
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,240
sorry…

319
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,200
I accidentally put this mark on that day.

320
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,440
Even if you don’t recognize yourself as Wu Tingfang

321
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,800
But this seal will never change

322
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,400
will never disappear

323
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,840
Tingfang

324
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,760
So what if I am Wu Tingfang?

325
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:33,320
Will you keep your promise and marry me?

326
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,200
You are speechless because in your heart

327
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,040
I never thought about getting married to Wu Tingfang

328
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,240
In that case, why do you have to force me to admit it?

329
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,480
Tingfang, can you listen to me?

330
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,280
There is another person waiting for you to go back in Xianyang City

331
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,960
Qin Tai Fu

332
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,040
Is Shaolong back?

333
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,200
Qin Tai Fu

334
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,600
Brother Teng, where is Shaolong? Is he back?

335
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,680
Hasn’t Shaolong been with you all the time?

336
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,880
The city fell that day

337
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,680
We were chased by Li Mu's army

338
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,040
My eldest brother and I split up and evacuated halfway.

339
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,760
I thought eldest brother would have come back a long time ago

340
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,200
Qin Tai Fu…

341
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,880
Does your Majesty want to increase military pay?

342
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,800
This is what I mean

343
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,360
Does Prime Minister Lu have any objections?

344
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,120
Please forgive me for speaking frankly. Since the king ascended the throne,

345
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,640
Different taxes have been increased successively

346
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,360
Now we are rashly increasing military pay

347
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,400
I'm afraid it will deepen public resentment

348
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,200
Damn it, now the six countries are eyeing our great Qin.

349
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,440
The war is about to break out

350
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,600
If we don’t increase our troops and armaments as soon as possible,

351
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:34,200
In order to fight against foreign enemies, do we, the Qin Dynasty, need to be treated like mermaids?

352
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,440
According to what the king said, it seems inevitable

353
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,360
That being the case

354
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,400
Why does the king need to seek the opinions of his ministers?

355
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,200
I have summoned all the members of the Qing family to brainstorm ideas.

356
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,720
Few people believe that except Prime Minister Lu

357
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,800
Dear friends, what do you think about the increase in military pay?

358
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,560
Everyone has different opinions

359
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,920
Your Majesty, the so-called strike first

360
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,240
Latecomers are controlled by others

361
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,720
Since a war is inevitable

362
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,840
For the well-being of the Qin Dynasty, Wei Chen believes that

363
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,680
The issue of increasing military pay cannot be delayed without delay

364
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Your Majesty, in my humble opinion

365
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,280
What Li Taishi said is not unreasonable.

366
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,360
Your Majesty, the general also feels the same way

367
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,840
Unknown General Meng…

368
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,320
Since no one objects to it

369
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,640
How dare I have any objections?

370
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,600
That's best

371
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,080
Li Si, immediately draw up the details of collecting military pay.

372
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,280
The sooner this is implemented, the better

373
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,000
是, 大王

374
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,800
Retreat from the court

375
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,400
Your Majesty, Your Majesty is indeed diligent and caring for the people.

376
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,880
A widower is the king of a country

377
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,360
Of course, we must put the country first in everything.

378
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,760
That's right, the so-called family can rule the country and bring peace to the world.

379
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,440
It is important to care about national affairs

380
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,160
But I only care about state affairs

381
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,920
And make the housework into a mess

382
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,040
I'm just afraid of being laughed at by all the people in the world

383
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Can Prime Minister Lu understand what he said?

384
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,160
Please forgive me for not being able to speak clearly.

385
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,320
It’s just that King Ruoran still hasn’t dealt with this matter.

386
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,920
a few more months

387
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,960
I'm afraid the king will have an extra brother-in-law for nothing.

388
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,000
The alias brother?

389
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,840
May the king be blessed

390
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,080
Where is the Queen Mother?

391
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,120
Back to your Majesty, the Queen Mother has just gone to bed.

392
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,520
Going to bed so early?

393
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,400
Is the Queen Mother okay?

394
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,880
The king wants to see the queen mother, please wait for the slave to pass the message first

395
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,640
No need, I can just go in by myself.

396
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,560
Imperial physician, Zhao Gao is here

397
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,000
You two go in with the widower

398
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,280
Everyone else will leave

399
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,440
Wang Er greets the Queen Mother

400
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,640
Your Majesty, you don’t need to be polite

401
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,560
The Queen Mother goes to bed so early

402
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,440
Could it be that he is ill?

403
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,240
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty. I am fine.

404
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,800
No, the Queen Mother's noble body is contrary to harmony

405
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,440
How can we ignore it? The imperial doctor is here

406
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,080
Why don't you diagnose and treat the Queen Mother quickly?

407
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,240
How is it? Is the Queen Mother in good health?

408
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,040
Kaidaiou, Hiroshi…

409
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,760
Damn it, I asked you what disease the Queen Mother is suffering from?

410
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,480
you hesitate

411
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,360
Do you want someone to kill you before you say it?

412
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,960
I don’t dare to do my humble job. The Queen Mother is not sick, but...

413
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,160
Say it quickly

414
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,520
pregnant

415
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,440
If you are pregnant, you will really congratulate the Queen Mother

416
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,840
I know that I am guilty of death

417
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,640
If you want to behead or kill, please do as you please, Your Majesty.

418
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,560
The Queen Mother's words are wrong.

419
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,240
It is a great joy for the Queen Mother to be pregnant

420
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,640
What's the crime? Zhao Gao is here

421
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,800
starting from today

422
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,840
All matters big and small in Dazheng Palace

423
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,960
are solely your responsibility

424
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,480
Any idle person, without the approval of me

425
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,960
No entry or exit is allowed, you know?

426
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,640
The slave obeys the order

427
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
Your Majesty, you…

428
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,760
The Queen Mother can rest assured that I am not a heartless person.

429
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,280
The Queen Mother can rest peacefully in Dazheng Palace

430
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,320
I can guarantee

431
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,360
When she grows up, she will definitely give birth to a fat and white baby

432
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,880
I also want to see it with my own eyes

433
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,440
Who does my nominal brother look like?

434
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,600
Next

435
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,360
What I'm asking for is a hit.

436
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,800
If you miss a hit, there is only one way to die.

437
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,280
The villain knows...

438
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,960
Sir, the king has just sent someone here

439
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,680
He said that he had something important to do and asked the Marquis to come to the palace as soon as possible to discuss it.

440
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,360
The king wants me to escort Prime Minister Lu

441
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,080
Go to inspect the Great Wall construction site

442
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,360
Could it be that there is something difficult about Marquis Changxin?

443
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,720
In fact, there are many people who are qualified for this job.

444
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,040
Why does the king have to have me escort him?

445
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,760
Marquis Changxin doesn’t know something

446
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,600
Prime Minister Lu is the target of public criticism in the court.

447
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,880
If someone plots a plot on the way,

448
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,880
It’s really hard to defeat ordinary guards alone.

449
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,120
Prime Minister Lu has always had opinions on this prince.

450
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,360
I'm afraid he may not be willing to let me escort him

451
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Chang Xinhou can rest assured about this matter.

452
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,760
I have made it clear to Prime Minister Lu

453
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,560
This time Chang Xinhou

454
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,440
I went to inspect the Great Wall construction site on behalf of the widow.

455
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,080
Therefore, Lu Cheng relatively trusted the Marquis

456
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,760
There will never be the slightest doubt

457
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,360
The king means...

458
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,440
Idiot means

459
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,000
If Marquis Changxin can successfully protect the safety of Prime Minister Lu

460
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,520
Of course it's a good thing

461
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,960
But if something happens suddenly

462
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,320
and cause any death or injury

463
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,720
I will never blame Marquis Changxin

464
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,280
Chang Xin Hou can proceed with confidence

465
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,720
I will do my best

466
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,160
The king will not be disappointed

467
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,840
What are you doing?

468
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,480
Changxinhou, what does this mean?

469
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,920
I am following the king's orders

470
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,480
I want to convey a message to Prime Minister Lu

471
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,200
Your Majesty, if you have anything to say, please convey it to the Marquis.

472
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,520
The king asks you not to blame him for being ruthless, kill him

473
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,880
Sure enough, he has the air of a general

474
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,960
You can still laugh at this time

475
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,600
Lao Ai…

476
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,480
The truth is that you were smart all your life, but you made a mistake in one moment

477
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,640
It's not me who's going to die today, it's you

478
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,080
Zhao Gao, please retreat first.

479
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,080
Yes, Your Majesty

480
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,880
Queen Mother, you haven’t drunk it yet

481
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,240
I don’t know what kind of medicine the king wants me to take.

482
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,000
The Queen Mother is so hesitant

483
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,480
Could it be that I thought I would poison the soup?

484
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,240
I dare not

485
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,320
Don't hide it from the Queen Mother

486
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,040
I learned yesterday that the Queen Mother is pregnant

487
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,520
I couldn't sleep all night, thinking about it all night

488
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,520
The Queen Mother would like to know

489
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,520
What is it that is haunting the widow?

490
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,120
I would like to hear the details

491
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,320
I am thinking

492
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,120
Should we allow the birth of a bastard in the Queen Mother's womb?

493
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,120
King

494
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,440
Originally, I also wanted to see it with my own eyes.

495
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,720
Is this wild species similar to Lao Ai?

496
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,960
But I thought about it

497
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,160
Cheng Xi's rebellion

498
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,880
Let me get a lot of inspiration

499
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,400
If the matter is not eradicated as soon as possible,

500
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,960
It often only leads to endless troubles

501
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,480
But the Queen Mother can rest assured

502
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,680
I never want to be condemned by the world

503
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,240
Saying that a widower is unfilial

504
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,480
Therefore, I will never touch the Queen Mother in the slightest.

505
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,120
Just a bastard in the Queen Mother's belly

506
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,400
I will never allow him to exist in the world

507
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,880
As long as the Queen Mother drinks this bowl of soup

508
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,120
There will no longer be such a bastard in this world

509
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,920
All problems can be solved easily

510
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,320
No, Your Majesty, I beg you

511
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,200
You showed great mercy and spared the flesh and blood in my belly

512
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,000
King, I beg you

513
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,360
You don't care about your status

514
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,120
To do such an immoral and scandalous thing

515
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,360
If I hadn't thought about the love between mother and son,

516
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,640
I've cut you, a bitch, into pieces long ago.

517
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,960
I now order you to drink this bowl of soup

518
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,960
No, my lord, I beg you

519
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,680
who?

520
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,440
King Qi, something happened to Marquis Changxin

521
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,040
Something happened to Lao Ai?

522
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,280
Lao Ai wants to assassinate Prime Minister Lu?

523
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,120
Fortunately, I am blessed with good luck and good fortune.

524
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,400
Otherwise, he would have been killed by the sword of the counter-servant Lao Ai.

525
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,280
Why did Lao Ai want to assassinate Prime Minister Lu?

526
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,160
Back to your Majesty, this person is quite tough-tongued.

527
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,160
No matter how much the ministers tortured me, they never said a word

528
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,800
However, Prime Minister Lu believes that

529
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,040
What should be done with this person

530
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,520
General Meng

531
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,680
I dare to ask, what is the crime for trying to assassinate an official of the imperial court?

532
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,160
According to the laws of Qin State

533
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,440
Lao Ai intends to assassinate the imperial minister

534
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,000
Deservable to be quartered by five horses

535
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,080
Those who conspire with him should also be killed

536
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,200
Collusion? Didn’t Prime Minister Lu just say that?

537
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,920
Did Lao Ai insist on not confessing?

538
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,480
Wei Chen doesn't believe it

539
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,640
We will use severe torture to extract confessions

540
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,640
Lao Ai dare not recruit the conspirators, unless...

541
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,800
Prime Minister Lu is right

542
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,240
Lao Ai committed a heinous crime

543
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,840
He should be sentenced to death immediately and cut into pieces.

544
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,120
Your Majesty, please don’t cut Lao Ai’s five horses into pieces.

545
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,560
Queen Mother

546
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,560
It was me who asked Lao Ai to kill Prime Minister Lu.

547
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,240
If you want to kill me, then kill me

548
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,120
Damn it, the so-called state-owned laws and family rules

549
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,000
Not to mention a mere Changxinhou

550
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,960
Prime Minister Lu, I beg you as my wife

551
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,960
You give Lao Ai a way out

552
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,360
Now he is the one who wants to put the truth to death

553
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,320
How can I, Lu Buwei, spare this man?

554
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,200
Prime Minister Lu

555
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,360
Just remember that Zhu Ji once served you

556
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,800
Let Lao Ai go

557
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,840
Who does the Queen Mother think Lu Buwei is now?

558
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,320
If only a few words from the Queen Mother

559
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,200
I, Lu Buwei, will spare this person

560
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,840
How can the truth convince the public from now on?

561
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,200
Your Majesty, please have a nice word with Prime Minister Lu

562
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,120
Let Lao Ai go, Your Majesty

563
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,760
I'm out of sight

564
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,360
Whether you want to kill or release

565
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,240
Let Prime Minister Lu execute everything

566
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,320
King…

567
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,200
Prime Minister Lu, I beg you, please spare Lao Ai

568
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,360
General Meng, tomorrow the rebels will be cut into pieces.

569
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,480
No, Prime Minister Lu

570
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:37,200
Prime Minister Lu, don’t…

571
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,760
Queen Mother…

572
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:22,480
How about it? Doesn’t it feel good to be a prisoner?

573
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,680
Lao Ai, now your martial arts skills are completely useless

574
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,480
Are there any other tricks you want to play against Ben?

575
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,680
You'd better kill me, otherwise you will regret it

576
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,120
You really have a lot of backbone, but don't worry

577
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,520
The truth will not let you die so cheaply

578
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,360
I want you to live worse than death

579
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,360
What do you want?

580
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,720
Lao Ai, how dare you steal my woman?

581
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,760
Now I just want to see the real thing

582
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,520
What skills do you have in the future?

583
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,600
You can have fun with that bitch again

584
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,560
Castrate him for me Yes

585
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,440
Lao Ai, see you in the next life

586
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,680
Madam...amazing

587
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,800
Lao Ai

588
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,520
Lao Ai...how could this happen?

589
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,520
Lao Ai…

590
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,920
You're still standing still, go get the medicine

591
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,520
Yes, Queen Mother

592
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,320
Lao Ai, please answer me

593
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,400
What happened? Lao Ai

594
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:12,040
Lao Ai, do you know?

595
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,160
No matter how you become

596
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,480
I will always love you

597
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:32,000
Promise me, for me and our flesh and blood

598
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,560
You must not die

599
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,200
Lao Ai

600
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,400
Lao Ai

601
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,520
don't want
