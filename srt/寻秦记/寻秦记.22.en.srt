1
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Xiang Shaoxia is polite

2
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,560
No need to be polite, it's just you and me here

3
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,680
Just tell me if you have something to say

4
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,200
It’s been a long time since Xiang Shaoxia, I didn’t expect him to be so impatient

5
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The king entrusted him with the important task of capturing Zhao Mu alive on the day he returned to the country.

6
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,520
It is also the time when you have made great contributions to Qin

7
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,840
It's really gratifying

8
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,280
Are you mocking or complimenting?

9
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,360
If you want to capture Zhao Mu alive, you have to do it wisely, not with force.

10
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,760
I also know this, but how to outwit it?

11
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,000
When I was his swordsman

12
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,200
I learned a big secret about him

13
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,480
Although he is the Marquis of the State of Zhao,

14
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,840
But the real identity is

15
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,920
The illegitimate son of Lord Chun Shen of Chu State

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,360
Such twists and turns, filming?

17
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,600
He has established power in Zhao for many years

18
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,520
There is only one purpose, which is to harm Zhao Guozhongliang

19
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,040
So that Chu State can take advantage of it

20
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,400
So what?

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,040
As long as you master his secret

22
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,640
You can falsely claim to be the secret envoy of Chu State

23
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,280
Gain his trust and then capture him alive

24
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,560
Why are you helping me? Don’t you hate me?

25
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,240
Yes, I hate you

26
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,800
That day you took away my love and destroyed my right hand

27
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,920
I wish I could tear you into pieces

28
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,480
But I have thought it through today

29
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,240
Fall in love, can't force it

30
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,680
I also respect Fang'er's decision

31
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,840
In fact, the person who owes me the most is not Fang'er, but Zhao Mu

32
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,520
Do you like men's?

33
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,360
The so-called scholar dies for a confidant

34
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,920
The friendship between men

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,360
More valuable than the personal relationship between children

36
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,240
I was appreciated by Zhao Mu and thought I had found a confidant

37
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,760
So I have always been devoted to him and loyal to him.

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,200
Who knew that after I was hurt by you?

39
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
He kicked me out of the house

40
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,480
As a result, I fell into the world, I must avenge this

41
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,320
Zhao Mu is the common enemy of you and me

42
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,000
I hope Taifu Xiang’s trip can avenge my previous shame.

43
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,720
Zhao Mu is Chun Shenjun’s illegitimate son?

44
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,640
Are the sources correct?

45
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,880
The person who tells me should be reliable

46
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,080
There is a sealed letter here, which was obtained from Zhao Mu's Mansion.

47
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,040
It was written by Chun Shenjun to Zhao Mu

48
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,080
The letter has Chun Shenjun's seal on it

49
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,320
Mr. Xiang, you can see if the seal is real.

50
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,760
Sure enough, exactly the same

51
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,600
Can I have Chun Shenjun’s seal?

52
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,040
It seems that the relationship between the two of them is really not simple.

53
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,800
Even if it's not his illegitimate child

54
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,520
It seems that he must be a spy from Chu State.

55
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,880
God helps me to have this opportunity

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,680
It would be even easier for the Tutor to capture Zhao Mu alive.

57
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,840
This is not necessarily the case. Zhao Guo is now looking for me.

58
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,080
I'm afraid I'll be caught before I get to Zhao Mu

59
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,600
In this case, why doesn't Taifu pretend to be safe?

60
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,760
Disguise?

61
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,360
Okay, that's a great idea indeed.

62
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,680
The master's ranch has many good horses

63
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,320
It's really easy for Brother Xiang to disguise himself as a horse dealer

64
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,840
It's easy to borrow some horses from the castle owner

65
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,200
Do you think it's easy for me to pretend to be someone else?

66
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,440
Shaolong, you can rest assured on this

67
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,840
Tao Fang is a master of disguise

68
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,720
No, are you a master of disguise?

69
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,720
I haven't played this tune for a long time.

70
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,120
I hope I can help you get through this time

71
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,280
That's my trouble, thank you...

72
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,120
No need to be polite

73
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,640
Guess who I can pretend to be?

74
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,720
Xiang Xiongjie doesn’t mind…

75
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,440
I don’t mind...the most important thing is to dress up...

76
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,600
Just be talented and handsome.

77
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,840
What's going on?

78
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,480
Brother Xiang’s body shape and facial features

79
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,320
Somewhat similar to Dong Kuang, the horse madman from Chu State

80
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,360
Who is Dong Kuang?

81
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,640
Yes, Shaolong, Dong Kuang is the horse madman of Chu State

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,680
But this person lives in seclusion

83
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,800
Few people have seen his true face

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,720
Shaolong will play the role of Chu envoy this time

85
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,600
Dong Kuang happened to be from the Chu state. What a coincidence.

86
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,560
I thought there was something special about Mr. Tao

87
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,680
Turns out you can just stick on some beard and put on a hat for me

88
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,000
I really don't want to see it

89
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,160
If I don't know how to change the sound

90
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,080
Isn't he dead?

91
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,200
What is the best way?

92
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,160
My name is Dong Kuang

93
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,320
My name is…

94
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,960
My name is Dong Kuang

95
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,080
Is this okay?

96
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Who are you?

97
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,080
Who are you?

98
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,800
If you don't say anything, I'll call you

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,280
I'm here to have a bridal chamber with you today

100
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,560
Don't come over

101
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,720
Don't pull out the knife. If you have something to say, please tell me.

102
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,560
you go away

103
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,520
If you have something to say, don't you recognize me?

104
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,880
Don't come over

105
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,040
you listen to me

106
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,720
Are you still here...it's me, I'm Brother Xiang

107
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,880
Brother Xiang?

108
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,200
Yeah, just to play with you, you just pull out the knife and bite me

109
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,440
I don't recognize you, and you said something frivolous

110
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
He's as timid as a rat, even if he's joking

111
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,600
You know that I am too timid to be frightened

112
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,240
You still make such a joke?

113
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,640
Did you really not recognize me just now?

114
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,000
Manager Tao is really good at it

115
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,440
Just stick on some facial hair and you guys can be fooled.

116
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,000
Could it be that ancient people were really easily deceived?

117
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Brother Xiang

118
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,520
Why are you acting like this?

119
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,520
I'm going to capture Zhao Mu

120
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,000
Zhao Mu came to Qin?

121
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,040
No, I haven't told you yet

122
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,160
The King of Qin ordered me to return to the Kingdom of Zhao to capture Zhao Mu.

123
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,600
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

124
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,480
Yes, I also know there is danger

125
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,440
But Pan'er begged again and again

126
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,920
You want me to capture Zhao Mu to avenge his mother

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,360
So I decided to go and discussed with the castle owner

128
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,480
He said I look like Dong Kuang

129
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,120
So I dressed up like this

130
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,560
But if you return to Zhao alone, if you are recognized by Zhao Mu...

131
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,640
No way, you and I see each other day and night

132
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
You can’t recognize it’s me, let alone Zhao Mu

133
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,760
If you haven’t seen me once in ten years, you won’t recognize me.

134
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,520
Will the king send troops to protect you?

135
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,440
It would be nice if there was

136
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,760
This way I can openly lead my troops to capture Zhao Mu

137
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,880
No need to have a beard all over your face

138
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,360
but…

139
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,080
Needless to say, don’t worry

140
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,920
Your elder brother Xiang is blessed with great fortune and will be fine.

141
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,200
The nearby area is the most dangerous pass in the northwest of Daqin.

142
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,440
Going further north will be the closest to the forces of Rong and Di.

143
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,880
Rong Di?

144
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,720
The Rongdin people are nomadic people who live in pursuit of water and grass.

145
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,000
He is fierce by nature and often crosses the border to the south.

146
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,400
In order to guard against them, as early as the period of the previous kings

147
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,440
He ordered people to build the Great Wall to resist

148
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,120
With the Great Wall, you won’t have to worry about anything.

149
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,760
Concentrate on dealing with the Six Nations

150
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,640
After the world is unified

151
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,120
It can also connect the Great Wall of Yan and Zhao countries

152
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,480
Became the once-continuous Great Wall

153
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,120
The Great Wall is really great

154
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,680
I hope my dream can be realized in the hands of the prince

155
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,080
Such a difficult task

156
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,680
I'm afraid it would take a very capable king to complete it.

157
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,520
The prince is also a capable man

158
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,440
But I may not inherit the throne of the king

159
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,240
As long as the prince is ambitious and determined,

160
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,720
The ministers gave a word of caution, and the people were at the mercy of the prince.

161
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,680
The government and the people are united

162
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,240
Not far from this great cause

163
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,000
What the Prime Minister said makes sense, our Da Qin is so powerful

164
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,520
The prime minister takes the greatest credit

165
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,200
The prince is so complimentary, prince, please

166
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,480
Prince, this is part of the Great Wall

167
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,960
catch the prince

168
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,520
Kill them all

169
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,720
The prince was frightened

170
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,760
Summoned Taifu Xiang and ordered him to enter the palace to protect him.

171
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,640
Take orders

172
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,840
Prince, please rest assured, as long as Lao Ai is here

173
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,680
I will try my best to protect the prince

174
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,560
The prince will not be harmed in the slightest

175
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,320
Thank you Lai Warriors for coming to the rescue.

176
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,640
The brave warrior is the beloved general of Prime Minister Lu

177
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,920
I dare not ask my warrior to bother me

178
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,320
The prime minister’s subordinates are also the prince’s subordinates

179
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,960
Taifu Xiang will go to Zhao State soon

180
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,120
The prince really needs someone to protect him

181
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,720
Wedge position?

182
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,240
The wedge position means that I will cling to you while I am not around.

183
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,760
hope for prosperity and wealth

184
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,360
Does Master think Lian Jin can be trusted?

185
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,640
This guy has ulterior motives. I believe he will die even if he is 10% sure.

186
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,080
But I think he won’t harm you for the time being.

187
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,560
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

188
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,280
I often worry that he will leak my secrets

189
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,920
Then you don't need to panic, he may be more panicked than you

190
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,480
He's not really Lao Ai either

191
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,440
Master also makes sense

192
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,400
But he only has one life, if he risked it...

193
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,160
You don’t need to be scared, Lu Buwei trusts you now

194
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,080
But what Lian Jin was most worried about was Lu Buwei.

195
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,240
If there is really any trouble by then,

196
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,520
You just told Lu Buwei

197
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,400
It’s not too late to borrow Lu Buwei’s hand to kill him

198
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,440
Besides, Lian Jin is very smart.

199
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,440
I think he didn't get any benefits before

200
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,000
He won't act rashly

201
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,520
I will leave as soon as possible and return as soon as possible

202
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,120
Master, you have to be more careful

203
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,160
Don't worry, I still want to save my life

204
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,680
Watch you ascend the throne and become a king

205
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,360
Master must capture this thief Zhao Mu alive.

206
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
Zheng'er wants to kill him with his own hands

207
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,040
To make Zhao Mu believe that Dong Kuang is the secret envoy of Chu State

208
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,560
There must be a personal and confidential letter from Chun Shenjun recommending Dong Kuang.

209
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,760
The villain pays homage to the prime minister

210
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
Li Si?

211
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,080
Xiang Taifu

212
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,560
Do you two know each other?

213
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,320
Yes, I have seen him before in Daliang, Wei State

214
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,600
Have you really come to Qin?

215
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,600
yes

216
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,720
You are absolutely right to come to Qin. Qin’s national power is strong

217
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,600
Unifying the world is a must

218
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,160
If a man wants to make a difference, he should come to Qin

219
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,880
Yes, he is right, you have a bright future

220
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,920
Has the secret letter been written?

221
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,640
Ready, Mr. Xiang

222
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,760
Please take a look at it

223
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,480
Okay, it's really like photocopying

224
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,640
Sure enough, exactly the same

225
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,120
I believe that Chun Shenjun himself would have a hard time telling the truth from the false.

226
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,200
The Prime Minister is so complimentary, it’s just a small trick.

227
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Mr. Xiang and I have some important matters to discuss. Please step back for now.

228
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,520
Yes, Mr. Xiang, Mr. Xiang, I will take my leave first.

229
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
So quiet, are you thinking?

230
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,280
Brother Xiang, farewell to Daliang, Brother Xiang has become the Tutor

231
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,120
Now I have a heavy responsibility again, which is gratifying

232
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,000
Do you think I really want to do it?

233
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,280
If I could choose, I'd really rather go home

234
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,320
There is no greater criticism than being humble, and there is no greater sorrow than poverty.

235
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,440
Brother Xiang's meteoric rise

236
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,200
Of course, I don’t understand the bitterness of being unappreciated.

237
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,840
You're not bad now

238
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
At least I became Prime Minister Lu’s diner.

239
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,160
Diners? Not worth mentioning

240
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,520
Brother Xiang just saw me in the prime minister's house just now

241
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,680
Just doing some copying work

242
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,000
There is absolutely nothing to do on weekdays

243
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,600
No, didn't the Prime Minister use your imperial skills?

244
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,240
The Art of the Emperor

245
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Li Si once put forward many opinions to the Prime Minister

246
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,840
It's a pity that the prime minister just turned a deaf ear

247
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,960
Li Si is in the heart of the prime minister

248
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Maybe he's just a scholar who writes well.

249
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,760
Other than that, it's useless

250
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,400
That’s because Mr. Lu missed the talent.

251
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,840
Maybe Li Si thinks too highly of himself

252
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,080
He is not a talent for managing the country and the world at all.

253
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,920
You don't have to be too pessimistic

254
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,080
He doesn't appreciate you, and me too

255
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,360
Let's do this. I'll go back and report it to the king.

256
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,480
I recommend you to be Wang Zizheng’s right-hand man in studying.

257
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,760
Wang Zizheng will really become a king in the future

258
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,440
I'm sure you can help him then

259
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,440
Thanks to Taifu Xiang for his appreciation

260
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,360
Mr. Xiang had a close relationship with Mr. Zai

261
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,040
Li Si is grateful

262
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,240
Don't be polite, remember

263
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,240
Work hard and don’t give up on yourself, you know?

264
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,520
I'm leaving

265
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,720
walk slowly

266
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,200
what are you doing here?

267
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,000
Brother Xiang, I kneel down to pray for blessings

268
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,080
I hope you can go well and come back safely

269
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,000
What's up?

270
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,000
I heard that seeing a broom star is a bad omen, brother

271
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,040
Silly girl, that's not a broom star, it's a shooting star

272
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,600
meteor?

273
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,280
Yeah, shooting stars bring good luck in my hometown

274
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,120
real?

275
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,080
Of course it's true, let me tell you

276
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,360
In fact, there are many stars in the sky

277
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,760
It's just that it's too far away from us and can't be seen with the naked eye.

278
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,960
There is something called a telescope in our hometown

279
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,000
We can see the stars in the sky with a telescope

280
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,680
You can also see many constellations

281
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,440
Orion, for example, and many, many others

282
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,560
Why are there shooting stars?

283
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,480
Because there are many broken stones in the sky

284
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,680
As these rubbles hurtle towards the earth

285
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,960
Burning occurs when passing through the atmosphere

286
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,040
This will be at the end of the stone

287
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,440
forming a long burning tail

288
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,840
This is called a shooting star, it’s beautiful

289
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't think it's beautiful

290
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,720
My heart is always a little unhappy

291
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,160
Brother Xiang, this peace charm was given to me by my mother

292
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,400
I have been with you since I was a child, and I have always been safe.

293
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,760
Now I give it to you, hoping to bless you

294
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,200
No, what your mother gave you is very important

295
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,640
Keep it to yourself

296
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,280
If something unexpected happens to Brother Xiang

297
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,880
What's the point of leaving me alone?

298
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,080
Okay, Taifu Xiang is in front of you now

299
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,080
Just another person

300
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,240
Well done Tao Fang

301
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,560
Prime Minister praised me

302
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,440
Shaolong, this trip is very dangerous, so be careful

303
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,880
knew

304
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,000
Mr. Xiang, I may be there for several months this time.

305
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,320
I'm afraid after I leave

306
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,200
No one urged Wang Zizheng to study

307
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,200
So I want to borrow someone from you

308
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,280
I wonder if you would mind?

309
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,800
Who does Taifu Xiang want to borrow?

310
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,120
That's your diner Li Si

311
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,040
Li Si who is proficient in calligraphy?

312
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,080
Yes, Li Siqin can do everything in chess, calligraphy and painting.

313
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
If he urged Wang Zizheng to study

314
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,400
I'm sure I can get twice the result with half the effort

315
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,240
And I have asked your Majesty for instructions on this matter

316
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,720
I wonder if Mr. Xiang would mind?

317
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,320
Since Taifu Xiang recommended it, Jin Xiang certainly agreed.

318
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,760
Thank you Mr. Xiang

319
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,320
Mr. Xiang, there are many powerful generals around you.

320
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,040
I believe Wang Zizheng should be able to come in and out safely.

321
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,360
Brother, it's getting late

322
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
Trouble Prime Minister

323
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,760
Third brother, after I leave

324
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,280
Remember to take good care of the princess, okay?

325
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,720
Got it, bro

326
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,840
Brother Xiang

327
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,720
Don't be so sullen, it's not like I'll never come back

328
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,200
Don't talk nonsense

329
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,440
Don't worry, my brother is wise and brave.

330
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,680
You will definitely come back successfully

331
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,440
By the way, big brother will make great contributions then

332
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,200
You are more than just the wife of the Taifu.

333
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,800
Remember you have to take good care of yourself after I leave

334
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,280
Brother Xiang, take care

335
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,880
It's getting late, let's go

336
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,680
Are you awake? The fish is almost cooked

337
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,840
How do you know I'm here?

338
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,680
There's only one thing I don't know

339
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,760
That's why you left without saying goodbye

340
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,240
I brought Xiang Shaolong to see you that night

341
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,480
Don't mention this guy again

342
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,080
We traveled a long way to Qin

343
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,800
Also to meet him

344
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,040
It doesn’t matter if there is a woman by his side or not

345
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,680
You should also come forward and ask clearly.

346
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,080
I told you not to mention this person again

347
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,040
Miss Shanrou, I want to ask you to kill someone.

348
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,000
Who are you going to kill?

349
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Lao Ai

350
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,720
The world-famous left-handed swordsman Lao Ai

351
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,120
Why do you want to kill him?

352
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,800
This person has a sworn feud with Tingfang

353
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,480
Until he dies, I will never have peace

354
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,480
Sorry, I can't help you

355
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,800
Sweet girl, you are an assassin

356
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,160
Why don't you agree to my request?

357
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,160
Are you afraid that I won’t pay the fee?

358
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,520
I'd better tell the truth, there's no point in asking for it

359
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,480
Lao Ai has great martial arts skills and never leaves anyone alive under the sword.

360
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,760
My strength alone is not enough to deal with him.

361
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,400
I can help you, even if my martial arts skills are inferior, I can outwit you.

362
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,320
As the saying goes, one person is short-term and two people are long-term.

363
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,160
As long as I can get revenge, no matter what I do

364
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,880
Even if it costs my life, I won’t hesitate

365
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,720
Why bother?

366
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,240
Although I don’t know what grudge you have against Lao Ai

367
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,880
But he has to sacrifice his life for revenge

368
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,760
Is it worth it?

369
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,680
worth

370
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,600
As the saying goes, evil will be punished, this kind of person behaves viciously

371
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,360
Sooner or later you will die a violent death, why should you risk your life?

372
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,400
There are many meaningful things worth doing in life

373
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,960
Instead of living in hatred and torturing yourself

374
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,800
It's better to put aside the hatred

375
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,080
Make yourself live more happily

376
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,040
Unless Lao Ai dies, I will never live happily

377
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,760
The happiness of my life has been ruined in his hands

378
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,880
I should have been dead

379
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,680
I'm still secretly alive in this world

380
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,280
The only purpose is to kill him

381
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,120
Tingfang

382
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,000
Sweet girl, you don’t need to persuade me

383
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,920
You are an assassin, as long as someone is willing to pay

384
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,440
You know how to kill people. I can give you whatever you want.

385
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,120
Okay, you negotiate the price with me

386
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,520
But with my own strength

387
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,040
Difficulty completing tasks

388
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,240
I want to work with the assassins in the organization to plot the deployment

389
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,480
How much do you want?

390
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,440
One thousand gold

391
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,640
One thousand gold?

392
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,360
Even if I don’t want it, I will give it to other assassins

393
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,960
If you have half of it, I will promise you

394
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,360
good

395
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,960
You have?

396
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,360
Not yet, but even if I have to be a cow or a horse

397
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,840
Even if I have to sell myself, I still have to raise enough for you

398
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,200
Then come to me after you have raised enough money.

399
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,120
Why do you want to follow me?

400
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,720
You kill people for a living

401
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,080
I believe you will encounter many dangers

402
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,520
With one more person helping you, you can ensure safety

403
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
you mean…

404
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,880
I believe there is no other livelihood

405
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,720
As much money as being an assassin

406
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,080
I'll help you kill people, you share some with me

407
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,640
I believe I can raise enough money for you soon

408
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,120
Do you know how to kill?

409
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,400
I don’t understand, but I’ll understand if you teach me

410
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,920
You don’t understand anything, I will only give you a small amount

411
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,920
I don't care, as long as I can fight alongside you

412
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,040
good

413
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,520
The target of this assassination

414
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,440
He is a powerful swordsman

415
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,600
So we can’t fight head-on, we have to outsmart ourselves.

416
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,200
I'll poison the wine first

417
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,520
I want to drink poisonous wine with him

418
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,880
gain his trust

419
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,040
When he was poisoned

420
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,400
You have to come out and kill him with one sword

421
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,280
The owner of your village means to let bygones be bygones

422
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,480
I hope you will return to the village soon

423
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,320
Is this true?

424
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,720
Harmony is the most precious thing in all things, and you should be merciful when you are able to do so

425
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,400
It means the owner of your village

426
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,280
I'll drink first as a token of respect.

427
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,040
please

428
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,120
After you kill him, I will take the antidote immediately

429
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,560
Remember, act fast

430
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,280
Otherwise, even I will be poisoned and die.

431
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,560
I don’t want to be called a traitor, you...

432
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,960
quick

433
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,000
Tingfang

434
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,960
Shanrou...how are you?

435
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,000
Antidote…

436
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,840
Zenju…

437
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,960
sorry

438
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,040
You don't need to apologize, luckily you took action in time

439
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,600
Otherwise even if I am not strangled to death by an assassin

440
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,040
I will also die from poisoning

441
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,080
If it weren't because I was too panicked and too timid

442
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,520
As long as I followed my plan, I could have killed him long ago

443
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,040
Humans are not grass and trees, killing someone for the first time

444
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,840
It will indeed be difficult to start

445
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,160
But if you follow me, sooner or later you will get used to it

446
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,360
But I advise you to give up as soon as possible

447
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,840
Killing is not fun

448
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,880
Absolutely not, I will never give up no matter what

449
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,200
Why bother?

450
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,120
I kill for revenge

451
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,640
Miss Shanrou, what are you doing?

452
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,720
You once said that life is alive

453
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,680
There are many things worth pursuing

454
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Why are you fighting to kill?

455
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,200
You killed many people you didn't know

456
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,480
Even put your own life in danger

457
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,720
What exactly is it for?

458
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,000
Is it just for money?

459
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,000
No, I fight with my own life

460
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,960
It can save many people

461
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,760
Sister Shanrou...

462
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,960
dumb uncle

463
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,560
Sister Shanrou, be good

464
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,640
I came back this time with many different seeds

465
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,440
From now on you will have many kinds of vegetables and grains to eat

466
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,280
OK

467
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,120
By the way, there are some daily necessities here

468
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,760
Just obediently help the mute uncle put it away, okay?

469
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,600
good…

470
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,720
take it over

471
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,440
Why are there so many children in this village?

472
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,480
Where are their parents?

473
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,360
They are all orphans

474
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,880
Countries have been fighting for years, and how many people have died in the wars?

475
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,000
Those who survived, the men had to fight or serve in slavery

476
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,040
The remaining old, weak, women and children have to deal with exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes.

477
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,000
As a result, nine out of ten rooms are empty, and there are people dying of hunger on the road.

478
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,560
I am an orphan myself

479
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,520
I understand the pain of being homeless without a father or a mother.

480
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,560
So you become an assassin

481
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,480
Use the money you earn to help them

482
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,760
I was adopted by the assassin leader since I was a child

483
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,240
I have no choice in taking the path of an assassin.

484
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,600
Completely out of control

485
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,720
But now I'm finally ready for my assassin career

486
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
found meaning

487
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,760
I hope to be in a place far away from the war

488
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,160
Build them a home of their own

489
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,720
The relatives of these children are all dead

490
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,000
The experience may be worse than yours

491
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,720
But they didn't worry about their life experience

492
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,640
They only think about how to make their lives better every day

493
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,280
If you only have hatred in your heart

494
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,640
So what if you kill your enemy in the future?

495
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,280
Then your life in the world will only be more empty

496
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,000
Really inflexible

497
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,680
The prince is so agile

498
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,960
The prince has been having fun for an hour

499
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,320
How about you go back and copy your homework?

500
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,160
Li Si, just write, your handwriting is beautiful

501
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,000
Remember not to write too neatly

502
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,400
If it's too neat, it won't be like what I wrote.

503
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,320
Xiaogao Prince…

504
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,120
The luxurious lady has arrived

505
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,560
Get up...take off your armor

506
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,680
See Madam Luxurious

507
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,440
See the gorgeous lady…

508
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,520
Free of charge

509
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,200
daughter

510
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,760
Zheng'er worked really hard, and the bamboo slips were full of words

511
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,200
Mom praised me

512
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,400
It must be very hard for Zheng'er to write

513
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,520
I wrote until I was sweating profusely

514
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,280
No need to trouble mother, Xiao Gao

515
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,440
The slave is here

516
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,200
Prince please

517
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,680
It turns out that Madam Huagui is also here

518
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,160
See Mr. Lu. See Mr. Lu...

519
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Prime Minister Lu

520
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,560
Madam is polite

521
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,680
It’s such a joy to meet someone unexpectedly

522
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,240
Learning and practicing is the real pleasure

523
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,280
Prince, how did you do with your homework today?

524
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,280
Please ask the Prime Minister to take a look

525
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,160
The font is beautiful and there is indeed progress

526
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,600
This is all due to Li Si’s teachings.

527
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,120
Prince praises

528
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,760
But the last one was just a little bit off.

529
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,840
Writing can show a person’s mind

530
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,160
So don't be careless

531
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,680
The Prime Minister is really dedicated

532
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,040
Although the king went to hunt in the fields

533
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,760
Still doing his duty to teach the prince

534
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,240
As if the prince is your biological son

535
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,120
Madam, I am really grateful.

536
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,560
Madam, you are serious

537
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,760
I will not stop you from studying calligraphy with the prince.

538
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,760
Send your mother off

539
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,800
Invite Prime Minister Lu into the palace

540
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,320
You said that my wife has something important to discuss, so let’s put it down.

541
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,400
yes ma'am

542
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,480
I didn’t expect that my wife is so good at cooking

543
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,000
Other dishes are simply incomparable

544
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,920
real?

545
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,480
Madam, Prime Minister Lu…

546
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,600
invite him in

547
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,560
See Madam Luxurious

548
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,840
You two stand down

549
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,120
yes…

550
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,360
The Prime Minister asked me to inform Madam

551
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,560
He was unwell and could not attend his wife's appointment

552
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,240
Why be so heartless and righteous?

553
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,920
Even if you don’t miss past kindness

554
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,040
There is no need to be so cold and distant when we get to know each other.

555
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,080
Could it be that this lady is a man-eating demon?

556
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:58,280
Will one meeting ruin his future?

557
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,480
Since the love is gone, why should my wife be persistent?

558
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,680
Dog slave, who are you?

559
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,520
Say these words to this lady

560
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,560
This lady can kill you at any time

561
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,440
With the power of my wife, I can kill all the men in the world

562
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,080
A man who can also own the world at the same time

563
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,960
Even the king is no exception

564
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,000
With the beauty of my lady,

565
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,200
There are many ways to make yourself happy

566
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,240
Why bother begging and asking for trouble?

567
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,200
I hope my wife will cherish herself

568
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,480
Bold

569
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Tianxiang Tower was very famous in the past

570
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,680
A friend of mine took me here to eat

571
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,920
But now they are gone

572
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,520
Lord, don’t bring up the past too often

573
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,680
You are Dong Kuang now. You should have never set foot in Zhao country.

574
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,600
The entire cavalry team has been stationed at the post station outside the city.

575
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,600
We should meet Zhao Mu as soon as possible

576
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,520
Flowers are ready to be cut off when they are in bloom, don’t wait until there are no flowers left to break branches.

577
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,880
parking

578
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,880
I lost several rolls

579
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,720
It must have been lost on the way

580
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,880
Godfather, wait a moment, my daughter will check back.

581
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Miss Qin

582
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,160
You and I have never met

583
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,680
How come you can recognize this little girl?

584
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,760
i just saw you

585
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,040
I just saw a girl searching for something

586
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,440
And I picked up this painting again

587
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,720
The seal above has the characters Qin Qing

588
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,320
It is unknown whether this is the girl’s lost painting

589
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,240
Fortunately, this scroll was found by Your Excellency

590
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,360
Girl, is this painting important to you?

591
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,080
Have we ever met?

592
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,800
The girl also said that we have never met

593
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,640
how do we know each other

594
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,200
You seem to be an old friend of my little girl

595
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:42,240
I actually look like the girl's old friend, it's impossible

596
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,200
The girl looks so beautiful

597
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,160
How could I have a friend as rude as me?

598
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,680
And I, Dong Kuang, have just arrived in Guijing.

599
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,360
Dong Kuang, turns out to be Mr. Dong

600
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,920
Qing'er...has the scroll been recovered?

601
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,240
I have to thank Mr. Dong for this.

602
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,680
There’s work…

603
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,680
Just a little effort

604
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,840
We wasted a lot of time on the way

605
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,480
It seems like we should leave immediately

606
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,640
Mr. Dong, see you later

607
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,760
See you later

608
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,360
Miss Qin

609
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,920
It will be due later

610
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,280
I wonder when I will have the chance to meet Miss Qin again?

611
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,000
We will meet each other naturally if we are destined
