1
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,880
Get up so early?

2
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,280
It's getting late, it's already three o'clock in the morning

3
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,880
How can you defeat Zhao Mu and the others if you are so lazy?

4
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,400
It seems like you came prepared today

5
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,760
Let me ask you, is our bet still valid?

6
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,400
Effective, I never lie

7
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Then prepare to be a pig or a dog later.

8
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,480
Are you ready? Miss, let’s begin

9
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,440
start

10
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,160
good

11
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,600
We are willing to admit defeat and you lose the game

12
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,040
Take action now

13
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,480
You brought me here in broad daylight

14
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,480
Could it be that you want to insult me?

15
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,280
Or do you want me to insult you?

16
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
He is indeed a slut who speaks dirty words.

17
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,840
Keeping you in the world will only harm people and things

18
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,080
Since you are willing to admit defeat, you are willing to do whatever you said

19
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,240
Jump down from here now

20
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,560
It's better to jump out of the plane. It's actually very dangerous.

21
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,760
Don’t you have the guts to regret breaking your promise?

22
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,200
That's fine, just kneel down and kowtow to me and beg for mercy.

23
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,240
This lady can spare your life

24
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,560
beg for mercy?

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,680
This is better than jumping off a cliff to death

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,920
I jumped off a cliff

27
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,520
lewd thief

28
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,160
Brother Xiang, I don’t want you to die

29
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,040
I just want to tease you

30
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,960
You're not usually so obedient, you're an idiot

31
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm a ghost

32
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,840
Didn't you jump?

33
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,120
I'm a hungry ghost

34
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,680
You damn pervert, you're teasing me again

35
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
It turns out this bastard didn't fall off the cliff

36
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,360
Grab the vines and scare me, bastard

37
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,840
This bastard is pretty smart and funny too

38
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,640
You imitated his tone and teased me, and you even helped him

39
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,040
If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have told you.

40
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,480
Can you hold back and say nothing?

41
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,480
I used to call you a thief all the time, but now you call me a bastard all the time.

42
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,000
I’m afraid I’ll have to call you husband from now on.

43
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,760
When did you learn to be so tricky?

44
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,120
Arrogant? Did that bastard say that again?

45
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,240
You even speak with an accent like him

46
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,560
I'm afraid I have to follow that bastard for the rest of my life.

47
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,800
Don't even think about it. I felt guilty when I saw him.

48
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,440
Seeing injustice? Seeing injustice if you can’t see it

49
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,360
Princess, when did you learn to speak so badly?

50
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,080
Just learning from you

51
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,720
Learn from me? Learn from me…

52
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,360
don't want

53
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,320
Brother Lian

54
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,920
Fang'er, I haven't seen you for a long time

55
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Thought something was wrong with you

56
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,360
It's okay, I was blocked by that bastard when I went out

57
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,360
Which bastard?

58
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,560
That's Xiang Shaolong

59
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,600
Is your bet with him still over?

60
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,480
Fang'er finally won

61
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,600
Complete all projects within time limit

62
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,040
That's good, you won't need it in the future

63
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,680
Practice Xiang Shaolong’s weird stuff again

64
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,160
No need to be teased by him anymore

65
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,000
certainly

66
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,600
Is the sword I gave you suitable for use?

67
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,840
This sword is still unsheathed

68
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Let's start sword practice

69
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,320
good

70
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,720
Your swordsmanship has improved greatly

71
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,480
It is powerful for stabbing, chopping and cutting.

72
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,640
Fang'er feels that she is more comfortable handling the sword than before

73
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,440
Such great progress can be made

74
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,160
I have to thank that bastard for that shit too.

75
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,000
My hand and leg strength have improved

76
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,120
Although your strength has improved

77
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,160
But the hands and feet are not coordinated

78
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,360
You should do this...

79
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,320
I'm both thirsty and hungry

80
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,200
Shall we go to Tianfu Pavilion for lunch?

81
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,560
Okay, that bastard and the generals practice every day

82
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,640
Buy some cakes to comfort them

83
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,400
Dad, the Cuju competition will be held in three days.

84
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,760
Dad knows

85
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,000
Do you know that Xiang Shaolong?

86
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,280
Lead the family members to run and jump every day

87
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,120
Have you never been to a Cuju court?

88
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,800
Xiang Shaoxia has his own opinion

89
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,640
I think this makes absolutely no sense

90
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
It means it’s a Cuju competition.

91
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,040
Of course I have to practice at the Cuju court.

92
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,120
Dad, this time you are trusting someone else.

93
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,360
Young Master, practice your strength and physical fitness

94
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,880
Helpful for Cuju

95
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,960
I think that Xiang Shaolong

96
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,440
I don’t know what the hell the idea is

97
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,280
It's obviously a waste of our general's physical strength.

98
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,120
Maybe he is a spy sent by Zhao Mu

99
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,000
I think our Wu family will be defeated

100
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,840
Dad, the game is in three days

101
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,800
It's not a show of skill, it's a show of ugliness

102
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,840
What's so ugly? If I had known, my whole family would have plastic surgery

103
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,320
No more physical training

104
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,760
You came just in time. Dad and I have something to ask you.

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,800
What's up?

106
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,760
What's your plan for the Cuju competition in three days?

107
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,720
You'll know then

108
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,960
Dad and I asked you but you didn’t answer.

109
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,400
What exactly do you mean?

110
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,200
Will, don't be rude.

111
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,600
Dad believes in Xiang Shaoxia

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,520
Xiang Shaoxia, everything will be done according to your plan

113
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,040
Castle Lord, don’t worry

114
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,760
I will definitely try my best to do my best

115
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,760
Mr. Tao, I have something to ask you.

116
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,720
What do you want from me?

117
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,560
You follow this pattern

118
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,680
The cook did as I was told and copied dozens of copies for me.

119
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,760
Useful on game day

120
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,120
Cook the bowl as instructed? What does that mean?

121
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,560
Just follow your example and copy my bowl

122
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,920
Do you understand? I don’t understand.

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,520
If you don’t understand, just copy it and keep asking questions.

124
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,240
Good morning everyone, after a series of training

125
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,160
The official competition will begin in two days

126
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,320
This game is very important to us

127
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,040
I will take this opportunity to tell you today

128
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,200
How will I deploy it then?

129
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,000
We have six people in each team

130
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,760
I assigned two to be forwards

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,160
Two are defenders, two are backbone

132
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,920
Unlimited gantry system

133
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,120
Whoever sees the ball will be the goalkeeper, do you understand?

134
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,400
clear

135
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,040
forward defender

136
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,840
Another ghost story

137
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,800
Forward is responsible for attacking

138
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,120
The defender is responsible for defending

139
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,160
To guard the gate is to be responsible for guarding the dragon gate.

140
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,200
Except for you two idiots, does everyone understand?

141
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,040
clear

142
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,880
According to you, it limits everyone's position

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,120
Wouldn't it be more rigid and unable to attack?

144
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,880
You're not too stupid this time

145
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,480
He actually asked a more thoughtful question

146
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,520
A game for six people is called mini-ball in our hometown.

147
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,840
Due to the rush of time

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,920
It has something to do with you not having time to train.

149
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,360
So I assigned a number to each of you

150
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,000
So that I can control it when the time comes

151
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,760
For example, my trumpet will represent attack at that time.

152
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,560
This number represents defense

153
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,520
As for the details

154
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,000
I will demonstrate to you later

155
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,720
You can say whatever you want with your mouth

156
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,560
How can I take care of the real competition?

157
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,400
Anyway, if you grab the ball, you have to attack the opponent's goal.

158
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,240
Is it just what you call forward and defender?

159
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,560
Can you win?

160
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,680
Sorry to trouble you, Castle Lord

161
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,680
Will, stop arguing.

162
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,240
Shall we get started?

163
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,000
Attack No. 2

164
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,960
On the 3rd, on...

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's right...No. 2, on, that's right

166
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,760
Back to the bottom line on the 4th...

167
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,000
No. 5 returns to Longmen and guards Longmen, by the way...

168
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,280
By the way...attack

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,120
No. 3 and No. 2 entered politics together

170
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,480
Don't just stand there, Number Five.

171
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,560
You are not a watchman, you have to run, right?

172
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,520
By the way, No. 2 returns to Longmen

173
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,080
Go back and guard the dragon gate, guard... that's right

174
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,880
Mr. Mao, bet fifty taels, buy Wujiapu to win.

175
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,000
Mr. Mao, why don't you just throw the silver into the Yellow River?

176
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,400
Wujiabao has lost for three consecutive years

177
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,480
Why do you put gold in Gongzipan's pocket?

178
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,720
Mr. Shao Yuan, are you jealous?

179
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,640
This young master collected more bets than you did

180
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,920
Julu Mansion will definitely win

181
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,160
I really can't get the interest to place a bet

182
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,720
But I heard that this year Wujiapu

183
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,440
A fierce general came, named Xiang Shaolong

184
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,320
There is a Lian Jin Dynasty in Juluhou Mansion, it seems that there will be a fierce battle

185
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,200
Juluhoufu must win

186
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,840
Things are unpredictable and the football match has not started yet

187
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,280
Why judge so quickly?

188
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,840
Things are unpredictable? Do you think

189
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,320
Will Juluhou Mansion lose?

190
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,800
Very likely

191
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,160
If Wujiapu wins, my son Jia will pay ten for one.

192
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
One for ten?

193
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,920
Since Zhao Pan has such a unique vision,

194
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,120
I will bet with him once

195
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,360
Okay, I’ll bet one hundred taels

196
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,960
Seriously? Listen, everyone

197
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,360
I will use this hundred taels to treat everyone to drink wine.

198
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,800
Thank you Gongzijia

199
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,520
Thank you, Zhao Pancai

200
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,800
How can I carry one thousand taels back to my home?

201
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,800
One thousand taels is enough to drink flower wine until you die.

202
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,760
Where did Fang'er go? She obviously followed her

203
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,400
Maybe he went to the toilet

204
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,440
Never able to sit still

205
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,360
The daughter’s family is not allowed to visit the Cuju competition.

206
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,240
She is now disguised as a man

207
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,640
It would be troublesome if you were discovered

208
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,640
Dad, the king is here

209
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,040
Invite the Juluhou team and the Wujiapu team to come in

210
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,480
The Lord of Uburg, the clothes of your noble general

211
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,200
It's really ingenious. It's really eye-opening for me.

212
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,400
King, are you right?

213
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,800
right

214
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,960
Mr. Hou, you actually have new eyes and ears

215
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,800
That's not a good thing

216
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,400
But why are your clothes

217
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,680
Did you embroider some special symbols?

218
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,760
Your Majesty, this is actually my hometown

219
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,600
Special auspicious symbols

220
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,120
Lucky symbol? That’s right

221
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,040
If you want to win this game

222
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,280
I think it can only be achieved by asking God to worship Buddha.

223
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,160
Zhao Pan, you are really discerning

224
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,400
The Cuju competition has begun, please preside over the service ceremony

225
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,680
Where did No. 2 go?

226
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,000
He just said he had a stomachache and went to the toilet and didn't come back

227
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,480
Only now has something like this happened

228
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,640
Call the backup quickly

229
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,560
Number two is back

230
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,600
Mrs. Ya arrives

231
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,920
Brother Wang

232
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
your scarf

233
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,160
I'll keep this scarf as a souvenir for you.

234
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,320
In fact, this silk scarf is really of no use to men.

235
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,720
Well, let’s see which team wins this Cuju competition.

236
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,920
This towel is an extra gift

237
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,440
Sister Wang, why did you suddenly come to see the Cuju competition?

238
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,000
Brother Wang, this is not right.

239
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,240
Wang Mei is not invited to watch the annual Cuju competition.

240
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,680
Cuju is a manly thing

241
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,200
Since Wang Mei likes to watch, okay, come and give me a seat.

242
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,400
Zhao Pan...it seems that everyone is envious of you

243
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,280
There is such a coquettish girl

244
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,480
It's so embarrassing to have such a coquettish aunt

245
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,840
It's embarrassing

246
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,320
Of course, your coquettish aunt

247
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,120
Won't do you any good

248
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,160
But Zhao Pan is different

249
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,080
I can have a few wealthy godfathers to take care of me.

250
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,680
The benefits are numerous

251
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,240
Mr. Shao Yuan, please stop talking.

252
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,040
It's funny, your mother is widowed, my mother is also widowed

253
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,160
It's a pity that my mother doesn't know how to take advantage of widowhood

254
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,720
Hooking up with three people everywhere

255
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,920
There is really no gain in leaving me without anyone to take care of me.

256
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,960
Mr. Shaoyuan, you might as well accept Mrs. Ya as your godmother.

257
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,000
From now on, I won’t have to worry about my godfather and adoptive father taking care of me.

258
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Everyone is ready

259
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,280
superior

260
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,160
The Wu family is awesome…

261
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,160
Why is Wujiabao so sophisticated?

262
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,480
Well played, well played

263
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,920
good…

264
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,520
Wujiapu played well, played well

265
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,840
Thank you for your appreciation

266
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,760
Okay, that's a really good fight, it's really appreciated.

267
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Just because Wujiapu has one more strong player this year

268
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,680
The Lord of Ubau is indeed very discerning.

269
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,320
Lord Marquis, I accept it.

270
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,960
good…

271
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,080
red card, show red card

272
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,600
Brother Lian, you have gone too far

273
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,760
Deliberately kicked Xiang Shaolong’s leg

274
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,200
I didn't mean to do it, it was just an accident

275
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,000
Brother Xiang, are you injured?

276
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,720
Yeah, how do you know?

277
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,040
How's it going? Is the injury serious?

278
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,160
You know how hard you kick someone

279
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,920
Forget it...it's hard to tell when playing football, he didn't mean it

280
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,600
Brother Xiang, can you continue playing?

281
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,240
Guess

282
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,880
Then I'll take you back to my hometown to see the doctor.

283
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,040
you are really smart

284
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,880
Come

285
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Can you pick me up? Thank you

286
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,680
It seems that his injury is not serious

287
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,480
What a disappointment, let’s have a good Cuju competition

288
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,320
Someone was injured

289
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,920
Your Majesty is in full swing, the game cannot be stopped

290
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,160
Xiang Shaolong was injured and someone was needed to replace him

291
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,560
Dad, let the kid play the game

292
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,240
Okay, wait a minute

293
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,280
Find someone to replace Fang'er and tell her to come back here immediately

294
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,680
You said this was dad's order

295
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,760
knew

296
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,320
How is your leg?

297
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,600
It's okay, it's just a broken bone

298
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,560
Lian Jin went too far

299
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,840
It really touches me that you did it for me

300
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,640
Scold your sweetheart until he loses his face

301
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,560
It's really rare

302
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
Don't get me wrong

303
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,480
I'm just nervous about Wujiapu's prestige

304
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,000
Without your command, it's like a piece of loose sand

305
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,040
Doesn't it mean he will be defeated?

306
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,280
My legs hurt, what should I do?

307
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,640
Just be patient.

308
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,880
Miss, you go back first

309
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,800
Brother Xiang and I went to see the doctor

310
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,360
hug…

311
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,560
The horses are ready, just ahead

312
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
OK, let's go

313
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,720
Well...the Juluhou team finally recovered from its decline.

314
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,720
The more you fight, the braver you become

315
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,560
Lian Jin shoots well

316
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,760
OK OK

317
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,040
It's nothing more than this, the scorching sun is shining in the sky

318
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,600
Don’t say that the family will be sweating profusely at the end

319
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,560
The audience in the stands were also sweating like rain

320
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,120
It's really unbearable

321
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,400
Brother Wang, Sister Wang resigned first.

322
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,800
Are you ready?

323
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,600
yes

324
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,680
I'm not that stupid, that sinister villain

325
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,120
After noon, the guards at Zhizi Mansion were lax.

326
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,480
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

327
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,000
Not bad, makeup

328
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,320
Okay... hurry up, rush for time, let's go

329
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,520
give me a little green

330
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,800
good, wonderful

331
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,880
The troops are divided into two groups and act according to the opportunity.

332
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,040
follow me

333
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,200
Be careful, there are traps, everyone move aside

334
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,040
Are you Ying Zheng?

335
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
The villain's rescue came late, so the lady has been waiting for a long time

336
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,680
Madam, please come with me

337
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,440
Walk

338
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,840
Walk

339
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,760
The game is over

340
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,640
The Julu Hou team won, please give me a reward from your Majesty.

341
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,760
The Juluhou team won a big victory today, and their results were even better than before

342
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,160
Your Majesty, this is also an inheritance from Wujiapu

343
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,880
Congratulations to Mr. Hou for winning another beautiful battle

344
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
If Xiang Shaolong hadn’t left midway,

345
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,520
Wujiabao would not have suffered such a tragic defeat

346
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,280
Now the king rewards

347
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,360
Why not invite Xiang Shaolong to come out and have some fun?

348
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,160
Xiang Shaolong was seriously injured

349
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,960
Wu Mou has ordered someone to take him back to his hometown to rest.

350
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,000
It’s really exciting to sweep the Lord’s elegance

351
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,280
The king rewarded you with a valuable luminous cup

352
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,160
It's a pity that we are drinking flower wine tonight

353
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,520
There is no luminous cup to hold it, but Zhao Pan is treating me

354
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,440
Drinking very happily

355
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,280
Your Majesty, I will take my leave.

356
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,920
go back

357
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,600
Marquis

358
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,040
What

359
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,240
Proton Mansion...there are assassins coming to cause trouble

360
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,760
So brave, you actually dare to break into the Proton Mansion to save people

361
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,400
If it hadn’t been for Mr. Hou’s prior

362
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,480
Remove the real Zhu Ji and Ying Zheng

363
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,560
Then disguised as an assassin to ambush the thieves

364
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,040
The consequences are really unimaginable

365
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,320
Fortunately, he did not disgrace his life and all the thieves were killed.

366
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,800
Only two were injured and escaped, and I'm afraid they won't be able to make it far.

367
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,760
You losers, there are dozens of people guarding the proton house.

368
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,440
Can two people escape?

369
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,600
Forgive me, Lord. Forgive me, Lord.

370
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,680
Xiang Shaolong left the scene, Mr. Hou and I

371
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,920
Just stay in the palace for the Cuju competition

372
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,600
Something happened in the Proton Mansion

373
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,920
Mr. Hou, I think something is fishy

374
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
wujiabao

375
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,440
Xiang Shaolong, you shy little turtle come out

376
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,680
Xiang Shaolong, I will teach you a lesson today.

377
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,440
Where is Xiang Shaolong?

378
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,240
Will, what's all the fuss about?

379
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,040
Dad, if it weren’t for Xiang Shaolong today

380
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,200
I used to use some weird methods to train generals

381
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,840
Train them until they are vulnerable

382
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,600
We Wujiapu will not lose

383
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,040
The vulnerable Xiang Shaolong

384
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,480
Intimidating at first

385
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,400
He retreated after being kicked by Lian Jin

386
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,480
It's him who's in trouble, I'll teach him a lesson as soon as he comes out

387
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,000
Dad hasn’t taught you a lesson yet

388
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,520
Look at you, a woman is pretending to be a man to play Cuju

389
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,280
If you are recognized by the king, it will be a capital crime, do you know?

390
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,720
How could the king recognize it?

391
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,960
You are still quibbling, you are so willful

392
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,120
Our Wu family will definitely be ashamed of you in the future

393
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,960
Dad, the one who is embarrassing us now is Xiang Shaolong

394
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,760
This person has ulterior motives

395
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,440
I have long thought that our Wu family would make a fool of ourselves in front of others.

396
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,800
Dad, no matter what, I have to kill Xiang Shaolong this time

397
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,160
Expelled from Wujiapu and served as a police officer

398
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,640
Someone, bring Xiang Shaolong out immediately

399
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,400
Xiang Shaolong and Manager Tao are not in the mansion

400
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,160
Will, don't mess around anymore

401
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
I am not good at learning and my skills are not as good as others

402
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,240
And put the responsibility on others

403
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,920
Dad, until now, you still prefer to help outsiders.

404
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,760
Say no more

405
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,880
Dad, even if you don't drive that bastard away

406
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,320
I also want him to come out and explain.

407
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,960
Dad has his own sense of proportion

408
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,360
Fang'er wondered if he was so seriously injured

409
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,600
I must ask clearly

410
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,080
Master...Master Hou and the others are here

411
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,200
Lord Uburg, Ben Hout came to visit

412
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,280
How is Xiang Shaoxia's injury?

413
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,040
Lord Marquis is here, but he is welcome from afar

414
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,240
Please forgive me, Lord Marquis

415
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,600
What's the crime?

416
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,840
Lord Marquis, please take a seat

417
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,120
No need, I'm worried about Xiang Shaoxia's injury

418
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,920
So I personally brought Lian Jin here to apologize to him.

419
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,400
Mr. Hou is too outspoken.

420
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,880
Lord Wubao, Lian Jin came here specially

421
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,440
Can I apologize to Xiang Shaolong and ask him to come out?

422
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,320
Xiang Shaolong's injuries are serious and he has difficulty moving...

423
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,200
Since he has difficulty moving, I will take care of him personally

424
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,680
I have brought Doctor Wu to see him. Let's go up.

425
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,520
Lord Marquis, please stay. Lord Marquis...

426
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,120
The Marquis brought many people to see me

427
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,840
I'm afraid I can't bear it and will be flattered

428
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,240
How is the injury?

429
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,000
The injury was serious and there were broken bones.

430
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,000
Is Xiang Shaoxia's leg really injured and sprained by a kick?

431
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,440
indeed

432
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,080
Doctor, could my leg be lame?

433
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,040
Can it be cured?

434
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,600
If the leg is broken, just use a wooden board to clamp the leg bone tightly

435
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,680
Move less and your leg bones will heal quickly.

436
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,560
thank you doctor

437
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,880
Why don’t you quickly say thank you to the Marquis? The Marquis even went to the palace to

438
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,280
The imperial witch doctor is also here to diagnose and treat you.

439
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,760
I really want to thank you, Mr. Hou, for bothering you this time.

440
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,120
And brother, I heard that you

441
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,120
You came here specifically to apologize to me

442
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,320
But you didn't mean to kick me

443
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,240
It's really hard for a man to apologize.

444
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,040
Besides, I'm not a petty person either.

445
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,440
Okay...I'll forgive you

446
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,160
Brother Xiang is really measured

447
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,840
Since Xiang Shaoxia’s leg is fine,

448
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,160
There is no point in stopping you from resting, let’s go

449
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,240
I'll see the Marquis out

450
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,240
Doctor, how is Mr. Tao's injury?

451
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,280
Don't worry, sir, Mr. Tao's injuries are not life-threatening.

452
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,520
Although a lot of blood has been lost

453
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,840
As long as the wound is not invaded by wind evil

454
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,320
Change dressing every day and take good care of yourself

455
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,880
He will recover in about ten days

456
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,080
Doctor, I tell you

457
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,600
Manager Tao’s injury must not be publicized

458
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,080
Not even people from the Wu family can

459
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,120
It's a matter of great importance. If even the slightest bit of information leaks out about this matter,

460
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,520
you are responsible

461
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,560
Don't worry, sir, I understand.

462
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,160
Please go out and prescribe medicine

463
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,040
Yes, sir

464
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,760
doctor

465
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,920
Miss

466
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,520
Why is the doctor in such a hurry?

467
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,920
Is Mr. Tao feeling unwell?

468
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,240
master

469
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,640
Be careful of wounds…

470
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,160
The subordinate did not live up to the expectations of the master and failed to complete the task.

471
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
I…

472
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,720
Got it, you can rest

473
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,640
Zhao Mu, this cunning old man

474
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,760
It turned out that Ying Zheng and Zhu Ji had already been moved out of the hostage house

475
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,000
Cloaked as an assassin, he laid a dragnet in the house.

476
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,200
Lure us into fishing and catch us all

477
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,800
All the generals we brought with us have died heroically.

478
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,440
It's all my fault, I thought I could use competition

479
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,360
draw their attention

480
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,440
Who would have expected that...I'm sorry, Lord of the Castle

481
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,440
You must not say that, man’s calculation is not as good as God’s calculation

482
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
Xiang Shaoxia does not need to blame himself

483
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,360
Brother Xiang has tried his best

484
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:50,160
I understand, Xiang Shaoxia, your legs are okay, right?

485
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,520
Compared with the dead Wu family general

486
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,880
What do my legs mean?

487
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,840
Brother Xiang is very witty

488
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,000
When we fled back to Wujiapu just now,

489
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,760
Seeing the horses in the Marquis' Mansion

490
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,280
Brother Xiang knew that Zhao Mu was coming to investigate

491
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,040
Deliberately broke his own leg bone with a stone

492
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,400
This is really embarrassing for you

493
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,400
Xiang Shaoxia values ​​​​love and justice, and is both resourceful and resourceful.

494
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,080
It was all down to your clever trick just now.

495
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,240
Only then did the dog thief Zhao Mu return without success, which was indeed a clever move.

496
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,160
But unfortunately, the whereabouts of the real Zhu Ji mother and son are unknown.

497
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,160
What's more, it's enough to scare the snake away.

498
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,640
We will rescue their mother and son in the future

499
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,440
It’s even more difficult

500
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,480
Not afraid of Xiang Shaoxia’s laughter

501
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,240
Wu Mou left Qin for many years

502
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,280
I really want to complete the mission as soon as possible and return to my hometown in Qin

503
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,320
Our Wu family are from Qin?

504
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,120
But now it seems

505
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,840
I don’t know when this wish will come true?

506
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,240
Fang'er

507
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,440
Dad, my daughter has heard everything you said just now.

508
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,520
Tell your daughter what's going on

509
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,440
Why do you want to go back to your hometown in Qin?

510
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,400
Why should we rescue a mother and her child?

511
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,440
Fang'er, this matter is of great importance. If this matter is leaked,

512
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,920
We will lose our heads

513
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,880
Dad, are you from Qin?

514
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,360
Yes, our family is all from Qin

515
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,320
Why do you keep hiding it?

516
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,400
Why are we in Zhao country?

517
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,520
Dad has never told you brothers and sisters this secret.

518
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,160
I'm just afraid that you guys will be young and impulsive and cause big problems.

519
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,720
especially your brother

520
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,240
Often making trouble outside

521
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,640
I'm afraid he accidentally leaked this secret

522
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,040
Fang'er, now that you know this

523
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,000
I'll tell you, dad, it's a big deal

524
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,800
This secret must never be told to anyone else

525
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,200
especially your brother

526
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,640
The eldest lady, the matter is of great importance, up and down Wujiapu

527
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,160
Dozens of lives are staked on it, so be careful

528
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,920
Dad, you and Mr. Tao don’t trust your daughter either.

529
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,560
Instead, trust an outsider

530
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,200
I am not an outsider, I am also from Qin.

531
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,080
Yes, Xiang Shaoxia is from Qin.

532
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,080
And it's one of our own

533
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,960
He just helped us rescue the protons

534
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,880
Almost died in the Proton Mansion

535
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,720
Fang'er, don't target Xiang Shaoxia everywhere in the future.

536
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,800
My daughter is also a reasonable person

537
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,320
As long as he stops teasing his daughter

538
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,440
My daughter won't mess with him at all

539
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,200
Fang'er, dad is actually the most worried

540
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,880
It's you who associates with Lian Jin

541
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,080
Lian Jin is Zhao Mu’s confidant

542
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,240
This thief Zhao Mu is always against our Wu family.

543
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,480
If this secret is known to him, something bad will happen.

544
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,440
That’s why dad objects to your association with Lian Jin.

545
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,000
Dad, these two things have nothing to do with each other.

546
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,880
Zhao Mu is targeting our Wu family

547
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,080
But Lian Jin is just his subordinate

548
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,560
Lian Jin has no hostility towards the Wu family

549
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,560
You also often call me a pervert

550
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,640
But when have I ever been frivolous to you?

551
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,600
You also said that Lian Jin is a good person

552
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,080
You just witnessed him kicking my leg during the game

553
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,480
Then do you think he is a good person?

554
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,120
You broke your leg yourself

555
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,440
You're being naughty

556
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,240
Fang'er, remember what dad said just now

557
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,120
Don’t associate with Lian Jin anymore

558
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,320
Please listen to your father.

559
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,840
You are so old and still ignorant

560
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,560
Fang'er

561
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,960
Xiang Shaoxia, are you okay?

562
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,560
fine

563
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,560
I'm so sorry

564
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,160
Are you okay? It's okay

565
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,880
Lord, my subordinates are not doing their job well.

566
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,080
Failed to kill all the assassins who broke into the Proton Mansion

567
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,880
I have a bad reputation, please forgive me.

568
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,480
When you receive money from others, you have to do things well

569
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,920
Now the victim is not pursuing the matter

570
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,680
I will also absolve you of your guilt

571
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,800
So should we continue to track down the assassin's whereabouts?

572
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,840
No need, your appearance has been exposed

573
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,080
The owner will make other arrangements

574
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,240
Does the victim already know the whereabouts of the assassin?

575
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,440
You don't have to pay attention to this anymore

576
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,240
If there is another errand, I will contact you

577
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,640
Yes, lord

578
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,400
What the hell are you doing again?

579
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,480
crutches

580
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,240
You already have a cane

581
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,960
Is this a cane?

582
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,960
How can it be used? Of course there must be a support point

583
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,280
Can support armpits

584
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,000
A crutch is called a crutch.

585
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,320
Such a weird cane?

586
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,960
It’s not weird. The worst thing is that I don’t know how to sew.

587
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,960
Otherwise you can sew a cushion here

588
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,560
This way it will be much more comfortable if it is attached to the armpit.

589
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,480
I know how to sew

590
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,000
Do you understand?

591
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,000
Done

592
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,520
It sews really well, let me try it

593
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,600
Much more comfortable

594
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,440
I might as well make one for Manager Tao later.

595
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,440
Thank you for the idea of ​​making such a crutch.

596
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,280
I really didn’t expect you to look like a man on weekdays.

597
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,960
Also know how to sew clothes

598
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,040
I know a lot of things to do

599
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,200
Nvhong, needlework, knitting, planting

600
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,160
Horse riding, sword dancing, archery

601
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,360
But it’s a pity that I can do appearance work but can’t cook.

602
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,240
Cooking skills are beyond my reach

603
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,480
My special skill is making soup

604
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,160
Make soup?
