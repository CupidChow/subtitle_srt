1
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Ah Qing, I really want to marry you

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,200
I mean seriously, don't exchange rings, don't

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,800
Have you ever thought about what it would be like to travel through time and space?

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,120
You can go back to before your girlfriend left you

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Looking for a way to remedy this?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,880
Time travel, official countdown

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,440
Shanrou, are you really unwilling to give up?

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,120
Betrayal of the organization will lead to death.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,800
Let me take your head and go back to receive the reward.

10
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,200
Who are you?

11
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,040
Why did it suddenly appear here?

12
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,960
hateful

13
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,560
Do you want to die? Be careful of being discovered by Zhao Jun

14
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,960
Why all the fuss?

15
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,960
This head is worth twenty taels of gold

16
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,200
Who are you?

17
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,560
assassin

18
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,840
assassin?

19
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,600
What's this?

20
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,360
Yes, what is this?

21
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,520
Well, you can lend it to me to study.

22
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,280
I'll tell you again

23
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,400
You don't have to show off here

24
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,520
If you want to survive, then recruit from the real situation.

25
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,280
Who sent you here?

26
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,320
Dude, I want you to figure one thing out first.

27
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
I have no ill intentions towards you at all

28
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,480
If there is no malice

29
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,200
Why did it appear here by such a coincidence?

30
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,200
It was a time machine that sent me here

31
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,360
So I show up here

32
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,680
How do I know why?

33
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,800
I've heard of hens and I've heard of big roosters

34
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,400
Time Chicken? I’ve never heard of it

35
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,240
Let me tell you, I was actually in AD...

36
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,120
That is...here two thousand years later in your life

37
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,640
Do you believe what I say?

38
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,160
It's nonsense

39
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,640
If you are knowledgeable and interested

40
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,760
Just hurry up and tell the truth.

41
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,960
What is your last name? Where do you come from?

42
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,320
My name is Xiang Shaolong, I am twenty-eight years old this year

43
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,240
Not married yet, a member of the Hong Kong SAR Government

44
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,880
Hong Kong SAR?

45
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,000
That's my hometown

46
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,200
You kid talks very strangely

47
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,720
Don't worry, I, Shanrou, have always been clear about grudges and grudges.

48
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,040
You finally saved me just now

49
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,720
If I kill you without asking why

50
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,680
I am kind and gentle, but I walk around the world without a face

51
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,080
Thank you, what you did is very...very correct

52
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,920
You saved me once, I'll let you go this time

53
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,120
There is no debt between the two of us

54
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,080
What exactly is this place?

55
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,920
Here? What is here?

56
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,240
This is where, here, here, etc.

57
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,560
What you said is quite strange

58
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,480
This place is called Panlong Town, don’t you know?

59
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,400
dumb uncle

60
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,880
So how far is Panlong Town from Xianyang?

61
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,000
You're such a brave boy

62
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,560
You are in Zhao State, how dare you ask how far is Xianyang City?

63
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
Will Qin Shihuang ascend the throne today?

64
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,360
Who is Qin Shihuang?

65
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,240
It’s Emperor Qin Yingzheng

66
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,800
I only know that Emperor Qin is a stranger and has just ascended the throne.

67
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,000
Then there are still three years to go?

68
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,720
What happened to that time machine?

69
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,080
Where is my bag? Where has it gone?

70
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,040
Have you seen my bag?

71
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,000
What did you do? Take my stuff

72
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,160
Give it back to me...Stop playing, people will die

73
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,040
Don't worry, this bag is poorly made

74
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,240
The stuff inside is worthless at all

75
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,560
I don’t even want it, give it to you

76
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,640
The dumb uncle’s craftsmanship is really exquisite

77
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,080
This bamboo cage is perfect for holding human heads.

78
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,400
Where do you want to go?

79
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,840
I don’t need your permission to go to Xianyang, right?

80
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,440
Make a deal with you

81
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,760
What deal?

82
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,040
You are so dressed up

83
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,520
I'm afraid you won't even get to Xianyang with your life.

84
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,360
You give me money and I will take you to Xianyang

85
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,080
Neuropathy

86
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,200
Do you really want to...

87
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,320
You have to wait three years to go to Xianyang before you can go back?

88
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,120
No one is around, my girlfriend ran away again

89
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,200
The communicator can't receive it either. He's dead.

90
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,840
Is there anyone…

91
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,960
Sir, what are you doing?

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,280
thank god

93
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Please come in, please...

94
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,560
I'm sorry to disturb you so late.

95
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,480
Young Master, you really speak harshly.

96
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,760
The two of us haven't greeted guests in a long time.

97
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,160
Wanjun, do you still remember?

98
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,040
The guest we had last time

99
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,320
When did it happen?

100
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,160
Last time...it's been a long time, I forgot about it

101
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,400
No one usually passes by our place.

102
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,720
I can meet the young master today

103
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,320
Finally we are destined for each other

104
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,040
Haven't you asked the young master for his name yet?

105
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,840
My name is Xiang Shaolong. I don’t know how to call you two.

106
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,720
My surname is Huang, this is a bitch

107
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,400
Inside the purchase?

108
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,800
I almost forgot

109
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,880
This bowl of soup is for you to drink, this is for you to eat

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,840
Drink it while it's hot. You'll feel warmer after drinking it.

111
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,080
good…

112
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,360
Sorry, I would like to ask

113
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,560
The soup contains... bamboo, leaves, branches...

114
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,280
And this is…

115
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,480
This is for you to eat with the soup

116
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,120
Sorry, we mountain people

117
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Some are just mediocre meals

118
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,880
I hope Mr. Xiang won’t be offended.

119
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,840
I just feel bad, I'm sorry...

120
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,040
Let's keep it hot, okay...

121
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:21,160
How is it? Does it taste good? Does it taste good?

122
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,600
It was delicious

123
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,040
Very delicious? He said very delicious...

124
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,920
Sorry, have you lived here for a long time?

125
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,560
Yes, starting from my great-grandfather’s generation

126
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,840
we already live here

127
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah?

128
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,360
Then you should know where this place is

129
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,920
Of course I know

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
What is this place?

131
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,280
This is Zhao State, yes

132
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,440
I know this is Zhao country

133
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,000
I would like to ask where in Zhao country this is?

134
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,680
Where is Zhao State here?

135
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Wanjun, do you remember that guest from last time?

136
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,080
once told us

137
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,480
Where did he say this was in the State of Zhao?

138
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,040
Think about it

139
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,080
It's been a long time since last time, I forgot

140
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
I have forgotten

141
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,520
Sir, you don’t have to worry

142
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,440
Although we two elders don’t know

143
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,920
But the people in the market must know

144
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,360
Yes. Is there a market here?

145
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,960
Yes, I remember there was a market

146
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,800
Every time we celebrate the New Year

147
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,640
They all take sweet potatoes and sell them.

148
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,440
So is this far from the market?

149
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,800
Not far, just walk west for two days

150
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,520
Just turn south and walk for a day and you'll be there.

151
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,720
Yes...it's true

152
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,240
That's really not too far

153
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,240
Not far

154
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,200
Not far, we feel we are very close

155
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,560
What's going on? It's not working anymore...

156
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,640
I think it must be the soup...it's so...

157
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,720
There is a toilet behind the house, please use it

158
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,240
What's up?

159
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,080
Is there any toilet paper…

160
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,960
Toilet paper? Toilet paper...what is it?

161
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
It's the kind you use to clean here after defecation.

162
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,840
I understand...

163
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,520
Is this it?

164
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Could it be this?

165
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,240
That’s right, feel free to use it

166
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,160
Thank you, I can’t hold it in anymore…

167
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Thank you very much for bothering you all night.

168
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,480
if i have a chance

169
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,480
I will definitely come back to see you, excuse me for bothering you.

170
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,160
Mr. Xiang, do you really want to stay for a day or two?

171
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,600
No way, I still have to go on my way

172
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,480
Wait...

173
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,160
What's up?

174
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,280
Mr. Xiang, our mountain people

175
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,600
nothing good

176
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,200
You can take these sweet potatoes to satisfy your hunger on the road.

177
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,600
no

178
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,240
You are going to take these sweet potatoes to sell in the market.

179
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,240
How can I take it away?

180
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,120
Mr. Xiang, don’t worry

181
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,360
As long as God creates beauty, it won’t take three or two months

182
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,760
We can grow a lot of sweet potatoes again

183
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,840
Yes...take it

184
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,080
If you don’t accept it, our hearts will not be happy

185
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,720
yes…

186
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,080
Take it... Take it

187
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,960
Take it

188
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,360
Thanks…

189
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,920
I have nothing to give you

190
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,400
I have some chocolate, although some of it is melted

191
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,560
But it’s delicious. I don’t think you’ve ever tasted it.

192
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,640
Is it edible?

193
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,240
Is this really edible?

194
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,720
It's edible. Try it. Eat it.

195
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,680
Haven't opened the paper yet

196
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,960
hurry up…

197
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,960
Jiaming, is it delicious?

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,200
So delicious

199
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,240
Let me try, Wanjun, you try too

200
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,320
So delicious Delicious

201
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,840
Mr. Xiang, how do you cook this thing?

202
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,840
You teach me

203
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,880
I can make some and sell them in the market

204
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,320
I think this... it's hard for you to cook now

205
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,160
This is called chocolate

206
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Chocolate…if so

207
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,200
You really need to collect it carefully and taste it slowly.

208
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,560
give it to me

209
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,440
you…

210
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,080
You two, I really have to leave

211
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,840
I will definitely come back if I have the chance

212
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,320
You have to remember, come back and visit us as soon as you have time

213
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,920
Mr. Xiang, walk slowly

214
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,040
walk slowly

215
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,000
Take care of yourself

216
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,240
Uncle, I want to ask you

217
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,840
Do you know which way to go to Xianyang?

218
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,040
Xianyang?

219
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
Xianyang

220
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,120
Did I hear you correctly? Do you really want to go to Xianyang?

221
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,680
Did something happen to Xianyang?

222
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,400
I have long thought that your clothes are a bit weird.

223
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,120
It turns out you are really from Qin

224
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,560
I have four sons in my family

225
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,480
All were killed by Qin’s dog thieves

226
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,840
Everyone, come here quickly and help me kill him

227
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,760
kill him...

228
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,360
Don't have such a big reaction

229
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,360
I just want to know which way to go to Xianyang

230
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,520
I don’t have to go, I’m just asking.

231
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,040
Everyone is old

232
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,040
Why are you so excited and wielding swords and sticks?

233
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,160
At worst, I'll just smile

234
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,040
Don't listen to him, beat him, beat him to death, beat him

235
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,560
Stop, stop fighting...

236
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Are you okay?

237
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,280
Please stop fighting, okay?

238
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,320
Don't fight

239
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,000
What happened? You are not even afraid of guns

240
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,200
Stop fighting. Please stop fighting.

241
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,440
After all, I am also G4 (VIP protection team)

242
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,400
I was beaten like a pig by you guys

243
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,360
So many barbecued pork buns?

244
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,080
You, a Qin thief, how dare you come here?

245
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,560
catch him

246
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,000
Help

247
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,800
Mount your horse

248
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
I thought I was going back in time

249
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,720
Ah Qing can come back to me

250
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,680
Now it's even questionable whether I can go back.

251
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,000
Have you never learned to write?

252
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,840
Why is it written so strangely?

253
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,720
What does it have to do with you?

254
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,360
If it weren't for me, a busybody

255
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,440
You have long been captured and made into a young man

256
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,080
Thank you

257
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,200
In fact, why are you rushing to Xianyang?

258
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,040
Even if you tell me, you won’t understand.

259
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,720
All in all, it’s very troublesome

260
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,240
Is it just for this word?

261
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,720
if i tell you

262
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,440
As long as I can rush to Xianyang as soon as possible

263
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,840
The woman I love will come back to me

264
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,640
Would you believe it?

265
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,840
Then I really can't see it

266
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,600
Besides being weird, you

267
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,000
Still a passionate seed

268
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,200
Brother, when I beg you

269
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,600
As long as you are willing to take me to Xianyang

270
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,760
I agree to anything

271
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,400
You don't even have half a copper coin on you.

272
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,200
What good will it do to me if I take you to Xianyang?

273
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Stop being such a philistine

274
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,440
Just help me, okay?

275
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,040
It's true, if you really take me to Xianyang

276
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,160
I will promise you anything

277
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,600
Promise to everything?

278
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,400
yes

279
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,120
OK, I want a rainbow in the sky

280
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,080
Are you kidding me?

281
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,960
Why don't you ask me to pick off the sun and give it to you?

282
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Isn’t it possible? Then I’m sorry that I can’t help you.

283
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,960
Why is this necessary?

284
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,360
Is it true that you will help me if I give you the rainbow?

285
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,320
Of course, the most important thing for a killer is to keep his word

286
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,280
I, Shanrou, can do whatever I say.

287
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,600
You said it, put your hand out, put it out

288
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,400
The whole rainbow...don't move

289
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,360
Is the entire rainbow here?

290
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,920
How did you do it?

291
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,840
Don't worry about it. Anyway, I'll give you the rainbow now.

292
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,200
You must take me to Xianyang

293
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,600
Give it to you

294
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,480
Why don't you take me to Xianyang?

295
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,800
Thanks…

296
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,320
Honestly, when will you take me to Xianyang?

297
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,680
I promised to take you there, but I didn't say I would go immediately

298
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,800
Isn't it?

299
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,520
What I mean is that you also need to have the strength to sit down.

300
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,440
man

301
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,680
Do you want to call the store?

302
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,480
store

303
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,880
Yes... come... do you want to order? Guest

304
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,840
Yes, what delicious food do you have here?

305
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,240
All the delicacies in our restaurant are written here

306
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,960
Are you illiterate?

307
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,040
Of course not, I want that

308
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,200
This?

309
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:35,800
yes

310
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,200
OK, be there soon

311
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,280
Guest officer please

312
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,520
I haven't eaten rice in a flower pot for a long time

313
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,680
Use slowly

314
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,560
You are so stupid, how can you eat without chopsticks?

315
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,960
Chopsticks?

316
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,480
It's the kind where two bamboos are used to pick up vegetables for dinner.

317
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,760
We call it chopsticks here

318
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,720
But it's just for sharing dishes, not for eating

319
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,560
So what to eat with?

320
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,960
Is there a place to wash your hands first?

321
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,480
Do you know much about horses?

322
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,480
I’m not trying to scare you, but the entire G4 has named me the Horse God.

323
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,520
G4?

324
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,280
G4 is my hometown

325
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,000
Isn’t your hometown Hong Kong SAR?

326
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,240
I haven’t finished yet, G4 is…

327
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,440
The name of one of the villages in Hong Kong SAR

328
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,360
This horse is bad, it has a lot of white marks

329
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,400
Look, your hair is still disheveled

330
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,520
This one is even worse, its coat is dull and dull

331
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,360
The horse is listless

332
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,960
You are pregnant, do you want to see a doctor?

333
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,800
This horse is even worse, unable to stand

334
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,640
As fat as a pig, sitting here

335
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,920
This one is very good, strong and without fat.

336
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,800
Just buy this one and win.

337
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,280
this horse

338
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,720
It's okay if it's used to compete in short sprints and quick falls.

339
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,400
If it runs for three or four hours

340
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,320
You will definitely foam at the mouth and die from exhaustion

341
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,160
If you choose to travel long distance, you must choose this one.

342
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,960
Because it is energetic, powerful and strong enough

343
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,560
And he’s fat enough to endure the hard work

344
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,560
Thanks to your hometown, they still make you the horse god.

345
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,920
Is that so? Then buy a pig

346
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,920
Why shouldn’t Xianyang go west?

347
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,520
This is Zhao State, so how can there be a direct road?

348
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,840
You and I will go to Handan first, and then change our route to Xianyang

349
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,280
You didn't mean to take a detour, did you?

350
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,240
Dulu? Is it your hometown dialect again?

351
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
I asked you if you took me a long way on purpose?

352
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,880
What good will it do me to walk a long way?

353
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
If you don't believe me, you can go on your own

354
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,920
ask you a question

355
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,120
Why did the last time I went to the market, I said I was going to Xianyang?

356
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,840
Those people will have such a big reaction when they hear it

357
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,360
Are the people clamoring to kill me?

358
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,200
Do you really not know or are you just pretending?

359
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,160
I remember the Battle of Changping

360
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,760
Qin killed Zhao and surrendered 400,000 troops.

361
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,840
Just this blood feud

362
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,000
I see you dying ten times is not enough

363
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,160
As you say

364
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,000
After we arrive in Handan, we won’t be able to reach Xianyang?

365
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,880
Although Qin and Zhao were in a melee,

366
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,640
But there is still business between them

367
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,200
As long as we blend in with Qi's business travelers

368
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,840
You can go to Xianyang

369
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,560
It's getting late, go to your lodging place as soon as possible

370
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,360
Are you staying here tonight?

371
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,440
certainly

372
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,360
Otherwise, there is no need for me to buy you an iron sword.

373
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,160
This is called the Samurai Lodge

374
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Nowadays, we have been fighting for many years, and everyone advocates force.

375
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,520
if you want to be respected

376
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,040
Either that or killing the enemy on the battlefield

377
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,720
Or be an excellent swordsman

378
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,680
All people with power or fame

379
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,560
Everyone likes to set up samurai villas like this

380
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,680
Facilitate recruitment of talents

381
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,560
As long as you carry an iron sword

382
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,680
You can stay here anytime

383
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,480
With an iron sword like this

384
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,560
Is it so good to spend the night here?

385
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Get away

386
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,000
Damn it, I can sit wherever I please.

387
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,640
kill him...

388
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,720
kill him...

389
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,880
My master appreciates it most

390
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,920
He is a hero like a strong man

391
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,480
Please come with me and introduce me to my master

392
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,080
Is this okay?

393
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,520
Become a king and defeat a bandit, die without regrets

394
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,800
If you want to survive in this day and age

395
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,760
You must know one and a half moves

396
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,600
Otherwise, you will be hacked to death at any time

397
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,960
You may not be able to reach Xianyang City

398
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,120
What's there to see?

399
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,360
I told you before...you have a lot of brains

400
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,160
You must be beheading people again

401
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,320
Then go collect the bounty, that kind of thing

402
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,120
Unlawful assembly? Let’s go

403
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,680
Wait

404
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,240
It must be weird to have so many people here in the middle of the night

405
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,640
Juzi really has a good plan

406
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,400
Yuan Zong always regarded himself as upright and aboveboard

407
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,760
He never dreamed that I would drug the wine.

408
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,720
In short, as long as Yuan Zong becomes more toxic,

409
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,360
You all swarmed up

410
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,240
When the time comes, Ju Zi Ling will be in our pocket.

411
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,000
You two are so brave

412
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,880
How dare you break into General Zhao Mo’s headquarters at night? What’s the conspiracy?

413
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,440
I told you not to come down a long time ago

414
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,680
Yan Juzi, you have misunderstood

415
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,680
In fact, this matter...

416
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,120
Are you annoyed?

417
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,520
You've done this dozens of times during filming, why do you still do this?

418
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,520
Help…

419
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,840
We've been walking all night, let's take a rest first

420
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,320
What concealed weapon did you use just now?

421
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,080
Even if I tell you, you won’t understand.

422
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
How is your injury?

423
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,760
Let me take a look for you. No need.

424
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,480
Just look at it, it would be bad if it becomes inflamed

425
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,560
I'll wash the wound, and you'll look after me

426
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
The man is so effeminate

427
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,800
How can I use a guard when washing a wound? It’s really troublesome

428
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,760
If I didn't call you, you must not turn around

429
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,440
Okay, be careful about snakes

430
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,960
I'm not afraid of snakes

431
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,400
What? There’s a snake…

432
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,040
Frog, hurry up and help me catch the frog.

433
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Help me catch the frog, hurry up

434
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,360
Help...

435
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,120
Are you still watching? Didn’t you just watch enough?

436
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,280
You are usually a man

437
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,800
How did I know that you turned into a woman when you took the water?

438
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
Is it okay for a woman to just stare?

439
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,720
Men are fair and righteous when it comes to women

440
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,920
It's not a big problem, right?

441
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,080
Goddamn

442
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,080
This world is because of you stinky men

443
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,720
Only women have no status

444
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,400
I tell you

445
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,280
I have absolutely no gender discrimination against men or women.

446
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,360
Are you still laughing?

447
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,520
If you don’t laugh, you won’t laugh. Why are you so cruel?

448
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,680
I never expected a cold-blooded killer like you.

449
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,680
To be afraid of such a small frog

450
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,960
Could really use that...

451
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,360
"This killer is not too cold" to describe you

452
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,440
Damn it, can't killers be afraid of frogs?

453
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,680
I kill people, not frogs

454
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,920
If you weren't careless

455
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
Would I end up hiding here in such a mess?

456
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,600
It's pretty good now

457
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,000
There is both dry firewood and a strong fire, and a man and a woman alone.

458
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,440
also said

459
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,000
Don't draw your sword easily, you are a girl

460
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,080
Come, have some roast chicken...it's almost ready

461
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,680
frog…

462
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,200
Rude…

463
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:02,320
Qing, don’t leave, I want to marry you

464
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,240
Aren't you? Are you still planning to go back to find him?

465
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,920
Of course, Yan Ping's head is worth fifty taels of gold

466
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,800
Are you crazy?

467
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,960
Didn't you see that he was so good at martial arts last night and had so many people?

468
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,240
I was almost killed by him

469
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,200
That’s why we need to think of a foolproof strategy

470
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,720
Go away, do you hear me?

471
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,480
You should stay at home until you die, go away

472
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,560
You damn old man, why don't you leave?

473
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,160
Don't hit

474
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,520
Stop eating buns

475
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,520
Look, that uncle was beaten when he was dozens of years old

476
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,560
Can you help him?

477
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,960
Uncle, why did you give me the bun?

478
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,560
Sir, please forgive me...

479
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,320
stop

480
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,320
Everyone has stopped, so why fight?

481
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,600
Don't fight, brother, don't fight

482
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,360
Stop fighting...little brother, don't cause trouble and kill people.

483
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,320
Don't kick your feet

484
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,960
Little brother, just for my sake

485
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,040
forgive them

486
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,720
Didn't you hear?

487
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,640
This little brother has forgiven you

488
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,680
You guys aren't leaving yet?

489
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,520
Go... go...

490
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,280
Thanks to you just now, little brother

491
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,720
Savior

492
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,360
Savior?

493
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,440
Disciples meet with Master Yuan

494
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,960
Are you a disciple of Junior Brother Yan?

495
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,520
The family teacher learned that Uncle Yuan had arrived

496
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,480
A specially ordered disciple came to pick up Master Yuan and take him to the other garden to talk about it.

497
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,480
Finally, Junior Brother Yan still remembers me

498
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,680
Little brother, thank you for helping me just now

499
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,560
I'm sorry, I have something to do.

500
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,480
Can't have a good drink with my little brother

501
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,400
See you again someday, please

502
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,960
please

503
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,520
Did you see it just now?

504
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,720
He is in his fifties and his surname is Yuan. Could it be that he is really him?

505
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,280
I asked you if you saw it just now?

506
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,680
Do you know

507
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,120
Who was that old man just now?

508
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,480
How do I know who he is?

509
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,280
We heard his name last night

510
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
Yuan Zong?

511
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,200
Not bad, if it weren't for him

512
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,440
You have already been torn into pieces

513
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,080
That's bad, Yuan Zong must be in danger now

514
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,040
Don't worry, I won't let Yan Ping's evil plan succeed.

515
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,800
Junior Brother Yan

516
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,520
Are you really willing to support the three inks becoming one?

517
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,720
certainly

518
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,280
I remember when Patriarch Mo Zhai founded the Mohists Guild

519
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,080
I also want to help the world and eliminate war.

520
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,320
It's a pity that several uncles and uncles later lost their temper due to temporary anger.

521
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,800
Only then did the Mohists' Guild divide into

522
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,600
Zhao Mo, Wei Mo and Qi Mo

523
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,240
If there is really a way

524
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,400
If you can make the three inks merge into one

525
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,520
Yan will definitely be the first to agree

526
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,160
With the words of Junior Brother Yan

527
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,640
The integration of the three inks will surely be just around the corner

528
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,800
Yan Mou first toasts to Senior Brother Yuan for a drink

529
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,320
I wish the three inks can successfully merge into one

530
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,840
Be careful, someone wants to harm you

531
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,160
Did you poison the wine?

532
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,560
Hand over the huge order

533
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,040
Get on board

534
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,040
stand firm, be gentle, act

535
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,040
Chase

536
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,480
Neuropathy

537
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,800
Stop the ship

538
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,720
stop

539
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,160
Mount your horse

540
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,480
I just have a skin injury.

541
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,320
No need to rest here

542
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,640
No, if the elders didn't save us

543
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,640
won't be hurt

544
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,280
We must take care of you until you recover

545
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,600
Only then will we feel at ease, don’t you think?

546
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,680
yes

547
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
Besides, there are big traitors everywhere.

548
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,320
Uncle, you'd better take a rest.

549
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,040
In this case, I will rest here

550
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,080
Why has your temperament changed?

551
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,520
I helped people heal their wounds and bought two more chickens.

552
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,360
What do you want to gain?

553
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,520
Maybe I am close to you often and influenced by you

554
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,080
Yes, isn’t this a nice thing for a girl’s family?

555
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,360
When you open your mouth, fight or talk about money.

556
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,840
How can anyone dare to want you?

557
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,480
What does it have to do with you if I want anyone?

558
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,480
I'm afraid if no one wants you

559
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,680
It would be terrible if you force me to have you.

560
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,800
I'm scared when you kill chickens on the mountainside

561
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
I'd better go back first

562
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,040
(Grilled chicken wings, I have loved eating them since I was a child)

563
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,080
Is this called a unique secret skill?

564
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,000
It's quite unique.

565
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,600
With my distance

566
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,880
Grill those chicken wings over slow heat

567
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,600
Plus use this...you take it first

568
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,320
Plus use this love honey

569
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,000
Apply to the skin of chicken wings

570
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,800
It will become the most delicious chicken wings in the world

571
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,400
It's hard for me to help you find honey

572
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,880
It's red and swollen after being stung by a bee. Take it.

573
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,000
to be honest

574
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,080
Why are you so nice to that senior Yuan?

575
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,880
I'm doing it for your own good too

576
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
I think you also know the true identity of the elders

577
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,440
He is the descendant of the Mohists Guild

578
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,680
Thanks

579
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,760
That is to say

580
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,840
The elders took charge of the Juzi Order of the Mohists Guild

581
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,400
Rules of the Guild of Inkers

582
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,960
Seeing a huge son is like seeing a huge son

583
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,160
That is to say

584
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,000
The elders have the highest power in the Mohist Guild

585
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,920
No wonder that big traitor wants the Ju Zi Ling so much

586
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,360
Also, the veteran’s Mozi swordsmanship

587
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,280
Already practiced to the point of perfection

588
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,040
If he is willing to teach you one and a half moves

589
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,640
I believe you will benefit from it all your life

590
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,920
How do you know he will be willing to teach me?

591
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,200
Then look at your blessings

592
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,600
And your unique secret skill

593
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,040
You should have said it earlier

594
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,600
If I had known better, I would have sent out braised chicken wings

595
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,480
Coke Chicken Wings and Swiss Chicken Wings

596
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,640
What good are honey chicken wings alone?

597
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,280
Severe?

598
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,720
Senior, you are in luck

599
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,160
How is it? Senior

600
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,640
Are my honey chicken wings delicious?

601
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,520
You saw seniors eating fast and a lot

602
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,160
I know it's delicious

603
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,960
You two little brats, you don’t have to sing in unison.

604
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,840
Since I ate your chicken wings

605
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,640
I already expected you to ask for something.

606
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,760
Just say it

607
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,320
If I can do it, I will definitely agree to it.

608
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,240
That’s right, actually I wanted to…

609
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,240
In fact, he has always admired your swordsmanship, senior

610
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,400
I hope to become your teacher

611
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,840
You want me to be your teacher? I don’t think so.

612
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,120
But if the little brother is really interested

613
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,960
Then I will teach you one and a half moves.

614
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,800
Thanks

615
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,680
What…

616
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,040
Thank you, means thank you

617
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,520
Before I officially teach you Mozi’s swordsmanship

618
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,560
You have to promise me something first

619
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,680
Senior, just ask

620
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,040
You should remember it well

621
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,680
Mozi's swordsmanship aims to save people from danger

622
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,560
Don’t kill innocent people indiscriminately

623
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,840
After you learn Mozi's swordsmanship,

624
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,840
If you do many unjust things, you will be punished by God one day

625
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Senior, please rest assured, I will definitely remember it

626
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,680
I'd better avoid it first

627
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,880
Little brother, you are pretty good at it, come again

628
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,680
Little brother’s skills

629
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,680
I don’t know which school you are from?

630
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,080
Actually I learned it in the police academy, senior

631
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,680
Police academy?

632
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,200
I have been traveling around the world for many years

633
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,400
Never heard of such a sect before

634
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,520
How could the seniors of such a small sect like me have heard of it?

635
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,000
There is no priority in learning, those who master come first

636
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,240
With your martial arts foundation

637
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,320
Plus my Mozi swordsmanship

638
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,880
I believe you will travel the world in the future

639
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,960
There must be something to be done

640
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,160
We don’t have much time, let’s stop chatting, let’s get started

641
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,120
Senior, your martial arts are so powerful

642
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,880
If used to travel around the world

643
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,840
Can you really become the leader of the martial arts alliance?

644
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,920
Why are you in this situation?

645
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,120
Do you know who my ancestor is?

646
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,160
Senior is playing with the Mozi Sword

647
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,520
Your ancestor should be Mozi

648
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,200
Once the Patriarch went to lobby the King of Qi

649
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,640
Stop attacking Lu

650
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,360
Met a friend on the way

651
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,840
His friend advised the patriarch that

652
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,160
Nowadays, people in the world do a lot of injustice

653
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,520
Why are you alone?

654
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,400
Doing something like this that you know will have no results?

655
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,960
The Patriarch answered him:

656
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,400
Suppose there are ten brothers and nine of them are very lazy

657
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,080
If you have fields but don’t cultivate them, then what’s left will be

658
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,280
What do you think should be done?

659
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,200
Of course we have to work harder

660
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,640
Why?

661
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,040
If even he doesn't farm

662
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,320
Then wouldn’t these ten brothers starve to death together?

663
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,480
Little brother, you are really amazing

664
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,040
It’s best if you understand this truth

665
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,320
There are many things to do…

666
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,000
Doing it knowing you can’t do it…

667
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,600
Actually, it was taught by Sir before.

668
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,960
Sir?

669
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,360
Sir is just like you

670
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,760
people who teach me things

671
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,720
Hero, spare your life

672
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,400
Don't worry, I'm not trying to kill you

673
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,640
I just want you to deliver a message for me

674
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,600
Go back and tell your master

675
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,600
If he wants to capture Yuan Zong

676
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,560
It will be when the sun sets tonight

677
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,800
Arrive at Black Wind Mountain, listen clearly

678
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,240
Not too early, not too late, you know?

679
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,680
Know

680
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,800
good…

681
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,680
Senior, take a break and eat some fruit.

682
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,400
good

683
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,280
Come

684
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,760
Seniors, how is the progress of my brother Xiang?

685
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,240
Even worse than what I did back then.

686
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,200
Senior, don't say that

687
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,720
I should thank you

688
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,960
Yan Ping, since you are here

689
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,720
Why don't you come out to see me?
