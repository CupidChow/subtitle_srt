1
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,320
you are such a good mother

2
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,920
My son likes to eat Tianxianglou’s dim sum.

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,800
Come and buy it right away

4
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Just buying snacks along the way

5
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,480
Actually I want to buy a big gift

6
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,680
Tell the truth

7
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,360
Pan'er and Shao Yuanjun had feuds more than once

8
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,640
To calm people down

9
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,480
I want to buy a decent gift

10
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,920
Sent to Mrs. Pingyuan's Mansion

11
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,760
Apologize for Pan'er, so as not to cause trouble in the future

12
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,320
你真是面面俱到

13
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,400
You haven’t had many important things to do lately

14
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,040
Why are you free to accompany me today?

15
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,200
Is there anything more important than being with you?

16
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,960
You are not afraid that the Marquis will find out...

17
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,840
It's Mrs. Ya and your Xiang Shaolong

18
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,080
Xiang Shaolong is Xiang Shaolong, this lady is this lady

19
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,720
Why do you compare us?

20
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,880
You said you want to try Tianxianglou’s skillful dim sum, let’s go

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
This hosta is very elegant

22
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,040
But the setting work of this hairpin is very fine.

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,280
This jade bracelet is a bit noble. Which one should I buy?

24
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,800
It doesn't matter what you buy

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,960
The most important thing is that your son makes progress

26
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,920
Otherwise, you can help him remedy this

27
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,600
You can't make up for it even if you go bankrupt

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,440
In fact, Pan'er has grown a lot recently

29
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,360
Speaking of which, I really want to thank you for being such a good master.

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,240
Actually, I really want to ask you for help with something.

31
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,120
What's up?

32
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,880
Don't worry

33
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,960
I'm not asking you to help me save Qin's protons

34
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,080
I just want you to tell King Zhao for me

35
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,240
I want to help Xiaotu redeem himself

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,560
Help Xiaotu redeem himself?

37
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,840
Yes, Xiaotu is having a fight with my friend

38
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,320
How can I not help her when she has a problem?

39
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,840
And I promised her I would take her out of the palace

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,440
I wanted to talk to you and see if you can help?

41
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,840
if you can help

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,640
I would like to thank you on behalf of Xiaotu

43
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,440
Little Rabbit is... from the palace

44
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,880
I'm afraid it's not easy to redeem her life.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,720
But you are always King Zhao’s sister

46
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,160
If you open your mouth, it shouldn't be a big problem

47
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,880
Shaolong, you don’t know something anymore

48
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,680
The palace has its own rules

49
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,240
You can't change it just by asking for it at any moment.

50
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,800
The matter of redeeming Xiaotu must be considered in the long term.

51
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,120
Don't be too impatient

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,200
Bring the wine, here it comes

53
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,800
If you drink any more you will really get drunk

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,160
leave me alone

55
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,800
Even if you see Xiang Shaolong with that woman

56
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,760
You don't need to drink so much

57
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,280
Could it be that Xiang Shaolong

58
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,960
Is it really worth it for you to hurt yourself for him?

59
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,680
I won’t hurt myself for Xiang Shaolong

60
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,280
I won't be sad for him

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,520
Fang'er

62
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,760
Mr. Lian, is Miss Wu ok?

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,920
she drank too much

64
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,680
Do you have any spare rooms here?

65
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,640
have…

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,840
Xiang Shaolong, you clearly know my feelings for you

67
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,720
Why do you still treat me like this?

68
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,320
Dead thief

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,760
Xiang Shaolong

70
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,640
Dead thief

71
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,520
lewd thief

72
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,680
Do you know I really love you?

73
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,640
madam, please

74
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,560
The shop shipped a batch of fine wine from the Western Regions yesterday

75
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,400
Madam, do you want to taste it?

76
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,840
It’s really good wine

77
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,640
If our uncle Xiang is not satisfied

78
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,320
He will really tear down your Tianxiang Tower sign

79
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,280
If you are not satisfied, just take down my sign

80
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,080
The one who was drinking with Lian Jin just now

81
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,560
Is it Miss Wu?

82
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,640
Yes, she was so drunk just now

83
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,200
What do you think she is doing in the wing room with Lian Jin now?

84
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,440
Lian Jin

85
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,520
How are you?

86
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,640
You pervert, you are so despicable, go away

87
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,880
What do you want?

88
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,160
Want to get rid of big harm

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,760
You can't take her away

90
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,840
Neuropathy

91
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,480
Bold Lian Jin, do you even want to kill me?

92
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,760
He really went too far

93
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,440
I just wanted to rape Fang'er, now I want to kill you again

94
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,720
Mrs. Ya, don't listen to his nonsense

95
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,160
Fang'er and I are in love

96
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,160
I would never do such a thing

97
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,720
As the saying goes, those who are purified themselves will purify themselves. If this matter is purely a misunderstanding

98
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,000
Why should Uncle Lian get so angry?

99
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,640
So be it, now Miss Wu is unconscious

100
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,440
Staying in a hotel room is always inconvenient

101
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,360
If even uncle doesn’t object

102
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,120
Let me send Miss Wu back to the ranch.

103
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,720
Could it be that even the uncle and my wife can’t trust me?

104
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,400
Madam Ya, Lian Jin has absolutely no intention of doing this.

105
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,800
In this case, there is Mrs. Lloyd

106
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,360
Fortunately you arrived in time, otherwise something would have happened

107
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,880
Stop talking and leave this place of right and wrong as soon as possible

108
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,720
How are you? Are you awake?

109
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,160
Slow down...are you okay?

110
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,200
Xiang Shaolong, why are you here?

111
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,720
Don't ask, how are you? Are you still dizzy?

112
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,920
Why do you think I'm here?

113
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,280
You were drunk just now, I wanted to splash you with water to wake you up

114
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,440
So I moved you here, is everything okay?

115
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,320
What happened?

116
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,200
Stop asking

117
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,760
So do you. Check the whereabouts of protons.

118
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Make it like this now

119
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
I almost slept with someone, you know?

120
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,240
Why did you think about it for so long? My feet are numb thinking about it.

121
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,600
Fortunately, I arrived just in time, otherwise...

122
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,000
I really can't imagine

123
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,560
Lian Jin, how dare you do this to me?

124
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,720
I told you a long time ago that he is not a good person.

125
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,920
You only believe it now

126
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,280
It's all your fault

127
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,720
What? What does it have to do with me?

128
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,280
If I hadn't seen you with that whore

129
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,760
I won't get drunk at all

130
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,080
Stop cheating

131
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,200
I still blame others, but fortunately Mrs. Ya

132
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,360
Otherwise, I would have died just now, and you would have been...

133
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
no

134
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,800
It's my fault, you and that whore are all right

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,560
great

136
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,400
wake up

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,920
Don't scare me

138
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,960
No, what should I do if I just die like this?

139
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,240
Artificial respiration…

140
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,040
Wake up... come on...

141
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,840
Wake up, okay

142
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,240
What are you doing?

143
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,600
What to do?

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,240
You damn thief, taking advantage of others' danger, you are not a human being

145
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,600
you go

146
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,320
You don't care if my feet are hurt

147
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,120
I've never seen someone rescuing someone like this.

148
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,840
You haven't seen many things

149
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,760
How can I explain it to you?

150
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,360
Have you ever seen Salted Egg Superman?

151
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,360
Really want to know what Salted Egg Superman is?

152
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,200
Let's go, it's getting dark soon

153
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,960
Go take a hot bath

154
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,160
It would be bad if the cold bacteria infects the intestines and stomach

155
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,040
You are simply unreasonable

156
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
Molesting women in public

157
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,240
Now people are coming to investigate

158
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,880
How do you explain to others when you call me dad?

159
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,360
Dad, I just touched her face

160
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,600
You did something wrong and you said something harsh

161
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,720
How about I apologize to her face to face?

162
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,640
She is a young lady, her reputation is at stake

163
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,200
Is it okay to apologize?

164
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,600
What else? Could it be that I touched her face?

165
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,560
Do you want to marry her back to be your wife?

166
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,400
you…

167
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,400
father

168
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,760
If you touch your face, you will get married.

169
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,840
Then I gave you artificial respiration just now, wasn’t it...

170
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,200
You also said, dead lecher

171
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,000
Just kidding, don't lose your temper

172
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,720
Is it okay to joke about something like this?

173
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,680
The most important thing for you young ladies is the chastity arch.

174
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,040
Don't worry, I, Xiang Shaolong, will definitely take responsibility

175
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,080
Brother Xiang, wet, eldest lady

176
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,080
Mr. Tao, you also...why...

177
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,200
It turns out that your eldest lady talks a lot

178
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,480
Sprayed all over people's bodies and faces

179
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,760
Really? Of course

180
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,720
I went back to my room

181
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,960
If you are really afraid of catching a cold

182
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Add some coarse salt to the hot water, it will be useful

183
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,360
You two...

184
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,640
Hard to describe in one word

185
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,760
If you touch your face, you will get married.

186
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,040
Then I gave you artificial respiration just now, wasn’t it...

187
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,240
You also said

188
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,880
Don't worry, I, Xiang Shaolong, will definitely take responsibility

189
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,880
You have to be responsible

190
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,960
I was wondering who came to visit so early

191
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,240
It turned out to be Uncle Lian

192
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,320
Tao Fang, where is the lady?

193
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,320
The young lady said that she never wants to see Uncle Lian again in the future.

194
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Uncle Lian, since my daughter doesn’t want to see you

195
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,160
Why don't you...I'm here to apologize today.

196
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,400
Are you here to apologize?

197
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,800
Because yesterday I temporarily offended Fang'er

198
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,960
So today I came here specifically to apologize to Lord Wubao.

199
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,880
What happened to Uncle Lian and Fang'er?

200
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,640
Since Fang'er doesn't want to mention this matter

201
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,920
Even Jin is inconvenient to say more.

202
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,360
I just want to tell Lord Wu Bao

203
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,320
I am sincere to Fang'er

204
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,840
So today, in addition to asking for forgiveness, I

205
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,520
Or come here specifically to propose marriage?

206
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,240
Propose marriage?

207
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,000
Here is a pair of luminous pearls

208
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,920
If Lord Wubao doesn’t dislike it

209
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,080
Think of it as Lian Jin’s betrothal gift to Lord Wubao.

210
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,840
My daughter is still young and has not yet gotten married.

211
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,760
Wu Mou accepted Uncle Lian's kindness with heart.

212
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Does Lord Wubao mind Lian Jin’s identity?

213
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,360
If I am willing to leave Juluhou Mansion

214
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,800
Will the Lord of Ubau reconsider the proposal of marriage?

215
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,320
Uncle Lian is willing to leave Prince Hou's Mansion?

216
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,120
For Fang'er, I'm willing to give up everything

217
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,680
But Uncle Lian is a popular person around the prince

218
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,640
The number one swordsman has an unlimited future

219
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,200
Don’t you feel it’s a pity that you left so rashly?

220
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,160
In Lian Jin's mind

221
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,280
Nothing is more important than Fang'er

222
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,640
It seems that Uncle Lian is deeply devoted to Fang'er

223
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,680
Wait for Wu to discuss this matter with my daughter.

224
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,800
Reply again

225
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,880
Lord of Fort Xiewu

226
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,800
Please come back first and wait for my news

227
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,320
Lian Jin went back first and waited for the good news from Lord Wubao.

228
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,200
No more gifts

229
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,800
Master, do you really consider taking Miss

230
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,120
Betrothed to Lian Jin?

231
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,960
Lian Jin is indeed a talent

232
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,440
If he is willing to help us, he will be very helpful in rescuing the protons.

233
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,800
It is indeed beneficial without any harm

234
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,640
But this matter is related to the lady’s lifelong happiness

235
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,640
As far as I know, the lady’s true heart is...

236
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,040
I'll discuss it with Fang'er before making a decision.

237
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,200
This morning, Uncle Xiang sent me a pack of mint leaves.

238
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,720
He said just crush mint leaves

239
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,880
Then wrap the mint leaves with gauze

240
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,840
Put it to your nose and smell it when necessary

241
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,440
It can cure nasal congestion. Miss, you might as well try it.

242
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,520
How about it?

243
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
really effective

244
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,040
This thief is really not simple

245
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,000
As if he knows everything

246
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,840
Uncle Xiang really cares about Miss

247
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,440
Sending a package of mint leaves is called caring

248
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,040
I don't care about it

249
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,680
Who angered my good daughter?

250
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,720
father

251
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,760
Dad, do you have something to say to your daughter?

252
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,640
Fang'er, Dad just remembered

253
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,520
When I taught you to ride a horse, you were only four years old

254
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,600
I didn’t expect you to be an adult now

255
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,040
My daughter also remembers

256
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,400
When my daughter saw a horse for the first time

257
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,800
I was so scared that I cried all night

258
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,320
But now you are a real hero

259
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,880
It all depends on dad’s teachings.

260
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's why dad is worried

261
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,520
You grew up on a ranch and worked with horses all day long.

262
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,160
Develop a rough and heroic character

263
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,880
Dad is very worried that your husband will be afraid of you in the future.

264
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,720
Dad, where did you go?

265
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,800
My daughter never thought about getting married too early.

266
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,560
Even if no one is willing to marry me, my daughter still has a father to support her

267
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,040
Silly girl, my daughter’s family always wants to get married.

268
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,840
Fang'er, dad wants to ask you

269
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,960
Do you have a special someone?

270
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,800
For example, the one who offended you yesterday

271
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,640
What did he say to his father?

272
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,000
He apologized to his father early this morning

273
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,160
Also...he proposed marriage to his father

274
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Did he really propose marriage to his father?

275
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,760
How is it? Do you like it or not?

276
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,600
A shameless person like him

277
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,520
My daughter will definitely not marry him

278
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,720
Since you are not satisfied, dad will reject him

279
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,880
No, dad

280
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,960
If dad really thinks he is sincere

281
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,040
Can be entrusted for life

282
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,640
My daughter’s marriage should be decided by her father.

283
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,000
Just now you said he was shameless

284
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,280
What kind of moral character he has, dad should know best

285
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,840
Dad always felt that his identity was a bit suspicious

286
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,960
Is his identity suspicious?

287
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,440
Didn’t dad say that he is from Qin like us?

288
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,480
He is also from Qin

289
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,240
Then does he have other motives for hanging around Zhao Mu?

290
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,360
Hanging around Zhao Mu? Who are you talking about?

291
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,600
Of course it's Lian Jin

292
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,840
What dad means is

293
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,400
It is Lian Jin who proposes marriage to you, not...

294
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,480
If not Lian Jin, who else?

295
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,680
Dad, you don’t have to say it anymore

296
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,360
My daughter will definitely not marry Lian Jin

297
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,280
Such a despicable person

298
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,760
Fang'er

299
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,200
Xiang Shaolong, you don’t keep your word

300
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,360
You said you would be responsible, but now you...

301
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,080
What?

302
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,920
Is there something wrong with mint leaves?

303
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,680
I go to the toilet

304
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,520
Lord of Uborg

305
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,360
Brother Lien is indeed punctual

306
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,160
Jin couldn't get a reply from the Lord of Wubao for one day.

307
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,400
Really having trouble sleeping and eating

308
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,280
Wu Mou discussed this matter with his daughter

309
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,800
What does Fang'er mean?

310
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,360
But unfortunately... my daughter has no intention of getting married for the time being.

311
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,000
Is Lian Jin willing to leave Juluhou Mansion?

312
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,680
Lord Wubao and Fang'er were also unmoved.

313
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,840
No, even brothers can be punctual and trustworthy

314
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,760
I have no doubt about your integrity.

315
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,560
It's a pity...

316
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,800
The so-called good birds choose trees to roost in

317
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,840
For Fang'er, I am willing to go through fire and water.

318
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,320
As long as Lord Wubao gives me some time

319
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,320
I can definitely prove everything with actions

320
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,920
Why are you bothering?

321
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,440
Lord Wubao, you can rest assured

322
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,840
The so-called one person does things and one person is responsible

323
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,880
I will never implicate the people of Wuzhi Ranch

324
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,320
Waiting for my good news

325
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,080
farewell

326
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,240
The Marquis ordered Lian Jin to come

327
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,920
I have something important to discuss with my wife

328
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,720
Could it be that the Marquis wants to have a short get-together with Zhu Ji again tonight?

329
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,600
Mr. Hou has something important to do tonight

330
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,200
No need for a wife to accompany you

331
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,840
For a person who has been imprisoned here for many years

332
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,120
For a woman who has never seen the light of day

333
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,200
Sometimes you can go out and wait for the Marquis’ favor

334
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,200
That's not a bad thing either

335
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,320
Lian Jin always felt that he wanted his wife to devote herself to the Marquis.

336
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,320
It would be too difficult for my wife

337
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,760
If these words fall into the ears of the Marquis,

338
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,360
He will be very unhappy

339
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,400
Lian Jin believed this

340
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,960
Madam will never tell Mr. Hou

341
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,280
You are so bold. Are you not afraid of being beheaded?

342
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,240
For the woman I love

343
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
I have no choice but to make this decision

344
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,160
Did Lu Cheng really send people to Handan to rescue Zhu Ji?

345
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,960
yes

346
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,600
It's a pity that the visitors were never able to find out the whereabouts of my wife, mother and son.

347
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,600
But why would you risk helping us?

348
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,600
Because Lian Jin fell in love with the visitor's daughter

349
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,760
The conditions offered by the other party

350
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,160
They just want Lian Jin to help them

351
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,480
Find out the whereabouts of the lady, mother and son

352
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,400
Only then was he willing to marry his daughter to Lian Jin

353
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,200
I didn’t expect Lian Jin to be such a passionate person

354
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,120
Madam laughed at her, but the other party wanted to make sure everything was safe

355
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,000
The wife must present an object

356
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,760
Can prove the identity of the lady

357
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,800
Only then are you willing to believe Lian Jin’s words

358
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,560
You hand this square brocade handkerchief to the visitor.

359
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,200
They rely on the patterns on the brocade handkerchief

360
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
will confirm Zhu Ji’s identity

361
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,680
That's right, the pattern on the brocade handkerchief

362
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,000
Exactly the same as the engraving on the ring

363
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,240
It seems that the other party is really Zhu Ji

364
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,680
Finally lived up to the trust of Lord Wubao

365
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,000
you did well

366
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,840
Now that the other party's identity has been confirmed,

367
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,120
Can you tell me Zhu Ji's whereabouts?

368
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,320
Zhu Ji had something to say first because she wanted to confirm it

369
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,280
Is the identity of the person who came to rescue her true?

370
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,520
So she hoped that Lord Wubao would write a letter in his own hand

371
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,120
Then let me take it back

372
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,320
After she saw the letter

373
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,080
Will naturally reveal where you are

374
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,320
Okay, that makes sense

375
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,640
Wu will repair the book immediately and ask you to take it back.

376
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,040
Wu Yingyuan, the old fox’s evidence of collaborating with the enemy

377
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,560
Finally fell into the hands of this lord

378
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,200
Of course, if you hadn't come forward, Zhu Ji, this bitch,

379
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,480
Nor will the secrets contained in the keepsake be revealed.

380
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,320
It's a good trick to kill two birds with one stone, but you want to get it

381
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,800
But I believe you will also get a lot of benefits

382
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,040
Zhu Ji, a bitch, wanted to escape from Handan

383
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,200
I will definitely do my best to you

384
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,800
Mr. Hou, please don’t misunderstand me.

385
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,320
Lian Jin would never dare to treat the Marquis’ woman

386
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
Having wrong thoughts

387
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,600
I'm sorry you don't dare either

388
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,440
Besides, you already have a Miss Wu family in your heart.

389
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,840
It's a pity that this is the case

390
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,040
I'm afraid it will be difficult for you to become the Wu family's son-in-law.

391
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,520
As long as we can grasp the evidence of Wu Yingyuan's collusion with the enemy,

392
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,800
other things

393
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,680
I believe that Mr. Hou will definitely make the decision for me.

394
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,960
You can rest assured

395
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,760
As long as we can successfully uproot Wuzhi Ranch

396
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,080
After the matter is completed, the eldest lady of the Wu family

397
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,240
Of course it's up to you.

398
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Thanks to Mr. Hou for making it happen

399
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,280
Wu Yingyuan, I have always trusted you.

400
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,680
You actually had an affair with Qin State Lu Buwei

401
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,000
Plot to rescue Qin's hostage

402
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,240
Now that the evidence is conclusive, how do you explain it?

403
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,800
Return to the king, I am loyal to the king

404
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,400
How could he have an affair with Qin?

405
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,280
There must be some misunderstanding about this matter

406
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,160
Bold Wu Yingyuan

407
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,720
Now you still want to make excuses

408
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,720
A secret letter written by you to Zhu Ji

409
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,720
It's your evidence

410
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,320
A secret letter written by me personally?

411
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,160
This thing is really strange

412
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,440
Your Majesty, could you please let me have a look at the secret letter?

413
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,320
I don't think they would worry about taking out a secret letter

414
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,520
We will burn the secret letter.

415
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,840
I'm sorry you don't dare either

416
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,720
Your Majesty, show them to them

417
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,920
Let them die with conviction

418
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,480
Lord of Uborg

419
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,960
You can't even recognize your own handwriting, right?

420
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,160
The handwriting of this sealed letter follows:

421
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,000
Really somewhat similar

422
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,280
Damn, that's your handwriting

423
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,280
There is also the seal of Wushi Ranch, you still want to quibble?

424
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,960
May I ask if your Majesty has seen clearly?

425
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,880
The seal on this sealed letter is engraved

426
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,040
It's Tori, not Ushi

427
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,680
Really? Take a look

428
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,200
It's so sloppy, but there's really an extra stroke

429
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Is this happening? Someone comes and submits the secret letter

430
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,000
Juluhou, what's your explanation?

431
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,600
Your Majesty, the facts are quite obvious

432
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,640
Someone forged a secret letter in order to commit injustice

433
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,160
May I ask, Lord Marquis, where did you get this secret letter?

434
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,280
Mr. Hou, it seems that this person wants to harm

435
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,000
Not only me, but also you, Mr. Hou

436
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,360
Shaolong is really clever and clever

437
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,600
It was obvious early on that Lian Jin was pretending to surrender.

438
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,200
I didn’t expect Lian Jin to be so insidious.

439
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,120
The so-called he has a good plan, I have a wall ladder

440
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,920
He's smart, I'm not stupid either

441
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,880
Master, you should speak earlier

442
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,320
I'm so worried that you really betrothed the lady to him

443
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,000
In fact, everything is Shaolong's clever plan

444
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,560
He said he only needed to use Fang'er's marriage as bait

445
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,760
You can try out Lian Jin’s intentions

446
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,720
More than that? You can kill two birds with one stone.

447
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,480
Now it can finally be proven that Zhu Ji’s mother and son

448
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,320
I'm really trapped in Zhao Mu's house.

449
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,000
You say

450
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,120
How can I bet my life's events?

451
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,120
This matter obviously has nothing to do with either of them.

452
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,440
it's me

453
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,320
Xiang Shaolong, have you ever thought about

454
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,560
If your so-called clever plan fails,

455
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,920
Am I going to marry Lian Jin?

456
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,120
I've thought about it, but it probably won't fail.

457
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,680
What if Lian Jin has no conspiracy at all?

458
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,880
He kept his promise and helped you rescue the proton

459
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,120
What should I do?

460
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,320
What if...I don't think there are that many what ifs

461
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,360
If it really happens that he does this

462
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,040
It's worth it for you to marry him

463
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
This damn thief

464
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,040
Every time, I have to be so angry that I am half-dead before I am happy.

465
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,200
I don’t even know what he is thinking?

466
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
Princess, do you think you are mad to death?

467
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,440
Princess

468
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,240
Did you call me?

469
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,520
Did you listen to Tingfang?

470
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,320
sorry, say it again

471
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,680
But even if I tell you, you won’t understand

472
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,920
Now I know

473
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,000
It turns out that loving someone is very painful

474
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,040
That's right, liking someone

475
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,280
I will think of him all the time

476
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,320
Sometimes it's painful

477
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,160
Did Tingfang hear it correctly?

478
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,840
Princess, what did you just say?

479
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,920
nothing

480
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,320
No wonder Tingfang saw the princess absent-minded today.

481
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,160
You were absent-minded. It turns out you have someone you like.

482
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,600
Even if there is, it's useless

483
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,040
My father has decided to marry me to the Kingdom of Wei

484
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,440
Will set off soon

485
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,120
I live in the palace

486
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,920
Never have a chance to step out of the palace

487
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,760
It's my destiny to be at the mercy of others all my life

488
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,400
Cinderella can wait for her Prince Charming

489
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,200
But I...

490
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,600
What Cinderella White Girl?

491
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,400
Princess, don’t talk so badly about yourself

492
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,800
life is full of hope

493
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,240
Unlike you, I can do what I like

494
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,960
You can choose the one you love

495
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,080
You can even reject people you don’t like

496
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,880
Tingfang can do it, and so can the princess.

497
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,520
Happiness is something you have to work hard to pursue

498
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,000
Since the princess already has someone she likes

499
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,520
It is more appropriate to make it clear to the king

500
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,480
Let the king know

501
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,080
The princess doesn’t want to marry to Wei at all

502
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,800
Tell your father? It’s useless.

503
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,480
The princess has never tried

504
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,680
How do you know there is no hope?

505
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,240
but…

506
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,240
If the princess dare not say it, Tingfang will say it for you.

507
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,160
For the princess's lifelong happiness, behead her head

508
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,680
Let's go to see the king together

509
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,000
Tingfang, no, I'm afraid

510
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,560
What are you afraid of? Tingfang no matter what happens today

511
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,120
I also want to make it clear to the king for you.

512
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,280
Please rest assured, my king, regarding the princess’s wedding.

513
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,800
The humble minister will take care of everything for the king

514
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,960
With the words of Marquis Julu, I feel relieved

515
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,200
It was all because of Julu Hou’s words that he woke up

516
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,920
Otherwise, I would have married the princess to South Korea.

517
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,400
Same as getting married

518
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,200
Of course I choose to marry a princess

519
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,040
A place that is beneficial to Zhao State

520
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,480
Juluhou, you really have great powers.

521
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,440
It turned out that the secret records of Lu Gong were in the hands of Lord Xinling

522
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,440
It’s a great time to marry the princess to the Kingdom of Wei

523
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,680
Send someone to steal

524
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,600
When the time comes, the king will attack the six kingdoms

525
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,600
He will be invincible in all battles and conquer all attacks.

526
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,400
The widow has countless princesses

527
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,200
Marry a princess and you can get a copy of Lu Gong's Secret Records

528
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,560
What a deal…

529
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,560
How unreasonable

530
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,960
I never thought there could be such an unscrupulous father in the world

531
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,440
For what secret record?

532
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,720
Just casually sacrifice your biological daughter's lifelong happiness

533
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,000
Princess, don't do this

534
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,320
Now that things have come to this, it is no longer time to be a weakling.

535
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,880
Originally Tingfang thought he could plead with the king

536
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,680
Who knew he didn't care about the relationship between father and daughter?

537
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
The only solution for now

538
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,160
You can only rely on the princess to fight for your own happiness.

539
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,600
Fight for your own happiness?

540
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,840
Doesn’t the princess want to be with her lover?

541
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,960
Stay together forever?

542
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Is it possible?

543
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,600
As long as you are determined

544
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,280
The impossible becomes possible

545
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,960
But I don't know his thoughts yet

546
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,600
It's easy, the princess told Tingfang

547
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,320
Who is your crush?

548
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,960
Princess Tingfang just needs to ask him clearly what he thinks.

549
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,360
What a coincidence, shopping

550
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,680
I see

551
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,280
You must want to come. Thank you, Mrs. Ya.

552
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,120
What happened at Tianxiang Tower last time

553
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,960
What happened last time was just a little effort

554
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,360
Miss Wu family, are you okay?

555
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,520
Mrs. Xie Ya is concerned about what happened last time

556
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,880
Tingfang asked himself that his experience was far less than his wife

557
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

558
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,280
Yes, I like nonsense the most

559
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,920
Since I'm so unpopular, I'm leaving

560
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,840
Why are you walking so fast?

561
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,280
Master, you are so partial

562
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,040
I just stayed with my mother and ignored Pan'er.

563
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,760
Pan'er

564
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,080
What are you doing here?

565
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,880
I’m waiting for you

566
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,560
You still have the nerve to come see me

567
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,880
What conspiracy do you want to play in front of me?

568
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,480
You listen to my explanation

569
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,600
Is there any other explanation?

570
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,200
You do this despicable thing again and again

571
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,320
I really regret, how could I believe you in the first place

572
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Don't you know everything I've done

573
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,720
It's all for you, I really like you

574
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,240
I don't believe that to love someone, you have to do whatever it takes

575
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,120
Yes, I do whatever it takes

576
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,120
because i know

577
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,280
If I don't I'll lose you

578
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,880
I don't want to lose you

579
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,720
I live in the palace

580
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,400
There will never be a chance to step outside the palace gate

581
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,680
Being at the mercy of others all your life

582
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,280
I do whatever it takes, because I know

583
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,280
If I don't I'll lose you

584
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,840
Unlike you, I can do what I like

585
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,320
You can choose the one you love

586
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,600
You can even reject people you don’t like

587
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,360
Miss Tingfang, just come.

588
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,160
What's up?

589
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,360
The princess kept the door closed all morning

590
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,240
trap yourself in the room

591
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,160
The slave refuses to open the door no matter how you scream.

592
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,680
It's really worrying

593
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,880
Princess

594
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,760
Princess, why are you so stupid?

595
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,280
Death can't solve the problem

596
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,680
Can the problem be solved by not dying?

597
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,920
What happened?

598
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,160
Tingfang should remember

599
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,800
My father has betrothed me to the Crown Prince of Wei

600
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,320
But do you know what kind of person he is?

601
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,320
In the morning I accidentally

602
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,080
After hearing what Brother Wang and Gong Zide said,

603
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,920
It turns out that the Crown Prince of Wei is a dissolute and immoral person.

604
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,960
I like to hang out in romantic places all day long, and also…

605
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,640
Tingfang, you want me to marry such a person

606
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,200
I would rather die

607
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,440
Princess, don't worry

608
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,680
Has the princess forgotten that you have a big brother?

609
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,360
Tingfang has met Brother Daniu?

610
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,160
Princess Ruoran is determined not to marry to the Kingdom of Wei

611
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,200
Tingfang is willing to go with Brother Daniu

612
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,920
Find a way to take you out of the palace

613
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
Leave the palace?

614
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,840
What for? Invite me to negotiate

615
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,680
Did you bring what I asked you to bring?

616
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,320
Why are you so anxious to get this hairpin?

617
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,840
This hairpin was originally given to me

618
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,880
I just take back what's mine

619
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,960
You make it sound like you're breaking off the relationship

620
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,440
If you like it, I will give you more

621
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Jade rings, jade bracelets, jade hairbands for you

622
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,520
Do you like giving random things to people?

623
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,960
Crazy, do I have a lot of money?

624
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,640
Even if I really give something away randomly

625
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,000
I'll also send you the bill

626
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,200
Playful and smiling, not serious

627
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,800
It seems that these embroidered shoes are going to be returned to others.

628
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,760
Isn't this Xiaotu's? Why is it here with you?

629
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,560
Do you remember Bunny?

630
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,600
Little Rabbit will get married soon

631
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,360
So she asked me to return the embroidered shoes to you

632
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,960
Marry? Who to marry?

633
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,360
The king has issued a decree to marry Little Rabbit

634
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,360
Zhang Mazi, who was in charge of killing pigs in the palace

635
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,640
From now on, Little Rabbit will be with a

636
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,640
Old and ugly butchers kill pigs together

637
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,800
No, really?

638
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,000
Why are you so nervous?

639
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,120
If you really care about Xiaotu

640
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,320
You will never forget what you promised Xiaotu

641
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,720
i haven't forgotten

642
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,800
Okay, then let me ask you

643
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,480
Do you want to save the little rabbit and leave the palace?

644
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,440
think

645
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,240
stop

646
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,720
There is an outpost

647
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,280
Why bother the eldest lady of the Wu family today?

648
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,600
Deliver horse manure yourself

649
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,840
no way

650
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,160
Wu Datou, who was originally responsible for transporting horse manure

651
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,280
Return to hometown to marry a wife

652
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,360
Only this lady can do it herself

653
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,520
Where's the bunny?

654
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,000
Why are you so impatient?

655
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,600
We came to the palace to transport horse manure.

656
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,600
Do a full set of acting, first pour the horse manure

657
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,160
You don't need such a big bucket, right?

658
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,360
Even if you pretend to be a bunny, ten of you can still pretend to be a rabbit.

659
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,840
I'll pour it down if I tell you to

660
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,760
Is there so much horse manure?

661
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,160
Haven't come for a few days

662
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,120
I didn’t expect so much horse manure to accumulate

663
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,200
It seems that it will take two or three more transports to complete the transport.

664
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,200
I have to bother you two again.

665
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,800
Xiaobai, you haven’t been active lately and you’ve gained so much weight.

666
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,800
This princess will take you for a walk

667
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,200
Xiaobai ran away, hurry up and catch me back for this princess

668
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,080
yes princess

669
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,800
Little Rabbit Big Bull Brother

670
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,800
Also called Brother Daniu, let me introduce you.

671
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,480
This Xiang Shaolong, this girl Xiaoqian

672
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,520
Brother Xiang

673
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,760
It turns out your real name is Xiaoqian. It sounds very nice.

674
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,040
Can we go now?

675
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,280
The time is not yet ripe, continue pouring horse manure

676
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,320
What?

677
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,160
I have to bother the two soldiers again.

678
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,360
You can go

679
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,040
Brother Xiang

680
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,400
Brother Xiang, who hasn’t seen you for a while

681
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,160
It's like we haven't seen each other for ten years

682
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,880
Is the time now right?

683
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,520
If you guessed correctly, it should be mature this time

684
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,680
But I have to tolerate Miss Xiaoqian

685
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,400
As long as Brother Xiang is by Xiaoqian's side

686
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,200
Xiaoqian is not afraid no matter how dirty she is

687
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,200
Sorry to bother you two again

688
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,920
Already checked multiple times

689
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,960
Don’t you still believe in Miss Wu? Let’s go
