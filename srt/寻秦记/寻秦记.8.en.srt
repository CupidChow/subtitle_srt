1
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,760
Cloud-Piercing Arrow

2
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,520
You extras

3
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
well played

4
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,960
I thought you were a master swordsman

5
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,400
Unexpectedly, it is nothing more than this, vulnerable

6
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,320
Before, you bullied the weak and humiliated me in public.

7
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,960
Not only that, I also want to seduce my young master’s mother

8
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,360
Now new and old grudges

9
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,600
I will settle matters with you once and for all.

10
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,600
Lift it out...

11
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,280
Take him down and eat the whole bucket of shit

12
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,320
How much did he give you?

13
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,360
twelve taels

14
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Extras are so cheap here

15
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,800
There are more than ten liang here, right?

16
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,120
yes…

17
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,920
How could this happen? You guys

18
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,360
Being a human being does not necessarily require the use of force to solve problems

19
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,280
Problems can also be solved using your brain

20
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,920
What? Do you like forcing people to eat feces?

21
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,720
Come, eat it yourself

22
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,680
If you want to kill, kill

23
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,720
Why should I kill you? I'm not you

24
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,040
I just want you to eat shit

25
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,960
I'll give you a chance

26
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,840
If you are willing to kneel down and kowtow to me three times

27
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,960
I'll let you go

28
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,920
I will never kneel down and beg for mercy.

29
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,680
So brave? Then I can't help you.

30
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,960
Eat

31
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,440
Why bother doing it like this?

32
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,920
Only now do I know what it means to harm others and ultimately harm yourself.

33
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Don't do this next time

34
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,760
Next time, don't fall into my hands

35
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,800
Shaolong, I have been waiting for you for a long time.

36
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,960
Madam, I'm so sorry

37
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,240
Because I was delayed by a group of villains on the road just now.

38
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,000
So I'm late

39
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,120
A villain is blocking the way? Are the servants being held back?

40
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,520
No, just some unimportant people

41
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,240
Ignore them

42
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,000
Madam, shall we start admiring the flowers?

43
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,840
OK

44
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,280
Madam's flowers are blooming so beautifully

45
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,760
As pretty as a lady

46
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,560
It can be described in four words

47
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,600
It’s the beauty and fragrance of the country

48
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,000
The country is beautiful and fragrant? You are so flattering

49
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,960
It's not a compliment. Madam, you are young and beautiful.

50
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,880
And it's so well maintained

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,320
There is such a big mansion

52
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,360
It's really enviable

53
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,960
If Shaolong you like

54
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,040
You can be the owner of this mansion

55
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,080
Isn't it?

56
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,040
There is a person who is thirsty for talents

57
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,640
I admire Shaolong’s wit, strategy, talents and skills very much.

58
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,240
He hopes to recruit you as his disciple

59
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,680
As long as Shaolong agrees

60
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,680
This mansion will immediately become your residence

61
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,640
And beauties, fragrant cars, and gold

62
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,160
sounds really attractive

63
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,960
But I wonder if that includes you, madam?

64
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,640
Brother Xiang really has a vision

65
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
A man of courage and intelligence

66
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,160
Why worry about not having a woman?

67
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,960
I believe that your wife also admires you very much

68
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,080
Brother Xiang, please

69
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,360
Do you like this mansion?

70
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,880
I like...it's so big and luxurious, of course I like it

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,640
But I have never lived in such a big mansion.

72
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,400
I'm afraid I might not get used to it

73
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,320
Everyone has their own preferences

74
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,520
If Brother Xiang can serve me,

75
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,200
You can definitely do whatever you want

76
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,520
But I'm used to being free

77
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
suddenly need to serve others

78
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,400
I'm afraid I really won't get used to it

79
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,720
People always want something, and there is always a price

80
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,280
Brother Xiang, just say it

81
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,440
But there is such a thing as freedom

82
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
It can't be bought with money

83
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,200
I hope you will understand, Mr. Hou.

84
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,640
In this way, it is not speculative to be honest.

85
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Madam, could you please greet him for me?

86
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
yes

87
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,640
Madam, the owner of your big house has such a character.

88
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,800
Shaolong

89
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,800
Why do you have to reject Mr. Hou in person and contradict him?

90
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,720
I'm afraid there will be trouble in the future

91
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,640
I'm afraid it will be more troublesome if I do things for him

92
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,200
You were in the garden just now

93
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,920
Have you asked the Marquis if he would send me away?

94
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,400
Madam, I was just joking in the garden just now

95
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,280
I didn't mean it

96
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,720
I hope you understand, madam, and don't make me angry

97
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,840
In fact, a man must achieve great achievements

98
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,400
What's the point of sacrificing a woman?

99
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,400
Madam, why do you say this?

100
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,840
In fact, I respect Madam very much

101
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,480
The most important thing for a person is to live a wonderful life

102
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,760
It doesn't matter whether you have money or beauty.

103
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,040
The most important thing is that you can do what you like to do

104
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,600
If you are always at the mercy of others

105
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,040
So what’s the point of being a human being?

106
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,480
It's a pity that everyone's fate is beyond their control

107
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,320
especially women women

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,320
Look at it from my perspective

109
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,760
I think men and women should be equal

110
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,600
If you can have the courage, madam

111
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,600
I believe you will be like me

112
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,600
Can do the same

113
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,960
May I?

114
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,480
sure

115
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,800
Just think about it, if you start from now on

116
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,200
You can change your lifestyle

117
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,200
You can spend more time caring for your son

118
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,680
Then your son will also care about you

119
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,200
He will naturally come back to you

120
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,000
Then he won't go out and cause trouble.

121
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,320
Do you think so?

122
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,680
Is it too late to wake up and make corrections now?

123
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,360
Of course not, doing it is better than not doing it

124
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,240
It's better than never doing it anyway

125
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,400
It seems that Shaolong also has worries in his heart

126
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,200
Don't know why?

127
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,600
Madam, you really seem like a psychologist

128
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,920
But even if I tell you my worries

129
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,120
You can't help me either

130
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,920
I'm afraid Shaolong still has a grudge against me.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,560
So it’s inconvenient to say it clearly

132
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,560
Of course I have no grudge against you

133
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,040
I treat you like my friend

134
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,160
But you really can't help me with my problem.

135
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,320
If you need my help, just ask

136
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,720
I am willing to go through fire and water

137
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,160
Then thank you in advance, madam.

138
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,720
But if you have anything, you must tell me

139
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,360
Not only am I going through fire and water

140
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,200
Even if it means going up a mountain of swords or going down a frying pan

141
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,440
I can do it even if I hang myself from a beam.

142
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,160
really?

143
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,360
Of course it's true

144
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,960
Shaolong, I really have something to ask of you.

145
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,040
You don’t want me to hang myself from the rafter now, do you?

146
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,760
Can you accept me as your apprentice?

147
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,320
Brother Xiang

148
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,400
Mrs. Ya seriously gives this pot of special orchid to you.

149
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,400
Do you also think this potted flower is beautiful?

150
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,560
More than that, you know?

151
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,800
This orchid is abundant in the Xiongnu

152
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,240
General Li Mu defeated the Huns

153
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,080
The King of the Huns sought peace

154
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,120
I specially ordered someone to send three pots of this orchid to Handan.

155
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,600
As a result, a pot was placed in the palace of King Zhao

156
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,480
Give one pot to Zhao Mu as a reward

157
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,760
The last pot was given to Mrs. Ya.

158
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,080
Now Mrs. Ya actually gives this pot of flowers to you

159
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,640
It seems that Mrs. Ya values ​​you very much.

160
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,560
It's just a pot of flowers. Look how elegant you say it.

161
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,840
If you like it so much, I’ll give it to you.

162
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,720
Is it true?

163
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,160
Of course it's true

164
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,760
No, as the saying goes: a gentleman does not take away people’s love

165
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,520
What's more, Mrs. Ya specially gave this pot of flowers to you.

166
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,440
How can you let her down? No way...

167
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,840
That's good

168
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,240
You talk like you are a master of flower cultivation

169
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,240
Please help me plant it

170
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,880
Help me water the water every day, is that okay?

171
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,840
That's no problem

172
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,400
Planting this kind of flower can only drip water

173
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,960
Watering is absolutely not allowed

174
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,840
Really? Otherwise this flower…

175
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,760
Manager Tao, when did he become the gardener of Wujiabao?

176
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,760
Miss

177
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,120
Mr. Tao must be very leisurely.

178
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,560
There are so many things to do in Wujiapu

179
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,840
He actually came here to teach people how to grow evil flowers.

180
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,160
What evil flower? You are so ignorant

181
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,040
Tell her what Mr. Tao said just now

182
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,880
What is this potted flower? Iron King Kong defeated the Huns

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,920
Just snatched it back

184
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,120
If a person is not upright

185
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,840
Of course they are evil flowers.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,200
I advise you to plant carefully

187
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,440
Otherwise, one may accidentally plant it to death.

188
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,680
make people unhappy

189
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm afraid it will be difficult for you to be a guest again.

190
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,640
But I miss this evil flower

191
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,400
Definitely not as good as those domestic flowers

192
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,600
After more than 20 years of planting, the domestic flowers have already gone bad.

193
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,480
Xiang Shaolong

194
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,320
(Shit, I am like a governor, life is cheaper than an ant)

195
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,320
Xiang Shaoxia, this confidential letter has just arrived from Xianyang

196
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,800
i have seen

197
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,760
It’s more sloppy than English. What should you write?

198
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,840
It was written by Prime Minister Lu himself

199
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,480
He said that Yang Quanjun, the left prime minister of Qin, wanted to lobby the King of Qin

200
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,760
Make the second prince Cheng Xi the crown prince

201
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,360
What? What should Ying Zheng do?

202
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,360
good

203
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,520
So Prime Minister Lu said about saving Ying Zheng’s mother and son

204
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Must be fast

205
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
besides

206
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,560
besides?

207
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,920
Prime Minister Lu sent someone to deliver a token

208
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,720
He said that Zhu Ji and her son saw this white jade ring

209
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,640
Just know that we are the ones who save them

210
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,080
Too bad, I still can't find out

211
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,720
Where are their mother and son hidden, and what should they do?

212
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,720
Brother Xiang

213
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,200
Have you ever thought about starting with Mrs. Ya?

214
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,720
Mrs. Ya has a close relationship with Zhao Mu

215
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,040
This time I invite you suddenly

216
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,200
It's obviously Zhao Mu's intention

217
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,920
I want to use Mrs. Ya to test you.

218
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,520
If this thing is true

219
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,000
We should not stay in Handan for a long time

220
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,280
It is even more urgent to save Ying Zheng’s mother and son

221
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,000
Since Mrs. Ya has contact with Zhao Mu

222
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,520
She may know the whereabouts of Zhu Ji's mother and son

223
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,480
So starting from her is also a way

224
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,720
younger sister

225
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,360
Big brother

226
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Look how much big brother loves you. When you say you want a rabbit,

227
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll go up the mountain to catch it immediately

228
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,520
It took me two hours to catch it.

229
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,040
I know you worked hard

230
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,280
At worst, I'll be in front of the princess

231
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,800
Let me say a few more nice words for you

232
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,200
Even if you still care about me, your big brother

233
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,760
Why catch a rabbit for no reason?

234
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,360
The rabbit the princess used to raise died of illness a few days ago

235
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,960
Usually in the palace, the princess seldom sees people

236
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,720
Just rely on that rabbit to relieve boredom

237
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,360
So I want to give her a rabbit

238
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,320
I really can’t tell that you care about the princess too.

239
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,000
Here you go, but be careful, it's very cunning

240
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,240
Got it, don't worry

241
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,040
ran in

242
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,600
What are you afraid of? Go in and look for it

243
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,240
This room belongs to the thief, I won't go in

244
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,920
Don't be afraid, the guy named Xiang isn't here anyway.

245
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,480
Don't move

246
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,240
Still can't catch you?

247
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,120
You don't break anything, but you want to break this potted flower.

248
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,920
I knocked over a pot of flowers, what's the big deal?

249
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,360
you don't understand

250
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,560
Don't do it again. It's all broken anyway. Let's go.

251
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,200
what to do?

252
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,080
Did you break my potted flower?

253
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,000
Which of your eyes saw that I broke your potted flower?

254
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,920
I saw with both eyes that you damaged my potted flower.

255
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,640
You are really a petty person.

256
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,440
It can be done this way, are you right?

257
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,800
Mr. Xiang, you are really... Yeah

258
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,720
I'm a kid, I came in on purpose and broke your flowers

259
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,400
So what?

260
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,800
Now it's you who broke my flower

261
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,320
You are actually more fierce than me, you are really powerful

262
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,400
Do you want to see an official?

263
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,920
I'll call an ambulance and take you to the hospital.

264
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,960
See if you are mentally ill?

265
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,240
Neurosis, it’s really miserable

266
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,240
Princess, don't you like this rabbit?

267
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,400
no

268
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,480
I see

269
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,640
The princess must still remember the rabbit that died of illness

270
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,280
Tingfang

271
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,800
We may not be able to see each other again soon

272
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,200
Why?

273
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,360
Both Wei and South Korea sent people to propose marriage to their father.

274
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,920
Now I'm just waiting for my father to make a decision

275
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,360
What about the princess? Have you decided?

276
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,240
I?

277
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,840
Have you ever thought about yourself

278
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,640
Would you rather marry in South Korea or Wei?

279
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,640
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

280
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,200
Wedding is a major event, it is related to your lifelong happiness, princess

281
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,320
Of course it's up to you to decide

282
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,040
I don’t even know the person I’m about to marry

283
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,400
I don’t know whether I’m tall or short, fat or thin.

284
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,880
The princess can marry neither of them

285
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,280
Neither of them will marry?

286
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,200
Tingfang, I am different from you

287
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,560
There are many things that I can't decide on my own

288
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,000
Princess, you haven’t tried it yet

289
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,680
How do you know it's not possible?

290
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,440
Just like this rabbit

291
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,680
You didn't ask about it

292
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,880
How do you know she likes to eat vegetables?

293
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,560
Maybe it doesn't like it at all and only likes to eat radishes

294
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,840
Be it vegetables or radishes

295
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,680
As long as you are hungry, you still need to eat.

296
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,280
It’s better to stop talking about me and talk about you.

297
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,680
Where's that pervert of yours?

298
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,360
Do I still like to annoy you that much?

299
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,000
Don't mention that guy again

300
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,040
By the way, princess, don’t you like planting flowers very much?

301
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,520
I wonder if there are orchids growing in the palace?

302
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,360
Yes

303
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,120
That's great. Princess, can you give me a basin?

304
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,280
sure

305
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,520
Tingfang, when did you start learning to grow flowers?

306
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,760
I just plant flowers to pass the time

307
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,680
Princess Qi, Mrs. Ya is asking to see you outside the building

308
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,600
Auntie is here?

309
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
aunt princess

310
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,760
Is the eldest lady of the Wu family here too?

311
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,560
I'm leaving

312
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,920
Princess, will you send me a pot of orchids?

313
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,960
You and Xiaoxiang go to the back garden

314
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,800
Take whichever pot you like

315
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,080
Then I'm leaving

316
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,040
Does Auntie have something to do with Qian'er?

317
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,360
Listen to the king, your body is not in harmony

318
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,800
So aunt came to visit you

319
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,880
Auntie no longer has to say good things for my father.

320
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,320
Father always pays little attention to Qianer

321
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,600
The princess is in very good spirits today

322
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,080
Auntie is also very relieved

323
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,720
I want my aunt to worry about Qianer

324
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,680
Qian'er is really sorry

325
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,880
Silly girl

326
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,000
If your aunt doesn't care about you, who else will care about you?

327
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,040
By the way, the king agreed

328
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,200
You can come to my house to stay for a few days

329
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,400
Did your father really agree?

330
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,400
Yes, it depends on when you recover

331
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,480
Don't worry, aunt, Qian'er's illness has long since recovered.

332
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,880
Silly girl

333
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,880
drank this cup

334
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,200
Uncle, it’s really huge, eat a grape

335
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,840
Uncle Wu is so partial, he only cares about drinking with Ziwei

336
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,200
Ignore people at all

337
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,600
How could I ignore you?

338
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,480
Can I feed you grapes?

339
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,120
I want to drink with you

340
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,920
Who is it?

341
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,320
Damn, you're harassing my elegance.

342
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,920
It’s a villain, Uncle Wu

343
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,920
There are two uncles in the wing opposite

344
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,640
I want to invite Ziwei and Jinhua to come over.

345
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,280
How unreasonable, knowing that two girls are accompanying me

346
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Who dares to ask them to have sex?

347
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,680
Yes, even villains know something is wrong

348
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,360
But I don’t know how to explain it to the two uncles

349
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,480
You don’t know how to explain it, do you?

350
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,280
How about I accompany you to explain?

351
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,360
good

352
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,000
Wait for me, I'll be back soon

353
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,880
Come back quickly, don't make me wait too long

354
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,960
Wait for me, lead the way

355
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,960
Stop fighting, uncle

356
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,800
Why do you want to beat me?

357
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,640
Dare you be cruel in front of me?

358
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Are you looking for death?

359
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,240
Brother, help me seek justice.

360
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,600
You two, please give me some face for what happened today.

361
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,920
Just forget it

362
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,280
Damn it, why do you want me to give you face?

363
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,120
Walk

364
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,440
If you don't want to die, continue

365
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,320
Brother, thank you so much for today

366
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,160
Where

367
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,360
Thank you very much, brother, for coming to the rescue.

368
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,360
Tingwei, a toast to my brother

369
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,480
Seriously, please

370
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,080
It's none of your business here, go out

371
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,560
You two gentlemen, please use it slowly.

372
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,240
You guys can go out too

373
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,920
Brother Wu

374
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,720
Why is there such an elegant person coming here to drink?

375
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,320
Don’t you need to help the Lord of Uborg?

376
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,920
Now everything in the fort is big or small

377
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,080
My dad always listens to Xiang’s words

378
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,320
It seems that I won’t even have a foothold later.

379
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,520
That surname

380
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Is this really how to win the favor of Lord Wubao?

381
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,720
I don't understand what dad thinks either?

382
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,040
The person with this name has not been in Wujiapu for less than a month.

383
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,680
Is there any reason to use him so highly?

384
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,240
Could it be that the person named Xiang is the same as the Lord of Wubao?

385
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,400
have a special friendship

386
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,600
Then I really don't know

387
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,640
What special relationship does Dad have with him?

388
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,280
I only know the future of the surname Xiang before Wujiapu

389
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,440
I have never heard my father mention Xiang Shaolong

390
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,360
Is it really that weird?

391
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,200
Really, if you don’t believe it, you can ask Tingfang

392
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,320
By the way, how is Tingfang doing lately?

393
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,280
Okay, I'm going to be pissed off by that guy named Xiang.

394
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,360
Are they often vindictive?

395
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,360
More than just fighting spirit? It’s simply incompatible with fire and water

396
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,640
All in all, this boy with this surname

397
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,240
Never leave our ranch for a day

398
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,360
Just one more day of trouble

399
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,920
In fact, those who want to leave Wujiapu with the surname Xiang

400
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,600
It's not impossible

401
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,640
Brother, you really have a way

402
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,640
Let that boy named Xiang leave the ranch?

403
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,760
Yes, but a few horses from Wujiapu will have to be sacrificed.

404
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,080
Miss

405
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,520
Mr. Tao, where is the prostitute?

406
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,160
Are you talking about Xiang Shaoxia?

407
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,400
Now within Wujiapu

408
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,520
Is there a second adulterer besides him?

409
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,720
Mrs. Ya just sent a carriage to take him across the house.

410
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Miss, do you have something important to do with him?

411
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,480
Did I say I was looking for him?

412
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,920
No, I saw you holding a pot of orchids

413
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,960
I thought the lady was because of what happened last time

414
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,960
So I gave him a pot of orchids to apologize to him.

415
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,000
Damn it, why should I apologize to that adulterer?

416
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,800
This pot of orchids was given to me by the princess

417
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,160
Take it if you like it

418
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,040
You two are so...

419
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,840
You really can't find the young master?

420
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,720
The villain has already been to the places where the young master often goes in and out.

421
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,400
But I still can’t find the young master

422
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,400
Where do you think Pan'er will go?

423
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,880
I thought he might have been out chatting or drinking with friends

424
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,440
I drank too late, maybe I'll be back later

425
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,120
But Shaolong, you have to wait for him here for most of the day

426
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,040
I'm so sorry

427
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,520
Madam, please don't say that

428
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,200
I have this opportunity to be alone with you, madam

429
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
I'm really happy to chat at such a close distance

430
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,840
Shaolong, you really know how to joke.

431
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,880
Master...

432
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,360
I said I don't need you to help me anymore

433
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,840
Pan'er

434
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,080
What happened to you? Are you fighting outside again?

435
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,600
Don't worry about my affairs

436
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,640
You can continue to have a romantic relationship with your sweetheart.

437
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,160
Pan'er, stop

438
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,640
So what?

439
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,360
Mom wants to introduce you to your master

440
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,240
Him? When did he become my master?

441
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,680
How could you be so rude to Master?

442
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,600
Damn it, how can he be so good?

443
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,720
Why do you have the ability to be my master?

444
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,000
I have a lot of skills

445
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,240
But if you don’t have any ability,

446
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,960
I don't care if you are Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee

447
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,080
It's useless if I teach you anything

448
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,520
Name, you don’t need to make any mockery here

449
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,840
If that Zhao De hadn't bullied others by relying on the large number of people and the small number of people,

450
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,680
How could I not beat him?

451
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,480
Which Zhao De?

452
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,000
Zhao De is Shao Yuanjun

453
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,240
That is, Mrs. Pingyuan’s son

454
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,160
Please, you are so old

455
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,000
Don't rely on the latrine if you can't poop.

456
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,120
No matter if there are ten people or a hundred people

457
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,880
If you have the ability, you can beat him.

458
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,000
Why are you talking so much?

459
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,840
It's easy to say, it would be you instead

460
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,280
Probably worse than me

461
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,720
Will it? So be it

462
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,280
Do you dare to take a gamble with me?

463
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,840
What to bet on?

464
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Just bet on my bare hands

465
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,760
You can choose a weapon at will

466
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,160
I'll fight with you alone

467
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,880
If you defeat me, I will disappear immediately

468
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,960
If I beat you

469
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,360
You have to kneel on the ground and kowtow three times

470
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,960
Do you dare to call me Master?

471
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,840
It’s a deal

472
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,000
OK

473
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,360
Madam, the fragrant tea is ready

474
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,920
Are you really willing to let me go empty-handed?

475
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,320
Such a big man has to keep his word, come on

476
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,240
Wait a minute

477
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,560
Are you scared?

478
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,560
Will I be afraid of you?

479
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,360
I just want to know

480
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,360
That Bruce Lee you just mentioned

481
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,520
Who is it?

482
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,560
Even if you tell me, you won’t know

483
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,720
In short, he is an international superstar, come on

484
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,320
Okay, you brought it upon yourself

485
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,160
Don't blame me for being heavy handed.

486
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,080
Still coming?

487
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,360
I have no choice but to use the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms

488
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,040
Master, please pay homage to me, my disciple.

489
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,720
This is the first time that the maid has seen the young master willing to bow his head to others.

490
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,480
I hope Pan'er won't do anything wrong again in the future.

491
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,040
Uncle, the hosta has been repaired

492
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,920
Awesome, it can really be joined together

493
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,440
Uncle, you have given me a reward

494
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,160
How much?

495
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,680
sixty cents

496
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,880
Sixty dollars? Why not buy another one?

497
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,640
Thin gold flakes are also very valuable

498
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,360
But there is always a thin piece of gold on top

499
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,760
I suffered a loss

500
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,080
Neither will

501
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,840
All right…

502
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,720
sixty cents

503
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,480
Thank you sir...

504
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,520
I will definitely come back to see you next time

505
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,680
Thank you, uncle. Walk slowly, uncle.

506
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,760
Uncle, I have already done what you asked me to do

507
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,920
well done

508
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,160
Thank you sir

509
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,760
Uncle, why are you...

510
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,760
This is the only way to ensure you don't reveal secrets

511
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,520
Brother Xiang

512
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,280
Why is there an extra pot of flowers here?

513
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,880
This pot of orchid is the eldest lady

514
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,520
Zhuan Cheng brought it back from the palace

515
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,720
Yeah?

516
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,200
To be honest, I know the eldest lady’s temperament best.

517
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,600
Although she is a little willful

518
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,680
But she has a good heart

519
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,840
No grudge at all

520
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,760
You and I can be said to be a match made in heaven. Enough...

521
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,600
Since the eldest lady gives you this pot of flowers,

522
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,040
Obviously I just want to apologize to you.

523
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,920
Why are you still angry about this?

524
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,600
How could I be angry with her?

525
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,000
Honestly, don't blame me for being nosy

526
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,200
Could it be that Brother Xiang treats our eldest lady?

527
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,480
No good feelings at all?

528
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,360
Are you saying this is not troublesome?

529
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,040
Do you understand that I don't...

530
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,400
I mean I didn't think I'd be here.

531
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,560
I can't even talk to people here

532
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,680
Any emotional problems occur, do you understand?

533
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,360
but…

534
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,920
Don't be too impatient. It's night and I'm going to bed.

535
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,960
But our eldest lady...

536
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,680
You sleep here, I'll go out

537
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,080
No need... you rest here

538
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,920
Thank you for your help

539
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,360
Although our eldest lady is not the most beautiful woman

540
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,800
But...it's really...

541
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,520
That's good. Think about it.

542
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,560
I originally planned to restore the old one

543
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,000
Okay, now not only is it impossible to rebuild

544
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,720
And caused so much trouble

545
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,680
Don't mess around, Mr. Xiang Shaolong

546
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,520
Lord of the castle

547
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,280
What happened?

548
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,280
My subordinate inspected the horse pen early in the morning.

549
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,080
It was discovered that a batch of our horses were all poisoned and died.

550
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,680
Dad, how's it going?

551
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,160
if i read correctly

552
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,760
These horses are not simply poisoned by feed

553
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,680
What dad means is that so many horses died on the ranch this time.

554
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,440
Did someone poison him intentionally?

555
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,760
Castle Lord, originally this batch of horses

556
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,120
It's a war horse planned to be sent to the military camp in two days.

557
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,240
Being poisoned now

558
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,240
I think there must be something wrong with it

559
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,640
Lord of the castle…

560
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,280
Marquis Julu led a large group of troops to Wujiapu

561
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,920
The Marquis is here, but I don’t know what’s important?

562
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,720
Wu Yingyuan, you are so bold

563
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,920
Why did the Marquis say this?

564
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,640
I want to ask you, inside Wushi Ranch

565
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,920
Have any war horses been poisoned?

566
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,880
If this is indeed the case, how did the Marquis know about it?

567
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,200
I have received a secret letter

568
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,680
A foreign spy sneaked into Wuzhi Ranch with evil intentions

569
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,360
Now it seems that this is indeed true

570
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,880
I'm afraid the Marquis has misunderstood.

571
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,520
Wuzhi Ranch is not a military base.

572
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,760
Why are there foreign spies?

573
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,640
Wushi Ranch is responsible for training war horses for the king.

574
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,440
Used to kill enemies on the battlefield

575
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,800
If there are foreign spies mixed in to maliciously destroy

576
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,960
I am afraid that Lord Wubao will have difficulty explaining to the king.

577
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,320
Which foreign spy?

578
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,880
Japan, Italy or South Korea?

579
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,560
Xiang Shaolong, you don’t have to pretend

580
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,560
You are the spy

581
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,280
Mr. Hou, please check it out.

582
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,120
Xiang Shaolong will definitely not be a spy

583
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,040
Whether this person is a spy or not will be revealed later.

584
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,440
Look at the arrogant way he talks

585
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,840
Must have been prepared

586
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,600
Let's wait and see the good show

587
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,600
Mr. Hou, evidence of the crime has been found

588
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,600
Is a hosta a secret letter of collaboration with the enemy?

589
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,040
Of course that's not the evidence

590
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,720
Xiang Shaolong, no one has stolen the stolen goods yet?

591
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,520
Lord Hou is really awesome

592
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,360
The first time I saw this box, I knew there were hidden compartments inside.

593
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,520
I also know there is a letter in there

594
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,000
Don't be proud of yourself. Just rely on this secret letter of collaborating with the enemy.

595
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,560
Enough to make your head fall to the ground

596
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,920
You haven't read the letter yet

597
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,240
I knew it was a secret letter of collaboration with the enemy. It was really powerful.

598
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,840
Even when death is imminent, he still speaks uncontrollably

599
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,400
Okay, I will let you die convinced.

600
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,920
It's really a secret letter of collaboration with the enemy, but you did it the other way around

601
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,480
Don't leave, my real name is Bruce Lee

602
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,800
In my hometown, someone brought a group of Japanese people to play in the gym

603
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,440
They say that we Chinese are the sick men of East Asia

604
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,360
Then force him to eat the piece of paper

605
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,160
Kick the gym? Believe it or not, I want you to eat this letter

606
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,960
This time so many horses in our ranch died of poisoning

607
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,680
It must be the conspiracy of that bastard Zhao Mu

608
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,680
Want to take advantage of the opportunity to frame the fault

609
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,960
Fortunately, Brother Xiang used an erotic picture in time

610
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,120
Replaced the so-called secret letter of collaboration with the enemy

611
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,920
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable

612
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,440
It's none of my business whether he is the owner of a jade shop

613
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,760
Give us gifts because we buy things

614
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,000
let's have fun

615
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,360
Stop messing around. Who else would I be if I weren't you?

616
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,360
How do I know who it is?

617
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,920
anyway

618
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,720
It seems that there is really a traitor in Wuzhi Ranch

619
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,800
You don't have to hide anymore, come out

620
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,840
How? Are you satisfied with the erotic picture?

621
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,680
Not bad, but a bit too erotic

622
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,240
I also guessed it was you, thank you

623
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,480
Just a little effort

624
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,280
What did you say in the letter you exchanged?

625
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,640
Take it and see

626
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,640
See for yourself

627
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,520
I almost forgot that our uncle Xiang is illiterate.

628
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,200
This letter is written to you personally by Chun Shenjun

629
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,920
The content is that as long as you manage

630
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,520
Poison all the horses in Wushi Ranch

631
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,120
There will be great rewards

632
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,480
There is also Chun Shenjun's personal seal supervisor on it.

633
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,360
What’s the explanation?

634
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,600
You mean to ask why Zhao Mu and Lian Jin want to harm you?

635
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,200
no

636
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,040
I mean, why did he insist on saying that I was a Qin spy?

637
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,080
Or a spy from Wei State

638
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,840
Instead of saying that I am a spy of Chu State?

639
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,760
Unless there is only one possibility

640
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,760
It’s Zhao Mu and the others who have always been in contact with Chu State.

641
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,720
Zhao Pan

642
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,120
Zhao De, I didn’t expect that we would meet again so soon.

643
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,880
You think I didn’t hit you enough last time?

644
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,960
Come out today and let me teach you a lesson again?

645
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,080
Things are different now

646
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,120
I'm afraid I'll be beaten like a pig's head today

647
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,880
Not me, but you

648
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,120
Okay, let me see how different you are today

649
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,800
I'm afraid you will regret it after seeing it

650
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
There is no reason to speak arrogantly

651
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,520
If I don’t teach you a lesson today, my surname will not be Zhao.

652
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,360
Mozi's swordsmanship?

653
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,080
What do you want?

654
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,680
How is it? Are you afraid that I will kill you?

655
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,800
Don't worry, I'm in a good mood today

656
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,360
Decided to let you go

657
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,640
Wait a minute

658
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,120
Have I ever promised to let you go?

659
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,120
What do you want?

660
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,360
Damn it, didn’t I have a name for you to call me?

661
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,200
Yes, I don’t know Gongzipan

662
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,440
How can I be willing to let my husband go...

663
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,760
Let me go?

664
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,840
It's easy. You want to go, right?

665
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,240
Then could you please get out of here?

666
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,120
you…

667
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,560
How is it? Are you ashamed? Or are you afraid of being made fun of?

668
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,840
Zhao Pan, don’t be so cruel

669
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,120
I just like to do things very well

670
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,560
I will ask you again

671
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,360
Are you going to drill or not?

672
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,600
Able to bend and stretch, he truly deserves to be Mr. Shao Yuan

673
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,360
I have to feel sorry for the princess and stay in the east wing temporarily.

674
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,080
Auntie, this place is very elegantly decorated.

675
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,720
It’s good if the princess doesn’t dislike it

676
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,280
If the princess needs anything

677
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,000
Just give your servants whatever orders you want.

678
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,520
Why didn’t I see Cousin Pan along the way?

679
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,560
Pan'er was practicing sword practice with his master in the backyard of the west wing.

680
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,200
When did Cousin Pan get a master?

681
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,680
Pan'er has only been apprenticed for a few days.

682
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,160
He even made Cousin Pan willing to worship him as his teacher

683
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,000
This master must have very good skills

684
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,120
Indeed, his master is not only highly skilled in martial arts

685
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,520
He's also a good person and very interesting.

686
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,320
Can Cousin Pan be so impressed?

687
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,880
My aunt was full of praise again

688
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,920
It seems that this master is indeed not simple.

689
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,520
Master, you didn’t see that bastard Zhao De

690
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,400
When he got under his disciple's crotch

691
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,200
I don’t know how ugly my face is

692
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,480
I just learned two moves and three-legged cat kung fu and I'm looking for someone to take revenge.

693
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,240
Of course, if not

694
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,760
Why should a disciple learn martial arts from his master?

695
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,040
Look how arrogant and arrogant you look

696
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,040
have you ever thought about

697
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,680
What should you do if you can't beat someone?

698
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,160
If my disciple wants to learn martial arts

699
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,880
We must learn from the best in the world

700
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,920
Then naturally I will be the only one to hit others, and no one will hit me.

701
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,200
Then let’s skip the level and teach you the Eighteen Palms of Subduing the Dragon.

702
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,920
really?

703
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
Do you know what it means: a mountain is as high as a mountain

704
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,840
Does the strong have its own strong hand?

705
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,440
You can't be invincible forever if you learn kung fu

706
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,560
I don't know about others

707
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,000
It’s natural for a disciple to have a master to teach him...

708
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,640
Save it, you sycophant.

709
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,400
Starting today, you must first learn the basic skills

710
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,720
You take an hour every day

711
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,120
Learn physical training well

712
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,680
No, what is it...an hour?

713
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,120
Physical training?

714
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,240
yes

715
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,680
Master, how long will Pan'er continue to practice?

716
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,040
Palm presses are just one type of physical training

717
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,640
You didn't even do palm pressure well

718
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,560
How can I, your master, teach you other skills?

719
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,080
Just put more effort into practicing.

720
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,800
Master, you also have many great principles

721
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,000
It's because no one usually talks to you.

722
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,440
That's why you ended up like this today

723
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,840
So your master and I will start from today

724
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,280
In addition to teaching you kung fu

725
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,160
I will also teach you some principles of life, you know?

726
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,920
What are you doing? Why are you staring at me blankly?

727
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,000
master

728
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,480
What do you want?

729
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,880
Pan'er grew up

730
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,920
No one has ever said this to me

731
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,640
Only Master is willing to care about me

732
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,520
Silly boy, how come no one cares about you?

733
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,840
In fact, apart from your master and me,

734
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,360
Your mother also cares about you very much

735
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,800
My mother?

736
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,200
Believe me, your mother really cares about you

737
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,960
It's just that you didn't give her a chance.

738
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,160
No matter what, Master, from today on

739
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,440
Pan'er will definitely learn martial arts from her master.

740
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,160
Then be good, okay, let’s continue doing palm pressure.

741
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,680
Princess, I can’t imagine Mrs. Ya’s mansion

742
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,320
There will be so many exotic flowers and plants

743
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,280
There are many things about my aunt that you can’t imagine

744
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,600
This flower pot is planted crookedly

745
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,000
give me a shovel

746
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,120
Princess, the slave forgot to bring the shovel.

747
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,960
You go back and get it, I'll wait for you here

748
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,080
yes princess

749
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,160
What's wrong with you? Are you bored after being locked up for so long?

750
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,040
Do you want to go out to play?

751
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,320
Is there a toilet nearby? Is it so big?

752
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,760
Is it you?

753
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,680
Is it you?

754
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,640
How could it be such a coincidence?

755
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,040
Do you still recognize me?

756
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,320
How could I not recognize it? I'm sorry

757
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,160
Why are you, a palace maid, here?

758
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,880
Me? Palace maid?

759
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,200
The maid should stay in the palace and serve...

760
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,240
Empress Dowager Cixi may be the unruly princess

761
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,520
I have also acted on TV

762
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,680
television?

763
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,080
Even if I tell you, you won’t understand.

764
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,320
But it's really a coincidence

765
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,800
The two times I saw you, you almost fell into the water.

766
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,400
Yes, I haven't thanked you yet

767
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,000
Why are you here?

768
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,920
Tell the truth

769
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,880
I am Xiang Shaolong, Zhao Pan’s master

770
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,360
It turned out to be you

771
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,760
Majestic, right?

772
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,240
What you say is interesting

773
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,360
If I guess correctly, you must not be from Handan

774
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,760
That's awesome. What's your name?

775
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,720
I?

776
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,160
What am I? Is your name ugly?

777
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,960
Could it be called Cat and Dog?

778
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,480
Otherwise, it’s Ah Zhu or Amao.

779
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,320
You are the cat and the dog

780
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,360
My flower seedlings

781
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,080
I'm sorry...I didn't mean to

782
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,720
They have been planting all morning, and you see they were trampled like this

783
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm back, is it you? Sir...

784
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,640
Madam, there are still many things for us to do

785
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,320
Let's go, let's go he...

786
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,240
Let's go

787
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,400
Am I not looking for the toilet?

788
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,240
Let's go back and ask our disciples.

789
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,560
master

790
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,240
Do you really not need to ask your servant to prepare a car for you?

791
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,800
No, I want to go for a walk by myself

792
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,600
That's it, go back, goodbye

793
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,840
Okay then, master, walk slowly

794
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,400
Master?

795
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,520
Isn't it? You sent someone to follow me again?

796
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,920
I'm going to give you a good beating this time

797
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,240
Do you want to fight in these clothes?

798
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,920
Just wait a minute
