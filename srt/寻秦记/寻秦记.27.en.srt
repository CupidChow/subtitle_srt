1
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,760
Master is leaving? What should Zheng'er do?

2
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,880
You have become a prince

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
Do you still need me to supervise you all the time?

4
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,280
you have grown up

5
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Where is the master going?

6
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,120
Of course go home

7
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,600
Could it be that the master's home...

8
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,640
My home is far away, my home is in the future

9
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,960
I don’t belong to this dynasty

10
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,760
And if you follow me

11
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,600
How can I go back when you are gone?

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,440
You'd better stay and be the king obediently, you know?

13
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,320
No, Zheng'er stays here anyway

14
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,800
The master will be here

15
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,560
No matter what, you don’t understand. Don’t worry.

16
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,840
After I leave, you will still have Mrs. Qin and Li Si to help you.

17
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,160
they can trust

18
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,880
But Zheng'er only trusted his master

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,680
Stop talking...I'll teach you the nunchucks

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
What about nunchucks?

21
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,680
Xiaogao

22
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,200
Xiao Gao is in the kitchen, Dad

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,000
Lao Ai, find Zhao Gao for me and come back

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,080
The prince should send a message to the eunuch

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,520
You go to Zhao Gao immediately and tell him that the prince wants to see him

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,160
Yes, obey

27
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,360
Is there nothing else to do?

28
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,560
So arrogant and rude

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,320
Simply arrogant

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,360
In the future, if he has thousands of troops

31
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,160
Or if you have military power

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,680
I simply don’t want to watch it

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,560
In fact, I also hate this person very much

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,040
Is there any way the master can reduce his power?

35
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,480
Three months for a term?

36
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,120
Yes, the Chief of the Imperial Guard is in charge of the palace gates

37
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,360
The power is very important, if it is fixed by one person

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,200
As time goes by, it is easy to threaten the guards to show their self-respect.

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,920
Once a rebellion occurs, it will be difficult to deal with it

40
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,280
It’s rare for a prince to think carefully and speak truthfully

41
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,480
Your Majesty, don’t take Lao Ai lightly

42
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,320
Lao Ai is quite loyal so far

43
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,360
But Zheng'er's suggestion is also to take precautions before things happen.

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,480
Well, the lonely king will set up left and right generals later

45
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,120
Mutual transfer for a period of three months

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you father for accepting your advice.

47
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,640
Your precious son targets me.

48
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,400
He told the king that he would transfer me to another position in three months

49
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,040
If this is true

50
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,360
From now on, my wife and I will be separated from each other.

51
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,040
Is this really happening?

52
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,520
Although it is said that a man has ambitions everywhere,

53
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,440
But now my heart goes out to my wife

54
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,040
If we can't meet each other in the future, we can only sigh and miss each other.

55
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,480
Don't worry, I will convince the king to revoke this decision

56
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,200
But I don't want to force you to make things difficult

57
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,360
How difficult is it to convince the king?

58
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,160
You must not wrong yourself by convincing the king.

59
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,120
It's getting late, I have to leave

60
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,560
Leaving so soon?

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,800
The future is long, don’t let it go just because of temporary reluctance

62
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,680
And missed something important

63
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,720
May the king be blessed

64
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,120
Ai Ji, there is no need to be polite

65
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,640
By the way, you said you were going to Dazheng Palace to stay quietly.

66
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,080
Why did you suddenly come back to the palace?

67
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,800
Could there be another madman breaking in?

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,960
Your Majesty, I have a nightmare.

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,120
My concubine cannot sleep peacefully

70
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,640
Having nightmares?

71
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,760
I saw a guard breaking into my bedroom.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,280
Turns out he's an assassin pretending to be a bodyguard

73
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,080
A sword pierced into the heart of my concubine

74
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,720
It's just a dream, don't be afraid

75
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,560
No, if it takes three months, the head of the bodyguards will be replaced.

76
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,720
Even if there are assassins pretending to be guards

77
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,440
No one can recognize it, it’s really dangerous

78
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,520
It also makes sense

79
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,800
So what if the king stays with his concubine every night?

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,920
The king doesn’t know martial arts

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,280
When the time comes, they will all be assassinated, wouldn’t it be...

82
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,400
Ai Ji, don’t worry too much…

83
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,720
My concubine has miraculous effects when she dreams

84
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,200
Is it possible that the king will regret it only when he sees his concubine being killed?

85
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,080
Of course the lonely king doesn’t want his dream to come true.

86
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,480
The one I trust most is Chief Lao

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,560
If you take him away, I will really not be able to feel at ease.

88
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,600
Well, just in case Ai Ji feels uneasy

89
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Lone king decides to lift three-month term limit

90
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,080
Aiji, don’t worry

91
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,640
Master, would you like to take a rest?

92
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,920
Do you know that it’s harder for me to stand than for you?

93
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,160
Do you know that you played poorly today?

94
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,360
Very bad?

95
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,320
Bad means that you are restless and do not play well

96
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,280
Zheng'er doesn't play well, it's all because of Lao Ai

97
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,920
I didn't expect him to be so powerful

98
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,480
The decision to order my father to revoke the three-month term of office

99
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,280
I don't think so, maybe the ground is hard today

100
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Error 504 (Server Error)!!1504.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

101
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,120
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

102
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,160
And he also knows the secret of my identity

103
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,800
Qin Tai Fu

104
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,960
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Xiang

105
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,480
No hard work, Mr. Qin

106
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,480
I'll leave Zheng'er to you to teach him how to read.

107
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,440
You two have known each other for a long time, why are you so reserved and polite?

108
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,040
Inform the prince, the king and the noble lady have arrived

109
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,520
father, mother

110
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,840
Your Majesty, Madam

111
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,200
Error 504 (Server Error)!!1504.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

112
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,280
The lonely king is trying to test Zheng'er's knowledge

113
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,160
Are you improving in martial arts?

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,680
I summarized Shang Yang’s reforms into six points

115
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,040
Which six are they?

116
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,520
Enforce the rule of law and maintain strict security

117
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,960
Advocate to increase production and reward military service

118
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,440
Tidy up the land, change customs

119
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,720
Which two items do you think have had the greatest impact so far?

120
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,640
Increase production to get rich, join the army to strengthen the army

121
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,760
The biggest threat to Qin came from the Xiongnu

122
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,560
What strategies do you have to avoid future troubles?

123
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,520
March beyond the Great Wall and take back the land

124
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,880
Build the Great Wall to connect the borders of Yan and Zhao

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,320
And built a city in Yunyang to garrison troops

126
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,680
Xiuyi Avenue leads directly to Xianyang

127
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,760
Once the Great Wall is invaded, reinforcements can be sent directly to the outside of the wall

128
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,440
Well, Zheng'er is not only good at martial arts,

129
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,400
Discussing politics and national policies more clearly and logically

130
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,480
This is the credit of Taifu Xiang and Taifu Qin

131
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,680
In fact, Zheng'er is a martial arts prodigy

132
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,960
Besides, he is usually hard-working and in good physical condition.

133
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,360
On the contrary, it was more difficult for Mrs. Qin to teach reading.

134
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,440
Yeah?

135
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Mr. Qin is so talented

136
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,880
And I can keep the festival for my deceased husband for many years.

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,880
Don’t ask to marry someone else

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,280
It can become a model for women all over the world to follow.

139
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,000
By the way, Your Majesty, let’s build a monument to Taifu Qin.

140
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,840
In recognition of his merit and chastity, do you think it's okay?

141
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,240
OK

142
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,440
not good

143
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,800
You are not going to really promise him

144
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,000
Let him help you build the chastity arch?

145
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,760
Why did Taifu Xiang react so strongly to this matter?

146
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,480
Don't you think there's something wrong?

147
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,800
What's wrong?

148
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,440
Of course it’s not appropriate, the chastity memorial arch is all about keeping chastity

149
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,880
you never really married

150
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
What should you do if you like someone in the future?

151
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,240
Also, it’s very hard for you to carry the monument all your life.

152
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,240
You don’t want me to bear the burden of merit for the rest of my life?

153
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,360
Of course I don't want to

154
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,240
Why?

155
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,120
By the way, why?

156
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,400
Do you think I will ever meet someone I like again?

157
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,400
maybe

158
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,720
If you like it, you have to like both sides.

159
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,320
Anyway, I don't want you to joke about these things.

160
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,640
Play by yourself for the rest of your life

161
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,280
What does my business have to do with you?

162
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,880
We are friends after all, I don’t want you to be single all your life

163
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,680
Taifu Xiang, why didn't you do it for

164
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,320
My sweetheart from my hometown

165
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,160
Build a wall in my heart

166
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,920
Isn't this stupid?

167
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,800
Is there anything else you want to say?

168
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,920
Are you worried about the prince again?

169
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,280
What's the matter, brother?

170
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,560
Speak up and we'll share your worries

171
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,360
The king said that he would build a monument for Miss Qin

172
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,240
What can I say to praise her chastity?

173
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,440
Erect a merit monument?

174
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,960
Setting up a merit monument is a high honor

175
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,600
Do you have a mental problem?

176
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,360
After the monument is erected, Miss Qin can no longer get married.

177
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,920
Will you help me remove this monument?

178
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,040
But this monument was erected by the king

179
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,720
If you dismantle it, you will be beheaded

180
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,640
It won't happen if you behead someone, but you have to take responsibility

181
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Do you want us two brothers to marry Miss Qin then?

182
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,840
By the way, if brother likes Miss Qin

183
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,880
Why don't you marry her, then there's no need to erect a monument?

184
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,760
By the way, since you like her

185
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,480
Don't you confess your love to her?

186
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,640
Ah Qing, please don’t let your temper get the better of you

187
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,320
I agreed to erect a monument

188
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,960
Otherwise, you will regret it later

189
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,400
Why is the godfather so sure that Qing'er will regret it in the future?

190
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,800
Godfather is a man too

191
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I see that Xiang Shaolong has feelings for you

192
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,120
It's a pity that he has never admitted it

193
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,000
Maybe he has something to hide

194
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,480
I think he never forgot

195
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,560
The girl he had back home

196
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
I'm afraid this is also an excuse

197
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,680
Could it be that he dislikes me for being married?

198
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,160
Xiang Shaolong is not a pedantic person

199
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,560
Besides, he also knows that you are only a widow in name only.

200
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,720
So Qin Qing really doesn’t understand

201
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,520
What is he thinking?

202
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,760
My daughter’s family is inconvenient to speak

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,720
It's better to let me be the middleman

204
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,040
Godfather, please don’t

205
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,960
Speaking too obviously

206
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,800
I'm afraid we can't even be friends

207
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,200
You can rest assured that your godfather has his own sense of discretion.

208
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,680
Mr. Zou, although you invited me to watch the stars

209
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,080
But I don’t really understand this thing about looking at stars.

210
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,160
No, today is not about appreciating the stars

211
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,000
But I want to drink and have some fun

212
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,640
Look, there seem to be two sets of stars over there

213
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,760
This one seems to have a line connecting two sets of stars

214
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,240
Today is the seventh day of July

215
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,920
According to legend, it was a good day for the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl to meet on the Bird Bridge.

216
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,760
Really? I know, we only see you once a year

217
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,000
Very infatuated and long-lasting, right?

218
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,280
It is indeed touching, but since the two are in love

219
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,200
Despite all the hardships

220
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,600
We should overcome all difficulties and come together

221
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,280
Brother Xiang, the worst thing about feelings is that they are obscure.

222
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,480
A man should dare to love and hate

223
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,760
I know that too, but what I'm most afraid of is

224
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,040
Even if I say it, she won’t understand

225
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,600
If you don’t understand, just say it until you understand.

226
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,000
Besides, the other party is a learned and intelligent woman.

227
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,320
It's no use even if she's smart, how could she believe it?

228
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,840
If it's true, there's always a way to make her believe it

229
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,320
Even if she believed it, she wouldn't accept it

230
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,480
This is something to say later. At least you should explain the matter clearly.

231
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,000
So that everyone has a choice

232
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,960
The most tormenting thing is the darkness

233
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,600
Brother Xiang, do you agree?

234
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,800
Come to pay homage to the princess?

235
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,080
Have you forgotten that I have a friendship with the princess?

236
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,720
Well said

237
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,680
Actually I really envy the princess

238
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,520
Can I have someone as emotional as you?

239
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,880
Can be entrusted for life

240
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes, but unfortunately she is no longer alive

241
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,320
But things are so strange

242
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,280
Not available when I want it

243
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Things always happen when you don't want them to

244
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,320
But she got it in the end

245
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,920
The promise given to her by her beloved

246
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,880
Even if I die, I will have no regrets

247
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,960
You are right, so I think

248
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,360
If you really make a monumental contribution, you will definitely regret it

249
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,240
If I get what he loves, I will be considered a monument

250
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,200
I also have the courage to tear it down

251
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,160
But the monument in your heart is the biggest obstacle

252
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,040
I always thought you were a daredevil person

253
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,840
In fact, it is nothing more than this

254
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,120
You're right, but I really don't want to embarrass anyone

255
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,920
I don't belong here

256
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,760
I can't take you away, do you understand?

257
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,760
If you want, no matter where you are in the world

258
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,360
Qin Qing is also willing to follow

259
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,120
Do you understand what I said?

260
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,880
I don't belong here

261
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,000
I really don't belong here

262
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,400
I am from the future world

263
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,080
Future world?

264
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,440
I came from two thousand years ago

265
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,640
I came here through time and space

266
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,320
I once told you

267
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,680
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

268
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,480
I think you know clearly

269
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,760
What I like is my former girlfriend

270
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,640
Xiang Shaolong, you are really bullying me too much.

271
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,200
You don't need to use such ridiculous excuses to reject me

272
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,000
That's not what I meant

273
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,960
Everything I said is true

274
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,120
I just don't want to hurt...I don't want to hurt you

275
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,320
I don’t want to tire anyone anymore, do you understand?

276
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,840
I don't want to hear such ridiculous excuses anymore

277
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,040
Just think that Qin Qing is passionate and trusts others

278
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,000
That's not what I meant

279
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,880
I'm afraid you and I don't even need to be friends from now on.

280
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,280
Because what you said was dishonest

281
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,720
Could it be that Xiang Shaolong really comes from two thousand years in the future?

282
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,440
He actually used such a ridiculous excuse

283
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,800
Just want to reject me

284
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,200
If he doesn't like me, he can tell me directly

285
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,280
I am a daughter

286
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,720
Confess to him regardless of shame and dignity

287
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,320
He really deceives people too much

288
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,040
Qing'er, there's no need for you to be angry

289
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,040
What Xiang Shaolong said may not be ridiculous

290
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,280
Does godfather really think there is such a thing as a person from the future?

291
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,640
Think about it calmly

292
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,960
Since the first time when scholars in Wei State discussed politics,

293
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,320
I already feel that this person is extraordinary

294
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,840
The words are astonishing, and the knowledge is unknown to today's people.

295
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,640
Capable of what others cannot

296
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,920
These can all be explained by talent

297
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,440
Don't you think his behavior and words

298
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,240
Is it much different from people today?

299
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,240
I heard that he once persuaded Li Si to defect to Qin.

300
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,360
There will be success in the future, and now Li Si's official career is prosperous

301
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:27,360
Furthermore, he also predicted that Ying Zheng would ascend to the throne of crown prince

302
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,320
The result was as he said

303
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,840
He also affirmed that Qin would definitely unify the six countries in the future

304
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,680
Godfather means

305
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,720
He is like a prophet

306
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,560
Can you predict the future?

307
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,400
No, if he really comes from two thousand years later

308
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,960
Of course he knows what will happen in the future

309
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,680
Or maybe he's like a godfather

310
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,440
Learn omens from the stars and then make inferences

311
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,800
But Xiang Shaolong doesn’t know how to observe stars

312
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:09,240
Moreover, the stars did not predict what he predicted.

313
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,960
It's incredible

314
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,880
I have a way to test it.

315
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,960
Miss Qin Miss Qin Qing

316
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,080
Let's talk slowly. Brother, I'm out.

317
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,440
What are you looking for me for?

318
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,440
My godfather has something to ask you.

319
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,480
What's up?

320
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,680
He made a hexagram to predict when the prince would ascend the throne.

321
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,360
and the fate of the kingdom

322
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,480
He wrote the results in the brochure

323
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,200
Since you are from the future

324
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,760
You should know when the crown prince ascended the throne

325
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,640
What is the lifespan of the Qin State after it unified the six kingdoms?

326
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,440
Godfather wants to know what you know

327
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,480
Does it match his prediction?

328
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,920
According to records in history books

329
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,040
Ying Zhenghui will ascend the throne half a year later

330
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,120
After Qin unified China

331
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,000
In fact, Qin’s lifespan was only fifteen years

332
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,200
It really matches, are you really a person from the future?

333
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,480
Could it be a coincidence?

334
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,680
Whether it's a coincidence or not, you'll know in a year and a half

335
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,520
If you still don’t believe it, take a look at this thing

336
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,480
In fact, this is the receiver of the time machine

337
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,520
Why is there light flashing?

338
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,160
Because there is electricity inside

339
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,840
In fact, I did many things because I wanted Yingzheng to ascend the throne.

340
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,560
It's because of the day he ascended the throne

341
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,200
The receiver receives future messages

342
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
take me back

343
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,520
No wonder you know a lot about the future

344
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,320
It turns out you are from the future

345
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,840
You finally believe it now

346
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,200
You see now why I can't

347
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,520
Have sex with anyone here

348
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Because I always have to leave

349
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,080
Then just think that what happened between us was a misunderstanding

350
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,000
By the way, your hometown girlfriend

351
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,120
Does he really look exactly like me?

352
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,920
Yes, exactly the same

353
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Even the temperament is the same?

354
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,280
You are much gentler and gentler

355
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,560
There is something that the prince really does not understand

356
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,160
Why did your father set up a monument to your merits that day?

357
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,640
You did not refuse immediately

358
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,720
And only now do you flatly refuse?

359
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,080
Why does the prince think I should refuse immediately?

360
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,200
Because this prince thinks

361
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,600
It's a pity that Mrs. Qin won't marry.

362
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,400
No one cares, so what's the shame?

363
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,960
Besides, I have no merit or virtue

364
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,400
It is a shame to set up a monument of merit and virtue.

365
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,080
So I rejected the king’s kindness.

366
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,920
It is indeed a good thing to reject the merit monument

367
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,160
In fact, Taifu Qin and his master Lang Cai Nv Mao

368
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,480
A perfect match

369
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,760
If you miss the other party because of setting up a merit monument

370
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,600
That would be such a pity

371
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,120
Prince, please be careful what you say, lest your master hears it.

372
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,120
It's even more embarrassing when we meet

373
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,560
What's more, your master and I are only casual acquaintances.

374
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,200
But I see that the master appreciates you very much

375
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,320
He often praises you in front of me

376
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
Really? He complimented me?

377
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,400
Since they are casual acquaintances, why should we be so worried?

378
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,560
The prince is the heir to the throne, please be careful with your words and actions

379
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,760
Although the master has given the title of princess

380
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,840
But there is no real obstacle between you two.

381
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,960
Wouldn't it be a great thing if we got married?

382
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,200
But why do you always avoid it?

383
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,720
It’s hard to believe that there are many lovers in the world

384
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,880
There are many obstacles and it is not easy to be together

385
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,200
Given to you, made by my own hands

386
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,920
Can you stay here tonight?

387
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,920
I have told the king that I am not feeling well today

388
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,160
He won't come to Dazheng Palace anymore

389
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,960
In fact, every time I know that the king is coming to favor you

390
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,320
My heart feels very sad

391
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,320
The slave family often complains of illness recently

392
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,440
The king rarely spends any time here anymore

393
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,920
This approach is not a long-term solution

394
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,280
But what's your plan?

395
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,400
As long as I can stay with you forever

396
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,880
The slave is willing to do anything

397
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,240
My status is low, what do you gain by following me?

398
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,120
I once told you

399
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,080
A woman must rely on a man

400
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,360
You have to rely on a powerful person

401
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,080
The slave family just wants to be with someone

402
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,320
The man who I like and loves my slave family

403
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,360
The slave family doesn't care about power and status at all

404
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,520
It's a pity that I have your man now

405
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,920
is a powerful person

406
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,840
I can't completely own you

407
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,400
But you want to...

408
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,280
We must support each other

409
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,280
There will be good days in the future

410
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,440
Don't worry, as soon as you get the chance

411
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,240
I will definitely recommend you to the king

412
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,920
The king has arrived

413
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,360
Welcome the king

414
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,040
I didn’t know that the king was coming, so I failed to greet him respectfully.

415
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,840
Ai Ji, there is no need to be polite

416
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,320
It was late at night, and the lonely king could not sleep

417
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,720
The night is long, I don’t know what to do

418
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,600
I want to talk to my beloved concubine

419
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,560
It’s been a long time since the lonely king slept with Aiji and talked at night.

420
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,040
My dear, why is there a man's belt in your bedroom?

421
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,560
Your Majesty, who do you think this belt belongs to?

422
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,240
Has Prime Minister Lu been here?

423
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,120
Has your Majesty heard any more rumors?

424
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,960
After the last blood test,

425
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,240
The king still does not believe that the concubine and Prime Minister Lu are innocent

426
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,440
So this belt…

427
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,560
This belt was sewn by my concubine for the king.

428
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,080
Due to poor workmanship, the size may be wrong.

429
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,160
Planning to revise it overnight

430
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,760
The concubine’s good intentions only arouse suspicion

431
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,320
Ai Ji calmed down, maybe it was because of the lonely king's insomnia.

432
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,800
So if your mind is confused, don’t blame Gu Wang

433
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,560
Since the king has insomnia

434
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,000
It is better to let my concubine serve the king and take a hot bath

435
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,600
This will make it easier to fall asleep

436
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,560
Aiji is still thoughtful

437
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,600
who?

438
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,680
Just a gust of wind blowing down some objects

439
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,560
The king is suspicious again

440
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,840
Chief Lao uses a left-handed sword.

441
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,960
This prince is accustomed to using his right hand, which is really out of place for him.

442
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,840
Whether it's left or right hand

443
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,320
If the principle of sword moves remains unchanged, why is it so inconsistent?

444
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,000
It’s all about human effort

445
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,960
This prince has always practiced swordsmanship with Taifu Xiang

446
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,760
I really can’t adapt to your sword moves.

447
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,920
The subordinates were also entrusted by the noble lady

448
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,360
If the prince cannot adapt, his subordinates will not force him

449
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,520
Zheng'er

450
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,920
daughter

451
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,400
See Madam Luxurious

452
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

453
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,800
Why don't you appreciate it?

454
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,960
I have Taifu Xiang to teach me

455
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,640
Commander Lao and your master each have their own strengths in martial arts.

456
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,760
You learn one more sword technique

457
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,600
Good for you and no harm to you

458
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,200
You use the swordsmanship that Mr. Lao taught you just now

459
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,160
Let's practice it once and show it to my mother.

460
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,120
Yes, mother

461
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,560
Since the last time the king suspected

462
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,600
The Nu family and Lu Buwei are separated from each other.

463
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,960
The king placed eunuchs in the palace

464
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,480
Be the eyes and ears to monitor the slave family

465
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,520
You'd better be patient for now

466
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,400
Since the king suspects that the adulterer is Lu Buwei

467
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Why not take advantage of the situation?

468
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,320
If we can provoke discord between the two of them,

469
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,520
Then it will be beneficial to us without any harm

470
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,480
lady

471
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,800
Buwei

472
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,240
Madam called me down, what is the important matter to discuss?

473
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,880
Since the last time there were rumors that Zheng'er was not orthodox,

474
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,640
The king is often suspicious

475
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,800
I suspect there is no connection between us

476
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,880
I want to remind you to be careful

477
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,040
Thank you madam for your concern

478
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,080
But the king has no evidence and no evidence, and there is nothing he can do to me.

479
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,040
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

480
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,800
Buwei, do you know how lonely the slave family is in the palace?

481
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,640
I often think of you and my past love

482
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,400
Madam, why worry about being lonely when the king is with you?

483
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,360
You know who the slave family cares about

484
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,080
Buwei, can you stay with me tonight?

485
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,200
Madam, don't act arbitrarily

486
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,440
Now everything is undecided, please be patient

487
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,040
Etc. future…

488
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,120
The slave family has endured enough. How can one night of comfort be enough?

489
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,840
Do you also want to be so tolerant to the slave family?

490
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,840
Zhu Ji…

491
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,880
Great King... Great King

492
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,640
Good job you guys

493
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,560
Why did the king say this?

494
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,400
The Prime Minister stayed in Madam Huagui's bedroom for no reason

495
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,520
Now I still ask why the lonely king said this?

496
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,160
Your Majesty, I have heard that the noble lady has been ill recently.

497
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,120
So I come to say hello

498
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,840
Greetings? Do you want a hug?

499
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Just now, Madam felt dizzy and her steps were shaky.

500
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,800
Wei Chen just stepped forward to help him

501
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,200
Come here, I'll ask you

502
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,240
What's your deal with him? Tell me

503
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,040
What kind of activities does the king think his concubine can do?

504
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,200
Madam, please explain clearly.

505
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,160
Do you admit it? Do you admit it?

506
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,280
Anyway, this is not the first time that my concubine has been suspected by the king.

507
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,480
In vain, Fei Chen’s concubine was imprisoned in the State of Zhao for more than ten years.

508
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,120
After a lot of hard work, I wholeheartedly look forward to returning to China as soon as possible

509
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,960
Reunion with the child's father and family

510
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,440
Enjoy family happiness

511
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,680
Unexpectedly, after returning to China, I would not enjoy the happiness of family relationship.

512
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,240
Instead, he lives in rumors all day long

513
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,760
I've had enough of this kind of life

514
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,520
Your Majesty, please give this concubine her death.

515
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,880
Madam, madam, please get up

516
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
That's not what I mean

517
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,920
It's just that you are alone in the same room.

518
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,960
inevitably suspicious

519
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,840
This is also my concubine’s improper treatment of guests.

520
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,680
The king is always the king, the prime minister is always the prime minister

521
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,120
The ruler and his ministers must never overstep their bounds.

522
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,760
Well said madam

523
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,880
Your Majesty, what you said is wrong. It’s called catching a thief and taking away the stolen goods.

524
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,880
The minister and his wife are dignified and upright

525
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,760
Your Majesty, why do you see this humble minister behaving deviantly?

526
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,640
Any words of arrogance?

527
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,960
These words not only made Wei Chen heartbroken

528
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,760
It even discourages the civil and military officials who are dedicated to serving the country.

529
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,400
The minister and the king have been friends for more than ten years and have gone through many hardships together.

530
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,280
Still no match for the villain’s slander

531
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:15,800
I wonder if the rest of the subjects are more likely to be blamed?

532
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,440
How can the king make hundreds of officials work hard for the court?

533
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,560
Prime Minister's words are serious

534
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,040
It is said that water can carry a boat and also capsize it

535
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,320
The throne of the Great King is hard-won

536
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,880
Your Majesty, please be careful in your words and deeds.

537
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,840
It's all your fault

538
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,400
The villain knows his crime...

539
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,600
Someone is coming...

540
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,000
King…

541
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,240
Drag him out and beat him fifty

542
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,160
obey

543
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,680
King…

544
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,680
Wish you the best…

545
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,160
Gentlemen, what important matters need to be discussed today?

546
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,760
Your Majesty, the Korean envoy Zheng Guo is good at water conservancy.

547
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,440
I recently inspected my country’s water conservancy facilities

548
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,760
It is recommended to go from Jinghe River to Luohe River

549
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,920
Dig a canal three hundred miles long

550
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,000
It is used to irrigate farmland. I think it is desirable.

551
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,160
Prime Minister Yang, what do you think?

552
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,600
Your Majesty, this is a serious matter and should not be taken lightly.

553
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,560
What Prime Minister Yang said makes sense. This matter can be discussed later.

554
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,800
Your Majesty, agriculture is the foundation of a country and should not be neglected.

555
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,720
Even if it is to develop water conservancy projects, people from the Qin State should be in charge.

556
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,640
Why should outsiders worry?

557
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,320
The king employs people based on their talents and makes good use of them

558
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,600
There has always been no distinction between nationalities. What Prime Minister Yang said is wrong.

559
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,800
King Yingming

560
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,080
Prime Minister Yang is from a prominent family in the country

561
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,960
Moreover, he is pro-government and loves the people

562
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,120
What Prime Minister Yang said was all for the benefit of his country.

563
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,400
nothing wrong

564
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,760
Thank you King

565
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,680
Dear ministers, what else needs to be discussed at court?

566
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,440
Your Majesty, I would like to express my gratitude to Prime Minister Lu yesterday.

567
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,640
There are some opinions on the conscription system mentioned.

568
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,240
Accurate performance

569
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,040
Your Majesty, I suddenly feel unwell.

570
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,760
Please leave early

571
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,520
Zhunzou, Prime Minister Lu, please take care of yourself.

572
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,320
Mom, you missed the mark again

573
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,760
The child didn't give in at all and kept attacking with every move.

574
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,960
How do you deal with calling your mother?

575
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,120
What’s the point of giving in to each other?

576
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,560
Of course, you have to work hard to be happy enough

577
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,120
Mom gave up

578
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,960
Okay, let’s play the next game

579
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,680
See Prime Minister Lu

580
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,520
Madam, Prince

581
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,360
Prime Minister Lu is polite

582
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,960
It's useless to play, I'd better go back to study and make strategies.

583
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,040
Of course there's no point in playing around all day long

584
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,080
But occasionally playing chess is also good for the body and mind

585
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,240
It would be better for Wei Chen to play against the prince.

586
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,000
Prince, Taifu Qin has been waiting for you for a long time.

587
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,280
The prince promised Taifu Qin that he would just take a short rest.

588
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,120
Go back to your room and continue reading

589
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,800
Yes, learning is important

590
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,680
Let’s play chess with Prime Minister Yi next time

591
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,360
OK

592
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,520
Mom, the child has resigned

593
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,480
The slave resigns

594
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,200
Xiao Gao, thank you for being smart enough

595
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,360
The prince praised

596
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,600
You guys retreat first

597
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,200
Yes, ma’am…

598
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,280
Why does the Prime Minister sigh?

599
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,320
The prince smiled at his wife Yan Yan

600
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,200
But when it comes to me, you always treat me as a minister

601
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,960
It’s not that…

602
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,000
Who doesn’t want a loving father and a filial son?

603
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,600
Live a happy life

604
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,760
sneaky days

605
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,800
Don’t know when it will be over?

606
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,360
Madam, you have suffered for too long

607
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,560
Zheng'er already knows the truth

608
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,760
We, mother and son, have relatives, which means we have no relatives.

609
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,120
The king has doubted you and me...

610
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,800
I'm afraid that the days ahead are really unpredictable.

611
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,120
Don't worry, madam, I won't let the king hurt you.

612
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,960
I'm just worried about you

613
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,120
In case the king is bad for you...

614
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,800
No, he has no such opportunity

615
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,440
Your Majesty, Prime Minister Lu wants to see you.

616
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,800
The humble minister meets the king

617
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,800
Prime Minister Lu just resigned because he felt unwell.

618
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,040
Why did he leave and come back so quickly?

619
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,960
I beg your Majesty to allow me to resign and return to my hometown.

620
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,480
Prime Minister Lu, why did you say this?

621
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,960
As the saying goes: "There is no beginning for luxury, and there is an end for nothing."

622
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,280
Wei Chen really couldn't bear to see his relationship with the king

623
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,120
Supporting each other from the beginning

624
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,440
Eventually it turned into mutual suspicion

625
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,200
The Prime Minister may have misunderstood. Prime Minister, please get up.

626
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:58,680
Your Majesty, I think back to when the minister and your Majesty were in the Kingdom of Zhao.

627
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,120
Feel like old friends at first sight, open your mind and treat each other with sincerity

628
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,640
The humble minister even spent a lot of money to buy Mrs. Huayang

629
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,920
Accept the king as the crown prince

630
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,760
He even gave his beloved concubine to the king.

631
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,840
Not only that, the Prime Minister risked his life

632
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
Rescue the lonely king from the Kingdom of Zhao

633
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,320
Let the lonely king successfully ascend the throne after returning to the country

634
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,880
The Prime Minister is no longer a high-ranking official and well-paid

635
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,080
Is he a great minister?

636
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,400
Besides, the prime minister is a businessman.

637
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,480
The word "profit" must be the first one

638
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,720
Didn't you have any selfish intentions when you met the lonely king that day?

639
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,520
It's just a rare thing to live in.

640
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,520
Yes, Wei Chen is indeed a person who pursues wealth and power.

641
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,880
Therefore, the king should understand better

642
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,280
Weichen will never do it for a woman

643
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,760
And ruin your own future in vain

644
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,480
Things that have already been produced back then are no longer coveted by the humble ministers.

645
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,080
For more than ten years, I have only known myself to be loyal to my duties and to be loyal to my liver.

646
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,000
Between you and me, the monarch and my ministers, we already trust each other

647
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Unexpectedly, after returning to China after saving the noble lady and the prince,

648
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,440
cause gossip

649
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,720
The king misunderstood and suspected the minister

650
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,000
There is a blood test first

651
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,680
And again at the court meeting, you and I were tit for tat

652
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,880
The Prime Minister said something serious. Just now at the court meeting

653
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,520
The lonely king is outspoken and outspoken, not intentionally targeted.

654
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,160
As the saying goes, don’t trust people when you employ them, and don’t use people when you are suspicious.

655
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,240
Since the king misunderstood and suspected the minister,

656
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,040
What's the use of a humble minister sitting in his dead body and having a plain meal?

657
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,400
Even if the humble minister wants to help the country

658
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,960
Complete the king’s unification of the six nations

659
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,320
Now I'm afraid this dream will never come true again

660
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,000
Prime Minister, don't act out of emotion

661
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,480
Political affairs are complicated now

662
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,120
How can anything be accomplished by relying on the strength of a lonely king alone?

663
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,240
The prime minister is the right-hand man of the lonely king

664
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,440
The indispensable prime minister

665
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,840
The past of the king, the minister and the noble lady

666
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,920
Always a thorn in the king's heart

667
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,280
How could the lonely king be a mere woman?

668
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,840
And it will damage the friendship between the lonely king and the prime minister.

669
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,800
Prime Minister, please don't act out of emotion...

670
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,960
King Yingming

671
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,080
Your Majesty, the old grudges between you, my king and my ministers have been cleared.

672
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,640
How about I, the humble minister, have a drink with the king?

673
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,520
Good idea, prepare wine

674
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,920
Yes, Your Majesty

675
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,480
King

676
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,880
When the earth revolves around the sun

677
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,600
It's called revolution, which is one year of the earth

678
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,160
When the earth makes a circle on its own, it is called rotation

679
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,040
equal to one day on earth

680
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,920
Brother Xiang’s words

681
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,560
Really excellent knowledge

682
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,200
The so-called down-to-earth reality is not actually the reality.

683
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,600
So, are the people on the ground moving together?

684
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,160
Smart, in fact, except that we are rotating

685
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,360
The earth itself also has gravity

686
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,760
So to a certain extent

687
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,040
We may be upside down in a corner of the earth

688
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,920
It's incredible

689
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,320
But the changes in people are always greater than the changes in the earth

690
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,040
Yeah?

691
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,800
Yes, let me give you an example

692
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,200
In your era, it was actually ugly to say

693
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,000
Women are just accessories to men

694
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,400
But it was different in my time

695
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,640
Women not only do well in school but also make more money

696
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,640
Also, many senior officials are held by women

697
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,840
really?

698
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,560
Of course it’s true, you wouldn’t believe it if I told you

699
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,600
In my day, a man had to marry a good woman

700
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,000
is very difficult

701
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,720
Is it true that the Taifu is a master?

702
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,720
What does a master say to himself?

703
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,880
The two masters... are incredible

704
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:41,160
The two tutors... are incredible, Your Majesty...
