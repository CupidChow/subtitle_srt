1
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,240
Why can't I think of this?

2
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,600
Use a lightning rod to draw electricity down

3
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,280
Then connect it to the communicator with copper wire

4
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,760
Wouldn't it be possible to charge it this way?

5
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,160
I just stare at the sky every day in a daze

6
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,480
I can't think of such a simple method

7
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,360
He also went to ask someone to find a way to turn sulfur into sulfuric acid.

8
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,000
Do you think he is hopelessly stupid?

9
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,040
That's right. I don't know if that kind of sulfuric acid exists.

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,880
And you may not be able to find it

11
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,600
That's right

12
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,920
It's summer now, it should rain often

13
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
I believe it won't be difficult to catch lightning

14
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,080
Want to go deeper

15
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,360
This method of catching lightning may not be feasible

16
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,280
Why?

17
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,120
The power of lightning is so amazing

18
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,640
It can even split a huge tree that is hugging each other.

19
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,600
And the size of the communicator is so small

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,280
How can you bear it?

21
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,560
That's right

22
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,800
Even big trees can be split open

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,160
Then the communicator should also...

24
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,280
What to do?

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,040
I can't find a way to turn sulfur into sulfuric acid.

26
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,320
You teach me how to...

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,600
It’s not that I didn’t try hard to find it, but…

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
never mind…

29
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,200
I'm not trying to force you to do something you don't like to do.

30
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,640
I know you still prefer painting

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,640
Brother Xiang made this conclusion, and Qin Qing did not refute it.

32
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,800
Since Qin Qing can't help

33
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,320
I'll resign first

34
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,880
Miss Qin has a gentle and patient personality

35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,840
Rarely irritated

36
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
It seems that she is really angry this time

37
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,280
I think Miss Qin just doesn’t want you to leave, brother.

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,440
If this is the case, the eldest brother should not blame her.

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,320
After all, she is obsessed with you

40
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,760
Shaolong, you are here this time

41
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,280
Are you looking for me or Qin Qing?

42
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,520
Find Qin Qing

43
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,200
She came back just now

44
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,640
Go into the room angrily

45
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,520
He also ordered his servants not to see any guests today.

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,640
Is she angry?

47
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,160
If you are willing to stay, she will certainly be happy

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,000
If you want to leave, there is nothing she can do

49
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,480
It's a pity that you can't leave now

50
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,520
I want her to think of a way to send you away.

51
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,320
How uncomfortable she feels now

52
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,840
Sulfur? Sulfuric acid?

53
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,720
Medicinal stones usually come in two forms: water-like and block-like.

54
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Sulfur also has a watery form

55
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,800
Wouldn't a transformer suffice?

56
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,640
You don't have to understand what it draws

57
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,280
Anyway, just help me tie some ordinary copper wires

58
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,920
Does it really have to be as thin as a thread?

59
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,320
yes

60
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,040
I have made a lot of bronze tripods and bronze mirrors.

61
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,760
I’ve also made wine glasses as detailed as this.

62
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,360
If you want to make copper as thin as a wire

63
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,640
I've never done it

64
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,680
Just do your best

65
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,320
Yes, I can help

66
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,120
Then...I try my best

67
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,040
I'm tired

68
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,040
Caiyi, don’t you like eating millet grains?

69
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,440
Then eat millet

70
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,240
Caiyi, drink some water to moisten your throat

71
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,760
Sing a song for us?

72
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,840
Not even interested in eating

73
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,000
Why are you interested in singing?

74
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
Jing Jun

75
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,880
Miss Qin, let me introduce you

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,760
This is the talented girl Qin Qing who is famous all over the country.

77
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,640
It turns out to be Miss Qin Qing, no wonder she is so outstanding

78
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,920
Too much

79
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,800
My name is Lu Niangrong, I am a friend of Brother Jing

80
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,320
are very good friends

81
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,040
Qin Qing can also see that you are close friends.

82
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,680
By the way, where is Brother Xiang?

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,160
The eldest brother and the second brother went to the copper foundry early in the morning.

84
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,960
Second brother is back

85
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,840
Miss Qin

86
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,560
Brother Teng

87
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,920
Second brother, Miss Qin wants to find the eldest brother

88
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,640
Big brother is still in the factory

89
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,960
Forgetting sleep and eating to build copper wire

90
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,600
I believe I won’t be back for dinner tonight either

91
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,280
Second brother, please talk slowly

92
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,480
By the way, why does Brother Xiang want to build copper wire?

93
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm not too clear either

94
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,240
Talk about pressure reduction, resistance...

95
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,680
It's meant to catch lightning

96
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,360
By the way, Miss Qin, do you have anything to do with your elder brother?

97
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,000
Qin Qing read all the letters at home

98
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,880
The book does mention items similar to sulfur

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,800
Yeah?

100
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,000
But refining sulfuric acid from sulfur

101
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,200
It requires several procedures

102
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,960
The exact ingredients are not mentioned in the book.

103
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,640
The implication…

104
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,200
Qin Qing just has some undetermined opinions

105
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,360
It's not specific enough and I don't want to tell you.

106
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,680
To prevent Brother Xiang from getting angry

107
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,320
Miss Qin, will you still help big brother?

108
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,040
Yes, of course it will, why did Brother Teng say this?

109
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,080
My eldest brother was rude to Miss Qin before

110
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,880
I'm afraid you'll be angry with him

111
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,000
Caiyi, are you eating something?

112
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,320
Look at you, you're so hungry that you're dull

113
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,760
If you continue like this you will die

114
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,560
Yes, Caiyi, we are so good to you

115
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,960
Everything is accommodated to you, what else do you want?

116
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,040
If you do it for the sake of the birds

117
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
You should let it go and let it be free

118
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,960
You reluctantly built a cage to lock it up

119
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,160
No matter how nice you are to it, it won't be happy.

120
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
Because it doesn't belong here at all

121
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,160
Qing'er, what happened?

122
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,360
It's okay, I got a few pieces of sulfur from the alchemist

123
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,760
I hope to try refining sulfuric acid

124
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,560
Have you really decided to send Xiang Shaolong away?

125
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,160
I just want people to stay

126
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,080
The result is overwhelming

127
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,680
Makes everyone unhappy

128
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Why don't you try your best to help and fulfill Brother Xiang's wish?

129
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Take a break, Zhao Gao

130
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,280
The slave is here

131
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,840
Go get the chessboard for me

132
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,080
The slave obeys the order

133
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,160
Your Majesty, hard work pays off, but play is useless.

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,720
Now the prime minister has become Zhongfu

135
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,240
He is also in charge of state affairs.

136
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,880
This puppet of a widower

137
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,400
What is the difference between diligence and play?

138
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,680
Your Majesty, people must insult themselves and others will insult them.

139
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,120
If the king gives up political affairs and is willing to be a puppet

140
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,960
Not to mention Father Zhong, even other ministers

141
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,000
I will never take the king seriously in the future.

142
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,160
Your Majesty, Zhongfu assists the government

143
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,120
The purpose is only to make Qin rich and powerful

144
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,160
If the king is prepared to fight, he will give you insights

145
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,280
Father Zhong will definitely look at him differently

146
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,680
How can he regard the king as a puppet again?

147
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,520
Could it be that Li Yushi had some insights?

148
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,400
Your Majesty, I am the monarch of the Qin Dynasty

149
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,520
They all aim to unify the six countries as their ideal

150
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,280
Therefore, in the policy policy

151
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,240
should be placed above the word "unification"

152
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,000
Makes sense

153
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,640
King, the chess pieces have arrived

154
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,880
Play it yourself

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,320
I want to listen to Li Yushi's way of unification

156
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,560
Thank you King

157
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,480
The so-called unity does not refer to geographical boundaries.

158
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,160
True unity is the will of the people

159
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,920
To reach the hearts of the people, we must first start with customs and culture

160
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,240
Now the world is divided

161
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,200
Not only do languages ​​differ from country to country,

162
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,120
Even between the southeast and northwest of the country

163
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,360
Each has his or her own criteria

164
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,440
As a result, the situation cannot be released

165
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,480
It is also extremely inconvenient for traders to do business

166
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,840
Therefore, I think it is urgent to

167
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,080
is to formulate a set

168
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,560
Language, writing and weights and measures shared by the world

169
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,080
That’s it…

170
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,440
Wei Chen believes that this matter does not need to be rushed

171
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,000
Your Majesty, please discuss other government affairs first.

172
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,400
I don’t know what the ministers think?

173
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,440
The few think they want to dominate the world

174
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,640
You must do this first

175
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,160
The world has not yet been unified

176
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,640
Only the unified writing system in Qin State

177
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,240
What does it mean?

178
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,000
The most urgent task is to take advantage of the victory and pursue it

179
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,400
Develop a strategy to attack the Six Nations

180
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,760
The six countries had no chance to breathe

181
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,920
The issue of unification of characters can be put on hold for the time being.

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,840
But there is something... Your Majesty

183
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,440
Father Zhong has more experience in handling government affairs than the king.

184
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,960
Your Majesty, let’s do what Father Zhong wants first.

185
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,400
Great King, early today

186
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,920
I have long said that it is useless no matter what I say.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,560
What kind of books and cars share the same track?

188
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,240
It's like nonsense in their eyes

189
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,520
What will happen to the place where precious classics are abandoned?

190
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Prime Minister forgive me

191
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,880
It was Wei Chen who accidentally dropped his hand.

192
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,120
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, if you want to rule the country

193
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,600
You must first read the poems and books of sages and delve into knowledge

194
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,240
Only then are you qualified to discuss politics

195
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,080
Does Father Zhong mean that a few people are not qualified to discuss politics?

196
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,560
What's wrong with the suggestion just now?

197
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,880
Talking about ideals is unrealistic

198
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,840
so-called unification

199
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,960
Not limited to geographical boundaries

200
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,520
True unity should be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people

201
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,520
Start with customs and culture

202
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
The king wants to unify

203
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,040
Let’s finish reading the scriptures here first.

204
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,240
Please accompany your Majesty to study well

205
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,200
yes

206
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,640
Wei Chen resigned

207
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,840
Your Majesty, please be patient

208
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,080
A little calm and not impatient?

209
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,760
Now your idea has been dismissed as worthless

210
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,160
Your Majesty, a view beyond the present

211
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,600
It is really difficult to be recognized by the modern world

212
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,800
The so-called summer insects cannot speak of ice

213
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,040
It’s no wonder that Prime Minister Lu only cares about the current national conditions.

214
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,480
He has no foresight at all

215
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,080
He should be the one who wants to study

216
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,640
He wants the few to read, but the few refuse to read.

217
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,080
Zhao Gao

218
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,000
The slave is here

219
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,200
You accompany me on an outing outside the palace

220
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,240
Out of the palace?

221
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,480
Your Majesty, this is absolutely impossible

222
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,160
In case Prime Minister Lu comes...

223
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,600
There is a way

224
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,840
King

225
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,120
You study well here

226
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,880
Never let anyone know through it

227
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,720
Your Majesty, I'm afraid this matter...

228
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,840
The king retires...

229
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,360
Sirs, what do you do for me?

230
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,600
Let's take a look first, please

231
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,520
In the palace every day...

232
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,440
Be careful what you say

233
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,720
It would be bad if someone finds out your identity.

234
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,040
King

235
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,400
I mean those sets of clothes that I wear at home every day

236
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,520
It's so boring

237
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,520
This one seems quite special

238
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,280
Grandpa, do you like this shirt?

239
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,400
If you are sincere and want to buy it

240
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,080
I can make it cheaper for you.

241
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,840
No need ok

242
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,320
OK…

243
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,760
How? Does it look good?

244
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,520
Of course it looks good, Your Majesty

245
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,560
I mean my surname is Dai Wang, and this is Mr. Dai Wang.

246
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,080
Dai Gongzi's majestic appearance

247
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,440
Wearing this shirt will definitely complement each other.

248
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,840
Boss, you are also very glib.

249
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,520
It was delicious

250
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Yes, it is simply better than the cooking skills of the royal... royal chef

251
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,160
No matter how delicious it is, there’s no need to wolf it down like this

252
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,400
Ashin is

253
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,200
Sorry, guest

254
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,160
How do you do things if you don’t have eyes when you walk?

255
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
You go on a rampage and the evildoer files a complaint first.

256
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,240
So what about rampage?

257
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,080
You should apologize if you go on a rampage. You should step back first.

258
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,400
Apologize, you two.

259
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,600
One less sentence per person

260
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,960
Sir, she soiled your clothes

261
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,680
Not even an apology

262
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,120
This shirt…

263
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,360
Girl, it seems like you and I have never met

264
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,200
It's too much, take off your clothes immediately

265
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,680
you let go

266
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,600
As a woman, how can you be so arrogant?

267
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,360
Yes, girls are really shameless

268
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,840
Touching a man in broad daylight

269
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,080
It's simply disrespectful

270
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,080
You two are shameless, shirt thieves

271
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Why do I need to steal clothes when I am wearing dozens of coins?

272
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,400
This shirt is obviously stolen.

273
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,440
Let me go, girl

274
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,640
You'd better be more dignified, if you keep fussing...

275
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,360
Yes, I fought back

276
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,080
The pattern on this shirt

277
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,560
This girl dyed it herself

278
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,040
Unique in Xianyang

279
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,640
Fabric originally printed with patterns

280
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,320
The styles made are not like this

281
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,040
Now it has become such a common style

282
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,760
It's obvious that you stole my girl's fabric

283
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,000
Then take it and modify it

284
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,600
simply ridiculous

285
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,160
We are not tailors, nor are we big girls.

286
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,360
Why do you have the ingenuity to change your clothes?

287
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,720
Yes, this shirt

288
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,960
I bought it at a clothing store for five dollars.

289
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,840
really?

290
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,760
If you don’t believe me, you can go to a clothing store and ask the owner.

291
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
Okay, this girl will go and ask for clarification right away.

292
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,880
too much

293
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,160
This girl is quite interesting too

294
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,520
Boss, you did a good job

295
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,280
How dare you alter the clothes designed by this lady?

296
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,120
Where are the clothes designed by this girl?

297
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,640
Why is it missing?

298
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,200
Are they all sold out? Right? Boss

299
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,680
You are really dreaming about spring and autumn

300
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,720
All your clothes are here

301
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,560
It’s unreasonable that you would take the clothes I designed

302
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,240
Put it all in the suitcase?

303
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,640
You've had these clothes in plain sight for a long time.

304
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,080
No one cares about it at all

305
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,400
Is this true?

306
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,280
See for yourself

307
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,760
The clothes you made are in weird colors and nondescript

308
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,280
I don’t know if it’s a top or a bottom?

309
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,200
It’s hard to determine, how do you ask people to dress?

310
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,040
This dear man is wearing this shirt

311
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,520
Also because I changed it to a serious style

312
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,040
Only then can it be sold

313
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,000
Is it you again?

314
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,520
trouble you

315
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,600
Don’t put weird clothes on consignment anymore

316
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,440
So as not to frighten the guests

317
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,640
Indeed chic

318
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,840
I think these clothes are unique.

319
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,800
Bold and novel, with special colors and great style

320
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,520
Did you hear that? There are guests who appreciate it

321
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,800
In fact, dressing is the same as being a human being

322
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,520
Break the original restrictions from time to time

323
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,160
Just imagine if it were on the street

324
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,000
What’s the point of everyone wearing the same clothes?

325
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,320
It’s true that heroes think alike

326
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,840
This girl thinks so too

327
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,720
I bought it all

328
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,640
real?

329
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,040
How much? Boss

330
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,280
Let me do the math first

331
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,040
I'm so happy. I didn't expect to meet my soulmate today.

332
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,280
I'll let my little sister take over and invite the young master to have a feast.

333
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,120
OK

334
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,680
I was really offended just now

335
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,000
My little sister gives you a glass of wine as an apology.

336
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,000
You're welcome, we don't know each other without fighting.

337
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,800
This shirt has been modified

338
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,840
Actually it looks good

339
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,680
Of course, the young master has a majestic figure

340
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,840
Wear any clothes and look outstanding

341
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,280
You...

342
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,320
It all depends on the style designed by Miss Lu

343
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,440
It’s just unique enough with the printed and dyed fabrics.

344
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,000
There are also these models, which can be said to be unique and ingenious.

345
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,240
It's a pity that most people just stick to the old ways

346
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,040
Wearing the same clothes is boring

347
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,480
Mr. Dai’s words really touched my heart.

348
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,800
Dressing is actually a kind of culture

349
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,840
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

350
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,560
If you remain conservative

351
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,240
How can there be a new situation?

352
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,680
Just like King Wuling of Zhao State

353
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,800
He changed the clothes of the Central Plains into Hufu

354
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,680
Make the public feel refreshed

355
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,960
My little sister traveled there

356
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,560
You can also feel the new atmosphere of Zhao people

357
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,240
Yes, Zhao Guo is indeed a good place

358
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,360
Especially Handan City

359
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,800
Talents flourish, eat, drink and have fun

360
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,000
I don’t know how many times more than Xianyang City.

361
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,800
Mr. Dai also visited the State of Zhao?

362
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,360
Yes, I grew up there

363
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,280
Could it be that Mr. Dai is from Zhao?

364
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,520
Qin people, of course they are Qin people

365
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,720
By the way, since Miss Lu is interested in designing clothes,

366
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,520
Why not open your own shop for sale?

367
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,600
It’s always better than consignment to ordinary stores

368
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,360
Your clothes were ruined by an ignorant boss

369
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,600
I think so too. It's a pity that my father is old-fashioned and conservative.

370
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,400
I object to my little sister showing her face

371
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,720
How could he pay the little girl to open a shop?

372
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,920
Money is just a small problem. If Miss Lu is serious,

373
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,880
I can help you below

374
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,600
real?

375
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,200
Just buy that store just now

376
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,880
So that the ignorant boss can

377
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,560
I know how powerful Miss Lu is

378
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,840
I will also expand the store by then

379
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,080
Is it you again?

380
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Sorry, guest

381
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,760
Miss Lu

382
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,800
Brother Jing

383
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,760
Miss Lu

384
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,160
Are you okay?

385
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,440
Do you know that I have been waiting for you for two hours?

386
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm worried about you, I'm worried about you meeting a thief

387
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,480
I'm worried that your father won't allow it, and I'm worried that you'll forget

388
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,920
I wanted to leave just now

389
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,200
But I'm afraid you'll come as soon as I leave

390
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,520
Now that I see you, I feel relieved

391
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,200
You're so stupid. You've been waiting here for two hours.

392
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,080
I just went to Taifu's Mansion

393
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,520
I came immediately when I saw you hadn't returned.

394
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,240
I never thought you were really still here

395
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,880
Yes, a gentleman promises a thousand pieces of gold

396
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,440
Make an appointment to meet here

397
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,120
Anyway, I have to wait until you come

398
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,880
Don't be so stupid next time

399
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,440
Maybe I really don't remember

400
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,000
By the way, why are you so late?

401
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
I'm happy to say that

402
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,160
I just met a young man in the market

403
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,040
He is simply my soulmate

404
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,960
Soulmate?

405
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,400
No, it should be said that they are talented people.

406
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,360
That young man admired the clothes I designed very much.

407
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,120
Not only did he buy all my clothes

408
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,960
And the more we talked, the more we agreed.

409
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,680
He also promised to help me open a clothing store

410
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,880
Showing courtesy for nothing, either committing adultery or stealing

411
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,800
We can say we hit it off right away

412
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,400
That young man is tall and tall

413
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,000
You look really good wearing the clothes I designed

414
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,400
It can be said to be a raw sign

415
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,320
It turned out to be a handsome young man

416
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,120
No wonder someone is so late

417
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,920
I've been waiting here for two hours in vain.

418
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,520
You also know that you are stupid, right?

419
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,640
Yes, I'm a fool

420
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,000
It's getting late and I'm hungry again

421
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,480
Jing Jun said goodbye

422
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,960
Okay, let's go home and say goodbye

423
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,400
Just connect these copper sheets to lightning rods

424
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,440
to reduce the resistance of lightning

425
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,720
When there is lightning, we can try

426
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,200
Third brother, look, the copper wire has been made

427
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,880
Miss Lu just came to see you

428
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,800
What's wrong? With a sullen face

429
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,120
Did you quarrel with Miss Lu?

430
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,840
No, Miss Lu may be someone else.

431
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,280
How long have they known each other?

432
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,360
I only know that they have known each other for a day

433
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,240
But I don't know who he is

434
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,600
But after only one day of knowing each other, he was actually willing to pay.

435
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,320
Open a clothes shop for Miss Lu

436
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Do you think this person has ulterior motives?

437
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,960
So fast and so generous

438
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,720
What does Miss Lu mean?

439
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,640
She was so happy when she heard it

440
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,280
Then you are really in danger

441
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,800
How is it? Brother

442
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,920
How is it? I am also a Taifu after all.

443
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,280
I will definitely support you

444
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,200
Just decide

445
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,440
I'll pay for you and Miss Lu to open a shop

446
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,080
Then you can stare at her every day

447
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,960
Is it right to show great courtesy and do whatever you want?

448
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,920
Big brother

449
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,120
Oops, I can’t go to the opening ceremony of the clothing store

450
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,560
Calm…

451
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,760
It turns out to be the king

452
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,640
See Prime Minister Zhongfu is polite

453
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,520
The king is polite

454
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,440
I am rushing to see the Queen Mother

455
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,960
I don’t want to talk to Father Zhong any more.

456
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,200
Your Majesty, why are you wearing such strange clothes?

457
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,040
Yes, I don’t know if he is an envoy from South Korea or Yan State

458
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
gift sent

459
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,800
It's a pity that no one is wearing it in the palace.

460
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,640
So I tried it on

461
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,440
I'll change it back later.

462
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,280
Let's go then

463
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,720
Prime Minister, this servant resigns.

464
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,080
I think I've seen that shirt somewhere before

465
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,600
Our store opens new store today

466
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,760
Dear neighbors, please come in and take a look.

467
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,240
Not only is the price affordable

468
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,200
Free tea and pastries are also provided

469
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,160
If you don’t want to buy, come in and take a look.

470
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,880
Come in and eat even if you don’t want to watch.

471
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,880
Yes, we allow everyone to eat and drink here

472
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,920
yes…

473
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,960
Can I eat without spending money?

474
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
Yes, you can eat it without spending money

475
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,280
Come in and visit while you eat.

476
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,240
Please come in here. Please feel free to...

477
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,480
As soon as people hear that you can eat and drink, they immediately rush over to you.

478
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,400
It's really lively

479
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,400
This is the mentality of being greedy for petty gains

480
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,480
Taifu Xiang is indeed extremely intelligent

481
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,520
You can think of such a special method

482
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,680
What’s so special? It’s often found in Mong Kok

483
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,520
Mongkok?

484
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,480
You don’t know, this is my eldest brother’s hometown

485
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
I really want to visit Mong Kok if I have the chance.

486
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,080
OK

487
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,480
The boss is here

488
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,160
Your Majesty, this is Taifu Xiang

489
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,480
Don't be afraid

490
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,240
Dai Gongzi

491
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,800
Miss Lu

492
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,480
I'll introduce a friend to you, come here

493
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,120
Taifu Xiang, this person is helping me

494
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,800
Mr. Dai who runs this clothing store

495
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,080
Mr. Dai?

496
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,040
Yes, my surname is Dai Mingwang

497
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,080
It turns out that I fell in love with you at first sight

498
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,440
This is Mr. Dai

499
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,280
I didn’t expect that Miss Qin and Mr. Dai knew each other.

500
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,560
Miss Qin, it turns out that you and Mr. Dai are acquaintances.

501
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,320
Miss Qin is my teacher

502
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,400
Miss Qin, why are you here?

503
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,680
Miss Lu, Miss Qin is a talented woman famous all over the world

504
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,680
If even she were wearing our clothes

505
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,920
I believe others will rush to follow suit

506
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,720
Yes, Mr. Dai is really thoughtful.

507
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,360
Miss Qin

508
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,560
Let me show you the clothes I designed

509
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,360
OK come

510
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,800
Zhao Gao

511
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,480
Why do you dare to take the king out of the palace privately?

512
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,600
Don't make it public, Miss Lu doesn't know my identity

513
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,840
Yes, if the Queen Mother and Prime Minister Lu find out

514
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,440
I'll probably be beheaded

515
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,360
Dai Gongzi

516
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,160
I’m afraid it’s hard for Prime Minister Lu not to know this time.

517
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,320
They are father and daughter

518
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,200
What father and daughter?

519
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,320
Niang Rong and Prime Minister Lu are father and daughter

520
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,920
Don't you know?

521
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,560
I really don't know

522
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,200
It would be bad if this were the case

523
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,160
If you want to pursue someone, you don’t want to find out their details.

524
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,640
I only know how to use silver to attack

525
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,440
Why does Brother Jing look unhappy?

526
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,320
Could it be that Brother Jing is against Miss Lu...

527
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,400
Don't talk nonsense

528
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,040
go to toilet

529
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,320
Brother Jing, come in and help me mix the paint.

530
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,080
Miss Qin wants to learn how to dye cloth

531
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,720
OK

532
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,760
I want to try it too

533
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,600
OK

534
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,560
Sorry, it doesn't matter

535
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,160
You should say sorry

536
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,240
never mind

537
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,320
It's a pity to stain such beautiful clothes

538
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,800
Do you need a change of clothes?

539
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,920
No need, in fact Miss Jing Lu was so aggressive

540
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,920
The patterns on this dress are even more beautiful.

541
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,760
That's right, it looks more natural and smooth without any chiseling.

542
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,120
I'll go in and mix the paint.

543
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,840
No

544
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,240
You go in, get drinks, and come out to greet the guests.

545
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,160
I'll help too

546
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,960
let me help

547
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,160
How dare I trouble you, my lord?

548
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,360
Just call me Mr. Dai.

549
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,680
The villain dare not, my king

550
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,120
Are you deliberately making fun of me?

551
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,360
If I want to tease you intentionally

552
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,840
I have already called you King in front of my mother-in-law.

553
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,080
I didn't mean to deceive Miss Lu

554
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,960
I just don't want to use my supreme power

555
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,720
Come and win the beauty

556
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,320
What Niang Rong hates the most is climbing the dragon and attaching herself to the phoenix

557
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,240
If she knows your true identity

558
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,840
She must break up with you

559
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,760
If you expose my identity with a villain's heart

560
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,880
To win Miss Lu's favor is better than using force.

561
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,040
I am by no means a villain

562
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,040
But I know it’s impossible for you and Niang Rong

563
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,120
How can we see it?

564
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,280
Are you two done yet?

565
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,360
Knowing that you can’t do something, let it go early

566
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,320
Lest your reputation as a king be in jeopardy

567
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,640
An unmarried man and an unmarried woman, what not to do?

568
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,200
What he said is correct

569
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,040
Big brother

570
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,480
Forget it, you two brothers have a fight

571
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,200
Why bother arguing over a girl?

572
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,880
Isn’t it enough to have fair competition?

573
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,240
Did you hear that?

574
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,920
OK, I won't lose to you

575
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,160
What are you talking about? What won’t you lose?

576
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,400
No, I taught the two of them to play "Hoe Brother"

577
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,520
yes

578
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,440
There are many customers outside. Come out quickly and help greet them.

579
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,080
OK

580
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,080
I'm so angry

581
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,800
Children can be taught

582
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,520
The king is so fascinated by what he is reading.

583
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Li Si?

584
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,680
Li Si, we are back

585
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,880
I also bought you some new clothes

586
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,400
Li Si, no need to pretend anymore

587
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,080
yes

588
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,080
King

589
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,720
middle father

590
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,920
Mr. Lu

591
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,160
It's like this. I saw that I had been studying for too long just now.

592
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,560
Feeling a little bored

593
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,280
So I went out to play with Zhao Gao

594
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,000
It has nothing to do with either of them

595
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,600
Prime Minister, forgive me...

596
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,960
The king puts on new clothes

597
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,760
Could it be that he met some girl outside?

598
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,080
Of course not

599
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,920
I just bought it while passing by the market.

600
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,280
really?

601
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,880
Seriously, I'm just greedy for novelty.

602
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,280
But take a closer look

603
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,840
This kind of clothes is really difficult to wear in an elegant place

604
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,800
Zhao Gao and Li Si, throw it away immediately

605
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,880
Yes, Your Majesty

606
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,160
It would be best if your Majesty can understand the general situation.

607
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,440
Follow the teachings of Zhongfu

608
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,080
Dad, why did you come back so early today?

609
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,920
On weekdays, my father always discusses state affairs with the ministers until late at night.

610
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,960
Dad regrets that he has indulged you since childhood

611
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,440
Now you are daring to act recklessly and cause trouble everywhere

612
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,200
What did the daughter do wrong to make her father angry?

613
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,280
How dare you open a clothing store in the market without telling dad?

614
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,200
What clothing store?

615
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,480
Do you still dare to deny it? Dad has already sent someone to investigate.

616
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,000
That clothes shop you opened in the market

617
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,720
It's a business partnership between you and a young master.

618
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,880
Now that dad knows everything

619
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,600
Why do you need to ask your daughter?

620
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,120
Do you know the young man who paid for your shop?

621
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,440
He is the current king

622
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,760
Your Majesty? Is there any misunderstanding?

623
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,880
Do you think dad is trying to make something out of nothing?

624
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:47,000
Yes, Dai Wang...is the king

625
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,840
really unexpected

626
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,280
Are you still laughing?

627
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,240
Dad, what's wrong with my daughter getting to know the king?

628
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,280
My daughter has traveled around the world and has known people all over the world.

629
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,160
Whether he is a prince or a trafficker or a pawn

630
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,120
When young men and women interact freely, they will eventually...

631
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,080
In short, it is inconsistent with etiquette

632
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,400
It turns out that the father is afraid that his daughter will fall in love with Mr. Dai.

633
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,880
In fact, my daughter just loves making clothes.

634
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,920
I never thought about love at all

635
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,280
But where will my daughter's love go in the future?

636
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,640
It seems that dad shouldn’t interfere either.

637
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,560
Love can go anywhere

638
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,400
But it is absolutely impossible to return your love to the king

639
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,880
What’s the reason? Dad

640
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,920
Is it true that the rumor that the king is his father’s illegitimate son is true?

641
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,880
Bold

642
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,400
Such words that blaspheme the power of God and deceive the emperor

643
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,080
Dad forbids you to say that again

644
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,960
Dad has never interfered with your relationship with anyone.

645
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,880
Dad did this this time entirely for you.

646
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,400
Dad knows that running a clothing store is your wish

647
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,440
This time dad will let you continue the business

648
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,280
But you have to promise dad

649
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,640
I will cut off all contact with the king from now on.

650
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,080
Brother Jing

651
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,960
wear the same clothes

652
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,440
But our Mr. Dai is tall and tall

653
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,880
dress better

654
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,880
In comparison, Mr. Jing pales in comparison

655
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,880
The flattery of a villain is like farting

656
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,320
By the way, Mr. Dai, why are you so free?

657
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,120
Aren’t you busy with everything at home?

658
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,680
Brother Jing, you are also a subordinate of Taifu Xiang.

659
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,640
Logically, it shouldn’t be in a clothing store

660
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,840
Doing such a sissy job

661
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,200
It was Niang Rong who called me down personally.

662
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,640
Be her sign of life

663
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,000
It's a pity that I ruined this dress

664
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,440
Who do you think ruined his clothes?

665
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,640
The clothes made by Miss Lu were put on Mr. Dai

666
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,800
Of course it's better

667
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
I don't think so

668
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,720
I think Brother Jing wears this dress just right

669
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,640
Did you hear that?

670
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,640
Our civilian clothes

671
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,720
It is not suitable for someone of your status to wear.

672
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,440
Miss Lu, why did you say this?

673
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,280
Are you the current king?

674
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,360
He actually calls himself Dai Mingwang

675
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,680
Dai Wang...it's a shame you figured it out

676
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,240
Did you say it?

677
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,240
I don't

678
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,760
It doesn’t matter who says it

679
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,360
This girl hates people being dishonest the most

680
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,280
no integrity

681
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,520
Miss Lu, I didn’t mean to deceive

682
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,240
Whether it’s intentional or not

683
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,440
Dad already knows that I'm dating the king

684
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,800
He was very unhappy. In order to save the store

685
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,200
Please don’t come here again in the future

686
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,000
I’ll give you back the money you spent to open a shop

687
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,120
We won’t owe each other anything in the future

688
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,320
Miss Lu

689
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,400
Stop talking, I have no choice but to

690
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,400
let's go

691
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,000
The king is the king of a country and should not leave the palace without permission

692
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,120
Wander around the market

693
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,280
The widow is just...

694
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,640
The king has reached the age of marriage

695
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,160
Weichen Zhuancheng brought portraits of ten noble girls

696
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,240
Let the king choose the queen from among them

697
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,520
When did the widow say she wanted to get married?

698
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,960
Get married as soon as possible so that the king can concentrate on handling government affairs

699
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:44,000
To prevent the king from wandering around again and making mistakes

700
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,960
These women are strangers to everyone else

701
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,080
How can a widow be asked to marry them?

702
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,480
What's more, Taifu Xiang once said

703
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,840
Men and women must be in love with each other and be happy with each other

704
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,280
Only then can we become husband and wife

705
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,720
The king's marriage is a national event

706
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,720
Moreover, we will face each other day and night after marriage

707
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,920
Naturally, they will fall in love with each other and be happy with each other.

708
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,520
absurd

709
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,600
National affairs are at your mercy.

710
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,600
Now you even interfere in the marriage of a widower?

711
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,720
You must obey your parents’ orders on marriage matters

712
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,240
As the father-in-law, the minister has the right to make decisions for the king.

713
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,040
you…

714
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,600
When it comes to getting married, everything must be done

715
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,360
Your Majesty, please think carefully.

716
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,120
too much

717
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,080
King

718
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:45,920
mother queen

719
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,240
Father, he forced me to get married

720
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,760
i heard

721
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,840
When a man marries a woman, they should be in love with each other

722
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,240
How can you get married to a person who has no feelings?

723
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,960
Zheng'er, you'd better listen to Father Zhong.

724
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,400
Do you even say that to your mother?

725
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,320
You just ascended the throne and your foundation is not yet stable.

726
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,680
If you are at odds with your father-in-law at this time,

727
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,920
It will only do no good to everyone

728
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,320
You are in the same boat

729
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,520
Don't care about others' feelings at all

730
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,080
The slave resigns

731
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,320
put it here first

732
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,960
What a spectacle

733
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,200
Why is it so hot today?

734
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,040
I think it will rain soon

735
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,480
I have calculated that there will be a thunderstorm today

736
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,720
Brother, can you leave immediately?

737
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,600
Not yet, these bundles of copper wires need to be used for experiments

738
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,400
I don't know yet how strong its resistance is

739
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,960
I don’t dare to connect it to the communicator rashly.

740
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,640
Shaolong

741
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,880
Then you need to do more experiments before you can get it accurately.

742
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,520
Without further ado, let’s take a short break

743
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,000
Then conduct the experiment immediately

744
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,960
godfather

745
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,720
Miss Qin

746
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,320
Qin Qing can't be of much help

747
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,240
I just brought a few umbrellas

748
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,920
I hope that if it rains later, everyone will not get wet

749
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,600
Miss Qin is so attentive

750
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,120
thank you

751
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,120
Are you ready?

752
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,760
we are ready

753
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,440
If lightning strikes down, the fish will not die

754
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,920
It means that the resistance of those bundles of wires is successful.

755
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,600
We'd better stand aside and wait.

756
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,960
All burnt

757
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,720
All the hard work for many days was in vain

758
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,400
Just as I expected

759
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,080
Lightning is so powerful

760
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,760
Or is Miss Qin prescient?

761
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,200
If only we had listened to Miss Qin

762
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,120
There's no need to waste so much effort.

763
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Do I really want to stay here and never go back?

764
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,400
It won’t work…Second brother, third brother come over…

765
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,280
Look at this brochure for me

766
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,960
Has the word "electricity" been mentioned from beginning to end?

767
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,320
Okay... look quickly...

768
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,960
Electricity...

769
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,000
master

770
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,760
It’s so irritating, I won’t be the king anymore

771
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,880
What's wrong

772
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,440
Lu Buwei is really too bullying

773
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,760
Not only did he control the government

774
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,640
Now they want to force me to get married

775
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,560
So what?

776
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,000
He forced me to marry some noble daughter

777
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,640
I don't know you at all, I have no feelings

778
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,080
As a great king, it is normal for you to marry a noble.

779
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,120
This is just a political marriage, so why is it surprising?

780
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,880
Are you reluctant to leave Miss Lu?

781
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,840
Second brother, you are so stupid

782
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,240
How could the king be reluctant to part with Miss Lu?

783
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:00,920
you must have forgotten

784
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,920
The king will have three palaces and six gardens in the future, and many concubines.

785
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,080
One more Miss Lu is not much

786
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,040
It would not be less if one Miss Lu is missing.

787
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,400
Not just Miss Lu, but...

788
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,800
There is absolutely no freedom now

789
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,760
Ever since I entered the palace, I have become a puppet

790
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,320
Master, I don’t want to live like this anymore

791
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,080
Do you know you are so annoyed?

792
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,760
Please don't do it every three days.

793
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,680
Just say in front of me that you don’t want to be the king anymore, okay?

794
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,840
you…

795
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,880
Listen to me now

796
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,120
Go back to the palace immediately and be your king

797
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,200
It's too much

798
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,080
Do you really not need to pay attention to him?

799
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,400
Go and see how he is

800
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,800
Second brother, it might be raining outside, bring him an umbrella.

801
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,360
In the whole world, no one understands me

802
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,600
King

803
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,560
Your Majesty, Brother Xiang asked me to bring it to you.

804
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,720
Don't call me king again

805
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,680
I'm not a king at all

806
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,000
Anyway, I’ve been doing it for so long

807
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,080
Anyway, let's keep doing it.

808
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,840
If I had known that I would have...

809
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,520
If I had known I would not listen to Master's words

810
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,760
You don’t know something, it’s really miserable to be a king

811
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,520
I know it's miserable

812
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,720
But Master, he is still making trouble unreasonably

813
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,880
Don't blame your master

814
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,800
Your master's experiment failed, so he is inevitably in a bad mood.

815
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,440
What kind of experiment is it?

816
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,600
To connect with the lightning in the sky

817
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,080
If the experiment fails, he won't be able to return to his hometown.

818
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,760
What are the difficulties in returning to your hometown?

819
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,560
Just one baggage and a fast horse are enough

820
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,800
It's not that simple, it has to do with history

821
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,880
What is the present, the future, etc.

822
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,320
Since Master feels

823
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,800
Returning to my hometown is more important than my destiny

824
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,880
I have nothing to say

825
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,760
Your own destiny should be decided by yourself

826
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,080
Your Majesty, I'll stay with you and take you back to the palace.

827
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,880
No need

828
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,520
It's hard to blame him. The king didn't grow up in the palace.

829
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,240
He was suddenly asked to face such a political marriage

830
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,240
It's really hard to accept

831
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,480
I see

832
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,480
Or find an opportunity to discuss it with the Prime Minister

833
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,160
See if we can put the marriage on hold?

834
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,840
Be calm and don’t be impatient…

835
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,680
Taifu Xiang, Taifu Qin

836
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,320
Taifu Xiang and Taifu Qin, something bad is going on...

837
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,200
What's wrong?

838
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,200
The king is missing

839
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,160
What?
