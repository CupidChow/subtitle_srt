1
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,120
King Zhao is too polite

2
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,800
Not only a high price

3
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
Buy all the horses brought by Dong

4
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,960
And I have to trouble you, Mr. Hou.

5
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,240
It was so kind of me to arrange a place for Dong.

6
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,120
You're welcome, Mr. Dong.

7
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,600
Mr. Dong took the opportunity to learn about our country Zhao.

8
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,640
Recently, due to some reasons, there are no war horses available.

9
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,120
Come all the way

10
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,920
Solve the urgent needs of Zhao State

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,520
Mr. Dong’s kindness and kindness are extremely valuable.

12
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,960
Dong is a horse fanatic

13
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,840
Of course, I hope the horses I raise will be put to use

14
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,400
I hope that King Zhao will test horses in the spring suburbs soon.

15
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,240
Satisfied with Dong's horses

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,080
Just buy Dong’s horses in large quantities.

17
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,400
The horses raised by Master Dong will not disappoint

18
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,080
Come, have a drink. Okay

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,400
Thank you for your trouble, Lord Marquis

20
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,880
I heard the real Dong Kuang

21
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,120
In order to save the king of Chu, he blocked the car with his hand

22
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,680
So on the arm

23
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,440
There should be a scar from being run over by a carriage

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,920
Mr. Hou is really smart

25
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,240
Such a trivial matter cannot be hidden from Mr. Hou.

26
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,560
But the real Dong Kuang

27
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,520
That scar is not on the left hand

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,040
But on the right hand

29
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,800
The reason why Mr. Hou had doubts about Dong Kuang

30
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,160
It's because of Dong Kuang

31
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,240
He has always been loyal to Chu State

32
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,080
I will never turn against you rashly

33
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,160
Is it true to sell horses to Zhao Guo?

34
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,520
In fact, Dong Kuang has the same feelings for Chu as Lord Marquis

35
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,760
You guys stand down

36
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,960
Is there any hint in what Mr. Dong just said?

37
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,480
Dong came to Zhao State this time not for business.

38
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,680
I was ordered by Lord Chun Shen to assist you, Young Lord.

39
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Complete the important task of assassinating King Zhao

40
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,520
Dong was ordered by your Majesty

41
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,280
Your secret letter has been brought

42
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,720
Please take a look at it, Mr.

43
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,560
It is indeed your handwriting and seal.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,960
Your Majesty knows that Young Master endured humiliation and suffered a lot.

45
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,760
Now is the time

46
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,040
Dong was specially sent to assist Shaojun in his actions.

47
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,960
Why the secret letter sent last month?

48
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,800
This was not mentioned?

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,080
Because now the time is ripe, Zhao State is short of horses

50
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,600
So Dong comes in handy

51
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,840
Dong approached King Zhao in the name of selling horses

52
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,240
The day of the horse test in the spring suburbs was the time to assassinate King Zhao.

53
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,840
At that time, the Chu army will suppress the country in one fell swoop

54
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,760
really?

55
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,560
Your Majesty has already deployed according to Shaojun’s previous intelligence.

56
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,200
Deploy troops and generals, arrange the main army

57
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,240
Dealing with the weakest defense on the southern border

58
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,160
I have been waiting for this opportunity for many years

59
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,280
Mr. Dong, I offended you a lot just now.

60
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,000
Young Master is a cautious person

61
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,280
Not as careless as that King Zhao

62
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,040
Even if King Zhao is in danger of death,

63
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,200
It’s also your own fault

64
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,560
The King of Zhao dies, the Kingdom of Zhao dies

65
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,880
good…

66
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,440
big…

67
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,080
uncle

68
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,640
Is everything going well?

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,360
Finally good luck, this old fox

70
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,680
A little carelessness almost reveals the truth

71
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,240
Also, it’s really hard to say words in your day and age.

72
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,640
Fortunately I'm smart

73
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,520
My tongue hurts from talking about it, you know?

74
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,400
How strange

75
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,560
The horoscope of the new saint I saw last night went off track.

76
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,080
It seems that I have entered the Zhao realm

77
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Could it be that the new saint is now in Zhao territory?

78
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,120
Tomorrow, when talented people discuss politics, it will be possible to discover

79
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,360
Miss Qin, hello you two

80
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,520
Mr. Dong

81
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,120
Mr. Dong is the same as me

82
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,240
Being a guest at the Yingbin Villa of Juluhou Mansion

83
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,720
Yes, I didn’t ask for advice…

84
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,600
Old man Zou Yan

85
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,040
Master Zou, a long-respected name

86
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,800
You're welcome...Qin Qing is my goddaughter

87
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,040
I have already seen Miss Qin’s painting skills.

88
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,720
It turns out that the flowers and whiskers can be folded straight.

89
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,960
Don't wait until there are no flowers and break branches, this is the work of Miss Qin

90
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,400
It sounds very profound

91
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,680
But even a rough guy like me can understand it at a glance.

92
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,080
Really clever

93
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,200
Excuse me Kotokiyo

94
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,440
In fact, it was the servant who was rude.

95
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,000
Whether making friends through writing or drawing,

96
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,000
It’s also a beautiful thing

97
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,520
I travel everywhere, hoping to make friends with knowledgeable people

98
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,720
Mr. Dong, I hope you will also be a guest at Juluhou Mansion

99
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,200
They must also come here for tomorrow’s discussion of politics by talented people.

100
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,120
Julu Hou is really polite

101
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,960
Not only did he invite me and Qin Qing to come to Handan City,

102
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,240
Even sincerely hold a banquet in Tianxing Cave

103
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,360
So that the knowledgeable people in the world can

104
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,000
Get together and talk about world affairs

105
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,040
Mr. Dong, you must attend the meeting

106
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,600
must

107
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,720
Today’s gathering of intellectuals discussing politics

108
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,320
I believe there will be a lot of fun

109
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,400
Mr. Zou, I am here for you and Miss Qin.

110
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,120
Is it okay to arrange this political discussion venue?

111
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,360
Mr. Hou, you are unique

112
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
I am really grateful

113
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,720
Mr. Zou is famous all over the world, and Miss Qin is knowledgeable and talented.

114
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,720
This time Ken was invited to come to Handan

115
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,960
Give me the opportunity to listen to politics and expand my knowledge

116
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,760
It is truly my honor

117
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,480
You’re welcome, Mr. Hou…

118
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,680
Prime Minister Tian, ​​General Han, you two are here too.

119
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,240
Mr. Hou, now that the guests are almost here,

120
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,360
I'll go notify Qin Qing

121
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,240
Please do it

122
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,520
The two of them took the trouble to come here

123
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,720
Seems to want something else

124
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Although I, Tian, ​​am not a talented person, I am very good at discussing politics.

125
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,160
Able to understand the way to quell the war between the six countries

126
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,880
A mere thousand miles away, Tian didn’t realize the hard work

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,960
Prime Minister Tian has a high position, so he naturally has unshirkable responsibilities.

128
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
I, Han Chuang, have it easier.

129
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,960
To be honest, I don’t have much talent

130
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,680
As long as I can see Miss Qin's face again

131
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,560
Listening to the piano girl’s piano skills

132
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,320
My trip is not in vain, Lord Marquis, is it?

133
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,120
It’s not just General Han who’s chasing Miss Qin’s skirt.

134
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,840
And Li Yuan and Uncle Li Guo

135
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,200
I don’t know why I haven’t arrived yet?

136
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,160
Maybe he already has a new love

137
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,560
It seems that these people are only here for Miss Qin Qing

138
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,280
He said he was an official

139
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,560
It's like I've never picked up a girl in my life

140
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,960
No wonder they were all wiped out by Qin in the future

141
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,320
Mr. Dong

142
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,240
Miss Qin

143
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,440
Miss Qin…

144
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,080
Everyone, please take a seat. No need to be formal.

145
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,920
Fortunately, it’s not too late, hello everyone…

146
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,600
Miss Qin, after seeing each other for several months, she is even more beautiful than before.

147
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,120
Of course

148
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,400
At least Miss Qin won’t be like you, Brother Li.

149
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,440
Suffering from Single Thought

150
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
A graceful lady, a gentleman is a good man

151
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,040
Long Yangjun is not here again today

152
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,080
I believe no one will object to me saying this.

153
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,680
As the saying goes, everyone has his own merits

154
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,400
Talking about people behind their back is not what a gentleman does

155
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,240
I haven’t asked you yet...

156
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,800
I am Dong Kuang, a horse herder from Chu State.

157
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,360
It turns out that he is a crazy Dongma who sees more animals than people.

158
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,480
Li Guojiu, Mr. Dong first arrived in our country

159
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,840
He is the honored guest of the king of this country

160
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,040
Since today is a time for scholars to discuss politics,

161
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,600
Why don't we start now?

162
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,360
Mr. Zou, please forgive me for being rude.

163
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,400
before discussing politics

164
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,840
Please ask Miss Qin to play a song for us

165
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,320
Let’s clear our minds, shall we? Okay…

166
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,760
I have prepared two small gifts for Miss Qin.

167
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,760
Brother Li Yuan

168
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,360
Have you collected another unique treasure to give to your beautiful lady?

169
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,760
Then you have to see it

170
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,800
I hope Miss Qin won’t dislike it, come here

171
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,680
Qin girl is a guqin

172
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,000
This is no ordinary Guqin

173
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,680
It was used by Boya

174
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,360
My friend is dead, Boya broke his qin and stopped playing.

175
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,880
Therefore, Boya's Qin has long been lost.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,400
Already patched

177
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
And this piece of music is famous all over the world

178
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,640
"Nine Songs" written by Qu Yuan, an abandoned minister of Chu State

179
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,960
It is indeed the authentic work of Master Qu Yuan.

180
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,720
It’s really rare…

181
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,000
Miss Qin, as long as you like it

182
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,480
Brother Li, such a shabby old piano and music score

183
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,760
It can actually be used as a greeting gift, which is a bit embarrassing.

184
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,600
I am Xianbao

185
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,480
General Han is too blind to recognize the treasure.

186
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,920
Digging out random things in the ground that were used by ancient people

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,840
Just treating it as a treasure would be too shabby

188
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,040
Boya broke his qin because of the death of his friend

189
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,280
Qu Yuan was concerned about the country and the people, so he expressed the meaning of "Nine Songs"

190
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,360
So our descendants should respect these two ancient relics

191
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,440
It's rare that Qin girl likes it

192
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,480
It can be seen that Miss Qin is not a shallow person

193
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,760
Although I don’t know much about guqin and qin music,

194
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,200
But there are also many rare treasures

195
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,880
As long as Miss Qin likes it

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,960
I can definitely serve it at any time

197
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,960
Thank you, Mr. Hou, for your kindness

198
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,120
But what Qin Qing wants in her heart is beyond human power

199
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,960
Watching the sky at night with Qin Qing

200
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,280
I often feel that the night is intoxicating

201
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,320
It is the embellishment of stars

202
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,480
So what Qin Qing wants in her heart is a star

203
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,200
The reason why we chose this place as the place to discuss politics today

204
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,800
I hope you understand that you can’t sit in a well and look at the sky.

205
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,880
Like a frog in a well, stuck in its ways

206
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,640
Should jump out of the hole

207
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,040
Get rid of selfish desires and benefit all people in the world

208
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,520
Miss Qin said it very well

209
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,360
You remind me of a story from before

210
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,920
Why don't you let me tell you?

211
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,240
a long time ago

212
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,640
There was a young man who kept running in the forest

213
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,840
There was a pack of hungry wolves chasing him behind him

214
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,160
in front of this young man

215
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,880
An ancient well appeared at that time

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,520
When this young man ran to the front of the ancient well

217
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,720
Take a look

218
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,360
I actually found a group of venomous snakes at the bottom of the well

219
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,400
There is a thick branch in the center of the well

220
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
This young man was desperate

221
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,400
Jumped down the ancient well and hugged the branches

222
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,200
But when he jumped

223
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,520
He actually found a mouse at the end of the branch

224
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,200
Constantly biting branches

225
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,600
There is a honeycomb at the top of the branch

226
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,800
Honey keeps dripping on the tips of the branches

227
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,840
And the tip of the branch

228
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,760
There are also a group of ants looking for that little bit of honey

229
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,520
This young man was desperate

230
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:15,080
Climb to the tip of the branch and lick that drop of honey

231
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,800
This story actually has two morals

232
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,280
One implication is

233
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,600
A person can ignore the dangers around him

234
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,720
Only looking after immediate interests

235
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,960
And another meaning

236
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,480
Just the opposite of the first meaning

237
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,080
This story is actually a metaphor for the Six Kingdoms

238
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,640
If everyone ignores the danger before them

239
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,760
If you only care about immediate interests, the Six Kingdoms will perish.

240
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,160
Thank you Mr. Dong

241
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,600
Tell a story with such a moral

242
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,920
Why don't you let Qin Qing play a song?

243
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,280
Then we started discussing politics

244
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,200
good…

245
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,840
Are the tiles stable? They are just laid on

246
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,320
rest assured

247
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,920
Zhao Mu has already turned out the light and gone to bed

248
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,240
He goes to bed so early every night

249
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,240
Usually there are four more people following him

250
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,960
It's not easy to kidnap him

251
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,200
So what should we do?

252
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,600
Yes, what should I do?

253
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,000
Just wait

254
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,840
Yes, the opportunity will definitely come

255
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,400
I want to go pee please

256
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,320
Do you want to buy something for you to drink?

257
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,920
I'm not thirsty

258
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,040
Miss Qin

259
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,280
Mr. Dong

260
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,120
Not in bed yet?

261
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,040
Mr. Dong too

262
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,360
Maybe at the conference just now, I heard Miss Qin say

263
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,520
You said the night is intoxicating because of the stars in the sky

264
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,240
That’s why Dong stayed up so late

265
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,480
Come out and watch the stars

266
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,200
It's a pity that there are no stars tonight

267
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,240
Did Miss Qin come out to watch the stars?

268
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,960
Miss Qin, are you worried?

269
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,800
Qin Qing is not worried, just thinking about old things

270
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Remember old things?

271
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,520
What past events keep Miss Qin awake at night?

272
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,960
Miss Qin, do you miss your sweetheart?

273
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,280
Sweetheart?

274
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:41,400
In fact, Dong is also thinking about someone

275
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,560
That feeling is really strange

276
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,240
as if close at hand

277
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,720
There is such a huge difference in time between being so close to each other and so far away

278
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,840
The difference between time and space is so big

279
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,600
That feeling is really strange

280
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,320
Close at hand, but far away

281
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,680
Just like the stars in the sky are out of reach

282
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,840
Can only be viewed from a distance, but cannot be touched

283
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,200
That's not necessarily the case, Miss Qin

284
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,320
Star

285
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,400
The stars in the sky are already here

286
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,000
Why are the stars in the sky put in bags?

287
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,880
Don't blink

288
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,000
firefly

289
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,560
It's a star in the sky

290
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,160
Don't move

291
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,120
He Jie every time I see him

292
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,240
I have a feeling of déjà vu

293
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,000
Why are you looking at me?

294
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,600
It turns out that fireflies are stars that can be caught

295
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,120
If you don't catch them, they will fly away

296
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,720
Good morning, Miss Qin

297
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,800
Mr. Dong

298
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,200
Miss Qin, do you want to go out early in the morning?

299
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,080
My godfather and I were invited to the palace together

300
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,680
Lecture to princes and young masters

301
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,800
There will be lectures in the morning and political discussions among talented people in the afternoon

302
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
Thank you for your hard work, Miss Qin.

303
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,240
After working hard for days, I am indeed tired.

304
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,800
Fortunately, I got the gift Mr. Dong gave Qin Qing last night.

305
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,240
Let Qinqing hold her to sleep

306
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,280
Had a good night's dream

307
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,280
In fact, it’s the same below

308
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,360
What exactly is it?

309
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,480
It can be hugged to sleep and give it a good dream

310
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,800
godfather

311
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,640
Hello Mr. Zou

312
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,640
Hello, the so-called sleepless nights are the most tormenting

313
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,440
Mr. Dong, what did you give Qin Qing?

314
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,320
Let her hug her to sleep and give her a good dream

315
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,080
I hope Mr. Zou won’t laugh.

316
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,480
I just gave some stars to Miss Qin

317
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,160
Fall asleep with stars in your arms?

318
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,600
Godfather, we are just watching the stars at night

319
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,040
Stargazing at night is what my godfather is good at

320
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,280
Godfather, it’s getting late. Let’s go into the palace.

321
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,800
Don’t be late to meet the king

322
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,720
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

323
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,720
good…

324
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,200
Miss Qin

325
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,360
Good morning, Mr. Hou…

326
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,000
Mr. Zou and Mr. Dong are also here

327
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,920
Hello

328
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,960
Mr. Zou, the carriage is ready and is just outside.

329
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,880
Mr. Hou is really polite.

330
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,720
We've even got the carriage ready for the road. That's so polite.

331
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,120
Mr. Zou and Miss Qin are our honored guests.

332
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,200
Of course we can't wait too long

333
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,240
Mr. Zou, please...

334
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,440
Miss Qin

335
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,000
The weather in Handan City is cooler in the morning and evening

336
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,280
Your clothes are thin. It will be warmer if you add a coat.

337
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,760
The Marquis was polite, but Qin Qing didn't feel cold.

338
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,640
On the contrary, the cool weather is more comfortable

339
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,120
The wind is blowing at night, when I watch the stars tonight

340
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,800
I am worried that Miss Qin will catch a cold

341
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,120
Stargazing tonight?

342
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,120
Last night Miss Qin talked about the intoxicating starry night

343
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,520
I hope and Miss Qin

344
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,640
Enjoy the intoxicating starry night together

345
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,680
The reason why the starry night is intoxicating

346
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,080
It’s about enjoying it together with a close person you can talk to.

347
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,360
The Marquis should meet up with his close friends to enjoy the stars together

348
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,200
I'm afraid Qin Qing will ruin the Marquis's elegance

349
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,520
Godfather, let’s go

350
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,960
Qin Qing, this woman is really different from others

351
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,360
There has never been a woman

352
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,880
Will refuse the kindness shown to her by this Marquis

353
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,080
She is the only one who is so cold to me

354
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,800
Miss Qin is a world-famous talented woman

355
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,240
rather than a singer

356
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,440
How does Miss Qin know how to please people?

357
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,160
But the colder she is, the more interested I am in her

358
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,280
Mr. Dong, as you see it

359
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,120
How can I win the favor of a beautiful woman?

360
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,760
I really can’t believe that the Marquis has all kinds of talents and strategies.

361
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,080
He is so helpless for a woman

362
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,240
When I see Mr. Dong and Miss Qin, I think they are in agreement.

363
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,960
Could it be that Miss Qin is also interested in the art of raising horses?

364
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,120
Maybe Miss Qin sees me as a horse breeder

365
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,880
So I can talk to you about everything from north to south

366
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,960
But Mr. Hou is just the opposite.

367
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,720
Lord Marquis, you have a high position of authority

368
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,160
Women have always liked to rely on powerful people

369
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,040
But it's a pity that Miss Qin is not an ordinary woman

370
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Mr. Hou, why are you in the study today?

371
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,880
There will be so many banana leaves

372
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,080
You are from Chu State, tomorrow is the fifteenth day

373
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,080
Have you forgotten

374
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,400
Yes, I almost forgot

375
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,200
Tomorrow is the fifteenth day

376
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,720
I think the Marquis must be extremely busy.

377
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,200
Of course, I will be busy for at least half the day tomorrow

378
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,920
Will you be busy for most of the day?

379
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,360
Of course

380
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,520
Since it cannot be held openly in the Hou Mansion,

381
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,000
Of course you have to hide it from others

382
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,920
We still have to travel a long distance, taking a line of sky

383
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,280
And then act in a secret place

384
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,880
However, the Marquis's entry and exit must be proportional to each other.

385
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
some homes will follow

386
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,480
How can we cover up people's eyes and ears?

387
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,320
I will only bring a few famous experts with me tomorrow

388
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,480
should be no problem

389
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,520
Mr. Hou acted cautiously, so there should be no problem

390
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,600
Closer to home

391
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,160
I would like to recommend Qin Qing to the palace as Taifu

392
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,680
In this way

393
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,600
I can keep her in Zhao country

394
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,480
Don’t worry about not having the chance to meet each other in the future

395
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,640
That's not necessary

396
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,920
Or wait for Dong to try to date her on behalf of the Marquis

397
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,400
Then please

398
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,720
Below the line of sky is a narrow mountain road

399
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,480
We take advantage of the natural environment there

400
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,560
Weave a large stone net to catch the stones

401
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,960
Then lie in wait in a hidden place

402
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,400
As long as the convoy passes by, it will fall into a big pit

403
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,480
We can cut off the rope net and push out the boulder

404
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,280
When the time comes, they will be unable to move

405
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,600
You can capture him alive

406
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,280
Mr. Dong

407
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,040
Miss Qin

408
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,840
Today, talented people are discussing politics. Why didn’t Mr. Dong come?

409
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,000
Because a group of horses just arrived

410
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,120
So I have to go out and sort it out.

411
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,840
My lord, I will take my leave first and excuse myself.

412
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,320
I wonder how today’s political discussion conference went?

413
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,560
Scholars discussing politics are all clichés

414
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,640
It must be very boring if Mr. Dong is here

415
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,880
To be honest, don’t look at me with a smug look on your face

416
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,320
In fact, I am also a scholar.

417
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,120
The Talents Discussion Conference has ended today

418
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,240
Tomorrow Qinqing will go to the lake to paint with her godfather

419
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
It's better to take advantage of it before leaving Zhaojing

420
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,440
Paint the scenery of Handan and leave a memory

421
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,200
Miss Qin is leaving

422
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,520
That's right, the song ends and everyone disperses

423
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,920
Everyone has to leave Zhaojing all the time

424
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,720
Mr. Dong, if you are not bored and have some free time,

425
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,400
You can come with us to swim around the lake and have a painting discussion.

426
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,920
It's a pity that Master Zou is unwell

427
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,760
otherwise

428
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,000
You can enjoy such beautiful scenery with us

429
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,240
Miss Qin, where do you like to paint?

430
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,680
Just ahead, okay

431
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,520
Miss Qin’s painting skills are really amazing

432
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,400
Mr. Dong won the award

433
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,600
Miss Qin

434
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,800
Do you think ink painting itself is relatively monotonous?

435
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,680
If you can add a little color

436
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,280
Will it make this ink painting more colorful?

437
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,000
Color? How to add it?

438
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,600
This painting really becomes more colorful after adding color

439
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,320
Mr. Dong is knowledgeable and talented, and Qin Qing has benefited a lot from him.

440
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,720
Dong is just a horse breeder

441
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,240
Usually except facing the horse

442
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,960
Just facing the flowers and plants

443
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,400
Nothing to do

444
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,720
I just suddenly thought of this method

445
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,000
Qin Qing also likes to be with flowers and plants

446
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,720
Flowers and plants are also sentient things

447
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,240
Face each other day and night, endless joy

448
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,560
It's getting late, Dong needs to say goodbye

449
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,920
Mr. Dong, do you want to leave first?

450
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,680
Dong originally wanted to continue painting with Miss Qin

451
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,240
But Dong really has something important going on.

452
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,640
That can only be left for next time

453
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,520
Okay, Dong Mou takes his leave.

454
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,320
Mr. Dong, I'll go with you

455
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,560
good

456
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,000
Where are the bamboo rafts? They must have floated away. What should I do?

457
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,040
It doesn't matter

458
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,360
Let's walk back around the valley behind, come on

459
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,360
Miss Qin, are you okay?

460
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,160
my feet

461
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,080
Lord Marquis, there is a big rock blocking the road.

462
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,920
it hurts

463
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,000
Miss Qin, your foot is sprained and you should not walk.

464
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,120
let me hold you

465
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,760
Mr. Hou, you can go now

466
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,040
Get on the bus

467
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,120
Now back to the shore

468
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,080
Mr. Dong has important things to do. You should go back first.

469
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,680
Now it makes no difference whether to go or not

470
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,760
Brother, where have you been?

471
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,400
Zhao Mu’s motorcade is returning

472
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,760
Master Teng thought twice and acted rashly before Master Xiang arrived.

473
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,440
You may lose in a confrontation

474
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,080
Be careful, Miss Qin, take your time

475
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,360
Qinqing godfather

476
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,840
Why do your feet hurt?

477
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,080
It’s all bad

478
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,640
That’s why Miss Qin injured her foot

479
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,120
It's all Qin Qing's fault that has caused Mr. Dong to suffer

480
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,120
No, it’s not good to be here

481
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,080
Okay...stop arguing, you two.

482
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,600
How does your foot hurt?

483
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:30,040
It's not serious, but it hurts a little when walking

484
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,320
You were limping like this just now

485
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,240
Turn back from the sandbank

486
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,760
It was Mr. Dong who carried me

487
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,960
Sorry, you two, I'll take my leave first.

488
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,120
sorry

489
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,880
I thought big brother had something important to do

490
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,960
It turned out to be to accompany Miss Qinqing

491
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,080
Princess Zhao Qian is still waiting for you in Xianyang

492
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,160
You came to Zhao State with a heavy responsibility

493
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,400
I know

494
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,760
But you won’t listen to anything I say now

495
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,400
I have always respected my elder brother as a person

496
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,240
But this time…

497
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,160
Now I can only wait for the next opportunity before taking action.

498
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,920
A great opportunity was missed in vain

499
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,120
Will opportunities come to you in vain?

500
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,800
Who? What kind of person?

501
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,800
Mr. Dong, Mr. Hou invites you

502
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,480
It is not in vain that I have traveled a long distance to worship the mountain ghost.

503
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,720
The mountain ghost really has a spirit, there is good news soon

504
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,120
Good news?

505
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,440
That's right

506
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,040
King Zhao has chosen to test the horse on the outskirts of the city in two days.

507
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,600
Then we will act accordingly

508
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,720
Assassinate the foolish king of Zhao

509
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,920
Mr. Dong

510
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,160
You immediately contact the Chu army stationed outside Zhao

511
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,480
Cooperate with actions

512
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,800
Soon the army will press on the territory and we will become the hegemon of Chu.

513
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,520
so fast

514
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,320
Mr. Dong, has the plan changed?

515
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,840
No, I just think

516
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,200
Everything went so smoothly, so happy

517
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,720
That's right, everything went so smoothly and I'm so happy

518
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,720
I can already imagine what it will be like then

519
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,480
Mr. Dong, you will do it yourself

520
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,920
I pretended that my escort was ineffective or that I was slightly injured.

521
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,320
The day of trial is the day of regicide

522
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,200
good

523
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,320
It's really a dead end this time

524
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,560
There are two days left...what to do?

525
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,080
If Zhao Mu cannot be caught by then,

526
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,280
We're doomed

527
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,840
Don't stay there, think of a way

528
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,840
If I think of a way, I will tell you next time

529
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,880
Mr. Dong

530
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Who is it? Come in

531
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,720
Mr. Dong, my lady asked the slave to bring me bamboo slips.

532
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,360
Thanks

533
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,680
Sorry, could you help me see what it says?

534
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,280
The beautiful scenery of the sandbank, I would like to enjoy it with you

535
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,680
Don't fail to promise tomorrow, Qin Qing

536
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,680
I go to the toilet

537
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,320
I have a way

538
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,080
Miss Qin actually took the initiative to invite me to travel to the sandbank with her.

539
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,280
The bamboo slips are already in the hands of the Marquis, will they still be fake?

540
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,720
It is indeed Miss Qin’s handwriting

541
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,520
Not only the handwriting of Miss Qin, but also the

542
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,640
It also includes Miss Qin’s affection for Mr. Hou.

543
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,240
But Miss Qin has always been as cold as ice to me

544
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,320
Why would you take the initiative to invite me?

545
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,600
You don’t even understand what’s going on in your daughter’s family

546
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,840
Miss Qin is a talented woman

547
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,480
Talented women should be reserved

548
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,480
Miss Qin and Mr. Hou first met

549
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,160
How can I date you alone?

550
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,840
I think Miss Qin must have thought twice before going back.

551
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,520
Only then did I realize that Mr. Hou is someone I can trust for life.

552
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,560
Mr. Hou, you don’t understand

553
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,760
And tomorrow Miss Qin will be painting and waiting on the sandbank

554
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,240
Mr. Hou, don’t miss this opportunity.

555
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,400
You guys stay out of the way until sunset

556
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,360
Don't come back to disturb my elegance.

557
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,560
yes…

558
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,840
Are you here?

559
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,720
Yes, Miss Qin

560
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,640
Mr. Hou, how could it be you?

561
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,280
Miss Qin, it was you who asked me out

562
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,760
I didn't date you

563
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,920
Go quickly

564
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,120
If you don't leave, you'll be dead.

565
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,600
Xiang Shaolong, it’s you

566
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,400
follow me

567
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,080
Xiang Shaolong, what happened?

568
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,160
Mr. Zou, I didn’t mean to lie to you.

569
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,840
But I really can't help it

570
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,680
That’s why we arrested Zhao Mu like this

571
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,360
You don't want to, you are so despicable

572
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,920
He actually used Qin Qing's name to lure Zhao Mu Zhong into hiding.

573
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,440
I really don't have time to explain to you now

574
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,840
I don’t even want you to be implicated

575
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,440
Anyway, you are also from Qin.

576
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,880
Just go back to Xianyang with me to avoid it.

577
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,720
No need

578
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,200
I wish I had never met Xiang Shaolong

579
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,600
Mr. Zou, the situation is critical now.

580
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,680
I don't have time to explain to you

581
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,480
You'd better leave Zhao country as soon as possible to avoid it.

582
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,560
It's best to go west so we can take care of it more easily

583
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,840
Okay, I understand
