1
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,920
This is the word "ding"

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,560
There are so many strokes that it’s hard to remember

3
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,120
But if you can remember

4
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,320
I will reward you next time

5
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,200
OK…

6
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,720
Sister Shanrou and Uncle Mute

7
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,560
Sister Shanrou, dumb uncle...

8
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,160
Hey, we have fresh food tonight

9
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,160
Awesome…

10
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,440
We often have fresh food to eat

11
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,640
Thanks to you, dumb uncle

12
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,200
The mute uncle said that the vegetables he planted this time were eaten by insects.

13
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,640
Not as good as those planted last time

14
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,120
It doesn't matter

15
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,680
Next time we will take all the children to get rid of bugs together

16
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,160
I believe the next harvest will be better than this one

17
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,120
Everyone, hurry up and help the mute uncle get the food in.

18
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,440
good…

19
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,240
Kind and gentle, really on time

20
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,680
Fast, ruthless and accurate have always been the rules of an assassin.

21
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,680
Well said, I just need your speed and accuracy

22
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,480
This transaction is definitely not simple.

23
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,920
The person you killed was not only a skilled swordsman

24
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,120
And also very witty

25
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,360
The tougher the opponent, the more interested I am

26
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,280
Because the remuneration will be higher

27
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,160
Because this matter is of great importance

28
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,520
For the sake of caution

29
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,760
I decided to send

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,160
Five major assassins in the organization act together

31
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,920
You are responsible for contacting

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,120
We want the five of us to join forces

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,280
This must be a big deal

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,520
Anyway, after you complete the task this time

35
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,720
The remuneration you receive will be enough for you to enjoy for the rest of your life

36
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,200
Here is the deposit

37
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,400
Really generous

38
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,920
I don’t know who we are going to kill this time.

39
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,920
It’s King Yingzheng of Qin

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,640
Why do you need so much effort to kill Ying Zheng?

41
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,760
Of course, there is no need to mobilize troops to kill a Ying Zheng.

42
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,160
But he has to kill Xiang Shaolong beside him

43
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,800
The situation is different

44
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,040
I made an agreement with the mute uncle

45
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,680
I'll go out to the market with him in two days to buy more vegetables.

46
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,400
We plan to cultivate more vegetable fields

47
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,640
Then sell the extra vegetables to others

48
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,320
The orphan village has more income

49
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,440
Then you don't have to kill anyone anymore

50
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,560
good and gentle

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,480
Did you hear what I said?

52
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,440
I heard, you said to cultivate more vegetable fields

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,360
Then take out the vegetables and sell them

54
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,960
These are all secondary

55
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,960
I don't want you to kill anyone again

56
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,720
Although all the people you killed were bad people

57
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,160
But killing is never a good thing

58
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,600
I used to think so too, but now...

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,240
By the way, Tingfang, I have to leave for a while

60
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,160
Are you going to do business again?

61
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,840
You'd better stop asking me so many questions

62
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,680
Actually, I haven’t thought it through yet

63
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,200
Let me think it over clearly.

64
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,480
I have no appetite, you can eat it yourself

65
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,880
How did you do it?

66
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,840
Don't worry about it, I'll give you the rainbow anyway

67
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,160
You must take me to Xianyang

68
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,040
I'll give it to you, why don't you take me to Xianyang?

69
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,840
Shanrou, why don't you get up and help cook breakfast?

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,240
Dumb uncle, what happened to the food?

71
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,720
Why are all the vegetables eaten by insects?

72
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,360
I also understand that you grew these vegetables yourself

73
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Now I want you to throw it away with your own hands

74
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,400
It's really heartbreaking

75
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,440
Why am I not?

76
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,640
a few more days

77
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,240
I'm going to kill someone I like with my own hands

78
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,200
But you must not tell Tingfang

79
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,160
Because the one I want to kill is Xiang Shaolong

80
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,000
Of course I don't want to do that either

81
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,440
But dumb uncle, I have no choice

82
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
If I don’t kill Xiang Shaolong

83
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,480
It's tantamount to betraying the organization

84
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,800
I will be the one who is going to die then

85
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,760
It seems that I have no choice

86
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,760
After Sister Shanrou left,

87
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,320
You have to listen to Sister Tingfang and Uncle Mute

88
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,560
Do you know?

89
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,560
Sister Shanrou, don’t leave…

90
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,640
Yes, Shanrou, since everyone can’t let you go

91
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,880
Just don't leave

92
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,840
Tingfang, if possible, I don’t want to go either.

93
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,680
But there are actually many things

94
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,960
I can't help myself either

95
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,600
Do you have any difficulties

96
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,760
You might as well say it

97
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,480
maybe i can help you

98
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,080
Yes, Sister Shanrou

99
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,480
We will definitely help you, don't leave

100
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,680
Yeah, don’t go…

101
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,040
You are good

102
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,280
Tingfang, thank you very much for your concern.

103
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,000
But this time I must resolve it myself.

104
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,840
no one can help me

105
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,480
Take care

106
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,040
Fortunately, I have lived up to my fate.

107
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,280
The renovation of the tombs of the late kings has been completed as scheduled

108
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,440
The priest has also chosen the day by divination

109
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,800
Scheduled for Wuwu day of this month

110
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,600
An auspicious day for sealing the mausoleum

111
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,560
Just waiting for the king’s permission

112
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,800
Okay, let’s do everything according to Li Taishi’s arrangements.

113
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,400
Sorry, I want to ask what Wuwu Day is?

114
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,560
When exactly is it?

115
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,120
Taifu Xiang, Wuwu Day is the ninth day of this month

116
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
Exactly ten days later

117
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,680
Your Majesty, Prime Minister Lu is ill due to physical illness.

118
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,520
Need to go back to my hometown to rest for half a month

119
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,520
I’m afraid I won’t be able to attend by then

120
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,360
What? Lu Buwei got sick for no reason?

121
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,520
good

122
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,920
If he wants to recuperate, just let him recuperate as much as he can.

123
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,600
I don’t want to see him anyway

124
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,520
By the way, Taifu Xiang

125
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,280
Didn’t you say that Mrs. Qin was out on business?

126
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,240
Why haven't I seen him even after so many days?

127
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,680
I don't know either

128
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,200
The worst thing is

129
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,120
I don't even know where she went

130
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,400
So strange?

131
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,320
Xiang Taifu

132
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,160
Xiang Taifu

133
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,040
Lieutenant Lao Yan invited Taifu Xiang to come to Youshi

134
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,040
Go to the west gate tower to meet and discuss important matters together.

135
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,000
Taifu Xiang is indeed punctual

136
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,400
What's up?

137
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,600
Does Mr. Xiang know?

138
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,120
Cheng Xi met someone secretly a few days ago

139
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,640
If you have anything to say, just say it quickly

140
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
Please stop beating around the bush

141
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,280
Taifu Xiang is indeed a quick talker.

142
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,000
The person Cheng Xi met a few days ago was Lu Buwei

143
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,600
The content of the conversation between the two of them

144
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,440
I don't know

145
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,520
But after Cheng Yu met Lu Buwei,

146
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,480
I have been meeting with those old subordinates for the past few days.

147
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,560
Moreover, they urgently summoned a group of cronies and dead men back to Xianyang.

148
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,520
There seems to be some action

149
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,200
You mean... they want to rebel?

150
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,880
You are indeed smart. No wonder the king relies on you so much.

151
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,160
Lu Buwei already knows

152
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,840
The king is not his biological son

153
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,960
How did he know? What did you say?

154
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,480
Don't get me wrong, this matter has absolutely nothing to do with me

155
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,680
It was the Queen Mother who spoke out about this in excitement the other day.

156
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
In fact, you can rest assured

157
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,800
I wouldn't be so stupid as to let this out.

158
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,360
Because the king fell

159
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,640
The Queen Mother will no longer be the Queen Mother

160
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,040
To me, this will only do a lot of harm and no good

161
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,080
So my position can be said to be consistent with yours

162
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,680
No wonder Lu Buwei suddenly took leave to go back to his hometown to rest

163
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,840
It turned out that I wanted to be the mastermind behind the scenes.

164
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,120
Come out as a dragon and rebel secretly

165
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,040
The mastermind?

166
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,200
Taifu Xiang's adjectives are indeed lively and interesting

167
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,280
Without further ado, do you know when he will take action?

168
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,720
I really don't know this

169
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,400
You are the popular person next to the king

170
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,760
You should know everything about him

171
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,800
Shopkeeper is

172
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,480
Could you please prepare a guest room for me?

173
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,640
Yes, sir

174
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,640
besides

175
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,880
Please help me send this letter to Xianyang City

176
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,240
It's hard to find someone to take a letter into town at this late hour

177
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,600
These are the fees for sending letters

178
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,640
I wonder where this letter from your guest is going to be sent?

179
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,400
The address has been written clearly above

180
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,640
As long as you arrive at your destination before the third update

181
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,120
Someone will naturally accept it from you

182
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Okay, absolutely no problem, A Niu

183
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,240
Come

184
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,120
Immediately send this letter to Xianyang City

185
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,000
Listen carefully

186
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,480
You have to deliver this confidential letter to the other party personally.

187
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,080
If there are any mistakes

188
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,960
Watch out if your head falls to the ground

189
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,440
The villain knows...

190
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,160
Brother Xiang, be careful...

191
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,560
Not Brother Xiang?

192
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,040
Shanrou, why did you sneak attack on me?

193
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,240
I won't let you kill Xiang Shaolong

194
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,760
Today, either you die or I die

195
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,800
Shanrou, let me help you

196
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,720
Shanrou, how are you? You lost a lot of blood

197
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,520
It's okay, we need to hit the road right away

198
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,760
Shanrou...how are you? Shanrou

199
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,720
Shanrou...how are you?

200
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,200
You finally woke up, are you okay?

201
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,480
It's okay, but the wound still hurts a little bit

202
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,080
It's all my fault

203
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,320
I actually suspected that you wanted to kill Xiang Da...Xiang Shaolong

204
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,120
Almost ruined your big event

205
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,720
I also caused you to be injured, I...

206
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,520
Stop talking, how long have I been unconscious?

207
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,320
I've been in a coma for almost a day and a night.

208
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,280
One day and one night?

209
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,320
I was afraid you wouldn't wake up

210
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,720
Why don't you wake me up?

211
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,800
No, we have to rush

212
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,920
What happened? Shanrou...

213
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,560
if we can't make it

214
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,680
Xiang Shaolong will be in danger

215
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,120
Let's go

216
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,080
Welcome the king…

217
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,240
Li Taishi, Zhao Gao

218
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,800
You two go in with me

219
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,600
Everyone else will wait outside the mausoleum

220
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,640
as commanded…

221
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,280
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

222
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,640
The foundation of Da Qin will last forever

223
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,320
Ying Zheng, you don’t need to worship me anymore.

224
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,200
Anyway, today is also your death day

225
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,440
You'd better stay in hell

226
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,160
Please pay your respects when you see the late king.

227
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,040
Bold as a dragon

228
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,720
How dare you unite with the rebels to assassinate me?

229
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,360
Ying Zheng, why are you boasting about being a loner?

230
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,840
What are your virtues and abilities?

231
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,400
Can he ascend to the position of great king?

232
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,360
Today I want you to be buried in a mausoleum

233
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,720
Sleep here with the late king

234
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,520
Cheng Xi

235
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,760
How dare you do the following?

236
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,640
If you don't surrender, there is only one way to die.

237
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,520
Cheng Xi

238
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,640
Who would have thought that when the mantis stalks the cicada, the oriole follows behind?

239
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,280
Lao Ai, in addition to the traitor becoming a dragon

240
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,000
kill them all

241
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,760
King kill

242
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,520
This time, fortunately, Taifu Xiang and Lieutenant Lao Ting

243
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,400
Learned about the rebel plot

244
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,000
Deploy early

245
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,360
Otherwise, I'm afraid I might have been poisoned by a dragon.

246
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,200
Cheng Xi, I ask myself whether I treat you well or not.

247
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,400
Now you actually assassinate me in an attempt to seize the throne

248
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,640
You are overestimating your abilities.

249
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,920
The winner is the king and the loser is the bandit, behead him or kill him

250
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,320
I have nothing to say

251
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,840
You alone

252
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,760
I'm sorry, you don't have the guts either.

253
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,920
There must be another mastermind behind it

254
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,120
I want you to appear in front of all the civil and military officials of the dynasty

255
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,760
reveal the person's identity

256
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,400
Lao Ai, detain him first and wait for him to be punished.

257
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,480
Yes, Your Majesty

258
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,560
Protect the king

259
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,960
Be careful, king

260
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,920
Escort the king to go first

261
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,840
King

262
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,080
Girl, are you okay?

263
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,520
I'm fine

264
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,240
Go over the mountain ahead

265
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,560
It is the border town area of ​​Xianyang City

266
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,360
Girl, you'd better take a break

267
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,680
No need, I want to rush back to Xianyang as soon as possible

268
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,040
Let's continue on our way

269
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,800
They are not adult people

270
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,680
stop

271
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Shanrou, why did you come so late?

272
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,880
What about being good at attacking?

273
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,640
Didn't he meet up with you?

274
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,440
Unexpectedly, Shanggong would betray the organization

275
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,280
He attacked me from behind and I already killed him

276
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,440
Did you kill him?

277
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,720
If I don't kill him

278
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
I'm afraid I can't come here either

279
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,640
But I'm still a step late

280
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,960
Let Ying Zheng run away

281
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,920
It doesn’t matter if you can’t kill Ying Zheng

282
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,800
Let's take Xiang Shaolong's head back to take his life.

283
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,800
It's the same

284
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,160
This person cannot be killed

285
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,640
What do you mean?

286
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,040
Do you want to compete with me for credit?

287
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,200
That's not what I meant

288
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,680
I just want to take Xiang Shaolong’s head back with me.

289
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
At most, you can only get half of the bounty

290
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,160
Don't forget, our goal this time is to kill Ying Zheng

291
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,640
So what can you do to kill Ying Zheng?

292
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,880
Of course there is

293
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,040
We must save Xiang Shaolong’s life

294
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,800
Then use him as bait to lure Ying Zheng out of the palace

295
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,240
You don't have to act in front of me anymore

296
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,480
In fact, you have known Xiang Shaolong for a long time

297
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,760
And you are someone who cares about him very much.

298
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,560
You have always been a cold-blooded killer

299
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,120
Why are you suddenly so concerned about someone you want to kill?

300
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,720
Shancha, you really got the name right.

301
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,200
Really good eyesight

302
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,720
It seems you are the one who betrayed the organization

303
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,160
Or just end it on your own

304
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,120
Otherwise, come back with me and tell the main bus

305
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,360
I'm not going to either

306
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
you…

307
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,960
Shanrou, how are you?

308
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,120
I'm fine. Let's take a look at Xiang Shaolong first.

309
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,560
Brother Xiang

310
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,360
Xiang Shaolong

311
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,640
Brother Xiang

312
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,000
Brother Xiang, please wake up

313
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,520
You can't die, Brother Xiang

314
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Please wake up, I beg you, please wake up

315
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,120
Tingfang, calm down

316
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,040
He bled so much and was hurt so badly

317
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,320
No matter how you shake him, he won't wake up

318
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,040
It was me who hurt him

319
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,520
If I hadn't been reckless and ruined your big event

320
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,960
Brother Xiang won't be hurt at all

321
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,280
What if something happens to Brother Xiang?

322
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,760
Even if I die ten thousand times

323
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,320
I can't forgive myself either

324
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,640
Even if you die ten thousand times, he will never wake up

325
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,800
What should I do? I can't let Brother Xiang die.

326
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,520
The reason why I survive to this day

327
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,440
I just hope I can see him again

328
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,720
If something happens to him

329
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,600
What's the point of my survival?

330
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,280
If you want to save him now

331
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,720
There is only one way

332
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,000
The king

333
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,240
I have ordered people to search the area around the tomb of the late king.

334
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,960
However, no trace of Taifu Xiang was ever found.

335
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:35,000
What does this mean? Is Taifu Xiang alive or dead?

336
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,640
King, please rest assured

337
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,120
Judging from the death conditions of the three assassins in the mausoleum,

338
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,200
They all should have died under the sword of Taifu Xiang

339
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,800
In other words, Taifu Xiang should have been out of danger long ago

340
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,320
But for some reason, he still hasn’t returned to the palace to answer his orders.

341
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,240
Damn it, if Mrs. Xiang was already out of danger

342
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,720
You must first tell me your fate

343
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:59,680
Now that I haven't come back, something must have happened.

344
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,040
The king is concerned about Taifu Xiang's safety

345
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,520
A humble job is understandable

346
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,440
But things have their own priorities

347
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,400
Except for the life and death of Taifu Xiang

348
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,080
and many other important things

349
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,240
We have to wait for the king to solve it

350
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,720
Report to your Majesty, Li Taishi is seeking an audience outside.

351
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,080
Quick pass

352
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,320
obey

353
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,600
Li Si was ordered by the king to

354
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,600
Take people to Chengyu Mansion to search the house

355
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,960
Unexpectedly, Cheng Long had already secretly moved his family members away.

356
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,720
Only ordinary servants are left to hide from others.

357
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,400
Is there such a thing?

358
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,840
Your Majesty, Cheng Xi’s family members

359
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,840
A humble person will order people to step up the pursuit

360
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,320
But the top priority, I think

361
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,240
Should find out as soon as possible

362
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
The mastermind behind this planned rebellion

363
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,480
It would be best to have Cheng Yu publicly tried in front of the ministers.

364
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,600
Order him to hand over the identity of the mastermind behind this incident

365
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,040
The public trial will be settled tomorrow

366
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,480
The most important thing now is to send more manpower

367
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,360
Looking for the whereabouts of Taifu Xiang

368
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,480
King

369
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,560
Searching for the whereabouts of Taifu Xiang and the public trial of Cheng Xi

370
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,080
can be carried out simultaneously

371
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,440
Damn it, I'm the king now

372
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,440
Or are you the king?

373
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,120
I order you to find the whereabouts of Taifu Xiang

374
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,840
You'd better bring Taifu Xiang back safely

375
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,560
Otherwise, I will not only take back your death-free gold medal,

376
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,360
I want you to die with your head on the ground

377
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,080
I really don’t understand the humble position

378
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,520
Could it be that the life and death of Taifu Xiang

379
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,360
Compared with arresting gangsters

380
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,040
Is it more important to consolidate the king's power?

381
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Taifu Xiang is one of the most important officials in the current dynasty.

382
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,360
The most trustworthy person

383
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,400
The life and death of Taifu Xiang is related to my country.

384
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,680
I absolutely don’t want anything to happen to Mr. Xiang

385
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,600
Lao Ai, why don't you take the people to look for her yourself right away?

386
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,880
humble duty and obey orders

387
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,080
Now even the king sent people to look for him and couldn't find him

388
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,800
Unless he was captured

389
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,880
Otherwise, at least I would see...

390
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,600
At least I met someone

391
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,320
Second Master, Third Master, Xiang Master, he...

392
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,720
Big brother…

393
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
Big brother

394
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,280
Big brother…

395
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,360
Young Dragon's pulse is very weak

396
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,680
He must have been seriously injured and lost too much blood.

397
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,000
So unconscious

398
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,520
Who sent him back?

399
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,800
Even villains don’t know

400
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,440
I just heard someone knocking on the door outside

401
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,280
So I went out and took a look

402
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,160
I saw Mr. Xiang lying on a stretcher.

403
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,320
Don't say any more, carry him in quickly and rescue him immediately

404
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,160
Mr. Zou, my eldest brother’s injury…

405
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,000
Second brother, the king knows that the eldest brother is seriously injured

406
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,240
Special order for Li Taishi

407
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,960
I brought some imperial doctors to treat my elder brother.

408
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,040
Thank you for your help.

409
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,360
No need to be polite

410
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,720
Why don't you hurry up and help save people?

411
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,680
yes

412
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,680
Mr. Zou...

413
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
You have been divination for so long

414
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,160
How is my elder brother doing now?

415
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,960
I just used the stargazing method to divine the Kun hexagram.

416
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,200
There is a line above this hexagram:

417
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,560
Fighting a dragon in the wild, its blood is black and yellow

418
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,840
It is a disaster of blood and light. This is a sign of great danger.

419
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,480
How is big brother?

420
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,400
Unfortunately, there is no explicit statement in the hexagram

421
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,640
Does the hexagram mention that the elder brother can avoid this disaster?

422
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,960
The last part of the hexagram says:

423
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,520
Use Liuyongzhen to achieve a great end

424
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,080
In my opinion

425
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,920
In the end, Shaolong still needs his strong will

426
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,040
Only then can we escape the catastrophe of life and death.

427
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,360
No matter how much you say, you still can't help my brother.

428
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,080
Big brother is also true

429
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,600
Knowing that Cheng Yu would assassinate the king in the mausoleum

430
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,520
He also didn’t take us two brothers to escort him.

431
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,040
Mr. Zou, several imperial doctors

432
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,320
It's been a whole night

433
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
Why hasn’t Taifu Xiang woke up yet?

434
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
I and three imperial doctors

435
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,960
It can only be used to detoxify Shaolong.

436
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,600
To prevent the wound from worsening

437
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,320
But Shaolong really lost too much blood.

438
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,720
As a result, the heart and lungs are weakened, and the medicine may not be effective.

439
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,720
Taifu Xiang is like stepping into the gate of hell with one foot

440
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,640
As for whether I can survive today?

441
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,360
He can only rely on his own will

442
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,560
Mr. Zou, I beg you, please think of a way

443
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,440
We can't watch my brother die like this.

444
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,560
Is there really no other way?

445
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,480
Second Master, Third Master, Eunuch Zhao is here

446
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,600
The king is extremely worried about Taifu Xiang's safety

447
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,960
So Zhao Gao was specially ordered to bring this century-old ginseng here.

448
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,120
I hope it can help Taifu Xiang's injury

449
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,160
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your kindness.

450
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,120
It's a pity that Shaolong's life hangs by a thread now

451
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,800
Even though there are thousand-year-old Ganoderma lucidum and ten-thousand-year-old ginseng

452
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,600
I'm afraid it won't be possible to bring him back to life.

453
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,120
The king repeatedly warned Zhao Gao

454
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,120
We must rescue Mr. Xiang

455
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,600
The king also said, if anything happens to Taifu Xiang,

456
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,200
I'm afraid...

457
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,760
I'm afraid I don't even have to hope to return to the palace.

458
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,880
Several imperial doctors have already tried their best

459
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,680
Even if the king wants to kill us

460
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,080
Taifu Xiang still has no cure

461
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,360
Could it be that the eldest brother is really in trouble?

462
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,040
Second Master, Third Master, Mr. Qin is back

463
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,240
godfather

464
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,280
Qing'er went through a lot of hardships

465
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,040
Finally found that kind of courage

466
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,800
I also brought some bile back with me.

467
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,680
Brother Xiang can finally achieve his wish this time

468
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,440
Stop doing this

469
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,080
I know Brother Xiang is going back to the future world

470
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,160
You all hate him

471
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,480
But this is Brother Xiang’s long-cherished wish

472
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,280
This time he can achieve it

473
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,560
We should also be happy for him

474
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,640
Brother, can he survive today?

475
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,160
It’s still unknown

476
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,600
Godfather, what happened?

477
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,080
Is it Brother Xiang...

478
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,760
Yesterday, Cheng Xi tried to assassinate the king.

479
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,480
Shaolong stepped forward to rescue him, but was stabbed and seriously injured.

480
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:13,320
I'm still unconscious now, I'm just afraid...

481
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,080
Brother Xiang, it’s my fault

482
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,080
I shouldn't have left without saying a word

483
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,280
Not when you need me most

484
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,400
I'm not with you

485
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,120
Do you know I have a lot to say to you?

486
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,920
Why don't you wait for me? Brother Xiang

487
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,120
You know what? When you're in the mountains

488
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,440
I've thought it through clearly

489
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,840
I was stupid before, I shouldn't have escaped from reality

490
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,960
So I plan to tell you when I come back

491
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,960
Who knew you would just say nothing again...

492
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,960
Why don't you wait for me? Brother Xiang

493
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,320
Brother Xiang, as long as you wake up

494
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,400
we can be together

495
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,600
I don't care when you leave me

496
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,040
When will we return to the future world?

497
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,240
As long as we are together every day

498
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,000
I will definitely cherish it, Brother Xiang

499
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,720
farewell

500
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,600
please

501
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,160
Hail the King…Hail the Queen…

502
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,040
All ministers are exempt from gifts

503
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,880
Thank you King and Queen Mother

504
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,320
I believe that a few days ago

505
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,160
The assassination of a widower in the tomb of the late king

506
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,760
The ministers also heard a little bit about it

507
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,640
The ministers and others failed to understand the traitor's plot early

508
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,280
To frighten the king is really a crime worthy of death.

509
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,920
He who does not know is not guilty

510
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Thank you, Your Majesty...

511
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,520
But this time I was assassinated, and Lao Ai performed a great job in protecting him.

512
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,840
A few people decide on merit and reward

513
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,200
Grant Lao Ai the title of Marquis of Changxin

514
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,600
I wonder if the Queen Mother has any objections?

515
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,280
Lao Ai has made great achievements and should be rewarded heavily.

516
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,680
I have no objections

517
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,400
Thank you King and Queen Mother for your grace

518
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,120
I hope Changxinhou will work harder for the court in the future.

519
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,760
Helping the poor achieve a great cause together

520
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,520
The humble minister must devote himself to death and die.

521
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,080
OK, Li Taishi

522
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,080
Bringing the traitor to the palace as a dragon

523
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,440
Cheng Xi, don’t you think that I and you are brothers?

524
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,360
He was so mad that he dared to rebel and assassinate others.

525
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,120
Now there is solid evidence

526
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,080
What else can you say?

527
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,240
Become a king and lose the bandits, even become a cricket and have nothing to say

528
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,880
Cheng Xi, you alone

529
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,680
It is impossible to sneak into the tomb of the late king

530
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,800
There must be someone secretly arranging it

531
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,280
Who is this person?

532
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,640
The so-called leniency for confession

533
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,480
Even if you say it clearly, there is no need to be afraid

534
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,200
According to the Criminal Law of the Great Qin Dynasty, if you are willing to reveal the mastermind

535
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,880
Maybe it can save your family from the crime of being implicated

536
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,960
Cheng Xi, covering up the mastermind will only harm your family.

537
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,600
You'd better recruit from real people

538
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,000
Who is the mastermind of this matter?

539
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,240
Report to your Majesty, Prime Minister Lu is out seeking an audience.

540
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,360
pass

541
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,560
yes

542
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,400
Lu Buwei meets the king and wishes the king long blessings

543
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,400
Prime Minister Lu is not ill.

544
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,280
Want to go back to your hometown to rest?

545
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,120
Why did he suddenly go to court again?

546
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,080
Return to the king, the minister is on his way back to his hometown

547
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,280
Shocked to hear that the traitor turned into a traitor and rebelled

548
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,240
The minister is concerned about the safety of the king

549
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,760
He hurriedly returned to Xianyang to rescue him.

550
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,080
Unexpectedly, he met a traitor on the way and fled to his family.

551
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,960
Thanks to King Hongfu

552
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,520
Wei Chen finally captured all the people involved

553
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,840
It's a pity that Wei Chen was negligent for a moment

554
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,080
Turning the traitor into a pregnant wife

555
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:36,160
I ran away first after hearing the news. Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

556
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,840
The widow is ordering people to hunt down Cheng Yu's family members who are on the run.

557
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,840
Unexpectedly, he could not act as quickly as Prime Minister Lu

558
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,680
The chaos must be quelled quickly

559
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,640
Wei Chen did this because he wanted to help the king.

560
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,120
Just to avoid future troubles

561
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,320
In any case, Prime Minister Lu finally arrived in time

562
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,640
The crowd is interrogating Cheng Yu about who is the mastermind of the rebellion.

563
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,640
Prime Minister Lu might as well listen attentively

564
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,240
obedience to ministers

565
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,040
Cheng Xi, tell everyone

566
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:21,000
Who is the mastermind behind this rebellion?

567
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,720
No matter how powerful this person is

568
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,200
You also have to point him out in public
