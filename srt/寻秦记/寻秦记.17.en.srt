1
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,640
Does your Majesty want to just leave?

2
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,600
Your Majesty just used your power to forcibly search the waterside pavilion.

3
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,200
He also caused many offenses to my junior sister.

4
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,560
Nothing found now

5
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,760
Reasonable and reasonable

6
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,120
Should I have an explanation for you?

7
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,280
Xiang Shaolong kidnapped the princess from the palace, which caused a serious incident

8
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,040
Even if our army is guilty of something, it is inevitable

9
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,200
As the saying goes, it is rude to come and not reciprocate.

10
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,840
That being said, I would like to find a chance

11
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,200
Go to Junshang's mansion in person and search carefully.

12
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,360
Lord Long Yang, you dare to be rude to our Lord.

13
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,400
You dare to yell at Wei Mou, why are you talking to me?

14
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,840
Anyone who is rude to our Lord

15
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
Don't blame me for being ruthless under the sword

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,960
Have you forgotten

17
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,760
Is your swordsmanship not as fast as mine?

18
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,960
Please forgive me for acting recklessly.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,760
Even if there is any offense, please forgive me.

20
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,440
Since your Majesty personally begged for mercy,

21
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,240
I have nothing to say either

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,600
If something like this happens again in the future

23
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,600
I will never be as polite as I am today

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,080
No more gifts

25
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,320
Walk

26
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,360
Brother Xiang…

27
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,720
Brother Xiang, don’t abandon Xiaoqian

28
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,200
Miss Qin, it’s me

29
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,600
Senior brother, godfather

30
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,720
How is the princess now?

31
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,640
The princess is feeling hot all over, I'm worried about her...

32
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,120
She must have a bacterial infection

33
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,680
Bacterial infection?

34
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,520
Mr. Zou

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,200
Do you have any Chinese medicine for the princess to take later?

36
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,240
Keep her from having a fever for the time being

37
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Huangdi Neijing

38
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,240
Although there are also records of medicine and pathology

39
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,800
It’s just that most of them mainly use Qi observation and external application.

40
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,640
And use moxibustion to treat diseases

41
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,200
I have also tried them one by one

42
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,440
We even used folk secret recipes

43
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,960
It's a pity that the princess's injury still hasn't improved.

44
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,480
But if the princess can’t get rid of her fever

45
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,520
If this continues, my life may be in danger

46
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,880
Madam, the appointed time has passed

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,480
Mr. Xiang and Princess have not arrived yet, we...

48
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,440
No, I want to go back to Daliang to find out what happened.

49
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Madam, please think twice. Daliang is heavily guarded.

50
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,320
Madam, it might be dangerous if you go back like this.

51
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,240
Madam, please go back to Handan as planned.

52
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,360
Well, let me rush back to Handan first

53
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,640
Send two of you to stay here for two more days.

54
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,640
So as to be able to respond to General Xiang at any time

55
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,960
yes ma'am

56
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,200
This is the latest technology product

57
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,520
There are also two pills inside for your emergency use.

58
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,160
Feeling better?

59
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,520
You took the medicine and your fever has started to go down.

60
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,000
Mr. Zou has prepared some Chinese medicine for you.

61
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,400
I think you will recover after taking it

62
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,800
Xiaoqian is really useless

63
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,920
Stop talking about this. Come on, take a rest.

64
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,680
Your illness will get better if you sleep more

65
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,120
I wipe the sweat for the princess

66
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,680
The elixir that General Xiang gave to the princess just now

67
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,320
The shape is quite special, Qin Qing has never seen it before

68
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Unknown what kind of drug it is?

69
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,440
I brought that medicine from the countryside

70
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,680
Has anti-inflammatory and fever-reducing effects

71
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,120
Even if I explain it to you, you may not understand it

72
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,120
Please forgive Qinqing for taking the liberty

73
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
Listen to General Xiang's words and accent

74
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,120
Seems to be different from ordinary Zhao people

75
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,080
Where is your hometown?

76
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,760
I live in a place far south of here in the countryside

77
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,960
called Hong Kong

78
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,280
Hong Kong? Qin Qing has never heard of it

79
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,120
Unexpectedly, General Xiang’s hometown

80
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,880
Such a unique reputation

81
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,440
Could it be that it is called Hong Kong because it is rich in spices?

82
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,960
maybe

83
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,360
Although the princess was seriously injured

84
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,120
But can I find someone like General Xiang?

85
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,480
Such a loving and caring husband

86
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,560
Finally this life is not in vain

87
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,600
There are stars in the sky, and there is light in the stars

88
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,560
My heart is pleased with you, you know it

89
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,720
General Xiang

90
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,200
It's already so late, why haven't you gone to bed yet?

91
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,800
Yes, you're still up so late too

92
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,240
It seems that General Xiang has something on his mind

93
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,240
I do have a lot of questions that I can't figure out

94
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,840
I wonder if Miss Qin can help me answer this question?

95
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,680
What doubts does General Xiang have in mind?

96
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,600
Just say it and let everyone take a look at it

97
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,840
if there are two people

98
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,880
They were born in different eras

99
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:34,200
Do you think they can have a relationship?

100
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,760
As long as two people love each other

101
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,200
Regardless of age or geographical barriers

102
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,960
Can't stop them

103
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,640
What if it was two thousand years apart?

104
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,840
Two thousand years? Is this possible?

105
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,480
Yes, they are really two thousand years apart

106
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,200
Do you think they will be together?

107
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,840
General Xiang’s hypothesis is really unbelievable

108
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,440
Qin Qing can't understand

109
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,320
I really don't understand. A moth knows that it will die if it throws itself into the fire.

110
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,320
Why fly towards the fire?

111
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,560
Maybe they like to chase the light

112
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,440
In fact, between the moth and the fire

113
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,640
There is basically a kind of marriage in the past life

114
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,880
Just like some people, even though it’s the first time they meet

115
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,280
But I can't control the feeling in my heart

116
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,240
General Xiang has taken the topic too far.

117
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,200
Qin Qing also knew that the moth fluttering into the flame had another meaning

118
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,520
Just do everything you know you can't do

119
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,480
The result is just asking for trouble

120
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,040
That's right

121
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,280
There are really many people in this world who are like moths

122
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,560
Likes to look for trouble

123
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,840
What makes humans different from moths

124
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,960
It's because people don't do things based on feelings

125
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,600
I also know that there are certain moral responsibilities

126
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,480
It must be borne

127
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,680
When I was reading, there were two sentences from a poem

128
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,400
Really suitable for use now

129
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,560
Flowers are ready to be cut off when they are in bloom, don’t wait until there are no flowers left and then break off the branches

130
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,720
Fate is really hard to control

131
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,080
Because of this

132
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,880
General Xiang should cherish the people in front of him even more

133
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,480
Stop imagining things

134
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,080
I checked near the city gate

135
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,000
The city gate is surrounded by Lord Xinling's minions.

136
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,840
Even outside the city, there were several official roads leading to Zhao State.

137
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,680
It is also full of the eyes and ears of Lord Xinling

138
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,400
General Xiang wants to take the princess away from Daliang

139
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,280
I'm afraid it won't be easy

140
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,720
If you don't let the birds and beasts disperse, you will be dead.

141
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,200
What is "birds and beasts scattered"?

142
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,880
Leave as soon as possible

143
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,280
What the general said is true

144
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,760
Now the wind outside is getting tighter and tighter

145
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,160
If the general and the princess continue to stay here

146
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,280
I’m afraid I’ll have long nights and lots of dreams

147
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,760
Your Majesty, Mr. Li Si wishes to see you.

148
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,080
Li Si?

149
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,040
Li Si pays homage to Lord Long Yang

150
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,920
Mr. Zou, Miss Qinqing

151
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,400
Mr. Li, why do you have to be so polite? Mr. Li

152
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,360
I suddenly came to visit you and I don’t know why?

153
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,040
Li Si came this time

154
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,320
I sincerely say goodbye to you, Mr. Zou and others.

155
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,160
Could it be Mr. Li and Mr. Han?

156
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Has the matter of coming to Wei State to borrow food this time been settled?

157
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,920
The grain and grass we borrowed were officially shipped yesterday

158
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,200
Also because of the rush of time

159
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,440
Senior Brother Han has returned to South Korea with Liangcao first

160
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,040
Mr. Li will leave Daliang tomorrow?

161
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,400
Exactly

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,200
Dare I ask Brother Li, is there any news about Xiang Shaolong recently?

163
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,160
To be honest with you, Li Si has been here for several days.

164
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,160
They also went out to inquire about the whereabouts of General Xiang.

165
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,080
It's a pity that we haven't been able to get any news about General Xiang.

166
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,240
I'm afraid that General Xiang has already encountered something unexpected.

167
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,640
I asked you to go to Qin, so you don’t need to curse me like this.

168
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,200
General Xiang, are you okay, General Xiang?

169
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,880
Finally thanks

170
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,640
I learned that General Xiang was safe and sound

171
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,280
Li Si can also feel at ease

172
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,240
General Xiang doesn’t know something

173
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,160
Now the outside world is full of minions of Lord Xinling

174
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,040
Vow to hunt down General Xiang

175
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,480
Since everyone is General Xiang’s friend

176
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,840
Might as well tell the truth

177
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,160
I'm waiting to discuss

178
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,720
How to help General Xiang and Princess leave Daliang safely

179
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,320
Brother Li, can you help me?

180
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,400
General Xiang and Li Si hit it off

181
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,600
General Xiang was also kind to Li Si.

182
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,800
If this matter is useful, find it in the following place

183
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,480
Li Si went through fire and water without hesitation

184
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,840
I really don’t know how to thank you

185
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,400
The general said something serious, the most important thing now is

186
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,720
How can the general leave Daliang safely and quickly?

187
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,320
After I leave this time

188
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,760
Don’t know when I can meet you all?

189
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,040
General Xiang and the princess should take good care of themselves

190
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,760
My subordinates have been ordering people in recent days

191
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,320
Follow all the necessary routes to leave Daliang City

192
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,680
Expect Xiang Shaolong

193
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,160
I must be afraid that every city gate is heavily guarded.

194
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,680
I don’t dare to show up for a while

195
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,600
He dared to sneak into the palace and kidnap the princess

196
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,000
How can you be afraid of a few mere gatekeepers?

197
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,600
Did you find out today

198
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,560
Any suspicious characters or vehicles out of town?

199
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,360
Back to the king, all the carriages carrying goods out of the city

200
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,280
All subordinates stopped him personally and ordered people to conduct strict searches.

201
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,640
It's a pity that it has never been found

202
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,600
You take seriously all the vehicles leaving the city

203
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,000
Stop and search is done without exception.

204
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,120
Yes, without exception, except…

205
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,920
Except what?

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,160
Except for the Li Si motorcade that just left the city,

207
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,320
The subordinates saw Li Si showing official documents from the Korean envoy

208
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,360
So just a little search

209
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,280
Damn it, Han Fei has always been friends with Long Yangjun

210
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,440
Besides, when talented people discuss politics,

211
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,400
Han Fei, Li Si and Xiang Shaolong kept flirting with each other.

212
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,440
You were so careless and let me go

213
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,160
Subordinates convicted

214
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,240
Still standing still, why don't you rush to catch up?

215
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,200
obey

216
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,640
General Xiao, you come with a large number of troops to pursue and intercept

217
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,440
What happened?

218
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,320
This general suspects that Xiang Shaolong is hiding in this car

219
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,920
So stop and search

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,040
General Xiao, we were under the city gate just now

221
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,400
Your men have already searched my carriage.

222
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,320
Why do we need to search again now?

223
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,160
Because the general suddenly remembered

224
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,000
Your Excellency and Han Fei are at the intellectual discussion table

225
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,760
Close relationship with Xiang Shaolong

226
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,600
Most likely harboring traitors and smuggling them out of the city

227
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,200
Damn it, I'm on orders from the King of Han

228
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,080
Came to your country as a special envoy to borrow food for disaster relief

229
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,240
Now that the general is deliberately making things difficult, what crime should he face?

230
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,440
This general is just following the orders of Lord Xin Ling

231
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,920
Come to capture the traitor

232
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,800
Who dares to stop me? Don’t blame me for being ruthless under the sword.

233
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,120
Come, search the car

234
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,720
Yes stop

235
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,400
There is a man and a woman over there

236
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,760
Chase is

237
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,880
General Xiang, Li Si is still worried

238
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,400
Let me give you another ride

239
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,920
No, I'd better leave quickly

240
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Don’t let the bearded man come back to trouble you, take care

241
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,240
See you later

242
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,680
careful

243
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,080
Oops, I fell into the trap of luring the tiger away from the mountain. Let’s go.

244
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,080
Who?

245
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,080
I'm from Hong Kong

246
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,120
General Xiang... where is the princess?

247
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,360
Brother Xiang, we don’t have time. Let’s go quickly.

248
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,200
Do you think you can deceive this general?

249
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,920
General Xiang, you go first

250
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,960
Walk

251
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,360
catch them

252
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,200
shoot arrows

253
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,600
Chase is

254
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,560
Brother Xiang, let’s go

255
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,960
Chase

256
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,280
Search around Yes

257
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,840
Chase

258
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,840
Come, jump

259
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,360
It doesn't make sense. Everyone split up and went to the bottom of the cliff to look for it.

260
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,040
Even if they are broken to pieces

261
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,560
Also take their bones

262
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
Take it back and explain to your Majesty

263
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,920
Yes go

264
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,880
Brother Xiang...how are you?

265
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,280
Help me pull out the arrow

266
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,480
Come on, pull it out

267
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,680
but…

268
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,440
Pull it out

269
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,160
Pull it out

270
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,600
Pull it out

271
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,240
Brother Xiang...how are you?

272
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,080
Brother Xiang…

273
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,520
you have a fever

274
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,800
It's okay, keep walking

275
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,680
Brother Xiang…

276
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,720
Brother Xiang...how are you?

277
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,280
I'm so cold

278
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,200
It doesn't matter, I picked up a lot of firewood

279
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,200
I'll help you light a fire right away

280
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,480
Brother Xiang, are you feeling better?

281
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,360
Brother Xiang, how are you?

282
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,800
Xiaoqian…

283
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,240
Brother Xiang, are you awake?

284
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,240
Do you still have chills or fever?

285
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
much better

286
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,400
I sweated a lot last night and I feel more energetic.

287
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,560
But I'm a little thirsty

288
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,560
I'll get you some water, please.

289
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,000
Why is the water flowing out here black?

290
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,640
have a look

291
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,560
oil?

292
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,160
Oil? What is it?

293
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,040
Petroleum is a substance that can be burned and generate electricity

294
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,360
Materials for producing energy, in the future...

295
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,800
It's very valuable in my country

296
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,240
Brother Xiang, how do you know so much?

297
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,720
How do I know so much?

298
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,560
Because there was someone who stayed up all night last night

299
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,240
Find a way to cure me

300
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,120
So I understand everything now

301
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,200
your face is dirty

302
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,520
Brother Xiang, you are in much better spirits today

303
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,800
Thank you for taking care of me

304
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,600
Otherwise I might have died

305
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,240
There seems to be a room in front. Let's go and ask.

306
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,440
Is there a place to rest? Okay

307
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,800
Literature and art, come here

308
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,480
Look how dirty you are playing

309
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,880
Dad will definitely spank you when he comes back

310
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,840
Excuse me

311
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,640
you…

312
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,480
We are passing by and want to borrow some water from you

313
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,680
It is rare to find guests in this deserted village

314
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,680
Wait a minute, I'll get some water

315
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,040
Thanks

316
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,720
It seems that both of them are gentle people.

317
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,600
Why did you come to the mountains? Did you encounter bandits?

318
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,080
It can also be said that

319
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,240
These days there is a lot of war

320
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,560
My husband is tired of these days of fighting and killing.

321
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,880
So he buried his sword and lived in seclusion, making a living by hunting.

322
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,240
Finally living a peaceful and quiet life

323
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,520
What about your husband?

324
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,640
He and his good brothers went hunting in the mountains

325
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,000
How did you and your wife end up here?

326
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,360
We want to go to Zhao country

327
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,400
There is still a long way to go

328
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,800
It seems that you two are tired of walking

329
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,840
If you don't mind the shabby and humble house,

330
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,920
Why not stay one night and refresh yourself?

331
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,800
Let's continue on the road tomorrow

332
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,400
you are too polite

333
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,520
If we have to rush, we can still...

334
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,280
Sister Teng

335
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,920
Father Jing, what happened?

336
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,760
I just came back from chopping firewood

337
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,640
I saw many officers and soldiers descending from the mountain.

338
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,760
The evil spirit is coming towards us

339
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,040
Those officers and soldiers may be here to arrest us.

340
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Let's go first

341
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,800
Wait a minute, those officers and soldiers are coming up from the mountain

342
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,800
If you leave now, how can you avoid the officers and soldiers?

343
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,160
You'd better go in and escape first

344
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,560
After those officers and soldiers leave,

345
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,520
You go on your way again

346
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,000
But I'm afraid I'll hurt you

347
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,560
The three of us are old, weak, women and children.

348
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,440
Forgive them and they won’t make it difficult for us

349
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,080
I think both of them are good people.

350
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,760
My husband teaches me how to be chivalrous and help others.

351
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,360
If so, I will die without saving you

352
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,240
If my husband finds out, he will definitely blame me

353
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,520
Stop talking and come in with me

354
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,720
All right

355
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,320
Below is the dungeon where we store food for the winter.

356
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,840
You two can go down for a while and take a break.

357
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,760
You must wait until I call you before coming up.

358
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,440
sit

359
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,560
I wonder if something will happen to Auntie and the others?

360
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,840
No, they are just ordinary people

361
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,440
The officers and soldiers should not be suspicious

362
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,160
In fact, I envy Auntie and the others.

363
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,320
Men hunt for a living, women look after their husbands and raise children.

364
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,800
If one day

365
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,880
I wish I could live this life

366
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,360
But how can things in the world go as everyone wishes?

367
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,560
I also want to go back to Hong Kong

368
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,760
Even if I live in the countryside, I still have to be able to do it

369
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,360
Xiaoqian also wants to go back to your hometown with Brother Xiang to visit

370
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,680
Auntie...please answer me

371
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
father

372
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,920
Father...Mother, son...

373
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,440
Lady

374
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,000
two persons

375
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Who are you?

376
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,320
Was it you who killed my father?

377
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,800
Were you the one who killed my wife and children?

378
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,280
I was the one who caused them trouble

379
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,200
Brother Xiang, this sword...

380
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Don't get me wrong, you two.

381
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Brother Xiang did not kill the aunt and father.

382
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,400
Why should I believe you?

383
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,440
Listen to me, the real murderer of them

384
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,480
He is Lord Xinling of Wei State

385
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,400
They followed me all the way here

386
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,200
This aunt was so kind that she hid us in the basement

387
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,440
But unexpectedly, it killed them

388
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,160
Think about it, I don't know them

389
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,480
Why should I kill them?

390
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,000
But I don’t want to

391
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,040
It's you who use my sword to kill me

392
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
Is this sword yours?

393
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,800
Yes, I lost it a few days ago

394
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,160
The one who took the lead in calling out Wei Mou

395
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,440
As expected, he is from Lord Xinling's Mansion. Return the sword to him.

396
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
Brother Teng

397
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,160
The person who can use this sword must be an extraordinary person

398
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,240
Where are you two going?

399
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,440
I want revenge for my wife and children

400
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,200
Don't do it. Wei Mou has a large number of people.

401
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,360
You will only die if you go

402
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,760
No matter what, I will kill this person

403
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,200
If you really want to go, I will go too

404
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,320
But this brother, didn’t you just say...

405
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,240
Don't worry

406
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,120
Although they are outnumbered, we can outwit them

407
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,240
Brother Xiang, do you have any idea?

408
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Do you still remember the oil we saw?

409
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,480
General, look

410
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,200
The deserted village on the mountain has been searched just now

411
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,920
Why is there smoke rising?

412
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,320
There must be something weird, go back

413
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,800
Yes go back

414
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,880
Search Yes

415
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,880
Go Yes

416
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,160
You scum, even the old, weak, women and children will not be spared

417
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,400
Harboring a traitor is a crime worthy of death.

418
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,400
What are your future plans?

419
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,080
Teng buried his sword deep in the mountains, far away from the battlefield

420
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,680
I thought I could live a peaceful life

421
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,680
Now my wife and children are...

422
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,160
Brother Xiang, please forgive Jing Jun for being presumptuous.

423
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,840
It seems that this girl Xiaoqian is not like ordinary people.

424
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,720
Excuse me…

425
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,880
In fact, she is the princess of Zhao State

426
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,520
Princess?

427
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,080
It turns out that Brother Xiang is the general of Zhao State.

428
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,320
I think you both have good skills.

429
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
Why stay in the mountains?

430
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,120
How about you come back to Handan with me?

431
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Handan?

432
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,800
Brother Teng, we have nothing to worry about now.

433
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,800
Why not follow Brother Xiang to Handan?

434
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,400
Maybe you can really start a career

435
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,400
I never thought about achieving anything

436
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,560
It’s just that Brother Xiang is kind to me

437
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,360
If Brother Xiang is useful and has something to do with Teng,

438
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,640
Teng is willing to do the hard work of dogs and horses

439
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,240
Brother Xiang

440
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,840
It’s rare that the three of you once lived and died together.

441
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,720
Now we are like-minded again

442
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,800
Why not become brothers?

443
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,080
This is a good idea

444
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,560
Heaven and earth are witnesses, today the three of us become brothers

445
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,840
Sharing weal and woe, sharing adversity

446
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,160
congratulations

447
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,000
In terms of martial arts and intelligence, Brother Xiang is superior to both of us.

448
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
From now on we will call Brother Xiang Big Brother

449
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,440
Big brother

450
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,320
In fact, how do brothers differ in size?

451
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,040
We will be good brothers from now on

452
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,760
Good brother…

453
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,480
Over this hill is the border of Zhao State

454
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,320
Big Brother, Handan of Zhao State

455
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,160
Is it bigger and more prosperous than the Daliang of Wei?

456
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,200
Look at the princess

457
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,120
You know what kind of place it is there

458
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,240
Outstanding people

459
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,320
A beautiful princess can be born

460
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,000
Handan must be a good place

461
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,760
We are finally out of danger for now

462
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,920
But I wonder if my aunt has returned to Handan?

463
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Walk

464
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,000
Pan'er...

465
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,800
Madam returns to her home

466
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,560
Why so sneaky?

467
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,800
But the lady is dressed in a nondescript way

468
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,480
It would be unworthy of one's status

469
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,200
Ya'er just returned to Handan

470
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,560
Unexpectedly, the Marquis was waiting in the house

471
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,120
Failure to change clothes in time for reception

472
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,080
Please don’t be offended, Lord Marquis

473
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,240
The lady looked flustered

474
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,400
Could it be that I just rushed back from Daliang and it’s a long journey?

475
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,960
so tired

476
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,000
Ya'er is really ashamed

477
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,000
This trip to the Wei State was carried out as entrusted by the Marquis.

478
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,240
Ya'er has never been able to find out

479
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,240
Where is the secret record of Lu Gong hidden?

480
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,160
Lu Gong's Secret Records is indeed a unique book

481
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Not only does it allow people to fight overtly and covertly,

482
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,960
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

483
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,160
Willing to sacrifice the life of his precious son

484
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,560
What did you do with the plate?

485
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,040
Madam, you can rest assured

486
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,880
Your precious son is currently recuperating in my residence.

487
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,120
But Pan'er is indeed a filial son

488
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,960
Madam has been away for so many days

489
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,760
He has been worried for so many days

490
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,560
He was worried about his mother's safety and didn't think about food or tea day and night.

491
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,080
Even how can I intimidate you?

492
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,800
He also refused to take a bite of food

493
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,000
He is indeed a tough guy

494
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,800
Pan'er has nothing to do with this matter at all

495
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,600
I beg the Marquis to let Pan'er go.

496
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,000
As long as the lady honestly hands over Lu Gong’s Secret Records

497
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,000
I guarantee

498
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,720
You two, mother and son, will be able to see each other safely soon.

499
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,440
Ya'er can't steal Lu Gong's secret records at all

500
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,600
Why hand it over?

501
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,400
Do you think that every move in Wei State is

502
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,800
I know nothing, am I in the dark?

503
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,680
I got a report from a spy

504
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,160
Xiang Shaolong and the princess have escaped from the Wei Palace

505
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,360
Madam left Wei Jing earlier

506
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,000
If he hadn't successfully stolen Lu Gong's secret records,

507
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,680
And why did they leave the Wei Kingdom one after another?

508
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,520
And if it weren’t for the secret record being in your hands,

509
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,400
Will you risk escaping back to Handan?

510
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,360
Are you planning to take them away and flee?

511
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,200
I'm just afraid that the Marquis may have misunderstood

512
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,360
Ya'er left Wei this time just because Xingzang was exposed

513
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,080
Arouse the suspicion of Lord Xinling

514
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,920
Can't stay in Daliang anymore

515
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,880
As for secretly sneaking back to Handan

516
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,240
It’s because I couldn’t steal Lu Gong’s secret records

517
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,600
I was also afraid of being blamed by the Marquis, so I didn’t dare to show up rashly for a while.

518
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,440
If the Marquis doesn't believe Ya'er,

519
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,920
You can search Ya'er's body

520
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,360
See if the secret record is on Yaer

521
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,960
Since the lady has other plans

522
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,400
Of course I wouldn't be stupid enough to keep the secret record with me.

523
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,840
Ya'er really doesn't... Stop talking nonsense.

524
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,200
If before noon tomorrow

525
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,040
You still refuse to hand over Lu Gong’s Secret Records

526
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,400
Your precious son

527
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,920
Go down to hell immediately to meet his father

528
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,560
Marquis

529
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,680
Do you keep the secret record or keep your precious son?

530
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,800
Take care of yourself

531
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,600
Secret records are very important to us

532
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,440
Don't make any mistakes

533
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,360
If so, before noon tomorrow

534
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,040
You still refuse to hand over Lu Gong’s Secret Records

535
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,440
Your precious son

536
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,360
Go down to hell immediately to meet his father

537
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,840
Do you keep the secret record or keep your precious son?

538
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,880
Take care of yourself

539
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,640
Zhao Ya meets with the Marquis

540
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,880
Madam, why is it so late?

541
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,480
I thought my wife would break the promise

542
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,160
daughter

543
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
Pan'er

544
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,720
Sure enough, the love between mother and son is deep

545
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,760
But I hope Mrs.

546
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,160
I won't let you down again

547
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,160
Zhao Ya has already brought what the Marquis wants.

548
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,280
Mr. Hou lets him go first

549
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,160
Of course no problem

550
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,960
But how could I know what you have in your hands?

551
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,480
It’s really Lu Gong’s secret record

552
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,360
Lord Hou is really careful

553
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,120
Luban's skills are truly ingenious

554
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,800
The Marquis has already reviewed Lu Gong’s secret records.

555
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,280
He should be released, right?

556
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,360
Based on the past relationship between my wife and this prince,

557
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,800
Madam should know very well

558
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,200
I will never break my trust with a woman

559
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,200
Let him go

560
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,120
Pan'er, are you okay? Mom, are you okay?

561
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,240
Mount first

562
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:21,040
Madam, when you return to the city, why don't you wait for me to give you a ride?

563
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,920
I'm not going back to the city

564
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,240
Lu Gong secretly records that the Marquis has succeeded

565
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,080
I hope Mr. Hou will not harass Zhao Ya and her son in the future.

566
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,640
Madam, please rest assured

567
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,840
A thing that is no longer useful to me

568
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,160
I will never be nostalgic again
