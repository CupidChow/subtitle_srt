1
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,600
Say, where has the king gone?

2
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,360
Mr. Lu, we really don’t know

3
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,080
Keep on beating until you tell me

4
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,880
Mr. Lu, we really don’t know

5
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,520
Don't fight. If you beat us to death, we won't have to say anything.

6
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,120
we really don't know

7
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,080
Take them both out and kill them

8
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,000
Queen Mother, please forgive me...

9
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,240
Wait a minute, since the person has left

10
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,120
It's no use if you kill them

11
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,600
Xiang Shaolong, as a Taifu, you are not upright.

12
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,200
Often indulge the king in having fun

13
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,160
Let him be distracted and you are the culprit

14
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,520
I say you are the culprit

15
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
If you hadn't forced him to get married, he wouldn't have left at all

16
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,160
The king's marriage has always been a national event

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,120
I choose aristocratic women for him to marry

18
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,840
It is in line with the ancestral rules

19
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,280
It's better than him wandering around and indulging in women

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,640
I always think about the king

21
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,040
What do you have in mind for him?

22
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,080
You can find any woman and force her to marry her

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,720
Have you considered his feelings?

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,120
Do you really think he is a puppet?

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,000
The king is still young

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,880
You can slowly advise on getting married

27
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,520
Now he is forced to run away

28
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,080
What to do if something unexpected happens?

29
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,600
The Queen Mother actually blamed the truth

30
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,600
I don’t blame anyone

31
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,760
Lao Ai is the commander-in-chief of the inner court guards.

32
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,240
He failed in his duty and allowed the king to leave without authorization

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,080
He should also be held accountable

34
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,720
What's the point of regretting my death?

35
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,720
But if the king’s disappearance becomes public,

36
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,600
Let Cheng Xi have an opportunity to take advantage of it, and this will cause serious problems

37
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,920
For the time being, we can pretend that the king is sick

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,200
No morning service for now

39
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,720
But not long after, it will be the late king’s 40th birthday.

40
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,160
If no one reads out the memorial ceremony at the ancestral temple at that time

41
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,440
It’s no longer easy to lie

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,680
In short, the most important thing now is to find the king to return to the palace.

43
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,880
You can find the king to return to the palace

44
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,600
All the sins of dereliction of duty will be forgotten by me.

45
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,760
Thank you Queen Mother for your forgiveness...

46
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,240
You have to remember, you must get the king back

47
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,880
Otherwise, everyone's head will fall to the ground

48
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,760
I must bear the guilt

49
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,680
Searching for traces of the king

50
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,160
Okay, let's split into two groups

51
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,240
You look for it in Xianyang City, I'll look for it outside the city

52
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,480
How is it? Brother, is the king really gone?

53
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,960
I remember when we broke up last night, the king once said

54
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,000
Your own destiny must be decided by yourself

55
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,920
Will he never return?

56
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,200
It's all my fault

57
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,240
If I would have listened to his complaint last night

58
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,880
Maybe he won't leave

59
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,760
It's all my fault

60
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
I even used Miss Lu’s incident to provoke him.

61
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,840
I'm useless. I can't persuade him even if I chase him.

62
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Forget it...don't say anything that won't help at this time.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Let's think about how to find the king

64
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,200
But Qin is so big

65
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,320
Where should we find it?

66
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,520
When I taught the king the geography of Qin that day,

67
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,440
He was very fond of Bashu and the Great Wall in the north.

68
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
are particularly interested in

69
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
Maybe he'll go in either direction

70
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,320
Then divide the troops into two groups

71
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,160
You two go to Bashu, I go to the Great Wall

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,960
good

73
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,920
I'll go too

74
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,880
No, it’s a long journey to my daughter’s house

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,120
If something happens, how can I take care of you?

76
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,920
I'm not afraid, the king is my student after all

77
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,120
Maybe when I meet him, he will listen to my advice

78
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,160
All right

79
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
I'll prepare the horses

80
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,560
Thanks

81
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,680
you haven't drank

82
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,880
Let's go

83
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,240
Sorry, I want to rush to the market quickly

84
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,960
I'm worried something will happen to the brat

85
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,120
Qin Qing understands Brother Xiang’s mood very well

86
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,680
Young Master, look at whatever you want, choose whatever you want, and buy one.

87
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,680
Sir, just take a look

88
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,520
So pitiful

89
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,520
Really filial

90
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,760
Selling yourself to bury your father?

91
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,280
Girl, why is it so miserable to sell yourself to bury your father?

92
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,400
The little girl was born a serf

93
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,000
There is a high hall above and a small room below

94
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,160
I don’t have enough to eat or wear warm clothes on weekdays.

95
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,400
Now my father has died of illness and there is no money to pay for the funeral.

96
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,560
How can you bury your father without selling yourself?

97
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,440
Da Qin is known as a prosperous country and a strong people

98
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,160
I never thought there were people in extreme poverty

99
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,800
Girl, are these enough for you to bury your father?

100
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,560
It’s enough to buy one acre of land

101
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,560
Too many, sir

102
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,720
Use the rest to support your family

103
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,440
Thank you sir...

104
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,880
So kindhearted

105
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,160
I don’t know which family he belongs to?

106
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,400
Why is the girl following me?

107
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,400
Young master gave me money to bury my father

108
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,920
The little girl is willing to be a slave and serve as a maid, serving the young master

109
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,840
No need, helping the poor and helping the world is a benevolent act

110
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,160
I'm helping people, but I want peace of mind

111
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,520
You don't have to sell yourself to me, you should go home

112
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,760
Thank you, sir

113
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,120
You are kind and righteous, and you will be rewarded in the future.

114
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,760
Waiter

115
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,480
Pan'er

116
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,600
It was the master who was wrong before

117
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,600
I shouldn't ignore your feelings

118
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,080
Master apologizes to you

119
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,920
I don't remember what happened that night

120
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,240
If you have anything unhappy, you can discuss it with us.

121
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,200
You left without saying a word

122
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,040
we are worried about you

123
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,320
You also know your identity

124
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,840
If the news gets out, it's really not a child's play.

125
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,960
I understand, I will go back with you after dinner

126
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,200
Actually I just came out to relax

127
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,400
Will you never go back?

128
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,880
Anyway, the money I brought out is almost used up.

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,120
My stomach hurts a little bit

130
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,080
Are you okay?

131
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,040
You guys eat slowly, I'll be back after I go to the toilet

132
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,160
Waiter Sir, what’s the matter?

133
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,240
Where is your toilet?

134
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,720
There is only one horse, what should I do?

135
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
Come up

136
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,000
Sit tight

137
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,000
Where else are you going? Come back with me

138
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,560
I won’t go back, I must go back

139
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,360
I am not the king at all, not Ying Zheng

140
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,800
I am Zhao Pan

141
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,520
Now that I have taken my revenge, I want to leave Xianyang

142
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,480
I will not return to the palace to be a puppet again

143
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,360
I would rather go back to my hometown with Master

144
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,840
I won't go back either

145
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,000
If you don’t become the king, how can I go back?

146
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,880
If you don’t become king, history will be rewritten.

147
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,280
What does changing history have to do with me?

148
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,480
Anyway, I don’t want to be a king…

149
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,040
Did you listen to me?

150
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,960
If you don’t become the king, I won’t be able to go back.

151
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,160
Where are you going back?

152
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,160
I'll send someone to take you off in a carriage or boat right away

153
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,480
I don't believe in this world

154
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,960
There is a place that cannot be reached

155
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,240
Okay, then you send someone to take me back to Hong Kong

156
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,960
Do you know where Hong Kong is?

157
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,960
more than two thousand years later

158
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,920
Do you know what will happen more than two thousand years later?

159
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,720
It's useless even if you can fly now

160
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,640
It's useless for you to send me a plane.

161
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,960
Do you know what this is? Electronic instrument

162
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,160
Have you seen the things you sent me back?

163
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,440
Your Majesty, Brother Xiang

164
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
What? You want to see it?

165
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,120
Do you understand? Do you know what this is?

166
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,200
if i knew what this was

167
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,480
I wouldn't have ended up like this today

168
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,600
If you want to see it, let me show it to you.

169
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,160
Look, tell me what it is?

170
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,320
Qinqing

171
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,800
Are you okay?

172
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,000
That communicator

173
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Fortunately, it's okay, Brother Xiang

174
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,960
Brother Xiang, this communicator is fine

175
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
Thanks

176
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,920
Let's go find the king quickly

177
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,280
Forget it, it won't move if it can't be charged.

178
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,640
Even if I ask him to go back and become the king, I can't go back

179
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,160
It was dangerous for you to jump down like that just now

180
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,600
Don't do this next time

181
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680
I just want to catch the communicator

182
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
I know it's important to you

183
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,280
Sorry, I blamed you for not helping me last time

184
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,560
fresh pears

185
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Young Master, fresh pears, sweet and juicy

186
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,160
Buy it

187
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,960
Very sweet, buy it

188
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,200
Sir, buy a few more, okay

189
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,080
Thank you, sir

190
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,760
Walk

191
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,680
Young Master, buy some steamed buns, they’re so hot

192
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,880
i have no money

193
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,320
Just kidding, son

194
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,680
How come you have no money when you dress so well?

195
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,240
Go away, come back if you don’t have any money, bastard, go away...

196
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,560
Don't hinder my business

197
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,160
When I patronized you before,

198
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,280
I didn’t ask you to give me the extra money.

199
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,320
Nowadays, it’s not enough to just buy a bowl of noodles on credit?

200
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,680
Let’s go…no…

201
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,600
three buns

202
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,800
You can only buy one with this amount of money

203
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,640
So snobbish and heartless

204
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,880
steal something

205
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,320
Don't run

206
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,120
Brat, steal my stuff

207
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,200
So bold to steal something

208
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,880
The brave little thief actually stole on the street in broad daylight

209
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,720
Do you know you are guilty?

210
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,360
Be brave, I am the king today

211
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,360
How dare you, a lowly local official, touch even a few people?

212
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,960
Are you the current king?

213
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,720
Can the king steal steamed buns? What a crazy dream

214
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,680
Who is your name? Send me back to the palace quickly.

215
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,400
Determined to be promoted to an official position

216
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,120
The bold thief not only steals on the street

217
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,120
He also pretended to be the king and deceived the king.

218
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,560
Someone comes, beat him fifty times, and then put him in jail

219
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,840
Yes fight

220
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,240
I'm really the king

221
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,080
Also watch

222
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,040
Go faster, go...

223
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
Walk…

224
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,880
Come on...after dinner and work

225
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,880
Walk…

226
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,640
Why are you taking my food?

227
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,600
Give it back to me

228
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,040
We have searched all over Xianyang City

229
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,160
I'm just afraid that he is no longer in Xianyang City now

230
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,000
So how do we explain it to the Queen Mother?

231
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,840
Whether to explain now or not is another matter.

232
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,720
I'm just afraid that this stupid boy won't be able to think about it for a while.

233
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,720
I don’t know what stupid thing I will do again

234
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,240
What should we do? Let's look around again

235
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,520
hurry up…

236
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Work harder, don't you want to eat?

237
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,880
Come on, someone fainted...

238
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,640
Play dead...don't work, get up quickly

239
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,040
He fainted and you kicked him

240
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,840
You take him to the mass grave

241
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,640
What are you looking at?

242
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,560
It's him who dies now, not you, so why don't you do your work?

243
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,440
hurry up

244
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,120
That's it, I don't want to suffer here

245
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,640
Either die, or sneak away

246
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,440
Someone is running away...don't run away...

247
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,400
Walk…

248
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,640
You see, this is what happens when you sneak away.

249
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,280
If you are not working yet, go to work quickly...

250
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,040
Come on...go

251
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,560
Come on...work

252
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,240
Have you ever seen one?

253
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,040
About this high, very dark and strong

254
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,400
Fashionably dressed, wearing a brand name

255
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,760
Have you ever seen someone as handsome as me?

256
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,080
You two gentlemen, stop joking with me.

257
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,200
This is a remote place of hard work

258
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,600
How could a young man from your noble family come here to play?

259
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,680
Judging from the route we took when we met Zheng'er

260
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,400
He is walking north and should come to the Great Wall

261
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,840
Could he have gone to Bashu?

262
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,840
Since there is no trace of him here

263
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,360
It’s better to go back and ask Brother Teng and Jing Jun

264
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,360
Is there any news about him?

265
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,720
Prime Minister Lu…

266
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,720
Prime Minister Lu…

267
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,000
The king has not been able to come to court for many days. He must be seriously ill.

268
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,760
As the king's younger brother, I'm really worried

269
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,240
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty

270
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,000
In three days, the late king will die.

271
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,280
If the king fails to show up to read the memorial service

272
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,480
In what manner?

273
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,600
Then the prince can replace him

274
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,080
Read out the memorial service

275
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,520
The king will live forever, who dares to replace him?

276
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,960
Could it be that someone wants to rebel?

277
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,600
He's a cunning old man, but he can still pretend to be calm

278
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,520
As a monarch, the most important thing is filial piety

279
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,120
If the king has not yet appeared on the day when the previous king died,

280
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,760
Such kings will surely take their place

281
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,200
Don't worry, Your Majesty, everything will be settled in three days.

282
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,360
Lord Supervisor, be careful

283
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,520
A humble man is a king, a bold pariah

284
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,240
I am Ying Zheng. What is your official rank?

285
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,480
Bring the widow back to the palace, and the widow will be rewarded heavily

286
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,600
Ridiculous, the king is fine in the palace

287
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,640
you untouchable

288
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,600
Dare to blaspheme the power of God and pretend to be the king

289
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,560
Do you want to die?

290
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,680
I am really a king

291
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
Call me Yes

292
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,840
Drag him to the mass grave

293
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,960
I have searched a hundred miles outside the city.

294
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,680
But I can't find the king

295
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,600
Even the Great Wall to the north is nowhere to be found.

296
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,080
There has been no news at all in the past few days.

297
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,880
Could it be that something really happened to Zheng'er?

298
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,960
Today is the late king’s birthday

299
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,200
Yang Quanjun and Cheng Xi have been waiting for the opportunity to cause trouble

300
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,160
in order to rebel

301
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,200
Lao Ai failed and searched the entire Xianyang city

302
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,360
No trace of the king can be found

303
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,280
Even you can't find it

304
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,080
The truth is revealed first, if the king cannot be found

305
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,920
You want your head to fall to the ground

306
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,760
Can you get Zheng'er back if you kill all the people?

307
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,520
Now is the time to employ people

308
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,760
If you kill them all, who else will go to find the king?

309
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,440
If the truth cannot be fulfilled, then there will be no discipline

310
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,160
How to be convincing in the future

311
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,080
Why do people do their best to serve the court?

312
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,000
If you want to kill them, you should kill them

313
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,320
They are the king's close relatives

314
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,480
If you serve poorly, you really deserve to die.

315
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,520
The minister deserves to die, the slave deserves to die, please spare my life, Queen Mother.

316
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,680
Li Si has the position of censor

317
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,520
Often not with the king

318
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,920
If you really want to kill him, kill Zhao Gao

319
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,160
Queen Mother, please forgive me...

320
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,080
See the Queen Mother

321
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,720
Prime Minister, the Mingshou Festival is about to begin.

322
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,680
Prime Minister Yang urged the Prime Minister to set off as soon as possible

323
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,800
Prime Minister, please forgive me, Queen Mother, please forgive me...

324
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,840
Dog slave, shut up.

325
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,480
Someone is coming, take Zhao Gao and kill him somewhere. Yes

326
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:05,520
Queen Mother, please forgive me...

327
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,280
Bold and unruly, breaking into the palace gates

328
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,040
A humble man is a great king

329
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,000
Come on, don't cause trouble here

330
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,640
You are the king, am I not the king’s father?

331
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,560
I am really a king

332
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,040
I want to see the Queen Mother, Prime Minister Lu

333
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,120
Walk…

334
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,320
Spare my life...

335
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,400
Don't kill the villain, spare your life...

336
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,840
Don’t kill…

337
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,920
King

338
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,840
Xiaogao

339
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,560
King

340
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,160
King…

341
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,480
King

342
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,240
The auspicious time is coming soon, if the memorial sermon is not read out,

343
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,880
I'm afraid it's disrespectful to the late king.

344
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,680
The festival cannot begin before the king arrives.

345
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,920
Not even the late king’s death came

346
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It can be seen that the king is a man who has failed in his filial piety and moral integrity.

347
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,520
How can we face our ancestors?

348
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,720
Please ask the prince to read the memorial sermon

349
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,440
This king is not in his place

350
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,880
The prince read out the memorial text, which was expected by everyone

351
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,840
In this case, I will be disrespectful

352
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,040
The king has arrived

353
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,600
See the king

354
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,280
See the king...

355
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:30,120
I am my destiny, who dares to take my place?

356
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,600
The auspicious time has arrived

357
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,640
Please go to the ancestral temple and read the memorial sermon

358
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,600
Haotian has a destiny, in Mu Qing Temple

359
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,200
Recruit Xianxian to show his filial piety to King Zhuang and Xiang...

360
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,840
Ancestors of Da Qin

361
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,120
From today on, I am no longer Zhao Pan.

362
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,880
But the real Ying Zheng

363
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,840
As Taifu Xiang said, a humble man has become a great king

364
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,840
As Taifu Xiang predicted, the few will unite the six countries

365
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,400
I will definitely live up to my expectations

366
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,480
mother queen

367
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,600
King, long time no see, you have lost weight

368
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,640
Why don't you get some ginseng soup?

369
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,120
Mother, there is no need to worry, I am observing the public sentiment outside.

370
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,400
Why bother if you suffer a little?

371
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,080
If the king has some minor errors,

372
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,520
Who does the king ask my mother to rely on for the rest of her life?

373
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Don't worry, mother, I won't be willful again

374
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,840
Do something that worries your mother

375
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,560
Come to think of it, my mother also has her faults

376
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,680
If it weren’t for forcing the king to get married

377
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,840
Your Majesty, you won’t be impulsive

378
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,400
If the king doesn't like it

379
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,120
Getting married can be postponed for a step

380
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,560
No need, Queen Mother

381
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,800
I am about to summon the two prime ministers

382
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,280
Come to discuss marriage

383
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,800
Discussing marriage?

384
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,880
The king is planning a wedding?

385
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,280
Father Zhong is right, get married as soon as possible

386
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,240
It can make people more focused on political affairs in the future.

387
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,760
Your Majesty, it’s so gratifying to congratulate you

388
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,880
Observing filial piety for three years is the ancestral precept

389
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,280
Nowadays, a happy event is held less than a hundred days after the death of the late king

390
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,600
This is unethical and contrary to filial piety, Your Majesty

391
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,800
Filial piety and unfilial piety depend on the heart

392
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,360
The so-called three years of filial piety is just a formality

393
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,920
If you have filial piety in your heart, why should you stick to formalities?

394
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,480
Your Majesty, this is against the laws of heaven and violates filial piety.

395
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,640
From now on, the king will not be the king, and the minister will not be the minister.

396
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,080
All people in the world will be at a loss

397
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,720
The legal system relies on flexibility, just like our ancestor Qin Xiaogong

398
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,120
Abolish the pedantic old customs and rituals

399
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,480
Boldly appointed Shang Yang to carry out reforms, making the Qin Dynasty prosperous and powerful

400
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,680
King

401
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,920
Prime Minister Yang, there is no need to say more, I have already made my decision.

402
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,280
Let Prime Minister Lu take charge of everything

403
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,840
The humble minister obeys the decree

404
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,400
Your Majesty, think twice... Your Majesty

405
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,800
Your Majesty, Your Majesty has suffered a lot

406
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,200
The suffering suffered by the poor will not be in vain

407
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,120
The widow swore an oath

408
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:56,800
I won't let myself suffer like this again

409
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,160
Speaking of which, there are many people who need your help.

410
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,880
Otherwise, not only will the widow be kicked out of the palace,

411
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,640
Adults will also take advantage of the opportunity to rebel

412
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,640
It’s only right that this slave is grateful to the king for saving his life.

413
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,760
If he hadn't met the king, Zhao Gao would have died long ago

414
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,280
You have saved me many times, and you can be considered my blessing.

415
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,640
The slave dare not

416
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,560
I decided to seal you

417
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,720
Thank you King

418
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,600
Your Majesty, Taifu Xiang wants to see you

419
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,520
Brat, I'm scared to death of you, come here and take a look

420
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,400
It's so dark, is it hard outside?

421
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,520
master

422
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,280
I was really teased to death by you

423
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,440
Miss Qin and I are riding around looking for you.

424
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,480
I'm sorry for making you worry.

425
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Actually, I'm the one who's sorry. You're right.

426
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,080
I often force you to do things you don't like to do

427
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,320
If you stay in Zhao country now, you may be happier

428
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,680
If I were not in Qin, I would

429
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,280
How did you get your current status?

430
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,240
This experience has taught me one thing

431
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,120
Without any power, they will only let people eat their flesh.

432
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,520
Life is as humble and insignificant as an ant

433
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,160
After death, it is just a pile of nameless bones.

434
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,840
So from now on

435
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,040
Ignorant people will cherish their power and position

436
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,400
Choose the path you should take

437
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,800
I am no longer the arbitrary boy I used to be.

438
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,800
Follow others

439
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,800
You seem really different

440
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,680
Soon, the widow will hold a big wedding

441
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,280
If the master has not returned to the future by then

442
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,640
I hope Master can come and visit me

443
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,800
Marry? Who are you marrying?

444
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,560
It doesn't matter who you marry

445
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,680
Wedding is just a gesture, a formality

446
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,480
All subjects of the world

447
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,240
You can choose the woman you like

448
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,920
Only the king cannot

449
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,640
Therefore, Master, we must cherish the people in front of us.

450
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,560
Because Master, you still have a choice

451
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,280
Pay homage

452
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,400
former king

453
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,800
My late king, I am ashamed of myself.

454
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,800
I failed to defend my ancestors’ legacy and begged the king to punish me.

455
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,200
This is the ancestral instruction written by the late king himself

456
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,720
If etiquette is not shown, discipline will be weak.

457
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:48,240
The humble minister is willing to die as a remonstrance and begs the king to cancel the wedding.

458
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,280
Since Prime Minister Yang wants to die

459
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,960
I will help you and give you a death

460
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,200
King

461
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,440
beheaded

462
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,000
Take orders

463
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,800
Here comes the king

464
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,280
If rituals and music break down, they will be punished by heaven and bring about their own destruction.

465
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:21,360
Suicide, O king...

466
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,000
Pay homage

467
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,920
This imperial star is particularly bright tonight

468
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,240
It seems that Qin's fortune will become stronger and stronger.

469
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,000
It is destined that the king has grown up now

470
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,440
He is really the same as history

471
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,200
Has become Qin Shihuang

472
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,200
He kills people now without batting an eyelid

473
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,920
He really became a tyrant

474
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,240
History is a foregone conclusion

475
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:39,560
Even you and I can't change it

476
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,400
But I think it was caused by me

477
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,120
If I hadn't forced him to become the king

478
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,200
He will never become like this

479
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,560
Brother Xiang, things are beyond your control

480
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,400
It’s no use thinking too much

481
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,240
It's better to focus on things you can control.

482
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,760
When you concentrate on tapping copper wire to capture electricity

483
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,520
Qing'er didn't give up

484
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,920
Have been experimenting with how to refine sulfuric acid

485
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,720
Is she still looking?

486
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,040
Although she knows you want to leave

487
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,640
She couldn't bear it in her heart

488
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,080
But I still try my best to help you

489
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:29,480
Shaolong, have you ever remembered this intention in your heart?

490
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,880
What's up?

491
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,920
Qing'er is doing experiments

492
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,440
I wonder if something happened?

493
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,600
Qinqing

494
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,240
Qinqing, wake up...
