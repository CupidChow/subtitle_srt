1
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,400
Lu Buwei, come out

2
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,760
Xiang Shaolong, please don’t be rude in the Prime Minister’s Mansion.

3
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,440
Who killed the princess?

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,600
What does the death of the princess have to do with the truth?

5
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,360
Let me ask you, is the princess missing here?

6
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,680
So what? If not, so what?

7
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,960
I don't care if you are or not, but I must do it anyway

8
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,320
Find out who killed the princess Big Brother…

9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,360
Xiang Shaolong

10
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,760
How can you be allowed to be so presumptuous in Prime Minister Lu's Mansion?

11
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,600
If you don't leave again

12
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,440
Don't blame me for being rude

13
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,840
OK, come on

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,400
Brother, can you calm down?

15
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,360
It doesn't help that you are so impulsive.

16
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,360
You didn't find out clearly either

17
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,960
Maybe it really has nothing to do with the people in the prime minister's house?

18
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,120
Brother, think twice

19
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,240
Princess, don't worry

20
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,400
I will definitely not let you marry to Wei State

21
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,240
you have a fever

22
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,600
It's okay, keep walking

23
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,360
I have carried this peace charm with me since I was a child.

24
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,080
Always safe and sound

25
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,000
Now I give it to you

26
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,200
hope it will bless you

27
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,200
Why such a simple promise?

28
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,440
I can't do it either?

29
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,240
I can't even give you a little happiness

30
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
sorry

31
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,120
The villain is outside the Prime Minister's Mansion

32
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,520
I waited for two whole hours

33
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,320
The longer I wait, the more inappropriate it becomes.

34
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,080
So I boldly stepped forward and asked the servants of the Lu family.

35
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,720
This incident alarmed Miss Lu

36
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,160
Later she came out and said to the villain

37
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,160
It is said that the princess has left the Prime Minister's Mansion for more than an hour

38
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,200
After this incident, I also asked Miss Lu

39
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,360
According to Miss Lu, because the princess knew the way, she left

40
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,400
So in the end

41
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,720
Miss Lu did not see the princess out the door either.

42
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,760
That is to say

43
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,400
You didn't see the princess leave Lu Mansion with your own eyes

44
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,360
Yes, but because the princess said to the villain

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,360
She just went back to the Prime Minister's Mansion with Miss Lu to pick up some items

46
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,680
Won't stay there long

47
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,600
Tell the villain not to leave

48
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,480
So the villain has been waiting at the main entrance.

49
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,920
But if the princess leaves through the back door

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,720
The villain is unknown

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm tired

52
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,400
The villain resigns

53
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,480
Brother Xiang, how could the princess act rashly?

54
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,040
How about leaving through the back door of the Prime Minister's Mansion?

55
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,640
There is only one possibility

56
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,960
It’s just that the princess is unwilling to

57
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,440
taken away

58
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,440
What is the relationship between Lu Niangrong and Lu Buwei?

59
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,360
Brother, I absolutely believe in the death of the princess

60
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,680
It has nothing to do with Miss Lu

61
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,440
I'm not doubting Miss Lu

62
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,480
I'm just worried that she's trying to protect someone

63
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,680
That's why I lied

64
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,920
Brother, are you afraid that Miss Lu will defend Lu Buwei?

65
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,840
Now we have to find out who is the murderer

66
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,120
We need to figure out two things first

67
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,880
First, who wants to kill the princess?

68
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,880
Second, where did the princess get into trouble?

69
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,560
Brother, didn’t the princess drown?

70
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,560
That's just where the body was found.

71
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,520
I once examined the body of the princess

72
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,400
I found signs of strangulation on her neck

73
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,240
In other words, there are three possibilities

74
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,240
First, the princess was strangled to death somewhere unknown.

75
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,640
Then throw it into the river

76
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,000
Second, the princess was strangled to death in Lu Mansion

77
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,040
Then throw the body into the river

78
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,800
Third, the princess was really killed by someone on the riverside

79
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,480
Then throw it into the river

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,760
But if the princess really leaves the Prime Minister's Mansion, then something goes wrong

81
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,080
It will be difficult for us to find the real murderer

82
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,440
you are right

83
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,720
So we need to figure out two things

84
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,880
First, did Lu Niangrong lie?

85
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,720
Second, whether the princess is unwilling to

86
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,680
Being taken away from Lu Mansion

87
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,800
Who is so bold

88
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,080
How dare you kidnap the princess in the Lu Mansion?

89
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,360
I'm only sure of one thing now

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,240
It means that something must have happened to the princess in Lu Mansion.

91
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,760
What? Taifu Xiang, you want the king to issue an order

92
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,760
So that you can go to the Prime Minister's house to conduct a search?

93
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,840
i know i do

94
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,880
Prime Minister Lu might be very unhappy

95
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,800
But no matter what, I must find out

96
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,960
Who killed the princess?

97
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,240
Father, when Zheng'er was a hostage in the State of Zhao that day,

98
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,160
The princess was once kind to Zheng'er

99
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,240
Now the princess is tragically killed by an adulterer

100
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,880
I should wait to clear the princess's wrongdoing.

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,040
Yes, but…

102
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,320
Zheng'er absolutely believes that Prime Minister Lu is a sensible person

103
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,120
There will definitely be no objection, right, Prime Minister Lu?

104
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,040
Taifu Xiang lost his beloved

105
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Of course I can understand the pain.

106
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,960
However, Wei Chen is an important official of the imperial court.

107
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,960
Now, others are allowed to search the house

108
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,240
If this matter spreads, where will I lose my face?

109
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,400
What Prime Minister Lu said is true

110
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,080
Taifu Xiang... King

111
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
I wonder if you still remember

112
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,120
You promised Xiang Shaolong that day

113
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,080
You said if I find Zhao Mu and come back

114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,520
You will be greatly rewarded

115
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,880
I don’t know if this sentence still holds true?

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,680
The lonely king has opened his mouth, of course he will not go back on his words

117
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,000
All you need is the words of the king.

118
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,240
Now Xiang Shaolong hopes

119
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,920
You can search Prime Minister Lu’s residence

120
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,320
Consider it that day’s reward

121
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,160
Your Majesty, I know that this search of Prime Minister Lu’s Mansion

122
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,000
It will cause him a lot of inconvenience

123
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,400
Xiang Shaolong promises you

124
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,040
If I check this matter it has nothing to do with you

125
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,640
I will apologize to you in public

126
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,680
What Taifu Xiang said is extremely reasonable

127
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,440
I wonder what Prime Minister Lu wants?

128
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,320
Since the king and prince think this is harmless,

129
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,080
Wei Chen has nothing to say

130
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,840
But if Mr. Xiang has two meals every three days,

131
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,320
Came to Lu Mansion to search east and west

132
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,320
Isn’t it true that a humble minister will never have peace?

133
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,160
What Prime Minister Lu said is true

134
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,280
Taifu Xiang, the lonely king now grants you a three-day period

135
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,000
Search the Prime Minister's house

136
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,880
Once the three-day period is over, no matter what the outcome is

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,920
No one is allowed to make any harassment in the Prime Minister's house.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,160
I still remember that the princess had just completed her wedding dress that day

139
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,160
But I found that I didn’t have any suitable accessories

140
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,520
So I took the princess back to the Prime Minister's Mansion

141
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,240
I plan to help her choose one or two suitable accessories.

142
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,880
before the princess leaves

143
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,280
I also gave her a rabbit

144
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,240
Because I have to help dad greet the guests

145
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,640
Plus the princess said she knew the way out

146
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,000
So I didn’t send her out.

147
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,640
Apparently there was a larger flower pot here before

148
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,160
Why is there a rabbit here?

149
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,320
have a look

150
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,080
I gave this rabbit to the princess that day

151
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,320
How are you so sure

152
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,640
Did you give her this rabbit?

153
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,760
There is a red mark on its foot

154
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,680
yes

155
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,680
Miss Lu

156
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,800
I wonder if you would mind cooperating with me

157
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,960
I want to call everyone up and down the Lu family.

158
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,400
I want everyone to be able to prove it

159
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,560
There was alibi at the time

160
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
I have followed my brother's instructions

161
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,040
He Jingjun checked everyone in the Lu family.

162
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,640
On the day of the princess' accident

163
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,240
It starts from the moment the princess steps into Lu Mansion

164
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,560
Until the two hours when the princess disappeared

165
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,640
There are eight people in total who cannot be proven

166
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
Are they in Lu Mansion?

167
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,160
Who is included?

168
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,880
Except for a few Lu family generals, maids and Lao Ai

169
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,680
Also includes Miss Lu

170
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,160
The villain heard Xiang Shaolong say to the Prime Minister

171
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,040
Search each room one by one

172
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,520
So the prime minister ordered the villain to come and inform

173
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,080
Tell me to stay in the Prime Minister's Mansion and not go out.

174
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,920
Okay, it's none of your business, go out

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,880
yes

176
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,200
Isn’t that right? Xiang Shaolong

177
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,960
What do you think of Lu Mansion?

178
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,320
I miss you because the princess died unexpectedly

179
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,920
You keep searching the Prime Minister's Mansion

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,480
You can search the truth

181
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,200
Now you even want to search my daughter’s boudoir

182
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,520
Mr. Lu, please don’t get angry.

183
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,320
I sent someone to notify Mr. Lu yesterday.

184
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,000
Because there were eight people in your prime minister's house at that time

185
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,080
It is impossible to provide evidence of alibi

186
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,400
That's why we wanted to search again

187
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,440
Ling Qianjin happened to be one of these eight people

188
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,440
Damn it, anyone’s room can be searched

189
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,880
My daughter's boudoir is absolutely not allowed to be searched.

190
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,360
Dad, my daughter doesn’t have any hidden secrets.

191
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,840
Just let them search it

192
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,040
What's more, it has now been confirmed

193
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,040
The princess disappeared in our Prime Minister's Mansion

194
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,200
My daughter also wants to help Mr. Xiang

195
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,920
Find out why the princess disappeared

196
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,320
Ronger

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,800
Prime Minister

198
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,080
Could you please allow me to have a few words with Mr. Xiang?

199
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,440
OK, you say

200
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,320
It turned out that Taifu Xiang wanted to find out the cause of the princess's death.

201
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,480
And there is nothing wrong with searching the prime minister's house.

202
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,080
But there's always something in my heart that I don't quite understand

203
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,120
Why is Taifu Xiang so sure of the person who killed the princess?

204
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,960
He's from the Prime Minister's Mansion

205
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,920
The princess was killed in the Prime Minister's Mansion

206
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,400
Of course it was someone from the Prime Minister's Mansion who did it.

207
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,000
If I remember correctly

208
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,000
The reason why Taifu Xiang is so sure

209
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,680
The person who killed the princess was from the prime minister's house

210
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,360
It is based on the confession of a coachman in Taifu Xiang's house.

211
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,760
Good, because he can provide

212
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,000
After the princess entered the Prime Minister's Mansion,

213
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,520
No evidence has ever come out

214
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,880
Why are you so sure this person is not lying?

215
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,880
Want to know if what this person says is true

216
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,240
Just ask him if he has any alibi for that day and we will know.

217
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,640
He has been waiting outside the Prime Minister's Mansion

218
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,280
How could there be any alibi?

219
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,000
yes

220
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,800
The villain has been waiting outside the Prime Minister's Mansion that day

221
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,800
never left

222
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,600
Are there any witnesses who can prove this to you?

223
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,320
No

224
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,280
There is no evidence or evidence, whatever you say is fine

225
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,560
I can also tell you that day

226
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,400
Killed the princess while escorting her

227
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,720
Tutor, I have never done such a thing

228
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,480
This concentric knot

229
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,000
It was after the princess came to the Prime Minister's Mansion that day

230
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,560
I gave it to the princess

231
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,040
But you actually found it in the carriage carriage

232
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,560
This proves that the princess should have been on the carriage

233
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,320
you say

234
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,920
If you didn't kill the princess, who would it be?

235
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,640
He's not a villain... He's still making excuses

236
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,680
enough

237
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,160
He must be interested in sex

238
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,560
Intention to be rude to the princess

239
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,400
Unexpectedly, the princess refused to submit, so he killed the princess

240
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,960
No...I didn't

241
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,440
I'm going to kill you, stop it

242
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,120
The so-called family has family rules, and the state has state laws.

243
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,360
You cannot abuse lynching

244
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,800
I can assure you

245
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,240
I will put this person in jail first

246
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,160
Then deal with it according to law

247
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,920
The villain has already followed my grandpa’s instructions.

248
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,560
I bribed the jailer, I guarantee that

249
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,240
That coachman will never survive tonight

250
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,440
You're sure no one saw you move that thing

251
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,680
Put it in Xiang Mansion's carriage

252
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,640
Please rest assured, uncle

253
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,360
The villain is always cautious when doing things.

254
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,040
your

255
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,600
Uncle, I don’t know…

256
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,480
Too little?

257
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,440
I don’t dare, but...

258
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,880
Uncle, you also know that after this incident

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,600
I'm afraid I can't stay in Xianyang anymore.

260
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,240
So the villain hopes

261
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,400
The adults can give more rewards to the villains

262
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,600
So that the villain can have enough panchuan to leave Xianyang

263
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,200
That's right, the so-called man-made thing is to the end

264
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,760
I might as well send you on your way.

265
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,800
When can I go back?

266
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,880
Do I have to wait until the day Ying Zheng ascends the throne before I can go back?

267
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,240
stay here any longer

268
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,240
I don’t know what else will happen.

269
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,440
What if I hurt someone again...

270
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,640
I didn't expect such a simple gravel road

271
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,440
Every morning I walk on it for half an hour

272
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,920
The effect is so magical

273
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,760
Taifu Xiang is really a strange person

274
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,320
By the way, has Taifu Xiang been in a calm mood these past two days?

275
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,720
The lonely king never expected that he would be so infatuated with the princess

276
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,640
He just told the lonely king this morning

277
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,560
To resign from the post of Chief of the Imperial Guard

278
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,960
Really? The position of captain of the imperial guard comes with great responsibility.

279
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
It is not suitable to leave it empty for a long time

280
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,880
By the way, Your Majesty, do you remember?

281
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,400
Zhu Ji mentioned a suitable candidate to you last time

282
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,320
Thank you for your respect, Prime Minister

283
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,800
If he had a chance,

284
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,680
Lao Ai will definitely repay the Prime Minister for his promotion.

285
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,400
Promotion? What virtue and ability are there?

286
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,280
On young and promising people

287
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,880
The truth can never catch up with you, Lao Ai.

288
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,720
The Prime Minister is serious

289
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,600
If not

290
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,160
Why would the noble lady be in front of the king?

291
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,200
I highly recommend you to take up the position of Chief of the Imperial Guard.

292
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,960
Madam Huagui did this

293
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,400
It's all for your sake, Mr. Xiang.

294
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,560
No matter what, now you can move up

295
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,880
You must seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

296
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,800
Don't fall down accidentally

297
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,080
Disappointing the truth

298
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Thank you for your concern, Mr.

299
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,680
You should remember it well

300
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,040
A kite, no matter how high or far it flies

301
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,760
There is always a thread pulling

302
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,240
As long as the line is closed

303
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,000
That kite can be torn down at any time

304
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,200
The prime minister’s golden words

305
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,400
Lao Ai will definitely remember it in my heart

306
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,000
The water in Canglang is so clear that I can wash my tassel

307
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,760
The water in Canglang is turbid, you can wash my feet

308
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,800
prince

309
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,120
What's the matter?

310
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,600
Those lines of poetry that Li Si just read

311
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,160
Does the prince understand the meaning?

312
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,120
You haven't explained it in detail yet

313
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,280
How could this prince understand?

314
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,240
yes

315
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,480
The poems just now were written by Qu Yuan, a poet from the State of Chu.

316
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,240
It means when the water is clear

317
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,120
We can use it to clean clothes and hats

318
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,360
When the water is turbid

319
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,200
We can only use it to clean our feet

320
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,320
Of course, do you need to use sewage to wash your face?

321
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,440
In other words, the same goes for being a human being

322
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,440
How do you want others to see you?

323
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,920
First of all, it depends on what kind of person you are

324
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,520
If you are a person of high moral character and respect,

325
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,080
Others will naturally flock to you

326
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,800
If you are a notorious person

327
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,480
Others will just avoid it

328
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,400
No wonder I'm so afraid of seeing you

329
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,800
Ask the prince for advice

330
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,040
Nothing, continue

331
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,880
yes

332
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,720
But how to become a highly respected person

333
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,920
Long live the prince

334
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,600
Lao Ai? It would be nice to see you

335
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,880
This prince is practicing a new set of sword skills

336
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,560
I wonder, Lao Ai, if you can give me some advice?

337
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,360
Madam, are you okay?

338
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,160
fine

339
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,960
By the way, Zheng'er

340
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,800
Why are you practicing swordsmanship with Lao Guard Chief here?

341
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,840
Mom, you don’t know something

342
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,120
Since the death of the princess, Taifu Xiang has lived in seclusion.

343
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,720
I haven’t entered the palace for several days in a row.

344
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,640
No one accompanies Zheng'er to practice sword practice

345
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,120
Zheng'er studies every day and is really bored to death.

346
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,000
Fortunately, I just met Lao Ai

347
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,320
Zheng'er asked him to practice sword practice with me.

348
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,400
If Zheng'er likes it

349
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,200
You can ask Lao, the captain of the guard, to take time out to practice sword practice with you every day.

350
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,080
To prevent Zheng'er from becoming unfamiliar with his sword skills

351
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,520
Thanks to my wife, I am promoted in front of the king.

352
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,360
I can't thank you enough for this humiliation.

353
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,920
I thought that after Lao Ai became the chief guard of the inner court,

354
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,800
I have forgotten this palace

355
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,680
How could it be? It’s just that the palace is troubled by affairs

356
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
I need to find an opportunity to express my gratitude to my wife.

357
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,680
It's not easy

358
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,000
If you are willing, you will naturally find opportunities.

359
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,040
May the king be blessed

360
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,960
King

361
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,040
Listen to Zheng'er, Madam, you are feeling ill

362
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,800
Is there something happening?

363
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,360
The king takes care of everything

364
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,680
How could he care whether Zhu Ji was ill?

365
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,120
Do you need the lonely king to summon an imperial doctor for you?

366
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,760
If the king really cares about Zhu Ji

367
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,280
You shouldn't just focus on taking care of government affairs all day long

368
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,560
and ignore others

369
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,600
How could the lonely king ignore you?

370
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,040
But there are really a lot of things going on between North Korea and China these days.

371
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,000
It needs to be handled by the lonely king, so...

372
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,640
Zhu Ji doesn’t care, Zhu Ji wants the king tomorrow

373
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,360
Accompanying others to Lishan Hot Spring

374
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,480
Going to Lishan Hot Spring tomorrow?

375
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,640
In fact, Zhu Ji also knew that she was talking nonsense.

376
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,960
How could the king abandon the government?

377
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,000
How about accompanying someone to a hot spring bath?

378
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,840
Madam, don’t you intend to embarrass the lonely king?

379
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,840
Your Majesty, since Zhu Ji returned to Xianyang

380
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,040
I have never left Qin Palace even half a step

381
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,360
People really hope

382
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,480
It can be like being in Zhao State back then

383
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,200
Go to the mountain with the king

384
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,360
Look at the scenery and soak in the hot springs

385
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,000
The lonely king really can’t leave

386
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,560
Well, Zheng'er grew up in the State of Zhao since he was a child.

387
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,040
I have never appreciated the scenery of Qin’s lakes and mountains.

388
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,840
Well, this time the lonely king will ask Zheng'er to accompany his wife

389
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,480
How about a trip to Lishan Hot Spring?

390
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,040
Zhu Ji wants the king, not Zheng'er

391
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,640
But the lonely king is indeed involved in political affairs

392
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,600
King Gu promises you

393
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,600
This time, Zheng'er will accompany my wife.

394
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,440
Next time, the lonely king will definitely accompany his wife in person

395
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,240
Is this okay?

396
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,440
What does the king say, okay?

397
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,680
Talk, why don't you talk?

398
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,560
Do you remember the princess? Me too

399
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,040
Brother, this is for you

400
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,960
rabbit?

401
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,400
I see you, this rabbit, all alone

402
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,720
So buy one to accompany it

403
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Brother...look what I brought to you?

404
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,320
Jun, you too...

405
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,920
Second brother, you also bought a rabbit?

406
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,960
If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have had to buy it.

407
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,040
Now there is one more

408
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,120
I understand how you two feel about me

409
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
I'm fine

410
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,800
master

411
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,840
prince…

412
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,200
Did you buy a rabbit too?

413
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,120
What rabbit?

414
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,320
nothing

415
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,800
Master, do you have anything special to do tomorrow?

416
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,040
No

417
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,160
That's good

418
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,760
Zheng'er plans to go to Lishan Hot Spring with her mother

419
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,440
I want Master to go with me

420
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,600
No need to go, you go and have fun

421
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,600
Ask the captain of the guard to personally escort me and the prince up the mountain

422
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,760
I'm really sorry

423
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,200
Protect the noble lady and the prince

424
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,880
It's a matter of humble duty

425
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,280
Mom, what should we do today?

426
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,440
This place is famous for its hot springs

427
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,120
Of course we came here to soak in the hot springs

428
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,040
But you can’t soak in a hot spring for a whole day.

429
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,720
I heard that there are many rare birds and animals in Lishan area

430
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,520
If Wang Zizheng is interested,

431
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,480
My humble job can accompany you to the mountains for hunting.

432
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,440
I'll go ahead and take care of everything

433
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,160
Madam Huagui, do you need some fragrant flowers?

434
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,240
I'm not in the mood, please leave first

435
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,920
Yes, ma’am…

436
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,920
Zhao Gao

437
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,640
The slave is here

438
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,480
Go and wait for the prince to take a bath and rest

439
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,120
The slave obeys the order

440
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,520
Prince, please

441
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,760
Before it gets dark

442
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I want to take a hot spring bath again

443
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,520
Madam, would you like to serve as an escort for me?

444
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,400
Then I'll have to thank the captain of the bodyguard.

445
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
How long do you have to wait for the lonely king?

446
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,080
Your Majesty, please wait patiently.

447
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,520
Anyway, Hu Ji promises

448
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,720
There will definitely be a good show for your Majesty to watch

449
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,000
Why did the captain of the guard stop?

450
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,440
As the saying goes, there are differences between men and women. I’m afraid it’s not appropriate to advance in a humble position.

451
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
You won’t escort me in

452
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,680
If there is an assassin inside

453
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Isn't this palace very dangerous?

454
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,240
How could there be an assassin in the hot spring?

455
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,720
If there is a beast inside

456
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,600
Aren't you afraid that the beast will eat me?

457
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,040
If Madam insists

458
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,560
That humble duty is only to obey orders

459
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,840
The slave has something to report

460
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,160
Come in

461
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,680
Why are you so late?

462
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,120
Please forgive me, Mrs. Xiuli

463
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,160
As soon as the servant saw Mrs. Huagui and Lao Ai,

464
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,320
After entering the hot spring, I will inform you immediately.

465
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,400
What did you say?

466
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,280
Just tell the king what you see.

467
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,880
Yes, report to the king

468
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,240
The servant saw Madam Huagui and Lao Ai with his own eyes

469
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,840
Both enter the hot spring

470
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,840
The hot spring water is slippery, Lao's head guard

471
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,600
Are you interested in coming down and giving it a try?

472
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,480
Madam, why is this necessary?

473
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,240
Why is it that Lao's guard captain looks like two different people?

474
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,120
Could it be that in the eyes of Lao's head guard?

475
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,640
Is this palace dismissive?

476
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,080
Of course not, Madam in my mind

477
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,600
It is simply the beauty of heaven and country, as beautiful as a flower

478
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,160
It's a pity...

479
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,800
I ask you again, can you come down?

480
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,960
See the king...

481
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,880
See the king...

482
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,760
go away

483
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,760
Your Majesty, why are you here suddenly?

484
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,960
Where is Lao Ai?

485
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,720
Lao Ai? I don’t quite understand, Your Majesty.

486
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,680
Someone saw Lao Ai coming in

487
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,000
If the king thinks that my concubine and Lao Ai are having an affair,

488
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,480
Okay, please search here

489
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,440
See if Lao Ai is there?

490
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,000
If the king still doesn’t believe it

491
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,280
Zhu Ji can die to prove her innocence

492
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,440
Madam, why is this necessary?

493
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,960
lady…

494
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,960
Madam, please listen to the lonely king's explanation first.

495
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,040
May the king be blessed

496
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,280
Why is my father here?

497
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,360
And mother and father...

498
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,720
It's all the fault of that beautiful lady

499
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,600
lady…

500
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,280
Mother, madam…

501
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,800
lady…

502
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,960
Madam, would you please listen to the lonely king first? Madam

503
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,400
Please ask the king to grant Zhu Ji a death

504
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,840
Madam, get up first...

505
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,120
Otherwise, please ask the king to demote Zhu Ji to a commoner

506
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,080
This... why is this necessary? Madam

507
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,720
Zhu Ji comes back to Xianyang this time

508
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,440
Being gossiped about behind my back all the time

509
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,880
To avoid embarrassing the king again

510
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,920
The king should expel Zhu Ji from the palace as soon as possible.

511
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,360
Madam, you get up first, get up... and then talk after you get up

512
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,560
Yes, it’s all because the lonely king was confused for a moment

513
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,360
Listen to that beautiful lady's slander

514
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,240
Okay, Gu Wang now promises you

515
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,440
There won't be a next time

516
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Mrs. Xiuli has always hated Zhu Ji deeply.

517
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,120
If the king wants to keep Zhu Ji by your side

518
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,240
It will only make Mrs. Xiuli more unhappy

519
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,000
Zhu Ji’s days will be even more miserable in the future.

520
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,560
It's all that bitch's fault

521
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,000
All he does is spread rumors and stir up trouble all day long, just for fear that the world will not be in chaos.

522
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,400
Okay, the lonely king will banish her to the cold palace

523
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,360
Madam, you should be satisfied with this, right?

524
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,120
Lao Ai, you have too many good things to do

525
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
I don't quite understand what madam means

526
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,880
I want to ask you, last time I was at Lishan Hot Spring

527
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,760
How did you know that Lady Xiuli would bring the king here?

528
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,440
It's actually very simple

529
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,920
Madam Xiuli has always been targeting you, madam.

530
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
If she knew

531
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,040
The lady has a tryst with her lover in Lishan Hot Spring

532
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,960
She will definitely bring the king here to catch the traitor

533
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,560
In other words

534
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,520
Did you arrange everything secretly?

535
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,560
so to speak

536
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,720
You are so bold, you even kept me in the dark

537
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,280
actually i do this

538
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,240
It’s just for the sake of my wife and Wang Zizheng’s future plans

539
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,120
What does this matter have to do with Zheng'er?

540
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,880
The king has now put Lady Xiuli into the cold palace

541
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,000
in other words

542
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,040
Now only you, my wife, are left with the king

543
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,720
As long as Madam’s power is consolidated in the future,

544
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,200
Wang Zizheng's chance of becoming the crown prince

545
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,960
It will definitely be greatly improved

546
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,920
I think back then, Lu Buwei’s magic trick could make a living

547
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,320
Today, Lao Ai, you are repeating your old tricks

548
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,400
Just for profit

549
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,440
Even this palace is included in your calculations

550
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,000
Humans are not like vegetation, my wife’s feelings towards me

551
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,600
How could I not know?

552
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,800
But what I hope for is not an overnight happiness

553
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,480
But forever

554
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,600
Madam please believe me

555
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,400
everything i did today

556
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,680
It’s nothing more than paving the way for us in the future

557
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,720
One day, Madam will definitely get her wish

558
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,240
It's a pity that Zhu Ji doesn't know when

559
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,440
Only then can we wait until this day

560
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,200
If two people are in love with each other, how can they live together day and night?

561
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,880
Xiaoqian, the promise you and I made before

562
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,640
I can't achieve it

563
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,240
Now I can do it

564
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,040
Just give you a name

565
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,040
You will always be my wife, Xiang Shaolong, from now on

566
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,720
Are you back in Xianyang?

567
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,920
My godfather and I are back in Xianyang this time

568
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,360
I want to ask you clearly

569
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,360
What happened in Zhao State last time

570
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,400
I didn’t expect to hear the news of Princess Zhao Qian’s death.

571
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,120
So come and see

572
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,880
If I hadn't left her alone in Xianyang

573
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,600
Or what if...

574
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,080
If I didn’t go back to Zhao country

575
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,320
Maybe the princess won’t die

576
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,160
If everything could predict the outcome

577
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,200
As long as you are alive, there is no joy, anger or sorrow.

578
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,040
The font on the tombstone is so weird

579
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,600
I only understand that it is the tomb of Zhao Qian

580
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,360
But those two words before were...

581
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,640
Is my beloved wife

582
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,640
Are you married to the princess?

583
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,240
if it weren't for me

584
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,920
The princess wouldn't do this

585
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,080
Although she is gone now

586
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,120
But I still want to give her a name

587
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,600
you do it out of guilt

588
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,000
So after her death

589
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,760
Do you still want to give her a title?

590
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,200
I owe her so much

591
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,120
The princess knows you did this to her

592
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,480
She has knowledge under the spring, which will definitely comfort her

593
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,480
I believe everyone who cares about you

594
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,880
I don’t want to see you so depressed

595
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,880
Do you know if it weren't for me

596
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,880
The princess wouldn't do this

597
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,880
Lady Ya is like this, and the princess is like this

598
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,440
Now I don’t even know where Tingfang is.

599
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,200
please teach me

600
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,000
How do I get back on my feet?

601
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,800
Great...have porridge to eat...

602
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,680
Be obedient and line them up one by one.

603
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,440
Don't push me, it was me first

604
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,200
Dumb uncle, making porridge again?

605
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,720
It's so thin, these kids won't be able to get enough to eat

606
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,080
I'm so hungry. Hurry up.

607
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,920
I'm so hungry

608
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,120
Locusts are causing famine recently

609
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,400
We are running low on rice grains

610
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,800
I just have to cook some gruel to survive for a few more days.

611
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,600
I'm afraid I won't have anything to eat the day after tomorrow.

612
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,720
I can only make some wild vegetable soup

613
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,800
Those children can't go hungry

614
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,840
Let's share the porridge between the three of us among them.

615
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,280
We eat wild vegetables

616
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,440
After solving this meal, there will be another meal

617
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,000
Being hungry for a long time is not a long-term solution

618
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,080
But the corrupt officials in the town refused to open warehouses to provide disaster relief

619
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,560
Also colluding with grain merchants

620
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,000
Nowadays, even if you have money, you can’t buy food

621
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,880
It seems that for these children

622
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,240
To make a moneyless transaction

623
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,960
Beautiful face and beautiful face

624
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,680
It can only be appreciated by those who can afford it.

625
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,280
The old rule is, the one with the highest price gets it

626
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,080
Xu Erniang, you are doing your old tricks again

627
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,960
Looking for a pheasant to pretend to be a phoenix?

628
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,560
Lord County Governor, why do you say this?

629
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,040
A girl who was taught by me, Xu Erniang

630
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,520
Which one is not a pheasant turning into a phoenix?

631
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,360
Otherwise, sir, you wouldn’t come here often, would you?

632
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,680
In short, you have to look at the goods first and then set the price.

633
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,480
Bid first and see the goods later

634
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,520
Just let me see what it is?

635
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,960
This gentleman is really rude

636
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,840
She is indeed a beauty

637
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,880
Xu Erniang, I will pay five taels of gold

638
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,480
Okay... who else can offer a higher price?

639
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,440
I'll pay ten taels of gold

640
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,040
Who else offers a high price?

641
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,480
I'll pay eleven liang

642
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,680
I'll pay fifteen taels

643
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,800
twenty taels of gold

644
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,880
Twenty taels? So much...

645
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,720
transfer

646
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,160
Beauty, you belong to me tonight

647
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,560
Wait a minute, I'll pay you forty taels of gold

648
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,200
OK…

649
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,680
Forty taels per night? I’m afraid my life span will be shortened if I get it.

650
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,760
Come on...

651
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,720
It's a long night, why be in such a hurry?

652
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,800
It's really boring to have a few drinks with me first.

653
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,840
Yes...have a few drinks first, come...

654
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,880
No, I'll just feed you something to drink

655
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,640
Yes... well-informed

656
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,760
After only three drinks, my sincerity will be reduced. I still have two glasses.

657
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,360
OK…

658
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,080
I drink…

659
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,880
What are you doing?

660
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,040
I want to help you undress

661
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,680
It turns out you are more anxious than me

662
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,840
I'll help you undress, come on...

663
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,400
Wait a minute, you can catch me even if you're blindfolded

664
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,320
Just punish me by taking off my clothes first

665
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,680
If you can figure it out, it's interesting...come on...

666
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,240
Don't go too far, I will definitely catch you

667
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,040
can start

668
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,720
I am coming

669
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,440
I'm here

670
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,840
Where you are, don't leave

671
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,480
You bitch, I spent forty taels to buy you back.

672
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,800
Do you want to leave? It’s not that cheap

673
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,560
Uncle, don't do this, uncle

674
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,640
Take your time, uncle, don't do it

675
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,920
Let me go, uncle, don't do this

676
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Sir...are you okay?

677
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,960
adult…

678
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,520
Is he dead?

679
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,320
Sir...are you okay?

680
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,080
Sir, please don't be rude. I won't let you go.

681
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,640
How about, are you okay?

682
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,320
I didn't want to kill him, but he...

683
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,840
You are right, this corrupt official

684
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,960
Just care about spending money for your own pleasure

685
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,000
Locking up rice grains and refusing to open warehouses for disaster relief

686
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,560
Regardless of the life and death of the people, they should have been killed long ago

687
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,680
Before anyone finds out, we

688
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,480
We need to open a rice warehouse as soon as possible, come

689
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,680
I want it...

690
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,280
Don't pour rice on the ground

691
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,320
Do you know?

692
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,080
Sister Tingfang took a big risk

693
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,680
Just brought this rice back

694
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,360
The most important thing is

695
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,480
Every grain of rice is cultivated by farmers with hard work

696
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,440
You can't just waste it, you know?

697
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,440
we must cherish them

698
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,040
Shall we pick it up one by one?

699
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,000
good…

700
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,160
Bland, just pastries here and there

701
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,200
Throw it out, yes

702
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,280
The prince may not know something

703
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,880
There is famine in many places now

704
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,240
Ordinary people don’t even have enough to eat.

705
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,560
If the prince wastes food like this

706
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,680
It is really against heaven's morality and will be punished by heaven.

707
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,440
The prince once experienced hardship among the people

708
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,800
You should know how to cherish food

709
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,080
Take these pastries to the kitchen first

710
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,200
When I'm hungry, I won't choose what to eat

711
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,320
The slave obeys the order

712
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,720
It's rare for a prince to listen to what a villain says

713
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,000
The villain dares to say something more

714
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,480
OK, you say

715
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,680
The prince usually likes to read military books and appreciates the way to strengthen the army.

716
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,040
But we know that to strengthen the army, one must first enrich the country

717
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,760
Rich countries must focus on farming, otherwise they will encounter years of famine

718
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,880
Do we want soldiers to fight on an empty stomach?

719
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,400
This is the reason why villains often say that agriculture is used to raise soldiers.

720
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,600
Li Si, you are full of talent and learning

721
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,760
Now I am just a little Langguan, studying with me

722
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,640
Isn’t it too unfair to you?

723
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,840
The villain doesn't hide anything from the prince

724
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,880
Li Si does have difficulty expressing his ambitions

725
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,560
But in such a situation, there is nothing you can do

726
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,840
Let me recommend it to my father

727
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,840
Let you be a counselor or an official

728
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,360
Li Si thanked the prince for his kindness.

729
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,600
But the prince thought too simply

730
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Now the king is surrounded by people from Prime Minister Lu

731
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,320
There is no place for others to interfere

732
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,640
Unless the prince becomes a prince one day

733
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,320
It is inconvenient for Mr. Lu to object to the person recommended by the prince.

734
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,800
OK, I promise you

735
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,200
If I become the prince one day, I will definitely promote him

736
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,560
Thank you Prince
