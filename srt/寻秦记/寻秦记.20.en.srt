1
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,800
madam, please

2
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,640
Prime Minister Lu really misses the past

3
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,800
Various decorations in the Prime Minister's Mansion

4
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,360
They are exactly the same as the old residence in Handan

5
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,000
Madam laughed

6
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,760
It’s just that Lu Buwei remains unchanged.

7
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,280
Someone coming

8
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,360
Yes, Mr. Xiang...

9
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Not even taking my wife and Wang Zizheng with me

10
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,040
Go into the wing and take a rest.

11
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,240
Yes, Mr. Xiang...

12
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,920
madam, please

13
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,840
Wang Zizheng, please

14
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,920
Lord of Uborg

15
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,960
exist

16
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,560
This time I really owe you a favor

17
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Prime Minister's words are serious, in fact, we can succeed this time

18
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,240
All thanks to Xiang Shaoxia’s contribution

19
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,400
It is my duty to help Mr. Lu

20
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,360
The useful princess will go to the villa to rest first

21
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,880
After Lu Buwei leads Mr. Xiang to meet the king,

22
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,840
Let’s make other arrangements for the princess and Mr. Xiang.

23
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,000
Mr. Lu, we all listen to you

24
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,040
Prime Minister

25
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,280
Come in

26
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,640
Mr. Lu

27
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,400
Mr. Lu

28
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,080
lady

29
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,280
Zhu Ji misses you so much. Zhu Ji doesn’t want to go back to the palace.

30
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,480
How then?

31
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,760
Zhu Ji waited for more than ten years to see Master Lu again

32
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,920
Zhu Ji doesn’t want to leave Master Lu anymore

33
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,040
Zhu Ji…Mrs.

34
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,040
Madam, please listen to what Lu Buwei has to say.

35
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,480
Madam, please don't forget

36
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,600
The king is in the palace now

37
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,280
Waiting for the reunion of Madam and Wang Zizheng

38
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,000
Could it be that in the past ten years?

39
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,400
Mr. Lu really doesn’t miss Zhu Ji at all.

40
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,960
If Lu Buwei doesn’t miss his wife at all

41
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,520
How could he be so anxious to rescue his wife, mother and son and return them to China?

42
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,880
It’s just...not what it used to be

43
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,280
Now the lady is the person beside the king

44
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,080
You should immediately take a shower, change clothes, and return to the palace to reunite with the king.

45
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,960
Zhu Ji is just afraid that once she enters the palace gate, she will

46
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,840
It’s hard to see Mr. Lu again

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,240
Zhu Ji didn’t dare to ask for anything

48
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,680
I just hope I can stay in Lufu for a few more days

49
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,280
Serve Mr. Lu well

50
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,600
Zhu Ji will be satisfied with this

51
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,080
Madam, why bother?

52
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,640
Mr. Lu

53
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,200
My wife went through a lot of hardships in Zhao State

54
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,800
Now I am lucky enough to return to my country

55
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,200
You should enjoy the happiness and happiness in the world.

56
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,640
Lu Buwei hopes that his wife will look to the future

57
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,960
Put big things first

58
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,360
The things of the past are now in the past

59
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,560
It’s really useless to think too much

60
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,000
What about Zheng Er?

61
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,520
Have you forgotten that Zheng'er is your biological flesh and blood?

62
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,960
Don't you want to get to know him?

63
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,920
Madam, this is wrong.

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,760
What is now placed in front of Zheng'er's eyes

65
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,640
It is to inherit the great responsibility of the unification of Qin State

66
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,240
How can Madam serve her own desires?

67
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,000
And ruining Zheng'er's bright future

68
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,240
Lu Buwei

69
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,720
If you are like this, then go back to Zhu Ji and his mother to return to China.

70
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,040
Just for your bright future?

71
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,040
Lu Buwei’s future

72
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,760
Isn’t it the future of Madam and Zheng’er?

73
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,880
All in all, the most important thing at the moment

74
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,480
It is to help Zheng'er gain the king's favor as soon as possible.

75
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,560
Between Madam and Lu Buwei

76
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,320
Nothing should happen that would make anyone suspicious.

77
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,880
I didn’t expect Prime Minister Lu to have such foresight

78
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,560
It really impressed Zhu Ji

79
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,760
It's getting late, someone is coming

80
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,040
Wait for your wife to bathe and change her clothes well

81
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,560
Yes, Mr. Xiang

82
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,840
Lu Buwei now goes out to prepare everything

83
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,200
Waiting for Madam to finish bathing and changing clothes

84
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,000
Send your wife to the palace immediately to meet the king

85
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,520
Meet the king

86
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,880
What a pity it is

87
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,080
The lonely king thought he would never see you again in this life

88
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,160
So why not Zhu Ji?

89
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,720
Madam, you have reduced your income

90
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,600
Madam, you don't know something

91
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,320
In order to try to rescue his wife and brother Wang and return to the country

92
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,320
I don’t know how much thought my father put into it

93
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,800
Now it’s really God’s wish

94
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,720
The king is finally reunited with his wife and prince

95
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,680
It is truly a blessing to the Qin Dynasty

96
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,120
You must be Zheng'er

97
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,480
I didn't expect to grow so big

98
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
Zheng'er greets his father

99
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,080
good…

100
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,880
This time my wife and the prince can return home safely.

101
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,520
reunited with the king

102
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,000
Prime Minister Lu really takes great credit

103
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,200
It seems that Prime Minister Lu’s years of planning have indeed paid off.

104
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,240
If we talk about merit

105
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,840
How can Lu Buwei compare with Master Wu Bao and Xiang Shaoxia?

106
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,760
Please, Your Majesty, reward them both.

107
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,600
Yes... When someone comes, please give me a seat first, Madam.

108
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,520
Over the past ten years, my wife has been really embarrassed

109
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,240
The lonely king decided to canonize Zhu Ji as his noble wife today.

110
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,000
He also rewarded hundreds of slaves for dispatch

111
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Thank you King

112
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Wu Yingyuan, it’s rare for you to rescue Madam Huagui

113
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,320
and zizheng

114
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
He did not hesitate to lurk in Handan for many years

115
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,520
This shows that you are loyal to Da Qin

116
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,560
I wonder if you have ever thought about it

117
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,680
Continue to operate the ranch in Qin State

118
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,560
How about training horses for the lonely king?

119
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,880
I'm already old

120
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,880
I really can't take on this important responsibility

121
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,880
I sincerely request your Majesty’s permission to return to my hometown.

122
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,400
be able to spend the remaining years in peace

123
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,880
As the saying goes, everyone has his own ambitions

124
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,240
It’s rare that the Lord of Wubao doesn’t seek fame in vain, so please grant it to your Majesty.

125
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,240
Okay, Gu Wang decided to play it accurately

126
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,280
And I will give you ten hectares of grassland and hundreds of good horses.

127
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,080
So that you can enjoy your old age in peace

128
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,640
Thank you King

129
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,000
Xiang Shaolong, you have done a great job in rescuing the wife and the prince.

130
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,520
How do you want the lonely king to reward you? You might as well say so.

131
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,120
Xiang Shaolong is from the Qin State

132
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,960
Saving his wife and prince is what Xiang Shaolong should do

133
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,760
I don't expect any reward from the king

134
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,240
If the father does not object

135
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,520
Zheng'er hopes that his father will appoint Xiang Shaolong as Taifu

136
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,440
OK

137
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,320
Xiang Shaolong, the lonely king will appoint you as Taifu

138
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,920
The person responsible for teaching Wang Zizheng...

139
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,480
By the way, Xiang Shaolong, what are you best at?

140
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,880
I'll teach him martial arts

141
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,440
Actually I'm just a martial artist

142
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,760
I don’t know much about any literary accomplishments

143
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,360
But he still knows a few martial arts moves.

144
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,080
I'll teach him martial arts

145
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,360
Xiang Shaolong is indeed quick to talk

146
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay, from now on you will teach Wang Zizheng martial arts.

147
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,400
thank you

148
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,520
Thank you King

149
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,680
Brother Xiang, listen to them

150
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,760
Isn’t it true that Wubao mainly goes back to his hometown?

151
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,920
Yes

152
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,520
In fact, I have also thought about it

153
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,840
If I could be like the Lord of the Castle

154
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,800
Go to a place with Brother Xiang where no one knows us

155
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,200
That would be great, don’t you think?

156
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Xiaoqian knew that she wanted Brother Xiang to give up everything

157
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,200
It's not easy indeed

158
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,440
You misunderstood, it’s not that I can’t let go of fame and fortune

159
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,040
Let me ask you a question, Xiaoqian

160
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,360
If one day

161
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,600
I'm going to take you to a place far, far away

162
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,880
all the buildings and people there

163
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,240
Everything is different from here

164
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,840
Maybe you can't adapt there at all

165
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,480
Will you go with me?

166
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,880
Brother Xiang, are you talking about your hometown?

167
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,600
Yes, will you come with me?

168
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,840
Since Brother Xiang and I left Wei State,

169
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,960
I have decided to follow Brother Xiang forever

170
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,360
Even if you take me to a place I can't adapt to

171
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,000
I don't mind either

172
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,600
But we go to this place

173
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,440
Your life may be in danger, are you really not afraid?

174
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,880
Don't be afraid, as long as you can be with Brother Xiang

175
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,480
Even if I die, I'm not afraid

176
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,200
Brother Xiang promises you

177
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,360
As long as Pan'er becomes King of Qin,

178
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,600
I will definitely take you out of here

179
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,800
Give me a little more time

180
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,680
Madam, these treasures

181
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,840
It was Gu Wang who specially ordered people to search everywhere to bring it back.

182
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,200
See if you like it, madam?

183
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,000
Madam, don't you like it?

184
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,080
It doesn't matter

185
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,360
The lonely king immediately ordered people to search for other treasures

186
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,800
Until you like it, madam

187
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,720
Since Madam returned to Xianyang,

188
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,240
I have been feeling depressed, is there something on my mind?

189
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,000
It doesn't matter, if you have any wishes, you might as well say so

190
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,880
The lonely king will definitely help you

191
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,360
Your Majesty, don’t worry

192
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,360
What Zhu Ji really wants in her heart

193
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,320
I'm afraid that the king will never be able to give Zhu Ji

194
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,280
How could it be? The lonely king is the king of a country

195
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,040
What can't be done?

196
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,040
good

197
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,800
Wait for the King Gu to order people to search for other rare treasures.

198
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,880
Otherwise, ask Lu Buwei for help.

199
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,440
With Prime Minister Lu’s ability to do things

200
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,400
I believe I can fulfill your wish, madam.

201
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,520
Come, let's have a drink together

202
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,440
Prime Minister Lu was being too polite for such a feast.

203
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,320
Wang Zizheng laughed at this

204
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,280
It's rare for a prince to have the honor to visit Lu Mansion

205
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,920
It’s really an honor for me, Lu Buwei

206
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,920
Speaking of honor, it should be me, a knowledgeable person...

207
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,960
No, it should be me, the guest.

208
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,200
Mr. Xiang, this is wrong.

209
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,160
This time Wang Zizheng was able to return to China

210
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,320
Taifu Xiang is the greatest contributor

211
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,640
How dare Lu Buwei ask Taifu Xiang to accompany him?

212
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,560
Report to the Prime Minister, Lao Ai is already waiting outside the hall.

213
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,280
call him in

214
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,240
yes

215
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,880
It’s rare to be so happy today

216
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,640
Lu Buwei specially appointed Prince Zheng and Taifu Xiang

217
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,800
Introduce a famous swordsman

218
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,160
he's coming

219
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,960
Lao Ai pays homage to Prime Minister

220
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,440
Lao Ai, hurry up and meet Wang Zizheng and Taifu Xiang

221
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,000
Lao Ai met Wang Zizheng and Taifu Xiang

222
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,920
This is the world-famous left-hand divine sword Lao Ai

223
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,320
He is also the swordsman that I, Lu Buwei, recently took under my sect.

224
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,000
Lao Ai heard that Taifu Xiang once used a wooden sword

225
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,800
Defeat Lian Jin, the best swordsman of Zhao State

226
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,080
I really admire you

227
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,520
I was just lucky for a moment

228
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,840
Why should Taifu Xiang be too self-effacing?

229
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,360
As the saying goes, a successful king loses a bandit. His skills are not as good as those of others during the Jin Dynasty.

230
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,760
You should be convinced that you lost

231
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,880
By the way, Brother Lao Ai, right?

232
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,440
Do you know where Lian Jin is now?

233
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,960
Lian Jin is the defeated general

234
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,440
No one will care about his life and death at all.

235
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,280
How can I know his whereabouts?

236
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,720
Taifu Xiang and Lao Ai seemed to hit it off

237
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,600
Come, let's talk in detail

238
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,360
Enjoy delicious food and wine

239
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,840
Lao Ai, take a seat too

240
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,560
Mr. Xie

241
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,600
To congratulate Wang Zizheng on his safe return to China

242
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,560
I, Lu Buwei, specially ordered someone to prepare a whole-sheep feast.

243
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,720
So that Wang Zizheng and Taifu Xiang can taste it.

244
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,600
The world-famous Xianyang dish

245
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,000
Someone coming

246
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,840
This is my first time eating a sheep like this

247
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,360
Mr. Xiang really wants to taste it carefully.

248
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,000
OK…

249
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,760
Lao Ai was negligent for a moment

250
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,080
Shocking the Prime Minister and Wang Zizheng

251
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,320
It's really a crime worthy of death

252
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,400
If you hadn't taken action in time

253
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,200
I'm afraid Wang Zizheng has been poisoned

254
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,360
What are you guilty of?

255
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,280
Wang Zizheng, are you okay?

256
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,200
I'm fine

257
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,280
It has been less than two days since Wang Zizheng returned to China.

258
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,240
It's impossible to have a grudge against anyone

259
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,400
Now someone actually came to assassinate me

260
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,000
If Lu Buwei guessed correctly,

261
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,080
This matter must be related to Cheng Yuda

262
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,960
Does Prime Minister Lu suspect that the second prince has become a dragon?

263
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,280
There are many stakes involved in this matter

264
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,320
It's hard to explain clearly at the moment

265
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,760
Come, move the banquet to the backyard

266
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
yes…

267
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,160
Wang Zizheng, let’s talk while we’re walking.

268
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,760
I never thought you would save us

269
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,400
There will be many things in the future that you can’t think of

270
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,320
What? You want to leave?

271
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,600
Of course, Zheng'er arrived in Xianyang less than two days ago

272
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,320
He has been assassinated. If he had stayed a few more days,

273
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,200
I'm just afraid of losing my life

274
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,160
Please, you are so scared of one or two assassins

275
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,720
How can you do great things in the future?

276
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,000
How can you accomplish great things if you don't even protect your life?

277
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Master also heard what Lu Buwei said

278
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,920
The one who wants to assassinate Zheng'er is Cheng Xi

279
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,480
Rather than waiting to die in the palace, it would be better to leave

280
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,640
Don't worry, I'm here with your master

281
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,080
you'll be fine

282
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,840
We finally arrived in Xianyang

283
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,360
Are we going to leave like this?

284
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,600
Don't worry, you won't be in danger as long as I'm here

285
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,720
Is there no danger? Master, you have seen it too

286
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,520
That Lian Jin suddenly appeared in Lu Mansion

287
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,880
He knows my life experience

288
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,840
If he informs the King of Qin

289
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,160
Am I not... decapitating...

290
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,760
Please don't be so timid

291
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,000
If Lian Jin wants to shake you out...

292
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,320
I mean Lian Jin wants to expose your identity

293
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,480
He has already done it

294
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,280
Why did he save us just now?

295
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,920
That's true

296
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,400
But Master, his right hand was clearly disabled by you

297
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,280
Now he uses a left-handed sword and changed his name.

298
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,280
There must be something weird in it

299
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,520
You have to be good now. The first thing you have to do is

300
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,240
Just don't complicate a simple thing

301
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,640
Now your master, I need some quiet time.

302
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,720
Take a break, okay?

303
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,680
I didn't expect that we would meet again so soon

304
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,080
Lian Jin

305
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,280
No, I should call you Lao Ai now

306
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,960
I think you also know it very well

307
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,760
Why did I invite you here this time?

308
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,480
I think you must really want to know

309
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,200
Why wasn't I in front of Lu Buwei?

310
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,320
Reveal Zhao Pan’s true identity

311
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,280
I still remember it very clearly

312
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,000
After you crippled my right hand that day

313
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,120
Zhao Mu expelled me from Juluhou Mansion

314
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,200
Fortunately, I didn't deserve to die

315
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,000
I met the left-handed swordsman Lao Ai

316
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,120
This person is cruel and ruthless

317
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,080
And he abused me in every possible way

318
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,160
But he finally taught me the sword technique with my left hand

319
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,680
Sure enough, rapid progress

320
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:56,360
As time goes by, your swordsmanship will definitely be no less than mine.

321
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,920
After you killed Lao Ai

322
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,400
Just use his identity as your own

323
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,880
good

324
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,600
You also really like being the chief swordsman

325
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,520
In the blink of an eye, he became Lu Buwei's chief swordsman

326
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,240
The title Chief Swordsman means a lot to me.

327
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,480
I'm no longer interested

328
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,320
From the moment I saw you and Zhao Pan entering the city

329
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,760
I knew it

330
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,480
This is the real opportunity God gave me

331
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,400
You want to threaten me?

332
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,440
I can't say that, I just want to cooperate with you

333
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,120
You used Zhao Pan to impersonate Ying Zheng

334
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,400
It’s nothing more than trying to gain power through Ying Zheng

335
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,600
In this regard, my purpose and yours are absolutely the same.

336
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,880
from now on

337
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,840
I will try my best to help you assist Ying Zheng in becoming the crown prince

338
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,200
As long as he successfully ascends the throne and becomes King of Qin

339
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,760
You and I will be in harmony

340
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,520
Became the left and right prime minister of Qin State

341
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,000
When the time comes, we will share the blessings, why not do it?

342
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,520
Why should I trust you?

343
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,920
That's right, you have no reason to believe me

344
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,560
But at this moment

345
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,240
If I reveal your secret

346
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,160
what's in it for me

347
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,000
Things that harm others but do not benefit oneself

348
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,680
I, Lao Ai, would never do that.

349
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,640
Zhao Pan…

350
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,280
Zhao Pan…

351
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,960
Zhao Pan, how dare you pretend to be Ying Zheng?

352
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,440
Now I am following the king’s orders

353
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,960
I want to punish you on the spot

354
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Pan'er...

355
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,520
daughter

356
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,400
My mother died miserably, you must avenge her

357
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,080
daughter

358
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,440
Your precious son is now the prince of Qin Kingdom

359
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,840
Enjoy wealth and glory

360
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,800
I have already completely forgotten you

361
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,200
Just give up, mother

362
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,800
daughter…

363
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,440
It's just a dream, not real

364
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,400
Besides, I have reached an agreement with Lao Ai

365
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,160
He won't expose you yet

366
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,440
But Lao Ai is so despicable, how can you trust her?

367
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,800
Of course I can't believe that he's so despicable.

368
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,520
But as long as we give him a little sweetness

369
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,320
He won't mess around for the time being.

370
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,840
Then am I going to be threatened by him?

371
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,280
That's not true. You have no power now.

372
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,480
Of course, it depends on his face.

373
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,440
But if you become the King of Qin in the future

374
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,080
Don't you have a way to deal with him?

375
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,520
Wouldn't it take a long time to wait?

376
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,680
You don’t have to wait long, just a year

377
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,040
Can't you wait even a year?

378
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,000
Master, how do you know?

379
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,080
Report to Wang Zizheng

380
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,320
The king ordered his servants to inform Wang Zizheng

381
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,000
Zhao Guo sent envoys with gifts

382
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,880
Congratulations to Wang Zizheng on his return to China

383
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,000
Did Zhao send an envoy to congratulate me on my return?

384
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,160
Which envoy did Zhao send?

385
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,520
It seems to be called Shao Yuanjun

386
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,640
Is Zheng'er okay?

387
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,240
The prince is acclimatized and has some intestinal obstruction.

388
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,400
So I need a little rest

389
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,960
What a coincidence, as soon as I arrived

390
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,680
Wang Zizheng was unwell and could not appear in public

391
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,160
Shao Yuanjun, Wang Zizheng recently returned to China

392
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,440
It is inevitable that you will not adapt to the climate

393
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,280
You are sarcastic

394
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,040
Insulting the prince is the same as insulting Qin

395
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,960
General Meng, please don't worry

396
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,000
I came to Qin this time out of good intentions.

397
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,600
Since Wang Zizheng cannot come out,

398
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,760
A congratulatory gift from our country

399
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,560
So I had no choice but to let the King of Qin take over it on my behalf.

400
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,000
Bold Zhao De, what do you mean by doing this?

401
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,320
Please calm down your anger

402
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,520
May I ask your Majesty, do you know who is in the coffin?

403
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,080
Nonsense, how could the lonely king know who the person in the coffin is?

404
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,280
To be honest, Your Majesty, the person in the coffin is not someone else.

405
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,680
It is the true princely government

406
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,600
What a load of nonsense

407
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,440
Mr. Xiang just said

408
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Wang Zizheng is resting in the palace

409
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,200
Mr. Lu, you don’t know something

410
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,240
The people Xiang Shaolong brought back from Zhao to Qin

411
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,880
Not a prince's government, a real prince's government

412
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,680
Already died in the hostage house of Zhao State

413
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,040
In order to prevent King Qin from being kept in the dark, our great king

414
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,960
Zhao De was specially ordered to transport the corpse to Xianyang.

415
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,920
So that the king can know the truth

416
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,560
Shao Yuanjun

417
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,360
You said the person in the coffin is the real prince

418
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,720
Is there any evidence?

419
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,000
Wang Zizheng has lived in Handan for more than ten years

420
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,480
Hundreds of people have seen him

421
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,280
They can always prove

422
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,800
The person in the coffin is none other than Wang Zizheng

423
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,640
If King Qin doesn’t believe it

424
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,920
Zhao Deda can order someone to open the coffin

425
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,920
Let King Qin see clearly

426
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,240
No need, King Zhao is acting like a villain this time.

427
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,680
There is no way the person in the coffin is Wang Zizheng

428
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,880
Your Majesty, since Mr. Shao Yuan has spoken with certainty,

429
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,840
Since Wang Zizheng returned to China,

430
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,600
Your Majesty has been busy with personal matters

431
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,920
It’s not surprising that your Majesty doesn’t know this.

432
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,680
Trouble Taifu Xiang to tell the whole story

433
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,600
Say it to everyone again

434
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,520
Actually this is what happened

435
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,240
As early as when Mrs. Huagui and her son returned to China

436
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,240
Madam Hua Gui has clearly told the king

437
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,800
It was Madam Hua Gui who was placed under house arrest by King Zhao

438
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,400
But Mrs. Huagui is very smart

439
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,320
She had already expected this move from him

440
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,040
So I used the trick "civet cat for prince"

441
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,360
The real prince has been hidden early in the morning

442
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,640
And use a fake prince for you to adopt

443
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
This is wasted

444
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,240
You have spent more than ten years raising him with rice

445
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,640
I'm so sorry

446
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,960
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

447
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,480
Of course

448
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,400
Zhao De

449
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,240
How dare you carry the coffin into the temple, so rude

450
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,800
The lonely king will cut you into pieces today

451
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,560
Someone coming

452
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,440
yes…

453
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,560
Catch

454
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,440
Your Majesty...this matter is all our fault.

455
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,680
Listen to Julu Hou Zhao Mu’s idea

456
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,560
Zhao De is just following orders, I hope your Majesty will understand clearly.

457
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,840
King Mingcha

458
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,360
Nonsense, I won’t kill you today

459
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Everyone in the world thinks that the lonely king will be afraid of you, the mere State of Zhao

460
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,400
pull out

461
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,520
It's... the king

462
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,560
Your Majesty, please spare my life. Your Majesty, please wait.

463
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,280
Your Majesty, please listen to what I have to say

464
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,680
Judging from this person, he is as timid as a mouse

465
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,760
If you kill this person, you will only attract criticism.

466
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,920
It's better to spare his life and let him go back to Handan

467
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,280
So that everyone in the Zhao Kingdom will know that the king is magnanimous

468
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,520
Your Majesty, Prime Minister Lu’s words make sense.

469
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,120
Zhao De, listen carefully

470
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,280
If Mr. Lu hadn’t interceded for you today,

471
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,240
You've already lost your head

472
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,920
The lonely king now orders you to leave Xianyang immediately

473
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,720
You will not be allowed to step foot into the Qin Kingdom in this life.

474
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,000
let him go

475
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,440
Thank you for not killing me...

476
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,680
Thank God

477
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,880
Too bad, the master hasn’t come back for so long

478
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Nothing will happen, right?

479
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,360
Wang Zizheng just felt unwell

480
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,920
Why not take more rest?

481
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,240
Don't be nosy

482
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,960
The slave knows the crime

483
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,000
By the way, what's your name?

484
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,880
Servant Zhao Gao

485
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,440
Okay, it has nothing to do with you here. You can go out first.

486
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,280
The slave obeys the order

487
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,480
Father-in-law, please

488
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,440
Report to the prince, the noble lady has a destiny

489
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,720
Invite the prince to the lady's palace

490
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,840
You bastard Zhao Mu

491
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,720
What if King Qin knew that he had saved the wrong person?

492
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,040
There will definitely be a big reward

493
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,440
It’s a blessing that we don’t have to be beheaded now.

494
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,840
Wang Zizheng…

495
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,760
Make your slaves look for you everywhere

496
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,600
So, Wang Zizheng, you are here

497
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,800
Over there is the palace of the noble lady

498
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,400
As soon as he heard that stinky eunuch call me Wang Zizheng

499
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,240
he just left

500
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,680
I don’t know whether I should pursue it or not.

501
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,560
Master, what should we do now?

502
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,400
Stop running around

503
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,080
Let me see what happens to him

504
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,960
Your Majesty just left to see Mr. Lu

505
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,800
Zhao De came this time

506
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,160
There is a business deal that I want to discuss with Mr. Lu

507
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,360
Buy or sell?

508
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,600
Zhao De has a secret about Prince Ying Zheng of Qin Kingdom

509
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,600
I want to sell it to Mr. Lu, I know

510
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,960
Tell me, what is the secret?

511
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:36,440
The person currently in Xianyang is not the real Ying Zheng

512
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,600
Are you saying that the current Ying Zheng is fake?

513
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,240
He is not the son of King Qin’s stranger

514
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,160
You mean he is not the king's son?

515
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,880
Do you know whose son he is?

516
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,800
Yes, this is exactly where the secret lies

517
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,840
As the saying goes, family scandals should not be made public.

518
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,200
If Zhao De rashly went to report to the King of Qin,

519
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,000
There is no guarantee that the King of Qin will not kill people and silence them

520
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,560
Wouldn't the truth be like this?

521
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,200
Mr. Lu is a businessman

522
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,880
Of course, knowing this secret is very important to Mr. Lu

523
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,880
A priceless treasure indeed

524
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,000
You did the right thing. You have indeed found the right person.

525
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,960
What's up?

526
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,640
Return to Prime Minister

527
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,320
Xiang Shaolong has something urgent to ask for outside the Prime Minister's Mansion.

528
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,920
Mr. Lu, please don’t believe it

529
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,760
Every word Xiang Shaolong said

530
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,080
This person is the culprit of the whole thing

531
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,600
Are you saying that Xiang Shaolong knows Ying Zheng’s true identity?

532
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,680
Yes, Xiang Shaolong came to see Mr. Lu this time

533
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,760
I wonder what the trick is?

534
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,040
Mr. Lu, you must be careful

535
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,520
True nature has its own measure

536
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,920
The visitor is

537
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,840
Please greet Mr. Shao Yuan well for me.

538
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,680
I'll talk to you in detail when I come back after meeting Xiang Shaolong.

539
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,280
Xiang Taifu

540
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,560
Taifu Xiang, you came at the right time

541
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,880
Please give me a death, Mr. Lu

542
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,480
What did Taifu Xiang commit? I want the truth to give you death

543
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,320
I feel really ashamed to say it

544
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,960
I didn't expect it to be for a woman

545
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,440
It actually caused Wang Zizheng's reputation to be damaged.

546
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,440
Xiang Shaolong can't make up for it even if he dies ten thousand times

547
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,120
Please give me a death, Mr. Lu

548
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,040
Woman? Taifu Xiang, who are you referring to?

549
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,320
I would like to ask Mr. Lu

550
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,720
Is Zhao De currently in the Prime Minister's Mansion?

551
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,200
So what?

552
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,640
I think Zhao De will definitely tell Mr. Lu

553
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,520
Talk about the prince zheng I brought back from the state of Zhao

554
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,000
not true

555
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,920
Why did Zhao De say this?

556
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,480
It's all my fault

557
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,920
When I escorted the princess to the Kingdom of Wei

558
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,160
I was actually with Zhao De

559
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,000
Something very unhappy happened

560
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,360
What is the whole thing like?

561
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,080
Mr. Lu, I don’t want to lie to you either.

562
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,520
Actually it's all my fault

563
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,600
When I sent the princess to the Kingdom of Wei

564
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,560
Maybe it’s because of the long-term relationship

565
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,360
I actually fell in love with the princess

566
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,720
A graceful lady, a gentleman is a good man

567
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,000
Princess Zhao is young and beautiful

568
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,040
No wonder Taifu Xiang is tempted

569
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,680
Mr. Lu, please don’t misunderstand me.

570
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,480
In fact, I have always followed the rules when it comes to princesses.

571
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,480
I haven't done anything deviant at all

572
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,320
But I really didn't expect it

573
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,760
This Zhao De is even worse than a beast

574
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,760
He actually entered the princess's room in the middle of the night

575
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,240
And tried to rape her

576
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,480
Fortunately I arrived in time

577
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,880
Then he gave him a slap in the face

578
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,240
flat?

579
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,320
I just meant to beat him up, Mr. Lu

580
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,600
I didn’t expect that Taifu Xiang had such a grudge against him.

581
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,600
After I also found out about this

582
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,320
Zhao De will definitely hold a grudge.

583
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,760
So after I rescued Wang Zizheng, his mother and son,

584
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,120
I plan to fly away with the princess

585
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,640
Who would have thought that Zhao De would report on me everywhere?

586
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,000
It was said that the prince I brought back was a lie

587
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,160
Small report?

588
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,800
Whistleblowing means spreading rumors everywhere, Mr.

589
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,920
What benefit does it bring to Zhao De to do this?

590
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,480
Zhao De, for personal grudges

591
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,960
He did not hesitate to wrongly accuse Wang Zizheng

592
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,000
In order to achieve his purpose of killing someone with a borrowed knife

593
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,520
After all, he also wanted to kill Xiang Shaolong

594
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,200
I don't want Wang Zizheng's reputation to be damaged because of me.

595
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,640
So I come this time

596
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,760
I just hope Mr. Lu will grant me death

597
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,360
if i die

598
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,360
Zhao De will no longer slander Wang Zizheng

599
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,000
I hope Mr. Lu will come true

600
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,200
Mr. Xiang, please rest assured

601
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,680
Facts speak louder than words

602
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,880
How could the truth be so trusting to Zhao De's words?

603
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,920
But there's one thing I don't quite understand

604
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,800
He Yixiang Taifu

605
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,360
Will beg to die for the sake of Wang Zizheng's reputation

606
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,240
Mr. Lu, you really don’t know something

607
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,240
Ever since I met Wang Zizheng

608
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,360
Not only was he very nice to me, he also had no pretensions

609
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
After I came back to Xianyang with him,

610
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,520
He even recommended me as Tai Tu in front of the king.

611
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,560
In fact, in Xiang Shaolong’s eyes

612
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,720
Wang Zizheng is not only smart

613
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,600
And he is also a rare talent

614
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,000
I believe he will

615
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,160
He will definitely inherit his father's fine bloodline

616
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,680
Achieve great things

617
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,200
Maybe we can even unify the world

618
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,720
So it makes no sense because of the grudge between me and Zhao De

619
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,480
And it affects the bright future of Wang Zizheng

620
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,680
In order to repay Wang Zizheng for being so kind to me

621
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,200
Even if I, Xiang Shaolong, die tens of thousands of times

622
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,200
I also feel that there is no regret in dying

623
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,680
Taifu Xiang rescued Madam Huagui

624
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,800
and Wang Zizheng’s great contribution to returning to China

625
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,520
How could he listen to outsiders' slander and kill Zhongliang?

626
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,800
Mr. Xiang, please get up

627
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,560
Thank you Mr. Lu

628
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,040
It is rare that Taifu Xiang is loyal to Wang Zizheng

629
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,800
The important task of teaching Wang Zizheng in the future

630
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,600
I leave it to you

631
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,280
Mr. Lu, you are too harsh.

632
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,560
I, Xiang Shaolong, will definitely do my best

633
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,640
Help Wang Zizheng, please rest assured Mr. Lu

634
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,600
That would be best

635
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,680
Mr. Xiang has worked hard, please come back

636
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,000
Then I'll leave first

637
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,000
Mr. Lu

638
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,680
You won’t listen to Xiang Shaolong’s nonsense, will you?

639
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,440
Since what Xiang Shaolong said is nonsense

640
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,120
How can the truth be so gullible?

641
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,400
Mr. Lu, you really know everything clearly.

642
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,480
Of course, the truth has been in the officialdom for many years

643
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,600
Who tells the truth, who tells lies

644
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,000
Still can't tell the difference?

645
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,080
Of course...

646
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,240
The visitor is

647
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,560
Serve wine

648
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,240
You guys go out, yes

649
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,120

650
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,200
The truth has bought such a big secret now

651
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,920
should be celebrated

652
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,680
In fact, the truth also has a big secret to tell you.

653
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:02,120
What I hate most is being threatened

654
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,680
Anyone who threatens the truth will die
