1
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,720
Qinqing…

2
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,360
Wake up, Qin Qing...

3
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,920
Brother Xiang?

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,480
Don't do this next time, the sulfuric acid will explode

5
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,520
Don't experiment randomly, you know?

6
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,520
I just want to help you

7
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,080
Qing'er...are you okay?

8
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm relieved that you're okay

9
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,040
By the way, you're fine. I'm going back to my room to rest.

10
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,200
Shaolong, please slowly heal Qing'er's injuries.

11
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,000
Brother, you asked me to drink with you to relieve your boredom

12
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,640
Why do you seem to be getting more and more bored the more you drink?

13
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,560
I don’t know what I want to do either?

14
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,400
I know I have to leave sooner or later, yet I still do this

15
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,080
Brother, what are you doing?

16
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,040
I really don't know how to explain it to you

17
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,760
I just realize I'm staying here now

18
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,400
It will only tire people and things

19
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,040
How could it be? Brother is leaving

20
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,360
My third brother and I are very reluctant to part with each other.

21
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,640
It’s just that the elder brother decided

22
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,600
As brothers, we will be fulfilled no matter what

23
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,640
The worst thing is that it’s unclear whether I can leave now.

24
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,000
How could it be? As the saying goes, where there is a will, there is a way.

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,040
As long as you have determination, anything can be solved

26
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,560
Don't say any more. It's said that one drink can solve a thousand worries.

27
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,240
Big brother and I will have another drink and wake up tomorrow morning

28
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,680
Everything will be solved

29
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,320
Maybe you are right, if you have wine today, you will be drunk today.

30
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,760
Okay...I will decide today that I won’t get drunk until I get home.

31
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Gold and stone relics?

32
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,360
If there is courage and alum in the mountains, it is also gold and stone.

33
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,240
Brown in color, soluble in water for alchemy, its property is humic acid

34
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,120
Could this kind of bile alum be the sulfuric acid that Brother Xiang mentioned?

35
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,280
Great, I finally found it

36
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
Qing'er, what makes you so happy?

37
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,480
Godfather, I finally found sulfuric acid

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,280
Look, it says here

39
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,160
The kind of sulfuric acid that Brother Xiang was talking about

40
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,960
In our day and age, it’s called bile

41
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,200
What does that mean?

42
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,680
If I find bile

43
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,160
You can help Brother Xiang make electricity

44
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,360
By activating the communicator, he can return to the future world

45
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,120
Qing'er, just think about it

46
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,400
If Xiang Shaolong really returns to the future world

47
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,280
What will happen to you?

48
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,920
Now all you want in your heart is to help Xiang Shaolong

49
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,800
Have you ever thought about yourself?

50
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,920
If Xiang Shaolong really separates from you

51
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Can you withstand this blow?

52
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,320
Godfather? How could I be so selfish?

53
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,800
If it is only for yourself, then it is selfish

54
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:08,160
But although my godfather is old and his eyesight is dim,

55
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,160
But I have already seen that Xiang Shaolong is in love with you

56
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,080
If not, how could he have done anything for you last night...

57
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,680
so nervous for you

58
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,600
Qing'er, for your own lifelong happiness

59
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,000
You really have to think clearly

60
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,680
In fact, you and Xiang Shaolong are in love with each other.

61
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,640
As long as you are willing to show affection

62
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:54,400
I think Xiang Shaolong will definitely stay in this era for you

63
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,200
Godfather, if I ask you to give up everything

64
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,720
And how would you live in the world two thousand years from now?

65
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,240
It would also be difficult for the godfather to accept it, right?

66
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,160
Just like Brother Xiang

67
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,000
He belongs to the future world two thousand years from now

68
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,400
Now I want him to give up everything

69
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,280
Come to this strange age

70
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,720
Godfather, what do you think Brother Xiang should make?

71
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,280
I think Xiang Shaolong may be doing it for Qing'er

72
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,120
Willing to sacrifice everything to stay in this era

73
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,400
Maybe at this moment, he will stay for me

74
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,440
But if he regrets it one day

75
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,120
Wouldn't he blame me for the rest of his life?

76
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,400
That's why you

77
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,440
So we have to help Xiang Shaolong return to the future world

78
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,680
Are you willing to be sad alone?

79
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,440
At least this is Brother Xiang’s current wish

80
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,640
Xiang Shaolong is really blessed to have Qing'er

81
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,680
Unexpectedly, I have asked many stores, big and small,

82
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,640
No one knows what bile is

83
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,720
It’s no wonder, we also inadvertently

84
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,600
I saw the name "gall alum" from this classic

85
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,120
Let's go to the front and have a look

86
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,520
Don’t miss this bottle of powder

87
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,720
It can repel snakes, insects, rats and ants and protect livestock

88
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,480
You may wish to buy some to take home for emergencies

89
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,840
Everyone will know this bile alum powder after using it

90
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,880
It's so amazing. Come on, buy some if you can use them.

91
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,720
Uncle, let me buy them all for you

92
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,000
Buy them all? This girl really knows her stuff

93
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,520
Uncle, do you have any more at home? I want a lot of them

94
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,600
Girl, what do you need a lot of bile powder for?

95
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,160
There's enough here for you to use for several years

96
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,840
Of course we have reasons, how many do you have?

97
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,440
I bought this gall alum powder from the woodcutter on the mountain.

98
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,640
If you want so much, I'm afraid you'll have to go up the mountain to dig it yourself.

99
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Uncle, do you know

100
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,080
Where can I find this kind of gall alum in the mountains?

101
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,640
Qing'er, do you want to go up the mountain to collect gall alum yourself?

102
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,280
Okay, godfather will accompany you up the mountain

103
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,080
The mountain road is rugged, Qing'er can go alone.

104
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,960
But your daughter’s family goes up the mountain?

105
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,440
For Brother Xiang, I am not afraid of anything

106
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,640
Uncle, do you know where to find bile?

107
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,160
Go up the mountain to find bile?

108
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,640
What is bile alum?

109
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,640
The courage is what you said before

110
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,960
Sulfuric acid that can produce electricity

111
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,760
Because of you, Qing'er now goes up the mountain alone to collect gall alum

112
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,360
I believe it will take about ten days to come back down the mountain.

113
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,640
Which mountain did she go to?

114
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,360
I only know that you can dig alum from the mountains

115
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,960
But I don’t know which mountain

116
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,320
I believe Qing'er will have to ask around along the way to find out.

117
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,520
I wonder what she is doing?

118
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,360
A girl went up the mountain for no reason

119
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,600
What if there is danger?

120
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,920
Qing'er said that for you, I won't be afraid of any danger.

121
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,920
I really don’t understand…

122
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,760
You don’t understand? It seems that you don’t understand

123
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,600
But you can't figure it out yourself

124
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,760
In fact, the one who doesn’t understand the most is me

125
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,640
You and Qing'er, one is interested in Prince Xiang

126
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,320
One is a goddess with a heart

127
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,320
Between the two, there is just a word

128
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,160
But she doesn’t have to leave without saying a word.

129
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,640
This is what Qing'er means

130
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,360
She wants to be separated from you for some time

131
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,080
Think carefully about what's going on between the two of you.

132
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,440
The advantage of "raising the army with agriculture" is that besides conscription

133
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,960
It can also be used to encourage production

134
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,960
I also remember that Taifu Qin once said

135
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,400
Talking about the Great Qin Dynasty since Shang Yang’s Reform

136
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,760
The method of farming and fighting has always been adopted

137
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,640
Your Majesty, the so-called method of farming and fighting

138
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,720
The goal is to let soldiers go to war when they have something to do, and to farm when they have nothing to do.

139
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,440
So as not to waste manpower

140
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,240
But now there are frequent wars between Da Qin and the Six Kingdoms

141
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,400
Whenever we capture a territory, we must send troops to garrison it

142
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,080
If this continues, it will only result in more soldiers and less farming power.

143
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,080
If taxes are not reduced or reduced as soon as possible to increase agricultural production,

144
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,720
Da Qin may be in danger of food shortages

145
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,120
Tax reductions and exemptions can certainly encourage agricultural production

146
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,040
However, although agricultural production increased

147
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,280
National tax revenue has also been relatively reduced

148
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,000
In addition to food and wages, military supplies

149
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,800
Chariots, horses and weapons are also needed

150
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,640
Will it be impossible to make ends meet by then?

151
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,080
King, the way of governing a country

152
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,160
Don’t focus only on immediate benefits

153
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,040
Tax reduction and exemption aimed at increasing agricultural production

154
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,400
As long as the people have surplus food, they can naturally barter food

155
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,040
When the time comes, the goods market will circulate and commerce will flourish.

156
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,680
We collect from business income tax

157
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,560
It will inevitably increase rather than decrease, which can be said to benefit both the government and the people.

158
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,640
Mr. Xiang, what do you think of Li Si?

159
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,480
In fact, he is right. Farmers’ income has increased.

160
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,960
Naturally it can stimulate their consumption

161
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,160
More consumption will naturally stimulate economic growth.

162
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,480
Then there will be more taxes

163
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,040
Okay, after Li Si has worked out the details of tax reduction

164
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,600
The widow will raise it in court

165
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,280
If the ministers support it then

166
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,000
I believe Lu Buwei has no way to object.

167
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,360
Li Si, you go back and draft it immediately

168
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,400
Thank you, Your Majesty. I will take my leave first.

169
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,840
Zhao Gao, please retreat first.

170
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,880
The slave obeys the order

171
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,920
As expected, Taifu Xiang has a keen eye for recognizing heroes.

172
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,720
Li Si is indeed a rare talent

173
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,080
It's a pity that I have tried to promote Li Si to Taishi many times.

174
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,720
They were all heavily obstructed by Lu Buwei.

175
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,640
Lu Buwei has always wanted to cover the sky with one hand

176
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,080
The king has cronies in charge of real power, so of course he doesn’t want to

177
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,720
Lu Buwei relies on himself to hold real power

178
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,560
The ministers did not dare to go against him

179
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,760
All matters within the court, big or small, are handled by him alone.

180
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,280
Even the great king I have is only in name.

181
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,400
But if you can win over one person, then it may not be

182
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Does Taifu Xiang mean the Queen Mother?

183
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,520
Yes, as long as the king and the queen mother reach a consensus

184
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,960
If there is a vote in court then, you will have two votes

185
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,680
Lu Buwei only got one vote

186
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,280
Then it will be easier for you to control him

187
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,880
It's a pity that now in the heart of the Queen Mother

188
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,440
Just thinking about how to have sex with Lao Ai

189
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,760
She has absolutely no interest in cooperating with others

190
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,200
The Queen Mother is not interested, but Lao Ai is.

191
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,320
It’s not like the king doesn’t know Lao Ai.

192
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,920
He has always wanted to gain fame and fortune by any means necessary.

193
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,520
As long as you tell Lao Ai

194
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,280
I'm sure you can save a lot of effort

195
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,160
Your Majesty wants to invite the Queen Mother to attend court?

196
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,480
Lao Ai, you are a smart person

197
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,680
You should be very clear about the current situation between North Korea and China

198
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,840
Although I am called a king,

199
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,600
But the government has always been controlled by Lu Buwei

200
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,240
In addition, there are many Lu Buwei's party members in the DPRK.

201
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,800
It seems even more lonely and weak

202
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,280
So the king wants the queen mother to go to court to listen to the government?

203
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,080
Join forces with the king to deal with Lu Buwei?

204
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,720
As expected, Lao Ai drew inferences from one instance

205
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,600
I finally found the wrong person

206
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,840
Your Majesty, my humble position is just that of a palace guard.

207
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,880
How can I persuade the Queen Mother?

208
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,720
Your Majesty, let’s discuss it directly with the Queen Mother.

209
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,480
Lao Ai, there is no point in beating around the bush with me anymore.

210
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,880
Regarding the matter between you and the Queen Mother

211
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't have to pay attention to it

212
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,160
But you have to lend a helping hand

213
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,280
Convince the Queen Mother to go to court

214
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,480
Your Majesty's words are serious, I despise my position to be loyal to the Queen Mother

215
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,440
That is to say, to be loyal to the king

216
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,800
There is absolutely no conflict between the two

217
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,000
The king and the queen mother have a deep love for each other

218
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,440
If you want the Queen Mother to come to court to help the King,

219
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,360
I believe it’s not a big problem

220
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,600
But if Lu Buwei knows about this matter,

221
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,480
If it's because of a humble position that interferes with it

222
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,520
I'm afraid my life will be in danger if I take a humble position.

223
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,880
You can rest assured about this

224
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,240
Although the few people cannot hold real power,

225
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,240
But to protect a person's life with the position of king

226
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,360
Not difficult

227
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,040
I can give you a death-free token.

228
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,240
Except for me, no one in the court can punish you with death.

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,840
As long as Lao Ai can help me regain my real power

230
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,200
I will definitely reward you based on your merits

231
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,160
I would like to express my gratitude to the king in advance for my humble duty.

232
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,960
Convincing the Queen Mother is a matter of humble duty.

233
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,160
Did the king really tell you that?

234
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,560
The king is hoping that the queen mother

235
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,200
Can you join forces with me to deal with Lu Buwei?

236
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,800
Deal with Lu Buwei?

237
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,280
Doesn't the Queen Mother not want to

238
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,720
Can we sleep together and sleep peacefully as soon as possible?

239
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,960
Of course I do, this is my biggest wish

240
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,800
But has the Queen Mother ever thought about it?

241
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,600
Our real pet peeve

242
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,960
Not the king, but Lu Buwei?

243
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,720
I know very well what Lu Buwei is like

244
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,760
If he can successfully control the king

245
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,960
The next person he has to deal with must be me and you

246
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,720
What should we do?

247
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,360
It's simple, as long as we can succeed

248
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,160
Help the king regain military and political power

249
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,840
Your Majesty will naturally become our backer

250
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,040
We don’t need to be afraid of Lu Buwei anymore

251
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,680
I ask you, do you love me?

252
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,920
Or do you love all the power I bring to you?

253
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,840
Just think about it, if I had no power at all

254
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,560
How can I protect the woman I love in the future?

255
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,200
glib

256
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,080
Anyway, for our future

257
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,040
We must join forces with the king to deal with Lu Buwei

258
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,000
Regarding Wei Chen’s recent mention of the drought in Longxi

259
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,640
Request for tax relief

260
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,320
I wonder what your Majesty’s intention is?

261
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,840
Drought occurred in Longxi, except for unforeseen circumstances

262
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,480
Also blamed on the disrepair of water conservancy

263
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,600
Now you are reaping the consequences, and you should take the responsibility yourself

264
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,160
There is a food shortage in the area now

265
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,600
Adjusting grain to provide disaster relief is acceptable, but reducing or reducing taxes is definitely not possible.

266
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,720
Once this case is opened, other states and counties will

267
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,440
They all requested tax reductions under various names.

268
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,840
Dare I ask how it is?

269
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,720
I wonder if there are any other matters to be announced by the ministers?

270
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,000
Please inform your Majesty that the construction of the tomb of the late king has been completed.

271
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,360
Weichen also went to personally inspect and accept

272
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,520
Just wait for the king to choose a day to carry out the tomb sealing ceremony

273
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,200
Okay, this time the construction of the tomb of the late king

274
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,040
It was successfully completed, and Li Si was indeed indispensable.

275
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,760
The few people proposed to promote Li Si to Taishi as a reward.

276
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,720
I wonder if the ministers have any objections?

277
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,320
Your Majesty, the position of Taishi has great powers and responsibilities.

278
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,320
Li Si is still young, so he takes up the post

279
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm afraid it's hard to convince the public. I definitely don't agree with it.

280
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,800
but…

281
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,240
Report to the King, the Queen Mother has arrived

282
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,120
Welcome the Queen Mother

283
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,040
Long live the Queen Mother...

284
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,720
I was outside the palace just now

285
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,880
I seem to hear that the king and Prime Minister Lu are having a dispute.

286
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,200
What's going on in the unknown?

287
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,720
When I returned to the Queen Mother, I originally wanted to promote Li Si to Taishi.

288
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,880
It's a pity that Prime Minister Lu was very cautious

289
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,520
I wonder if Prime Minister Lu is willing to listen to me?

290
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,280
Queen Mother, please speak

291
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,120
As far as I know, Li Si is a learned man

292
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,160
Since entering the palace

293
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,680
I have always provided advice to the King and made many achievements.

294
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
The so-called officialdom is not prioritized

295
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,360
Regarding the king’s proposal to promote Li Si to Taishi this time

296
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,000
I deeply agree

297
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,280
Since the Queen Mother also agrees

298
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,920
I wonder if the ministers have any objections?

299
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,720
Everything is decided by the king

300
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,680
I don’t know about Prime Minister Lu…

301
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,840
Since everyone agrees, there is nothing to say about the truth

302
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,400
In fact, speaking of it, Li Si also came from the Prime Minister's Mansion.

303
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,280
Now I can be promoted by the king

304
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,640
Prime Minister Lu should be proud of Yourong, right?

305
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,840
What the Queen Mother said is true

306
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,240
Okay, let's decide this matter

307
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,320
Li Si stepped forward to hear the seal

308
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,480
I now officially promote you to the post of Taishi

309
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,640
Thank you King for your grace

310
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,120
Isn't this reasonable? The king clearly wants to

311
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,480
Use the Queen Mother to deal with the truth

312
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,680
Prime Minister, I don’t understand something at the end of the day.

313
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,960
Since the king ascended the throne

314
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,560
Although the Queen Mother was nominally in charge of the government, she

315
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,920
But I have always just attended

316
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,480
Rarely express an opinion at all

317
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,120
Not to mention going against the prime minister

318
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,600
Why did it suddenly change from normal this time?

319
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,560
If the truth is correct, the Queen Mother’s move

320
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,200
There must be someone behind it

321
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,840
Someone is causing trouble?

322
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,520
According to the Prime Minister's wishes, could this person be Xiang Shaolong?

323
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,480
Xiang Shaolong?

324
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,160
Xiang Shaolong is the most important person beside the king

325
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,440
If this person had not advised the king

326
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,840
How can the king know how to use the Queen Mother to fight against the Prime Minister?

327
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,480
Xiang Shaolong, you increasingly don’t see the truth in your eyes

328
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,400
According to the last general’s opinion, for the sake of the prime minister’s important affairs

329
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,440
It is really not appropriate to allow this person to stay with the king any longer.

330
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,920
Don’t worry, if Xiang Shaolong dares to incite the king again,

331
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,640
Many obstacles to the truth

332
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,240
The truth will never let him go

333
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,640
Niangrong

334
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Disgusting, I almost scared you to death

335
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,320
Just kidding you

336
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,080
Niangrong, have you sewed new clothes again?

337
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,960
Do you want me to try it on for you this time?

338
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,440
If you have time, go make peace.

339
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,200
Peaceful old?

340
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,560
Your eldest brother and my father

341
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,520
I don’t know if there has been any conflict recently.

342
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,840
I saw my father returning to the Prime Minister's Mansion from the palace yesterday

343
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,440
Seems very unhappy

344
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,640
Your father holds all the power in the court

345
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,840
As long as someone doesn't listen to him, he will be unhappy

346
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,080
What if your eldest brother and my father really became mortal enemies?

347
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
You and I are going to be enemies

348
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,080
Jing Jun, go back and persuade Taifu Xiang

349
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,280
Tell him not to go against my father

350
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,480
Niang Rong, my eldest brother has no intention of going against your father.

351
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,200
He just wants to help the king

352
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,520
So that the king can become a

353
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,640
A true king of a country

354
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,240
On the contrary, your father is always against the king.

355
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,680
I think you should go back and persuade your father

356
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,440
You should tell your father not to be too ambitious.

357
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,400
Have you ever imagined for us?

358
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,760
If your eldest brother and my father continue to be enemies

359
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,360
Do you think my dad will let us interact again?

360
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,680
These are two different things. Don’t you want to separate right from wrong?

361
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,840
Since you think so important about right and wrong

362
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,120
Then why did you come to me?

363
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,080
You go back and continue to help your elder brother deal with my father.

364
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,080
Don't come to see me again in the future

365
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,240
Niang Rong, can you please tell me the truth?

366
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,840
Yeah, I'm unreasonable, you go

367
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,240
Do you dare to step into my store again?

368
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,720
I asked someone to catch the thief

369
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,560
Niangrong

370
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,360
I really don't know what's going on in her mind

371
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,240
It's simply unreasonable

372
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,800
What is unreasonable?

373
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,120
Brother, in this world

374
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,680
can you find another girl

375
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,640
More unruly and willful than Miss Lu?

376
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,080
What are you doing? Are you arguing with Miss Lu again?

377
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,840
No wonder Kong Zhongni said that only women and villains are difficult to raise

378
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,400
A woman's heart is simply inexplicable

379
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,720
Think about it, brother

380
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,880
What you were talking about to Lu Buwei was a national matter.

381
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,920
Miss Lu and I were talking about our children’s affair.

382
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,400
How can they be confused?

383
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,720
It’s hard for you to blame Miss Lu

384
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,560
Lu Buwei and I got into this situation

385
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,000
And Lu Buwei is her father

386
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,120
You can hardly blame her for being indifferent

387
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,280
I don't blame her for favoring her father

388
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,360
But you can't force me to agree with her, right?

389
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,400
You don't need to be angry

390
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,680
Although Miss Lu has a bit of a young temperament

391
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,360
But I think she should be a person who can distinguish between public and private matters.

392
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,680
That's all we have to do, but a woman's heart

393
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,480
I find it really elusive

394
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,000
Just like Miss Qin suddenly and mysteriously went up the mountain

395
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,640
Yes, a woman’s heart is really elusive

396
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,480
They like to keep things in their hearts and not say anything.

397
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,280
By the way, my second brother is often mysterious lately.

398
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,520
Brother, do you know what he does?

399
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,320
Your second brother has a sense of propriety at his age.

400
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,040
Do you have to tell us everything?

401
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,760
Makes sense

402
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,040
Just like Miss Qin didn’t tell you when she went up the mountain

403
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,920
Maybe she doesn't want you to worry

404
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,760
Uncle, where can I find gall alum in the mountains?

405
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Girl, you went up the mountain alone just to find someone brave?

406
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Yes, I heard that gall alum can be harvested in the mountains

407
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,240
Is that so?

408
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,920
It's true, but this kind of courage can only be found when you go to the top of the mountain

409
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,560
Moreover, the mountain road is rugged, even if we are used to it

410
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,400
It takes more than two hours to walk.

411
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,200
Girl, I'm afraid you'll have to leave for three or four hours

412
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,600
Only then can we arrive

413
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,960
Sorry for bothering you

414
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,760
My dear friends, the tax reduction in Longxi has been decided.

415
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,280
What does the Queen Mother think?

416
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,600
It's all up to the King to decide, I have no objections

417
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,800
I wonder if there is anything else going on in the ministers’ family?

418
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,480
Your Majesty, I have recently inspected the Xianyang area.

419
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,160
I feel that Xianyang is the capital of a country

420
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,680
It is supposed to be the richest place in the country

421
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,480
But in recent years, agricultural harvests are far less than those in the south.

422
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,600
There is a real need for improvement

423
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,440
But how does Prime Minister Lu think it should be improved?

424
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,200
Wei Chen believes that large-scale construction should be carried out as soon as possible

425
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,320
Build a large canal to connect Jingluo River

426
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,520
for water conservancy and irrigation purposes

427
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,280
Make the Guanzhong area a fertile soil

428
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,560
Build a canal?

429
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,120
The king is aware of the situation and relies on the humble opinion of the humble minister.

430
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,320
This is absolutely impossible

431
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,600
I don’t know what Li Taishi’s wisdom is?

432
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,520
Return to your Majesty, the State of Qin built the Great Wall

433
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,160
There are already hundreds of thousands of laborers

434
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,640
Plus years of fighting

435
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,040
Most of the country's men have been drafted into the army

436
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,440
There is already a huge shortage of farmers

437
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,200
If we continue to waste money and people at this time, we will build a canal.

438
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,760
I'm afraid it will only make Qin fall into a state of fatigue.

439
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,880
Give the six countries an opportunity to take advantage of it

440
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,360
Li Taishi really thought deeply about

441
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,160
It makes sense to not seek great achievements

442
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,800
Let’s leave the matter of canal construction to a later date.

443
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,680
What does the Queen Mother think?

444
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,120
The king's prudent governance is actually a blessing to Qin

445
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,720
Reporting to the Queen Mother, Prime Minister Lu asked for an audience outside the door.

446
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,760
Go out and tell Prime Minister Lu

447
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,040
I have important matters at hand, so I can't...

448
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,480
What's important for the Queen Mother?

449
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,000
He didn't even have time to see his true form?

450
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,920
Prime Minister Lu broke into Dazheng Palace without permission from the palace.

451
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,760
It's a bit inconsistent with etiquette

452
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,160
The Queen Mother actually discussed etiquette with this Prime Minister

453
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,000
No wonder the Queen Mother and the King are always against me

454
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,760
It turns out that the Queen Mother had already regarded Lu Buwei as an outsider.

455
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,400
If it weren't for Prime Minister Lu who wanted to monopolize power and control the king,

456
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,560
How could your Majesty and I oppose Lu Cheng?

457
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,800
Could it be that the Queen Mother had already sent Lu Buwei to the Queen Mother?

458
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,280
Have you completely forgotten the kindness you had in those days?

459
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,600
Or maybe the Queen Mother has found a new love?

460
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,160
Leave Lu Buwei behind?

461
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,320
Lu Buwei, since you still respect me as the Queen Mother

462
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,400
Then you shouldn't be rude

463
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,080
I really don't understand

464
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,000
In what way can I, Lu Buwei, be inferior to Lao Ai?

465
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,080
You actually go against the truth for him?

466
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,000
Let me ask you, how much Lao'ai soup have you drunk?

467
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,960
Bewitched by him?

468
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,000
This seems to be a question you have to ask yourself

469
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,960
How have you treated us, mother and son, over the past ten years?

470
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,440
How should I treat you mother and son?

471
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,200
Without me, Lu Buwei

472
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,480
How can the king now sit on the throne of Qin?

473
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,240
How can the Queen Mother enjoy the glory and wealth in peace?

474
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,880
Zhu Ji, you should know very well

475
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,480
The current king is our biological son

476
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,200
The king’s country is our country

477
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,120
Now that the king is young and troubled, he is easily instigated by others.

478
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,320
The reason why I'm so worried

479
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,120
To strive for power in the government

480
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,360
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

481
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,240
Back then you gave me to a stranger

482
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,440
Could it be that you are also thinking about my future?

483
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,280
Don't deceive yourself anymore

484
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,440
Everything you do is for yourself

485
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Zhu Ji, I did this out of necessity

486
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,240
Now Daqin is in the hands of our family

487
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,040
We can continue our relationship

488
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,480
Don't touch me, more than ten years ago

489
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,520
You want to gain power

490
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,480
Give me to someone else like I'm a commodity

491
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,080
Already broke my heart

492
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,880
More than ten years later, I returned to Xianyang

493
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,560
I begged you so hard that I wanted to make peace with you again

494
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,680
Who would have thought that you would be ruthless and unjust to me in order to protect your position?

495
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,880
I've already lost my heart to you

496
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
There's no love at all, just go away

497
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,520
you…

498
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,240
Okay, even if I, Lu Buwei, feel sorry for you

499
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,760
If you don’t miss me, you miss our biological flesh and blood.

500
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,040
You don’t have to use your power to suppress me anymore

501
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,560
The king is not your son at all

502
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,520
What did you say? Say it again

503
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,080
I advise you to stop having your big spring and autumn dreams.

504
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:16,120
The current king is my son from a different person and the previous king.

505
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
It has nothing to do with you

506
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,080
You were in Handan that day

507
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,400
I told you that I am pregnant with your flesh and blood

508
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,160
I just want to stay by your side

509
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,640
Who would have thought that you, with your iron heart, would still give me to a stranger?

510
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:37,520
This is such a shame and humiliation, I will never forget it in my life

511
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,040
No...it can't be true

512
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,400
I know you said these words on purpose to irritate me

513
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,200
Lu Buwei, all your years of hard work are in vain.

514
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,520
Thinking that you can live in a rare commodity

515
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:55,200
But unfortunately, it seems that you bought the wrong product now.

516
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,240
No way, God can't play tricks on me like this

517
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,280
I know you deliberately made up this story to deceive me

518
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,080
Tell me, what you just said was false, say

519
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,440
let me go

520
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,560
You bitch, you have lied to me like this for more than ten years

521
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,280
I trust you so much, and you lied to me like this?

522
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,000
Tell me, you're not telling the truth

523
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,400
You bitch, you deserve to die.

524
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,800
let me go...

525
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,920
Lu Buwei

526
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:54,920
You first broke into the Dazheng Palace without permission, and then you were rude to the Queen Mother

527
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,160
I ask you what crime you deserve?

528
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,160
Lao Ai, you have nothing to do here, go out

529
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,280
As the commander-in-chief of the inner court guards, I

530
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,680
Responsible for protecting the safety of the Queen Mother

531
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,080
If you act rashly again

532
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,720
Don't blame me for being ruthless under the sword

533
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,280
Okay, you two will wait and see.

534
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,800
I, Lu Buwei, will never give up.

535
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,800
Rare things to live in

536
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,280
Unexpectedly, I, Lu Buwei, am so smart all my life

537
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,640
This bitch has deceived me for more than ten years

538
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,640
How ridiculous…

539
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,560
what happen?

540
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,920
The villain doesn’t know, Mr. Xiang...

541
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,840
Curiosities to live in…

542
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,760
father…

543
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,880
What a rare find... What's going on?

544
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,360
Dad, don't do this. Go away...leave me alone.

545
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,600
Dad... a rare thing to live in...

546
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,320
Dad, does your wound still hurt?

547
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,840
What happened to make you do this?

548
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,840
God is playing tricks on me, Lu Buwei

549
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,200
It took more than ten years of hard work

550
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,360
Actually making wedding clothes for others

551
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,880
How ridiculous

552
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,720
Dad, don't think so wildly

553
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,120
The most hateful thing is the ungrateful person Ying Zheng

554
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,360
You actually want to team up with this bitch Zhu Ji to deal with me.

555
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,360
Dad, you can't talk nonsense like this.

556
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,600
If this reaches the king's ears, he will be beheaded.

557
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,600
Damn it, Ying Zheng’s current throne

558
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,600
It was I, Lu Buwei, who supported him to climb the mountain.

559
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,560
if you were my son

560
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,520
I can make you a king

561
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,360
From now on, I don’t have to look at Ying Zheng’s face anymore

562
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,640
Why are you not my son?

563
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,400
Why?

564
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,080
Dad, you are drunk

565
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,440
I'm not drunk...

566
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,240
I can help him up or pull him down

567
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,160
Want him to never turn over

568
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,160
Your Majesty, are you okay?

569
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,320
How could Cheng Yu be as blessed as Prime Minister Lu and be ranked among tens of thousands of people?

570
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,360
Why does the prince need to make sarcastic remarks?

571
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,920
The position of a minor minister is just that of a prime minister.

572
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,560
But the prince is different

573
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,120
Your Majesty is of the bloodline of the Ying family, the son of the late king.

574
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,320
You can be the supreme king at any time

575
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,440
Prime Minister Lu was really drunk before he even drank.

576
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,280
I think that my brother Yingzheng is now firmly seated as the king.

577
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,800
How can a man be so virtuous and capable as to be able to become a supreme ruler?

578
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,240
Your Majesty, please listen to what I have to say.

579
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,320
You will understand the mystery. Your Majesty, please

580
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,000
Error 504 (Server Error)!!1504.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

581
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,760
This must be something unusual. Please let Prime Minister Lu speak clearly.

582
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,560
The prince is really quick to talk

583
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,000
Dare I ask the prince, since Ying Zheng ascended the throne?

584
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,680
Does the prince feel like a thorn in his back?

585
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,480
Great feeling of restlessness in sleeping and eating

586
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,880
In this case, why doesn't the prince make some changes?

587
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,800
Pull out the thorns?

588
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,160
What Prime Minister Lu means is...

589
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,320
Does the prince still remember?

590
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,320
On that day when Ying Zheng returned to Xianyang for the first time

591
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,400
Did the prince send people to assassinate Ying Zheng?

592
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,040
Because of this matter, Ying Zheng has always been worried about it.

593
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,720
Now he ascends to the throne of king

594
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,960
Always trying to find a way to settle the score.

595
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,520
If it hadn't been for the many obstructions from the humble ministers,

596
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,560
I'm afraid the prince has already died.

597
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,120
So isn't Chenglong in danger?

598
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,440
In my humble opinion, if the prince does not strike first,

599
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Just sit back and wait for death

600
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,040
It would be better to join forces with Lu Buwei

601
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,000
While Ying Zheng is still young, eradicate this person as soon as possible

602
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,200
Instead, take back the throne you deserve

603
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,920
The Prime Minister’s words are like a wake-up call

604
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,440
But why does the Prime Minister want to help Cheng Xi?

605
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,600
Ying Zheng is self-willed and ungrateful

606
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,600
He actually wants to eradicate the heroes who helped him ascend the throne.

607
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,720
He was unkind first, and I was unjust later.

608
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,480
This is a matter of course

609
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,800
From this point of view, those who really want to be kings

610
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,640
It’s Prime Minister Lu who is the real one

611
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,760
Chief minister's support rank

612
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,760
It's nothing more than wanting to use Chenglong as a puppet

613
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,360
It’s just so that the prime minister can have more power in the future.

614
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,120
The prince is indeed frank

615
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,720
But even so, what's the harm to the prince?

616
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,800
When the time comes, you will be a great king and enjoy all the wealth and honor

617
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,160
A humble minister can still sit firmly in the position of prime minister

618
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,400
Everyone gets what he deserves, why not do it?

619
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,320
Okay, I'll bet with you again, Cheng Xi.

620
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,200
Let’s see if Ying Zheng is lucky or if I am a dead man.

621
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:57,720
Okay, let's make it a deal

622
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,800
From now on, this day belongs to me and you

623
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,840
What? Did Lu Buwei really join forces with Cheng Yu to rebel?

624
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,400
Yes, since the Queen Mother asked Lu Buwei a few days ago

625
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,760
After revealing that the king is not an illegitimate child

626
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,120
I've always been worried that Lu Buwei would be up to no good.

627
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,760
Now he secretly meets with Cheng Xi

628
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,720
He must be trying to rebel and seize the throne.

629
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,680
Become a puppet king

630
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,840
Then isn't the king very dangerous?

631
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,880
It's all my fault, if it weren't for my impulsiveness

632
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,520
tell the truth

633
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,000
Lu Buwei will not be forced to make a desperate move

634
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,200
No, I have to tell the king about this

635
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,200
You must not do this

636
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,920
If you do this, you will only alert the snake and ruin the big thing.

637
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,040
But what if Lu Buwei really rebels?

638
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,640
Isn’t the king...

639
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,000
I just want him to put his rebellion plot into action

640
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,880
As long as there is something different between him and Cheng Xi

641
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,680
If you fall into my trap, there is only one way to die.

642
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,760
This is a great opportunity for us to make contributions
