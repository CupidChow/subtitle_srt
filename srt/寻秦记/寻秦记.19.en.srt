1
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,440
So you find a fake baby...

2
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,160
It’s just a fake baby to replace the real Ying Zheng

3
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,640
Fortunately

4
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,120
Otherwise, the prince would have grown up in the Proton Mansion

5
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,240
Zhao Mu used alcohol and sex to numb his will for a long time

6
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,880
In the end, it will be like today’s fake Ying Zheng

7
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,080
Become a waste who is greedy for life and afraid of death

8
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,800
Now that we know the whereabouts of the prince

9
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,160
We need to bring him back as soon as possible

10
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,880
I wonder where Niujia Village is?

11
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,800
Thirty miles east of the city

12
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,640
The foot of a mountain called Niutou Mountain

13
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,000
More than ten years later, how do we know

14
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,360
Which one is the real prince?

15
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,600
There is also one beside the prince

16
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,600
Identical white jade ring

17
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,360
As long as you show it to the old farmer and his wife

18
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,560
They will know that I sent you.

19
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,720
That's great, it's getting late now

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,920
We'll do this immediately tomorrow morning

21
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,120
We have no choice but to stay here temporarily

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,960
Madam, please don't be offended.

23
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,960
Lord Wubao, you're welcome

24
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,040
This place is already a hundred times better than Zhao Mu's mansion.

25
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,400
Madam please

26
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,760
By the way, it’s been so long since I came back

27
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,160
Why don't you see my apprentice and princess? Where are they?

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,400
Master, let me go

29
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,240
I want to kill Zhao Mu to avenge my mother

30
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,360
Revenge for... what kind of revenge? You have this kind of three-legged cat kung fu

31
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,160
If you go out to take revenge

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,480
They will definitely be chopped into pieces.

33
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,240
No matter how many copies of Lu Gong's Secret Records I have,

34
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,680
I can't bring you back either

35
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,600
I would rather die by the enemy's sword

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,760
Don't live an ignoble existence either

37
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,760
Young Master Pan, listen to your elder brother

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,520
A gentleman's revenge is not too late in ten years

39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,320
Yes, if you show off your courage

40
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,120
Isn’t it just like dying in vain?

41
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,680
Cousin Pan, calm down

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,440
Aunt Quanxia is well aware and doesn’t want anything to happen to you.

43
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,000
Master understands how you feel now

44
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,840
But now is really not the time to avenge your mother.

45
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,160
So when is the time?

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,640
Now the first thing we have to do

47
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,280
Just send Zhu Ji mother and son back to Qin.

48
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,560
After finishing this matter

49
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,360
I will find another way to avenge your mother

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,320
Is your name A Zheng?

51
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,480
no…

52
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,360
Big brother

53
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,920
Why are there funerals in every household in this village?

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,840
yes

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,240
Sir, is your name A Zheng?

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,160
no

57
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,800
Do you know where Daddy Cow lives?

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,520
Daddy Niu?

59
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,120
Everyone in our village has the surname Niu

60
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,120
Which cow daddy are you looking for?

61
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,720
There is a man named A Zheng in his family

62
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,960
Ah Zheng? Ah Zheng lives in this room

63
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,320
Working

64
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,320
How many of them are…

65
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,520
Are you a cow daddy?

66
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,880
That's right

67
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,200
Is A Zheng here?

68
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,240
A Zheng?

69
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,560
It’s a woman named Mrs. Zhu

70
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,000
Ask me to come to you with this white jade ring

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,520
Everyone, please come in

72
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,880
What's up?

73
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Tell me what those five words actually say?

74
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,800
It says "Niu Zheng's Spiritual Position"

75
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Niu Daddy

76
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Didn’t you tell me that Mrs. Zhu’s Azheng...

77
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,080
We are useless as a couple. I'm sorry, Mrs. Zhu.

78
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,160
In recent years, there have been frequent battles

79
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,000
All the men in our village have been drafted into the army

80
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,280
The army sent back several corpses a few days ago

81
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,920
It's a pity that Zheng'er is so young and about to die in battle.

82
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,400
You two, let’s go indoors and rest first.

83
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,560
Impossible, it won't happen

84
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Qin Shihuang would not die like this

85
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,960
I don’t believe it…

86
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,280
Brother, calm down and go away

87
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,960
Big brother

88
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,120
It can't be such a prank, right? People will die.

89
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,560
Big brother is crazy

90
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,000
Why so upset?

91
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
More than upset? I'm about to die

92
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,560
If eldest brother can trust Teng,

93
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,680
Just say it and let my second brother take care of your worries

94
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
You wouldn’t believe it if I told you

95
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,680
What's the use of telling you?

96
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
If you don't tell me, how will your second brother understand?

97
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,040
Even if you tell me, you won’t understand.

98
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,120
What if I told you that I suddenly disappeared in front of you

99
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,120
Do you believe it?

100
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,200
Suddenly disappeared? Brother, you are still here

101
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,440
How should I tell you?

102
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,800
I want to tell you

103
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,680
I am not the person I am now

104
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,080
I'm from the future world

105
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,760
I'm not from ancient times, you understand?

106
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,720
Future world?

107
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,760
The world of the future...that is, the world of the future

108
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,240
The future world is not the present

109
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,520
Now we call it ancient times

110
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,360
You understand ancient times, right?

111
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,800
Ancient times are the dynasties before your current dynasty

112
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,920
Do you understand that the previous dynasties are called ancient times?

113
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,560
I understand this, the ancients are...

114
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,480
Just understand it

115
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,520
The opposite of ancient times is the future world

116
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,400
I am from the future world

117
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,600
Do you know what I'm saying? Epcot

118
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,680
Let me give you an example, like...

119
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,800
You and your wife had a son

120
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,440
Your son gave birth to another son, who is also your grandson

121
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,320
Many, many generations of grandchildren later, then...

122
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,760
Which generation of grandson is that?

123
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,360
It doesn’t matter which generation of grandson you are.

124
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,000
Possibly the grandson of the generation after the 98th generation

125
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,760
Come back to visit your ancestor, when...

126
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,360
By that time, I'm already dead

127
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,320
I don't care if you live or die

128
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,480
In short, your 98th generation grandson

129
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,480
Come back to visit your grandpa

130
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
The era of the 98th generation grandson

131
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,760
It's called the future world

132
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,120
In that world, anything can be done, then...

133
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Is it really possible?

134
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,000
OK

135
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,360
Look at me sitting in front of you alive

136
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,760
I knew it would work, so how could it not work?

137
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,760
Anyway, the world at that time had everything.

138
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
Do you believe what I said?

139
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,720
Believe it, even though I don’t quite understand it

140
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,160
But I definitely believe what you said, brother

141
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,880
Actually this is also very interesting

142
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,880
Big brother can visit people anytime and anywhere

143
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,520
Are you kidding me?

144
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,640
The worst thing is

145
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,440
Now history has been messed up by me

146
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,120
The dead Niu Zheng you just saw

147
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,480
Originally, he would become the King of Qin in two or three years.

148
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,560
Then the Qin Dynasty will appear in twenty or thirty years

149
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,920
Then the six countries were unified, did you know?

150
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,960
Is he really that powerful?

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Of course he was awesome, he even called himself Qin Shihuang

152
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,440
Then they burned books and harassed Confucians

153
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,320
Later, many people were hired to build the Great Wall

154
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,480
The dynasty after the Qin Dynasty was the Han Dynasty

155
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,480
I don’t know what dynasty came after the Han Dynasty

156
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,240
Anyway, many years later

157
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,880
It was in the second thousand years, that is, my time

158
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,040
Do you know what I'm talking about?

159
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,280
Brother, are you saying that you are a person born more than two thousand years later?

160
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,720
Yes, originally it was

161
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,120
But the corpse you just saw

162
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
He is the future Qin Shihuang

163
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,080
Now that Qin Shihuang is dead, there is no Qin Dynasty.

164
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,920
The Qin Dynasty is gone

165
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,320
Then there will be no more Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties.

166
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,560
In other words, even the SAR government is almost gone.

167
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,120
Then...then I'm almost gone

168
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,560
Big brother is alive here now and has not disappeared.

169
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,360
Yes, how can we have grandchildren without a grandfather?

170
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,320
Just like how can there be eggs without chickens?

171
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,800
Now that the egg has been laid

172
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,560
In other words, there must be chickens

173
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,840
There must be chicken?

174
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,360
I also thought about the whole thing the other way around.

175
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,440
Brother just said

176
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,440
As long as Qin Shihuang unified the six countries,

177
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,760
there will be your presence

178
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,880
Since you already exist, that means

179
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,240
There must be a Qin Shihuang who came out to unify the six countries

180
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,280
You look a lot like Jesus

181
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,560
Master…

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,360
What should I do with this white jade ring?

183
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,480
Niu Lao Ma and Niu Lao Ma asked us to return it to Zhu Ji

184
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,640
Save it for me

185
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,800
keep?

186
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,000
Brother, Ying Zheng is dead

187
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,720
How do we explain to Mrs.

188
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,760
If Zhu Ji knew about her son's death

189
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,360
Must be heartbroken

190
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,440
What to do?

191
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,120
Xiang Shaolong, have you found it?

192
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,120
actually…

193
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,960
Zheng'er, you must be my Zheng'er

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,120
Over the past ten years, my mother has missed you so much.

195
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,760
Congratulations, madam...Congratulations, madam, on your mother and son reunion

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,520
Shaolong, he is obviously... I know

197
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,960
He is Wang Zizheng

198
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,280
division…

199
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,880
What is the teacher? I have said it many times

200
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,000
My surname is not Shi, my surname is Xiang, Wang Zizheng

201
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,640
Zheng'er, are you feeling uncomfortable?

202
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,240
It's okay

203
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,840
I think he may have been there for more than ten years

204
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,120
I have never seen my own mother-in-law

205
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,760
So I was overly excited for the moment

206
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,560
I don’t know how to express my inner feelings in words

207
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,160
So he might be a little sluggish

208
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
It'll be fine later

209
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,800
Zheng'er, mother said she would never leave you again.

210
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,120
You go in with your mother

211
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,720
Mom wants to have a good talk with you, come here

212
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,440
lady

213
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,680
Shaolong, what are you doing?

214
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,480
Big brother…

215
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Kill a chicken to thank God for his kindness

216
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,280
Let's go over there and tell the castle owner slowly. Come on

217
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,360
Replace Ying Zheng with Zhao Pan?

218
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,960
Who said Ying Zheng is really dead?

219
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,600
This is the only way

220
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,560
What can I do? What if my wife exposes me?

221
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,760
Don’t worry, Zhu Ji has been

222
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,960
I have never seen my biological son at all.

223
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,360
Otherwise she wouldn’t have seen Apan just now

224
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,160
Treat him as his biological son

225
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,520
I think if we don't talk about this

226
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,240
It won't be revealed

227
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,560
You must not do this. Impersonating a prince is a capital offense.

228
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,080
Besides, Prime Minister Lu is going back to Ying Zheng this time.

229
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,520
It is the successor to the Qin Kingdom

230
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,920
How can you find someone to pretend to be someone when the matter is so important?

231
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,040
Lord Wubao, I know you are loyal to Qin

232
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,720
But I think you were deceived by Mr. Lu this time too.

233
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,080
Shaolong, why did you say this?

234
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,680
In fact, Ying Zheng was not the biological son of King Qin at all.

235
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,400
He is the illegitimate son born to Mr. Lu and Zhu Ji

236
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,600
Is this true?

237
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,000
Of course it's true, before I came to Zhao country

238
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,200
Mr. Lu told me this personally.

239
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
He also warned many times

240
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,760
After asking me to save his son

241
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,080
Take him back to Qin so that he can be the emperor

242
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,000
Then he can dominate

243
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,480
No wonder Lu Cheng attached so much importance to saving the prince

244
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,280
It turns out that he was pretending to be a public servant for personal gain

245
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,520
If Mr. Lu knew that his son died tragically,

246
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,000
Wouldn't he be furious?

247
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,800
I can't imagine it anymore

248
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,200
He originally planned to take his son back so that he could become the king.

249
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,520
Now there is nothing

250
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,840
If he knew about this

251
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,800
I don't think any of us will survive

252
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,320
Then let’s go to Qin on this trip

253
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,800
Isn’t it a dead end?

254
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,760
Since it's a dead end

255
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,160
I think it’s better to follow what brother said

256
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,320
If you make a mistake, you will make a mistake. Use Zhao Pan to replace it.

257
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,880
Anyway, Madam already regards him as her biological son.

258
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,680
Master Wu Bao, you also saw it just now

259
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,040
Zhu Ji meets Pan'er

260
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,880
The excitement of reunion between flesh and blood

261
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,920
It's like a person who hasn't eaten for more than ten days

262
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
It feels the same as giving him a chicken leg

263
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,560
How can you bear to tell Zhu Ji?

264
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,600
Madam has been looking forward to it for more than ten years

265
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,640
Just waiting for the day when flesh and blood meet again

266
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,920
If the lady knew that her son was no longer alive,

267
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,720
It's so pitiful

268
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,360
Master Wu Bao, I know I want you to deceive Mr. Lu

269
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,840
It's a very difficult thing

270
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,120
But if you think about it carefully

271
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,760
We have no choice anymore

272
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,720
Ying Zheng is really dead

273
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,640
Besides, Pan'er's nature is not bad either.

274
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,520
As long as we teach him well

275
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,320
He will definitely become successful in the future

276
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,200
Now we can only make mistakes

277
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,320
One, it can save our lives

278
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,040
Second, it can also help Zhu Ji find her biological son

279
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,640
Why not?

280
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,240
Shaolong's words make sense

281
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,480
If this matter is publicized,

282
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,960
Not only are our lives at risk

283
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,640
I'm afraid the Qin State will also undergo great changes.

284
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,960
The only solution now is to do what you want

285
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,800
However, what saddens Wu the most is...

286
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,240
Looking at the country of Qin

287
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,680
Will fall into the hands of people with foreign surnames

288
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Even though Wu Mou is patriotic, he is also powerless.

289
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,800
It’s been more than ten years in the blink of an eye

290
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,600
Zheng'er has grown so big

291
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,200
I left you for so many years for my mother

292
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,360
She has not even shouldered a little responsibility as a mother.

293
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,400
really ashamed

294
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:40,160
Mom, you have suffered a lot in the past ten years

295
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,600
Call me mother for my mother and other political children

296
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
I have been waiting for more than ten years

297
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,960
Now I can see Zheng'er

298
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,600
Mom, the hardships she has endured for more than ten years are finally not in vain.

299
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,880
Mom, stop doing this

300
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,760
By the way, Zheng'er, tell your mother

301
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,800
How has your life been in Niujia Village these past ten years?

302
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,640
Pretty good

303
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,880
Are you well fed and warmly clothed?

304
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,920
Mom, look at the kid, he’s tall and strong

305
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,760
Just know that I have never been hungry

306
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,000
Zheng'er, why are your hands so tender and smooth?

307
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,400
Nothing like coming from a rural home

308
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,320
That's it, mother, you don't know something

309
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Cow Father and Cow Mother are very good to their children

310
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,520
So the children don’t have to do any heavy work.

311
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,960
That being said, my mother had nothing to blame back then.

312
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,440
Think about those days

313
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,000
Mom only gave a sum of money to Niu Lao Ma and Niu Lao Ma

314
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,320
As a child’s childcare expenses

315
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,880
I really didn’t know I would be separated from you for so long

316
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,680
The longer I am my mother, the more I will miss you.

317
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,520
I'm afraid that you will have a bad life and will starve and freeze

318
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:25,080
Mom, stop thinking so much about the past.

319
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,320
madam, prince

320
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
I've got hot water ready

321
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,880
Is it convenient to bathe and change the prince's clothes?

322
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Wei Niang only cares about chatting with Zheng Er

323
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,720
Forgot you haven’t…

324
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,320
You go take a shower and change clothes first, and wait until you finish washing up

325
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,720
I’ll talk to you again at night by holding a candle for my mother’s sake

326
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,960
Good guy, he really knows how to act.

327
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,000
And know how to adapt to changes

328
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,640
If I have the chance, I really want to introduce you to Hollywood.

329
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,520
You will definitely get rich

330
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,240
Master, Pan'er really doesn't understand

331
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,160
Why do you have to pretend to be Ying Zheng?

332
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,600
Didn't you see Zhu Ji's appearance?

333
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,200
She has been waiting for her son for more than ten years

334
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,720
If you tell her that her son is dead

335
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
I think she will commit suicide

336
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,880
But in this case, how long will Pan'er continue to pretend?

337
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,360
I have discussed this with Master Wu Bao.

338
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,240
We feel that the best thing at this stage is to make mistakes

339
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,800
Will it be a mistake to make a mistake?

340
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,680
Anyway, Zhu Ji has already regarded you as Ying Zheng.

341
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,040
Just use your identity as Ying Zheng

342
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,680
Isn’t it okay to follow her back to Qin?

343
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,160
Want me to follow her back to Qin...

344
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,560
Want me to follow her back to Qin? How can I do that?

345
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,840
I am from Zhao country

346
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,360
Doesn't this mean that the thief is the father?

347
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,600
You said yourself that you are from Zhao country

348
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,600
It’s a pity that King Zhao and Zhao Mu didn’t think you were from Zhao.

349
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,720
Have you forgotten?

350
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,760
but…

351
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,640
I want to stay in the Kingdom of Zhao and take revenge by killing Zhao Mu.

352
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,520
Please use your brain to think about it

353
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,040
When you become King of Qin in the future,

354
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,360
Not to mention revenge, you send a team of soldiers every day

355
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,720
You can just teach him a lesson when you have time.

356
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,120
Now that you have no power, how can you take revenge?

357
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,320
I'm worried that if you stay in Zhao State, your life will not be guaranteed.

358
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,800
Just trust me

359
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,320
Your master, when will I not lie to you?

360
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,960
No...when did I, your master, lie to you?

361
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,560
All in all, this matter is doing a lot of harm and no good at all.

362
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,080
No, it's completely beneficial and harmless

363
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,400
Brother, there is an inn in front of you

364
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,760
Then let's take a break in front first.

365
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,840
Dear guests, please...this way...

366
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,120
This way…

367
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,400
Zheng'er, the sun is scorching hot outside, are you working hard?

368
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,680
Mom, don’t worry, the baby will be able to survive

369
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,520
By the way, mother, are you tired after traveling for days?

370
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,080
Not tired, I just want to return to Qin as soon as possible

371
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,920
Reunion with your father's family

372
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,560
Two of them, one lost his mother and the other lost his son

373
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,200
Now that's a good thing

374
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,520
Therefore, there is a master in everything in the world.

375
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,760
Lord Wubao, how long does it take for us to reach Qin?

376
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,160
We can meet up with Tao Fang tomorrow

377
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,880
We can reach Qin in another two or three days.

378
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,120
Then won’t we be able to meet Tingfang soon?

379
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,120
Since the last time we said goodbye in the palace

380
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,960
I haven’t seen Tingfang for a long time.

381
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,920
Lord Wubao, how is Tingfang?

382
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,320
Thank you princess for your concern

383
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,480
But my daughter is unruly and willful

384
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,000
I have always liked traveling alone

385
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,720
I'm afraid I've reached the border of Qin now.

386
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,880
Ten days ago, we received a transaction

387
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,960
Someone offered a lot of money

388
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,320
Want us to track down a Mohist named Zhou Ping

389
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,120
On the surface, this person seems to be an alchemist who makes alchemy and medicine.

390
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,400
But secretly, we find

391
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,760
He is secretly developing a powerful weapon

392
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,520
Powerful weapon?

393
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,160
Could it be that this person died from such a powerful weapon?

394
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,440
You should be able to tell from the corpse.

395
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,600
In addition to his missing limbs

396
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,800
And there are signs of being burned by fire

397
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,400
But if it's just fire

398
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,040
The limbs should not be so mutilated

399
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,680
Yes, if this powerful weapon existed

400
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,840
Anyone who can grasp

401
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,120
I will definitely be invincible in the world

402
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,200
Shanrou, you want to find out the secret, you know?

403
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,920
Kind and gentle, obey orders

404
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,520
Beat you to death...

405
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,760
Is it comfortable? Isn’t it more comfortable this way? Smelly bitch

406
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Spit out the happy elixir that I worked so hard to refine?

407
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,640
Want to pretend to be dead? I won’t let you die so early.

408
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,400
Smelly bitch, I'm going to ask you to test the medicine.

409
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,800
Eat it...eat it

410
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,000
Hero, spare your life

411
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,040
If you don't want to die, just do it immediately

412
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,760
Hand over the secret recipe for the secret weapon you developed

413
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
What’s the secret weapon recipe?

414
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,080
You don't have to act crazy in front of me

415
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,240
I pay…

416
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,480
Hero, spare your life...

417
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,800
If you don’t want to die, hand over the secret recipe immediately

418
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,720
The secret recipe? I don’t know what the secret recipe is

419
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,240
Stop pretending to be crazy

420
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,800
A few days ago, I had a brother

421
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,680
He died because of your powerful weapon

422
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,760
A few days ago? You mean that?

423
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,840
You misunderstood, a few nights ago

424
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,280
Someone really sneaked into my alchemy room secretly

425
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,000
The villain's alchemy furnace is refining a five-stone powder

426
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,040
I don’t know how he knocked over the alchemy furnace.

427
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,880
Suddenly there was a loud noise like thunder and lightning

428
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,080
The entire alchemy furnace turned into pieces and scattered

429
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,640
Your brother is...

430
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,320
Good man, believe me, it really has nothing to do with me

431
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,840
Why does a good alchemy furnace turn into pieces?

432
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,600
This kind of alchemy thing happens all the time.

433
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,920
I don't know either

434
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,240
Then can you still remember that day?

435
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,560
What medicinal stones did you put in the alchemy furnace?

436
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,360
After so many days

437
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,560
I don't remember, I really don't remember

438
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,280
Really don’t remember?

439
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,320
I have many prescriptions here

440
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,160
Hero, spare the villain's life, take it.

441
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,880
You are a man with evil intentions and do all kinds of things

442
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,160
Do you like alchemy so much?

443
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,200
I will make it happen for you

444
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,600
Girl, let me get you out

445
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,400
The eldest lady of the Wu family?

446
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,320
danger, go

447
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,320
What does it mean?

448
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,760
What do you think?

449
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,600
Has the medicine not worn off yet?

450
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,160
I think you're hungry too. Let's have some porridge.

451
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,520
What happened to you? Tell me, okay?

452
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,880
Do you still recognize me? My name is Shanrou

453
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,160
Think about it carefully

454
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,840
I'm your eldest brother Xiang Shaolong's friend

455
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,880
Do you still remember Xiang Shaolong?

456
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,640
You just said you just walked out of the alchemy room

457
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,360
The alchemy furnace suddenly turned into pieces and scattered

458
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,440
Fortunately, my subordinate walked quickly

459
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,480
Otherwise, I will never have the chance to serve you, my lord.

460
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,800
Could it be as Zhou Ping said?

461
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,080
The so-called powerful murder weapon

462
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,680
It was just an accident that happened while refining the elixir

463
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,000
It's a pity that at that time

464
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,240
I poured the medicinal stones into the alchemy furnace randomly

465
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,720
I didn’t write down the contents of the medicine stone one by one.

466
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,560
otherwise…

467
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,560
Things happen suddenly, you don’t have to blame yourself

468
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,520
Shanrou, can you remember

469
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,160
I ordered you to be with Xiang Shaolong that day

470
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,880
Stealing the Juzi Order

471
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,640
Of course Shanrou remembers

472
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,520
The buyer who asked us to steal the huge order that day

473
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,960
After getting the Juzi Order, I discovered a hidden pattern in the order

474
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,480
But the secret grid turned out to be empty.

475
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,040
Could it be that the Lord doubts Shan Rou?

476
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Keep the secrets in the Juzi Order as your own

477
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,200
I'm sorry you don't dare either

478
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,280
But to prove your innocence

479
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,520
You'd better try something on Xiang Shaolong

480
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,520
Find out the secret hidden by Ju Zi Ling

481
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,160
but…

482
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,680
No need to say more

483
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,760
I don't care what means you use

484
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
You have to do it within three months

485
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,320
On Xiang Shaolong

486
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,360
Find out the secret hidden by Ju Zi Ling

487
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,920
Otherwise, you know what the consequences will be, right?

488
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,400
But for a while

489
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,040
The Lord asked me how to find the whereabouts of Xiang Shaolong?

490
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,760
You can rest assured about this

491
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,120
According to the spies' report

492
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,720
Xiang Shaolong is currently on his way back to Western Qin via a detour

493
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,840
As long as you rush to Xianyang immediately

494
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,040
Of course there is a chance to meet this person

495
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,520
I hope to see you next time, what you brought back

496
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,240
It's Juziling's secret, not your head

497
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,200
Why are you doing this?

498
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,920
Why did you save me? Just let me die

499
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,280
Although I don't know what happened to you

500
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,120
But you die like this

501
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,480
Are you willing to let go of Xiang Shaolong in your heart?

502
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,600
I have already forgotten this person

503
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,160
You can deceive others, but you cannot deceive yourself

504
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,040
You keep this hosta by your side all the time

505
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,080
You just remember him

506
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,040
Don't say any more

507
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,760
This hosta was given to you by him

508
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,040
If you really forget about him

509
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,840
Why keep it around?

510
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,480
So what?

511
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,160
He never put me in his heart

512
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,240
He said that you are his true love

513
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,800
then you are wrong

514
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,800
He just used me to piss you off that day

515
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,920
When he knew you didn't go back to Wujiapu

516
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,520
Do you know how nervous he is looking for you everywhere?

517
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,560
real?

518
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,200
But why would he bother to do this?

519
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,160
I only know that he regretted his marriage that day

520
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,920
There must be something unspeakable about him

521
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,560
Unspeakable and hidden?

522
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,240
if you want to know

523
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,000
You should save your life even more

524
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,600
Go and ask him in person for a clear explanation

525
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,920
Bystanders know clearly, authorities are confused

526
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,000
If you are seeking suicide now

527
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Xiang Shaolong will regret it for the rest of his life

528
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,880
And will you give up under Jiuquan?

529
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,760
Death is not the best solution

530
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,520
Have you made a fire?

531
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,760
I caught a fish, no need to eat dry food tonight

532
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,520
Where have you been during these days?

533
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,920
Why did it fall into the hands of the alchemist again?

534
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,960
Border towns are also quite lively, right?

535
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,640
Mrs. Zhu Ji and Wang Zizheng are back

536
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,640
Hurry up and see. Hurry up...

537
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,240
Come on, come over and watch the fun

538
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,160
Uncle, what happened earlier?

539
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,520
Don't you know?

540
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,720
Mrs. Zhu Ji, who has been under house arrest in Zhao for more than ten years

541
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,760
He and Zizheng returned to Qin

542
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,200
He seems to be a great hero named Xiang

543
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,280
Rescued them from the Zhao State Hostage House

544
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,880
wait for me

545
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,640
Xiang Shaolong

546
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,920
Why are you standing still and not chasing him?

547
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,400
I really can't understand your thoughts

548
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,040
You obviously miss Xiang Shaolong very much

549
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,040
Why didn't you go up and acknowledge him just now?

550
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,360
Didn't you just see...

551
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,000
Does he already have a princess by his side?

552
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,320
Deceiving oneself and others

553
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,680
Even if Xiang Shaolong has an extra princess by his side

554
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,360
as long as you want

555
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,720
You can also go up and ask for clarification.

556
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,760
Unless you have something to hide in your heart

557
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,840
After this battle

558
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,240
I know that I should plan everything for myself

559
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,840
Why did you betray me?

560
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,720
Eat it...you will be very happy after eating it

561
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,240
I practiced very hard

562
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,560
It turned out to be you?

563
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,520
Shanrou, are you sick?

564
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,360
Take me to a place like this in the middle of the night

565
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,760
He also said he would bring me to meet someone.

566
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,480
How is it? Who are you meeting?

567
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,800
Can't you see me?

568
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,880
Of course I can see you

569
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,480
But you don’t have to bring me all the way here to see you, right?

570
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,160
Just because I'm about to die and see my old friends.

571
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,600
Who is dying?

572
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,880
I mean this time we meet

573
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,440
may be the last time

574
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,360
What last time?

575
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,280
Forget it, I'd better not say it, so as not to embarrass you

576
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,200
Then just say it

577
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,440
If you don't tell me, how will you know that I can't help you?

578
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,720
Still don’t want it

579
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,000
Anyway, eighteen years later he is a good man again

580
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,520
I have nothing to offer, so I won’t say anything anymore.

581
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,000
Auntie, don't be so long-winded and talk in circles.

582
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,520
You tell me, only then can I help you.

583
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,680
So you agreed? Yes...

584
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,440
But you can’t tell me to commit suicide by cutting my pulse now.

585
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,560
I promise you too, right?

586
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,400
Don't worry, I won't force you

587
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,160
Last time I borrowed a huge token from you

588
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,040
Do you still remember?

589
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,480
Did you borrow it? You stole it?

590
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,480
If I had known that the huge order would kill me, I would not have stolen it

591
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,680
You stole something and said I killed you

592
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,080
You are so unreasonable

593
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,920
Tell the truth

594
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,280
My lord asked me to steal that huge order.

595
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
I don’t know how the lord actually knows

596
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,400
There is a secret hidden in the Juzi Order

597
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,160
He gave me a month to hand over the secret book.

598
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,160
Otherwise, there is only a dead end

599
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,160
Are you still a human being?

600
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,600
You stole my huge order last time

601
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,640
This time you asked me to give you the secret

602
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,040
You are so whimsical

603
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,120
I also said you won't help me

604
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,000
Forget it, if you don't care for yourself, you will be punished by heaven and earth.

605
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,080
I won't blame you

606
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,120
Anyway, if you drop by for the Spring and Autumn Festival, come and pay homage to me.

607
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,240
no problem

608
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,600
Just kidding, don't be so thin-skinned

609
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,240
Come on, come and sit down

610
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,000
how?

611
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm not afraid to tell you the truth

612
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,880
That secret book was given to me by my master before he died.

613
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,320
He repeatedly told me to keep it well.

614
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,920
What if it falls into the wrong hands?

615
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
When the time comes, life will be ruined and death...

616
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,200
If I didn't have that secret book

617
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,280
I can only die

618
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,520
Have you ever watched The Legend of the Condor Heroes?

619
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,080
I know you must not have seen it

620
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,960
The trick we used Huang Rong to deceive Ouyang Feng

621
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,560
Why don't you just come and lie to your lord?

622
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,120
Just give him a fake secret book

623
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,920
But my lord is no ordinary person

624
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,240
Not so easily fooled

625
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,600
Of course not the whole book is fake.

626
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,320
But one sentence is true and one sentence is false

627
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,200
Half a sentence is true, half a sentence is false.

628
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Let’s use Huang Rong’s trick

629
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,560
Write fast as slow and slow as fast

630
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,360
Left is written as right, right is written as left

631
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,600
Line before is written as after, after is written as...

632
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,040
You can imagine such a brilliant strategy, it’s awesome

633
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,680
Actually, it’s not what I thought of

634
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,400
It was Ajinyong who thought of it

635
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,360
A Jinyong?

636
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,000
Yes, it’s Ajinyong

637
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,400
Pan'er always thought

638
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,360
The scale of Handan City is already very grand

639
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,040
Now come to Xianyang City

640
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,760
Only then did I realize that there is another mountain that is higher than the other.

641
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,440
You know that Master made the right introduction, right?

642
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,680
Anyway, starting from today

643
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,320
Qin is the place where you can show your talents

644
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,560
Show off your skills?

645
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,960
Of course, the most powerful country today is Qin

646
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,480
If you don’t develop here, where can you develop?

647
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,200
Believe me, as long as you pay attention

648
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,360
You will definitely have the opportunity to stand out in the future

649
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,880
But Pan'er is always a little worried

650
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,840
After entering Xianyang City

651
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,200
Is it possible to deceive everyone

652
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,760
I heard people say

653
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,880
Lu Buwei of Qin State is a very powerful person

654
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,480
Don't worry, I'm here with your master

655
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,160
Anyway, you have to remember that after entering Xianyang City

656
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,880
You are no longer Zhao Pan

657
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,080
You are Ying Zheng, the prince of Qin

658
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,200
Pan'er...Zheng'er knows

659
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,600
The humble minister Lu Buwei, under the order of the king

660
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,080
Came here specially to welcome the lady and the prince

661
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,760
After more than ten years apart, Madam, how are you doing?

662
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,360
Prime Minister Lu has good intentions, everything is fine with Zhu Ji

663
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,600
Zheng'er, you haven't met Mr. Lu yet?

664
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,920
yes

665
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,720
Zheng'er met Lu Xiangye

666
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,680
Is he Ying Zheng?

667
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,800
I really didn’t expect that the government…

668
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,240
Wang Zizheng has grown so tall

669
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,640
Thanks to Prime Minister Lu Hongfu

670
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,960
Xiang Shaolong and Lord Wu Bao

671
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,880
Has successfully brought the wife and prince back to Qin

672
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,680
good, well done

673
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,280
Madam and Wang Zizheng travel long distance

674
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,560
Must be exhausted

675
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,240
Invite Madam and Wang Zizheng

676
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,880
Let’s go to Lu Mansion to settle down for a while.

677
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,960
See you again, Your Majesty

678
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,080
Then there is Prime Minister Lao Lu

679
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,280
Prince, please
