1
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,240
I am a great scholar of Qi Dynasty, known as the Sword Master Cao Qiudao.

2
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,040
I am a tycoon in the financial world

3
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,280
Known as the Martial Saint, "I'll Make You Noisy to Death"

4
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,280
Have you never heard of Cao Qiudao's name?

5
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,480
Never heard of it

6
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,240
I was in the market a few days ago and saw several young people using force.

7
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,800
One of them is called Gongzipan

8
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,880
The Mozi sword technique he used

9
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,360
So you come to ask me how I know Mozi swordsmanship

10
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,760
Then you don't need to move your hands or feet

11
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Please forgive me for being reckless

12
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,680
With the sword skills you use,

13
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,880
It’s from my senior brother Yuan Zong

14
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,320
Do you know the elders?

15
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,400
We are from the same school after all

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
By the way, how is Senior Brother Yuan?

17
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,200
very good

18
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,520
Senior Brother Yuan is dead? How could this happen?

19
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,480
It's a long story

20
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,880
Do you want me to start over again?

21
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,120
In addition to teaching you swordsmanship, Senior Brother Yuan

22
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,880
Is there anything given to you?

23
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,600
No

24
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,520
For example, Ju Zi Ling

25
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,200
What is Juziling? Uncle

26
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,840
The Juzi Ling is the token of the Mohist Guild

27
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,000
Very valuable to all ink practitioners

28
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,880
But to ordinary people, they are nothing but rotten iron

29
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,760
Let me ask you again, Senior Brother Yuan really didn’t give it to you

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,240
Not really, uncle

31
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,680
But this sword...

32
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,000
This sword is because I want to mourn the old man Yuan Zong

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,760
He told me to use it and not to ruin this wooden sword.

34
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,440
I'll use it to keep me close

35
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,320
Since you and Senior Brother Yuan met by chance,

36
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,880
I don’t know the whereabouts of Ju Ziling, so I’ll take my leave.

37
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,560
uncle

38
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,560
Why is it so special?

39
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,320
Even if my senior brother dies, he doesn’t care.

40
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,400
He didn't even ask where he was buried, he only cared about the token.

41
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,960
I can’t believe it, so I’ll keep it myself.

42
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,480
I heard that the Juzi Order is related to the fate of the Mohists Guild.

43
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,720
Now among the Mohists

44
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,400
Someone is willing to pay a lot of money to get this order

45
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,160
But the world is so vast, how should we check it?

46
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,320
According to the tip, now Ju Zi Ling

47
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,040
It is very likely to fall in Wuzhi Ranch

48
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,640
In the hands of a man named Xiang Shaolong

49
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,920
if this is true

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,560
You have to try to steal the Ju Zi Ling

51
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,560
Do you know?

52
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,840
Kind and gentle, obey orders

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,520
I still don’t believe that Xiang Shaolong is really so noble.

54
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,280
To be able to face glory, wealth, and stunning beauty

55
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
Also unmoved

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,720
I believe everyone should have a price

57
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Xiang Shaolong is no exception

58
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,040
Before I met Xiang Shaolong

59
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,280
Ya'er's words to Mr. Hou

60
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,760
I was convinced at first

61
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,920
But after meeting Xiang Shaolong

62
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,560
Ya'er finally knows

63
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,360
There are exceptions to everything in the world

64
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,640
Madam also seems to have a good impression of Xiang Shaolong

65
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,120
No wonder Xiang Shaolong became

66
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,800
Your precious son’s master

67
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,600
Ya'er just thinks

68
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,960
Since Xiang Shaolong can’t be moved by any inducements or inducements,

69
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,120
It's better to be moved by emotion

70
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,440
Maybe after establishing friendship with each other,

71
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,120
It would be much easier to talk

72
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,120
Being able to be moved by emotion is not a bad thing

73
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,120
However, I am afraid that my wife will be moved by her feelings.

74
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,920
On the contrary, the true feelings will be moved

75
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,160
Mr. Hou can't trust Ya'er so much

76
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,840
Why did you ask Ya'er to seduce Xiang Shaolong that day?

77
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,440
How can I not trust my wife?

78
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,040
But any man who sees the woman he loves

79
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,880
throw yourself into someone else's arms

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,040
That kind of feeling is very uncomfortable.

81
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,960
Could it be that after Madam met Xiang Shaolong?

82
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,080
I'm beginning to dislike this prince.

83
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,160
Ya'er is just feeling unwell

84
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,680
When did the Marquis become so suspicious?

85
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,920
That's fine. Madam should know very well.

86
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,120
If you are disloyal to your lord, you will usually not end well.

87
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,240
So if you say you are qi deficient, you are qi deficient.

88
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,680
Hit him twice, then stop, hit harder, and shout out

89
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,920
Just think of it as beating Zhao De

90
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,440
Master, Pan'er has been practicing punching sandbags all morning

91
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,600
When can you teach me other kung fu?

92
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,120
You really have little knowledge, hitting sandbags is just to practice Qi

93
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,440
Qi training is a kind of inner strength and mental method

94
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,360
You always go out and be aggressive and cause trouble.

95
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,120
Don’t think you have dark skin

96
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,680
I can't see it until my nose is bruised and my face is swollen.

97
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,080
Pan'er rarely goes out to cause trouble these days.

98
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,640
Let's do this. From now on, if people don't offend me, I won't offend anyone.

99
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,520
Brat, should I tell you to stop?

100
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Please grow up a little and play more sandbags

101
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,960
Or go out and run fifty laps and do palm presses

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Or else paint landscape paintings in the room

103
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,320
Your mother will be happy to see you so obedient

104
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,120
Master, you care about my mother very much

105
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,560
Shut your head off and go make sandbags

106
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,480
Pan'er also knows that master and mother are upright.

107
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,960
To be honest, sometimes Paner wishes...

108
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,120
Go ahead and hit your head with sandbags. You are talking nonsense.

109
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,560
I know it's impossible

110
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,480
My mother is so infamous

111
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,400
You don’t know your mother very well

112
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,040
In fact, there is a reason why your mother did this.

113
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,720
But it doesn't matter what the reason is

114
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,080
The most important thing is that you clearly know

115
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,960
Your mother loves you very much

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,280
Otherwise, no one can tolerate what you do.

117
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,360
But I also know that you are very good to your mother

118
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,680
I don’t want to say any more about these profound words.

119
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,200
Lest I look like a 70-year-old

120
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,560
I will only say a little bit today

121
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,760
Master, you are still saying too little.

122
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,120
You still talk back, you brat, go and punch sandbags

123
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,240
One two three, three two one, one two three four five six seven

124
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,920
Two three four, four three two, four five six seven eight nine ten

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,600
One two three, three two one

126
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,800
Why are you here?

127
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,920
You didn't expect me to be here, did you?

128
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,840
You haven't answered me yet, why are you here?

129
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,760
I trampled your flower to death yesterday

130
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,360
So I came here today to help you plant flowers.

131
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,600
Let the servants do these heavy work

132
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
no need to trouble you

133
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,080
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

134
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,800
Besides, I did trample these flowers to death.

135
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,560
The so-called masculine man means that one person does things and the other takes responsibility

136
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,800
What's more, as you said

137
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,880
Of course men do this heavy work

138
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Stop talking, little rabbit

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,040
Is this how flowers are grown? Is it okay?

140
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,680
Bunny?

141
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,080
By the way, I don’t know your name yet

142
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,160
I was so happy yesterday when I saw you catching rabbits in the garden

143
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
I'll just give you a random name, Little Rabbit.

144
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,160
Should I call you A-Zhu, A-Mao, or A-Gou?

145
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,520
Besides, the name Xiaotu is very cute.

146
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,440
You call me Little Rabbit, then what should I call you?

147
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,160
My skin is brown, like a cow

148
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,480
Just call me Big Bull Turtle

149
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,560
How can anyone call themselves a big bull turtle?

150
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,440
By the way, smile more...

151
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,880
As the saying goes, smile every day and the world will be more beautiful.

152
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,880
By the way, laugh

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,640
You speak so strangely

154
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,800
This is not called weird, this is called avant-garde

155
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,440
I am definitely here with you

156
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,920
Unprecedented and unmatched

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,320
I have never seen a person who likes to praise himself so much

158
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,120
Would you say that the flowers you grow are not fragrant?

159
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,880
You must be careful when planting flowers, let me do it

160
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,800
Is it okay to plant flowers this way so that the roots are exposed?

161
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,160
If the roots are exposed, they will die soon.

162
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,960
What should we do?

163
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Bury deeper

164
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,200
Bury it deeper? Come and take a look

165
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,280
you…

166
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,880
Madam sir…

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,720
I asked her to teach me how to grow flowers

168
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,560
Why don't you go in and do some work?

169
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,360
yes ma'am

170
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,480
I didn’t expect Shaolong to be so interested in planting flowers.

171
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,600
I wonder if you are interested in traveling to the lake with me?

172
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,560
Lake tour? That’s fine too

173
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,920
You seem to be in a good mood today

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,360
On weekdays, Ya'er rides on a tall and large building boat.

175
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,960
Today I have the opportunity to sit on a bamboo raft

176
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,400
I just felt the joy of visiting the lake

177
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,200
Is this your first time sitting?

178
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,200
More than ten years ago, Yaer once sat on

179
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,880
and General Zhao Kuo

180
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,680
And Pan'er, he was just one year old back then

181
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,680
If I had known, I would have asked Pan'er to come with me today

182
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,280
It's a pity that in Pan'er's mind

183
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,320
My mother is not worth mentioning at all

184
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,960
Frankly speaking, Pan'er is in your mind

185
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,520
Why not give you a headache?

186
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,280
The quality of the relationship between mother and son depends on communication

187
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,280
communicate?

188
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,600
Communication, do you know what a ditch is?

189
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,000
Communication is...it determines whether children are good or bad

190
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,040
Care about communication and caring about communication

191
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,240
Actually you should...

192
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,480
You should spend more time chatting with Pan'er

193
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,400
Or use your love to care for him more

194
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,760
Use your body language more

195
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,160
to express your love and concern for him

196
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,400
It has already reached the meaning of communication.

197
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,400
Young dragon, you are neither a father nor a husband.

198
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Speaking of truth, it turns out to be clear and logical

199
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,640
Don't laugh at me

200
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,480
If you ask me out today, you won't just go rowing

201
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,840
Or maybe it’s as simple as talking about your experience in raising children.

202
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,640
There must be something going on, tell me

203
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,000
Shaolong, can you leave Handan as soon as possible?

204
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,840
Zhao Mu asked you to tell me?

205
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
It means Ya'er

206
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,600
You don't fit in this place at all

207
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,280
If you take precautions day and night, you will be harmed by an adulterer

208
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,400
Better to leave as soon as possible

209
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,960
I want to leave too, do you think I won’t leave?

210
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,960
There is something that has not been done before

211
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,720
I can't leave

212
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,400
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

213
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,360
I am entrusted by others, and I can’t do it if I don’t do it.

214
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,560
But you can't go back if you do it.

215
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,200
Do you want to take advantage of my relationship with Zhao Mu?

216
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,920
Find out where Qin’s protons are imprisoned

217
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,520
Yes, but I'm not familiar with you

218
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,240
It's not good to bother you.

219
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,680
So what exactly do you want to tell Ya'er?

220
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,160
I hope you leave Zhao Mu

221
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,720
Is it okay for Ya'er to leave Zhao Mu?

222
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,520
Why not?

223
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,480
Now that you're gone, I don't believe he can find you.

224
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,120
Is he really Skynet?

225
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,560
He has so much power

226
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,120
I go to the ends of the earth, but he can still find me

227
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,680
I'm in Zhao Mu's eyes

228
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,160
Just a plaything, a tool

229
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,560
Forget it... stop talking about these unhappy things

230
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,880
I'll teach you some fun things to do

231
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,640
I'll teach you how to play fifteen or twenty

232
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,520
What is it? Stretch out your hand first

233
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,560
This is ten

234
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,080
If I call you ten, you will win.

235
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,920
If you can't shout

236
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,440
For example, if I call ten and you put it away, you lose.

237
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,600
Do you really understand? Yes

238
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,880
If you lose, you have to jump into the water

239
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,160
As you say

240
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,840
Mrs. Ya’s inquiry into the whereabouts of Zhu Ji’s mother and son

241
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,960
Seems to really know nothing

242
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,520
At first I thought I could check the mouth of the prostitute

243
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,120
The result is again in vain

244
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,360
You must have been exposed by a whore

245
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,680
Miss, can you call me Mrs. Ya?

246
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,440
Don't keep calling whore

247
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,560
This is very disrespectful to others

248
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,120
Brother Xiang, will Mrs. Ya hide anything from you?

249
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,320
No way

250
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,640
I am her friend, why would you lie to me?

251
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,480
So what if I can trust others?

252
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,280
You, Xiang Shaolong, can’t believe it

253
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,040
Look at you

254
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,200
I have long been fascinated by that whore.

255
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,400
Fang'er, Shaolong help us rescue Proton

256
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,760
Already a lot of hard work

257
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,400
Don't mess around

258
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,160
Leave the matter to Shaolong, I believe he has a sense of discretion

259
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,080
How did your check go?

260
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,760
Zhao Mu's dog thief has more than a dozen villas and mansions

261
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,960
We sent people to investigate secretly

262
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,640
Nothing seems suspicious

263
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,080
Zhao Mu and Lian Jin, how are you following?

264
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,760
I've sent people to monitor you for a few days.

265
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,680
In addition to entering and exiting the Hou Mansion, he

266
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,280
Rarely go to other places

267
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,480
It's weird, they knew we were going to save the protons

268
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,080
I really didn’t even look at where the protons were trapped.

269
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,680
No way?

270
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,880
Maybe people think

271
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,920
The place where protons are imprisoned is safe enough

272
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,120
You don’t need to patrol frequently?

273
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,400
It's safest under your bed

274
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,320
We missed one place and didn't check it

275
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,480
how so?

276
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,960
Why does it look so much like an advertisement for some kind of insecticide water brand?

277
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,200
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

278
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,880
Madam please take a bath and change clothes

279
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,320
You go out, I don’t need anyone to serve you.

280
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,480
i won't hurt you

281
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,800
If you don't say anything, I'll let you go, okay?

282
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,520
Who sent you here?

283
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,040
Mr. Hou…

284
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,520
Madam, I'm here

285
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,880
Mr. Hou is so bad for arriving so late.

286
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,120
Isn’t this Lord here?

287
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,560
Lord Hou, don't be impatient

288
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,000
After bathing and changing clothes, serve the Marquis well

289
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,560
I am really anxious

290
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,720
Why don't we make out first?

291
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,320
Another mandarin duck playing in the water

292
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,760
Can't you just wait a while?

293
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,000
It’s hard for others to make a promise for Mr. Hou

294
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,760
I have been waiting for more than ten years

295
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,120
Who calls you Zhu Ji Tianxiang Guose

296
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,200
How can I be willing to send you back to Qin?

297
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,760
Shaolong, according to what you said, it was really dangerous at that time.

298
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,320
Yes, luckily that woman is smart

299
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,680
Otherwise I will be beheaded by Zhao Mu

300
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,200
But why would that woman help you?

301
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,480
I really don't know, maybe she is loyal enough

302
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,920
This is how justice is used to slaughter dogs every time

303
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The entertainment venue is full of loyal chickens

304
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

305
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,720
Are the chickens from the farm? Are they from the farm?

306
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,760
Lord of the castle, I’ll give you this ring back.

307
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,200
It seems that what Prime Minister Lu explained

308
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Don’t know when it will be completed?

309
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,920
Shaolong

310
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,840
Have you ever thought about the woman who just saved you?

311
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,760
Maybe it's Zhu Ji

312
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,840
Yes, why didn't I think of that?

313
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,440
Lord, do you have any photos of her?

314
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,760
no, her painting

315
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,120
have

316
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,840
Who is this?

317
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,280
This painting is from the last time I went to Xianyang

318
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,320
Prime Minister Lu personally gave it to me

319
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,800
Prime Minister Lu said

320
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,960
When he and his prince Yiren fled Handan,

321
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,240
When returning to Xianyang

322
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,080
He asked the painter to draw it from memory.

323
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
From memory

324
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,120
This Zhu Ji is the Zhu Ji from more than ten years ago

325
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,120
How to identify?

326
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,960
Brother Xiang, the woman you saw in Zhao Mu’s house

327
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,960
Is this the person?

328
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,320
How do I know? Women are far different from each other by ten years.

329
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,880
Now even if you say... just say it's her

330
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,920
Isn't it good? You can continue to have excuses

331
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,920
I went to meet that Mrs. Ya under the false pretense of public service.

332
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,680
What kind of pretense is for personal gain?

333
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,640
I just know that I have to do what I have to do

334
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,880
It's better than some people just sitting around and making irresponsible remarks.

335
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,320
You pervert, how dare you say something bad about me?

336
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,920
Let me show you what I am capable of

337
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,320
Error 504 (Server Error)!!1504.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

338
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,400
This time you, you perverted thief, still won’t obey me.

339
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,800
Adults walk slowly

340
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,440
Huns envoy

341
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,640
Fang'er

342
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,680
Why are you here?

343
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,840
I should ask you this question

344
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,000
Do you want to follow me?

345
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,640
Of course not

346
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,640
I heard that a group of Yelang jugglers came recently.

347
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,520
I will perform at the market these days

348
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,480
I wanted to go see it with you

349
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,360
Now that you are so busy, I won’t bother you anymore

350
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,640
Fang'er

351
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,560
The Marquis asked me to bring people to take the Xiongnu envoy back to his home.

352
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,960
But the Marquis did not say

353
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,600
You must escort me along the way personally

354
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,840
Okay, I'll accompany you to see the Yelang Show

355
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,480
good…

356
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,640
If you have something important to do

357
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,800
There is no need to accompany me

358
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,960
It would be bad if the Marquis blamed him

359
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,320
Mr. Hou will not blame me. Mr. Hou believes in me.

360
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,200
Leave it to me, no matter how big or small,

361
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,960
It's okay to walk away for a while

362
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,040
Does Mr. Hou really leave you responsible for everything, big or small?

363
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,840
So is there anything special happening recently?

364
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,320
there are many special things

365
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,080
Today I will be responsible for picking up a distinguished guest

366
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,440
Are you just responsible for picking up and dropping off VIPs every day?

367
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,760
Nothing else to do?

368
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,360
Of course not, in two days...

369
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,640
What will you do in the next two days?

370
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,000
You say I'm so confused

371
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,160
I obviously promised to watch the sideshow with you.

372
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,640
He took it to another place for no reason.

373
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,560
Don't say anything else, just watch the show

374
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,320
Come…

375
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,240
Thank you Mr. Pan for the reward, walk slowly...

376
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,440
No need to say more

377
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,520
I don’t have any money left to reward you.

378
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,560
Thanks

379
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,120
Want to leave? Teach him a lesson

380
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,880
pull him up

381
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,640
I thought you had that last name

382
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
What kind of powerful martial arts did you learn?

383
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,120
Turns out it’s just vulnerable

384
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,800
Wang Zijia, he insulted me that day

385
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,480
Today you must help me seek justice

386
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,920
Mr. Shao Yuan, don’t worry

387
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,360
This prince wants him to appear in front of everyone today

388
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,680
I kowtow ten times to apologize to you.

389
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
Not only that

390
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,280
I want him to drill my crotch in front of everyone

391
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,720
Bastard Zhao De

392
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,160
If you can't win, I'll find someone to support you.

393
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,720
If you want me to penetrate your crotch, don’t even think about it

394
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,640
This prince wants to support Mr. Shao Yuan today.

395
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,160
Let me see what else you can do

396
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,120
I also want to see how you dig your crotch

397
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,560
After you drill my crotch

398
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,680
Call me grandpa three more times and I will spare your life

399
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,960
Come…

400
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,040
Damn, calling you Grandpa Turtle is just fine.

401
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,560
That makes no sense, let me see how hard your bones are

402
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,360
let me go

403
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,800
Dead turtle eggs, little bastards

404
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,400
Damn turtle egg, little bastard, who are you calling?

405
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
Dead turtle eggs, little bastards

406
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,280
Wang Zijia, he relied on having a fictitious father as a backstage

407
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,880
I don't even pay attention to you

408
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,760
Zhao De, what are you talking about?

409
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,360
Everyone in Handan City knows

410
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,000
What is the relationship between your mother and Juluhou?

411
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
You also said

412
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,640
Don’t you want me to say it? I have to say it

413
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,520
Your mother is slutty and shameless

414
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,800
I have had relationships with all the men in Handan City

415
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,560
I won't allow you to insult my mother

416
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,960
You don't allow me to say it, but I insist on saying it

417
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,160
Your wife is nothing but a whore, a slut

418
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,600
Shut up

419
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,040
There is a shameless mother

420
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,040
There's a shameless little bastard

421
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,240
I feel sorry for you

422
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,360
Zhao Pan, don’t say that I won’t give you a chance.

423
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,400
You admit in front of everyone that your mother is a slut

424
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,280
I'll let you go so that you don't suffer the physical pain

425
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,360
Bah

426
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,160
You're so tough, give me a slap

427
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,200
How is it? Do you want to say it?

428
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,520
Your mother is a slut

429
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,200
You... hit again

430
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,960
Zhao Pan, listen carefully to me

431
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,760
Even if you have several fake dads, how thick is your backstage?

432
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,480
I will never take you seriously either

433
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,880
Because my life is different from yours

434
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,400
I am a prince today, and I will be a prince tomorrow

435
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,440
He will be King Zhao in the future

436
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,560
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

437
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,640
I really don’t know if I don’t tell you.

438
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,600
It turns out there is so much knowledge in growing flowers

439
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,640
When the flowers you plant bloom beautifully

440
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,080
You'll be happy, right?

441
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,760
Make me look for you everywhere

442
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,320
It turns out you came here again to learn how to grow flowers.

443
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
lady

444
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,320
I don't know how to plant flowers, I can only pick flowers

445
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,480
Then you should be more careful

446
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,720
Flowers planted in Lady Ya's Mansion

447
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,680
Not allowed to be picked by anyone

448
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,520
Really? Don’t worry, I won’t pick it at will.

449
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,200
At worst, I'll ask my wife to give it to me.

450
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,600
Oops... Madam, something happened to the young master.

451
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,600
go out

452
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,480
Pan'er, you got into a fight again

453
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,840
Look at you, being beaten like this

454
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,800
Look...don't move

455
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,640
It's nothing, just three or four stitches and it'll be fine

456
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,600
Get a needle and thread to sew for him

457
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,320
I asked you to sandbag with your heart.

458
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,040
He always goes out to cause trouble and won't listen no matter what he says.

459
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,760
What are you saying, if you didn’t teach me martial arts

460
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,600
Will I be beaten so badly?

461
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,840
Pan'er, you are wrong and don't know how to repent.

462
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,520
And put the responsibility on others

463
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,160
It's a waste of all your master's efforts on you.

464
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,760
Mom thought you had made some progress recently

465
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,280
Who knows you still don’t love yourself

466
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,080
I don’t love myself? What about you?

467
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,680
You're not much better than me

468
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,000
You are not upright at all. What right do you have to scold me?

469
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,320
you've gone too far

470
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,880
Stop for me

471
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,400
If you want to scold me, feel free to scold me, anyway, I...

472
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,960
Pan'er

473
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,280
Pan'er...

474
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,320
Doctor, how is Pan'er?

475
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,160
The young master was seriously injured this time

476
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,760
Fortunately, the ribs and internal organs were not injured yet

477
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,760
I believe that after he took the medicine

478
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:58,560
Take a good rest for a while, it should be fine

479
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,120
He still has a fever

480
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,240
Young Master's new injury has not healed yet

481
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:09,120
When the good and evil qi in the body compete with each other, heat will appear.

482
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,600
Madam, don't worry too much

483
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,200
Just be careful to prevent the young master from catching a cold

484
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,880
Of course nothing will happen

485
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,280
The villain goes to write the prescription first

486
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,680
As long as the young master drinks the medicinal soup, his fever will go away.

487
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,160
farewell

488
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,840
Follow the doctor to get medicine, yes

489
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,160
Don't worry anymore

490
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,120
He's so muscular, he should be fine if he takes a rest

491
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,400
Pan'er is right

492
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,040
I, a mother, am not in good health.

493
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,120
I have no right to blame him

494
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,760
How many times have I said this?

495
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,880
Whether children are good or bad depends on love and care

496
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,280
You two don't care about each other, of course not

497
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,000
Mother-in-law...

498
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,880
No matter what happens, the young master will definitely recover.

499
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,720
Madam, don’t blame yourself too much

500
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,680
Madam, dinner is ready, I don’t know…

501
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,760
go get something to eat

502
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,000
You go and have a meal, I want to be here with you

503
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,480
Okay, we'll leave the food for you, let's go

504
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,000
aunt

505
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,040
Has the princess not rested yet?

506
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,400
My aunt won't eat anything. How can this be okay?

507
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,600
Pan'er's fever hasn't gone down yet

508
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,040
How can I, a mother-in-law, eat this?

509
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,800
Even so, my aunt still needs to take care of herself

510
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,720
What if even my aunt is sick?

511
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:21,040
The food is just here. I'll eat it when I'm hungry.

512
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,760
I have to wait until Pan'er's fever goes away before I can feel at ease.

513
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,240
Princess, you don’t have to accompany me anymore

514
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,120
It's late, go and have some rest

515
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,760
The ginseng tea is here, Auntie, remember to drink it

516
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,840
Zhao De, shut up

517
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,280
I won't let you insult my mother again

518
00:32:53,080 --> 00:33:01,520
Mom is not a slut, you are not allowed to insult her anymore

519
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,320
It turns out you were beaten like this because of me

520
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:22,280
It’s all your mother’s fault for making you suffer so much.

521
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,600
Actually, I don’t want to be called a whore either.

522
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,480
I can't help myself

523
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,360
Ever since your father died, I...

524
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,000
I made you in front of other people

525
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,240
Can't hold one's head high and be a human being

526
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,400
I will only say that you are not making progress

527
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,640
In fact, I am the one who is not making progress.

528
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:14,680
Pan'er, do you know? Mom doesn't want to blame you

529
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:21,800
Mom is heartbroken that you were beaten like this

530
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,880
Pan'er, do you know?

531
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,920
The one my mother loves most is you

532
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,760
Mom never had a chance to tell you

533
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,400
How did my aunt know that grinding soybeans can make soup?

534
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,400
Don't think that my aunt only knows how to open her mouth after eating.

535
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,840
A few simple side dishes don’t bother me

536
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,320
Use soybeans to grind soup

537
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,200
It is very beneficial to Pan'er's muscles and bones.

538
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,680
If Cousin Pan knew that you cooked for him personally

539
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,120
will be very happy

540
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,800
Pan'er

541
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,680
You haven't fully recovered from your injuries yet

542
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,200
Are you going out so soon?

543
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
Yes, Cousin Pan

544
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,440
You'd better stay in the mansion and rest for more time.

545
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,440
Who said I want to go out

546
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,200
It’s just that I have been resting for so many days

547
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,800
I seem to be in good spirits today. I want to come out and practice some exercises.

548
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,160
Master said that you should practice Qigong diligently to keep your Qi and blood in harmony

549
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,320
The injury can be healed as soon as possible

550
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,240
Don't worry, every experience makes you wiser

551
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,720
Pan'er will never go out to cause trouble again.

552
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,600
Cousin Pan, do you know how nervous your aunt is about you?

553
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,440
Get up this morning and cook by yourself

554
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,120
If you want to practice, practice after breakfast

555
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,080
Don't let down your aunt

556
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,440
Okay, I'm a little hungry anyway

557
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,120
Practice after breakfast

558
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,720
Also, today’s breakfast should be treated as a farewell to the princess.

559
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,440
The princess will return to the palace tomorrow

560
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,040
The princess is leaving so soon?

561
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,520
When the princess lived in the mansion

562
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,240
You don’t play with the princess more often

563
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,080
The princess is going back to the palace, but she pretends to be reluctant

564
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,480
Princess, we will finish breakfast later

565
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,920
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

566
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,320
Recently a group of Yelang jugglers came

567
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,880
Their performance was wonderful

568
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,640
Guaranteed to be something the princess has never seen before

569
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,920
Really? Good

570
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,320
No, the princess is worth a thousand pieces of gold

571
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,320
How can you show your face and walk around?

572
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,280
If something happens to her outside

573
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,520
How do you tell your mother to your Majesty?

574
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,680
Why are you climbing so high?

575
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
Big Bull Brother

576
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,680
Are you okay? Come on

577
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,760
What are you doing climbing up there? Is there anything to see up there?

578
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,720
Or do you want to sneak away?

579
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,240
What? Madam, did you scold you again?

580
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,400
Tell Brother Daniu, Brother Daniu will help you stand up

581
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,080
Don't be afraid, come... sit down and tell me slowly

582
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,280
Sit down and tell Brother Daniel what happened.

583
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,160
I'm going back to the palace tomorrow

584
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,400
Return to the palace?

585
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,360
I won't have a chance to see you after I go back

586
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,240
Silly girl, I thought it was a big deal

587
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,600
Just returning to the palace

588
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,320
If you like, you can come out to play again in the future

589
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,600
you don't understand

590
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,000
After I go back, I feel like a caged bird

591
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,400
Not that scary, right?

592
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,960
Being a palace maid is not a slave

593
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,400
Do you know? I was born until now

594
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,360
This is the first time I leave the palace

595
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,400
Leaving the palace for the first time, come with me

596
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,200
Where to go?

597
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,080
Help you ask for leave from Madam

598
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,400
Asking for leave, no

599
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,440
Why not?

600
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,920
Don't worry, I'll take you out to play

601
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,240
Can't I just take you back tomorrow?

602
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,880
I left a note for Madam

603
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,320
Madam won't scold you, come here

604
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,960
Madam seems to have gone out

605
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,280
Out? Better, kill first and tell later

606
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,200
Just leave her a note. You can write, right?

607
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,920
You write whatever I say, tell her

608
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,280
Madam won't scold you, come on... don't worry...

609
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,680
The scenery when the sun goes down is so beautiful

610
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,760
After the sun goes down tomorrow, I will go back to the palace

611
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,440
Don't you want to go back?

612
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,560
How about I tell Mrs. Ya?

613
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,240
How about I keep you at Madam's house?

614
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,840
I'm afraid my wife can't make the decision on this matter either.

615
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,240
How about I tell my wife and ask her to redeem your life?

616
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,160
Redemption?

617
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,560
Redeem your body so that you can be free

618
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
No need to stay in the palace

619
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,480
Go out and see the outside world

620
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,880
Brother Danniu is really willing to take care of Little Rabbit

621
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,800
Go out and see the outside world

622
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,920
Of course, how could Daniel lie to Little Rabbit?

623
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,080
Brother Daniu, you are so good to Little Rabbit

624
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,880
Have you ever heard of the Cinderella story?

625
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,000
Cinderella?

626
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,120
You must have never heard of it

627
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,640
Brother Daniel, who is Cinderella?

628
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,080
Why is it so strange to be called Cinderella?

629
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,040
That girl is like this

630
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,200
In the end, the prince relied on these glass slippers

631
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,760
I went to meet the princess, and then we got together

632
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,320
The moral of this story is to tell everyone

633
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,680
As long as you have perseverance, an iron pestle can be ground into a needle

634
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,400
I believe you are just like Cinderella

635
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,120
I will always wait for the prince charming in your heart

636
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,480
Can a bunny do it too?

637
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,480
More than just a bunny

638
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,480
Big rabbit, medium rabbit, any rabbit will do

639
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,040
I have a pair of embroidered shoes

640
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,080
The glass slipper is gone and will be replaced temporarily.

641
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,360
When did you buy these embroidered shoes?

642
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,440
How come I don't know?

643
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,200
If I had told you earlier, would you have been surprised?

644
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,960
Very beautiful embroidered shoes

645
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,440
Auntie, what happened today has nothing to do with Brother Daniu

646
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,560
Don't blame him

647
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,280
Didn't Auntie ever think of asking you about your personal affairs?

648
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,320
But what you did today would be too willful.

649
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
What if something happens to you outside?

650
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,520
How do you tell your aunt to explain to the king?

651
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,440
As long as Brother Daniu is by Qian'er's side

652
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,160
It'll be absolutely fine

653
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,120
Besides, I have to return to the palace tomorrow

654
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,600
There will never be such an opportunity again.

655
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,400
I'm just worried about this

656
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,160
Since the princess knows that she will return to the palace tomorrow,

657
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,920
You shouldn’t get stuck in the mud anymore

658
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,240
Otherwise, only the princess herself will be harmed

659
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,480
Qian'er and Brother Daniu are just ordinary friends

660
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,400
What about the little rabbit?

661
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,680
bunny

662
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,160
Think about it

663
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,360
If Brother Big Ox knew that Little Rabbit was a princess,

664
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,840
What would he think?

665
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,120
Auntie, please don’t tell Brother Daniu

666
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,520
In the mind of Brother Daniel

667
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,000
The people who live in the palace are all unruly princesses

668
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,840
If he knew I cheated on him

669
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,680
He won't be friends with me anymore

670
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,200
Do you really value this friend so much?

671
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,800
Brother Daniel is a good man

672
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,600
He has never disliked my status as a palace maid

673
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,680
Besides, I'm trapped in the palace

674
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,000
No chance to make friends

675
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,840
I don't want to lose this friend too
