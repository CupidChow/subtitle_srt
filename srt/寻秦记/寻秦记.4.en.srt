1
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,040
You are worse than a scumbag

2
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,680
Stealing people's property, raping women and children

3
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,560
They will be struck by thunder from heaven, and they will have no children or grandchildren.

4
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,120
Because Brother Beard helped me catch that horse before

5
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,320
I saw you fighting with him, so I gave him a helping hand

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,000
Anyway, I did bad things with good intentions before.

7
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,120
Now make up for it

8
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,440
it hurts

9
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,760
This person is Zhao Mu’s number one swordsman Lian Jin

10
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Little slippery, stealing dragons and turning them into phoenixes

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,720
Do you think you will have laxatives?

12
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,720
The medicine is indeed effective

13
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,880
Lian Jin is indeed Lian Jin

14
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,840
I also take the jade pen with me when I go to the toilet.

15
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,640
I'm afraid we won't be able to start this time

16
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,760
wait a minute

17
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,080
Brother Xiang, why don't we just stun him?

18
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,000
Then steal the jade

19
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,800
Lian Jin is so clever

20
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
If he wakes up and finds that the jade is missing

21
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,200
It's troublesome, of course it's not good

22
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,360
Take...

23
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
Brother Xiang, what’s the countermeasure?

24
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,800
Anyway, you believe me, I have a way

25
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,680
Anyway, just wait and see the good show

26
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,120
Go up…

27
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,000
Young Master, Young Lady

28
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
Kill this thief for me

29
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,240
Everyone will stop

30
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,960
Miss, it was a misunderstanding, please discuss it slowly

31
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,120
Manager Tao Fang'er

32
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,760
Let Brother Wei help you teach this pervert a lesson

33
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,640
good

34
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,880
Young Master, no

35
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:46,920
Big brother

36
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,600
Watch out on the left

37
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,200
left, right

38
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,880
above, below

39
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,800
Get out of here

40
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,440
you lied to me

41
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,280
Master, are you okay?

42
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,360
Sorry...didn't mean to...

43
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,520
Come again

44
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,720
you have blackheads

45
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,680
You deserve a spanking if you bite your finger

46
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,760
If you come again, if you come again, I will use the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms

47
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
Dad... Master

48
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,320
Sir, I have something to report to you.

49
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,360
He is the thief who bullied his daughter

50
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,120
Dad, Tao Fang is so bold

51
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,680
He actually stole He's Bi with this lewd thief

52
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,920
Sir, that's not the case

53
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,080
No need to argue, just take it back and talk about it later

54
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,720
Lord Ubold, that's what the whole thing is like

55
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,080
nonsense

56
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,320
Lian Jin is a humble and benevolent gentleman

57
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,560
The indomitable swordsman

58
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,960
I will never collude with horse thieves

59
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,920
Not to mention exchanging the fake for the real and embezzling He's Bi

60
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,040
You defend him so much, are you dating him?

61
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,160
Don’t understand what dating is?

62
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,120
It's two people who love each other

63
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,080
Ridiculous, many quibbles

64
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,920
It was obviously a horse thief who robbed the Wu family's property.

65
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Trying to humiliate this lady

66
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,040
If things fail, I will pretend to save Mr. Tao

67
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,440
Now he is slandering Lian Jin everywhere, with ulterior motives

68
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,400
Forget it if you don’t believe it

69
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,320
I have Mr. Tao to vouch for me

70
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,000
Master, although my subordinates have not personally witnessed Lian Jin

71
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,760
Kill people in the village and seize He's Bi

72
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,360
This is basically what this pervert is talking about.

73
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,760
One-sided words are really unconvincing

74
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,760
Fang'er

75
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,400
Let Manager Tao continue.

76
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,920
The subordinates indeed witnessed Lian Jin in Changting Town

77
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,320
Call a jade craftsman

78
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,920
A piece of fake He's Bi

79
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,520
Lian Jin indeed carries the Heshi Bi

80
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,640
As for his intentions? His subordinates could not figure it out.

81
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,960
Why not take the opportunity to recapture He's Bi in Changting Town?

82
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,720
Because I want to play the long game and catch big fish

83
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,560
Figure this out slowly

84
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,920
What is the meaning of this statement?

85
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,000
Because I heard Manager Tao say

86
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,800
The route of escorting He Shibi this time is very confidential.

87
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
Only four people know

88
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,400
The Lord of Uborg, Manager Tao, and the Eldest Lady

89
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,080
And Zhao Mu

90
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,520
Apparently there is a traitor in Wujiapu

91
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,640
Ridiculous, Fang'er didn't tell anyone

92
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,840
That's it

93
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,280
It was basically Zhao Mu who asked the horse thieves to rob

94
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,480
Then send Lian Jin to kill the horse thieves

95
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,040
Take back He's Bi

96
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,360
It makes sense, Lian Jin settled in Zhao Mu's hotel

97
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,200
Apparently he was ordered by Zhao Mu

98
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,000
Of course, Lian Jin was basically helping Zhao Mu

99
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,720
Although Lian Jin took He's Bi to explain to Zhao Mu,

100
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,760
Unexpectedly, Lian Jin suddenly had a wrong idea

101
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,560
Find a craftsman to make a fake Heshi Bi

102
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,120
Then he embezzled He's Bi

103
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,960
As you say

104
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,880
You know the whole thing well and have the upper hand

105
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,840
Why didn't you expose them immediately?

106
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,840
denounce it directly

107
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,240
Because I want to take advantage of the situation

108
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,880
Use Lian Jin to safely transport He's Bi back to Handan

109
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,960
But He's Bi has fallen into the hands of others

110
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,760
Even if it arrives safely in Handan, it will not help.

111
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,840
The Wu family also committed a dereliction of duty, which is a capital crime.

112
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,840
Lord Wu Bao, don’t worry

113
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,800
I've already thought of a way for you

114
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,880
What can you do?

115
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,920
But I can’t say it yet, Lord

116
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,280
Rhetoric, there is no solution at all

117
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,040
I could have said

118
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,360
But because of your close relationship with Lian Jin

119
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sure it's not simple between you two

120
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
if i say it now

121
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,920
It would be bad if you go tell Lian Jin

122
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Castle Lord, let’s find a private time to talk slowly later.

123
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,840
You don't need to make excuses here, I'll call Lian Jin right away

124
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,160
Face to face and make it clear

125
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,520
No, if you say it, you will be betrayed.

126
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,160
What is cheating? Nonsense

127
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,360
Are you afraid that your lies will be exposed?

128
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,840
Castle Lord, I dare to guarantee it with my head

129
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,760
If the jade cannot be returned to Zhao intact tomorrow,

130
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,000
My head fell to the ground

131
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,200
Sir, I guarantee this with my life.

132
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,920
you…

133
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,560
Dad, brother, please say something

134
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,840
Dad, I think this Xiang Shaolong

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Mysterious identity, strange words and deeds

136
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,160
There must be many secrets inside

137
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,360
Why don't we torture him to extract a confession?

138
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,000
No need to be polite

139
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,960
Yes, torture

140
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,880
I'm at the mercy of the slaughter now

141
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,640
Just one day

142
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,560
If there is no miscalculation, I will have a solution tomorrow

143
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,280
Ask Zhao Mu and Lian Jin to hand over He's Bi

144
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,920
Dad, you must not be deceived by him

145
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,280
Now I have lost Heshibi

146
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,520
More than 40 people from Wujiabao will be implicated

147
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,920
You also know about forty lives

148
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,320
Now only the troops are in danger

149
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,520
Lord Wubao, do you believe me?

150
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,240
Okay, Wu Mou will give you one day.

151
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,080
Dad, you are relying solely on his one-sided words

152
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,360
Just hand over forty lives to him

153
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,760
No, I have to go find Lian Jin

154
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,200
Fang'er, stop, you are not allowed to leave the ranch for the time being.

155
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,600
And you can’t contact Lian Jin, you know?

156
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,320
Dad, you don’t even believe your daughter, you believe this pervert

157
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,800
Fang'er, you can't mess around anymore.

158
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,280
You disguise yourself and go out with Mr. Tao

159
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,520
Dad hasn’t punished you yet

160
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,120
Will is

161
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,000
You can't leave the ranch either, you know?

162
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,760
Me? Yes, Dad

163
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,200
Xiang Shaoxia, please go to the study with me

164
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,920
good

165
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,120
Whether he is a villain or a gentleman, you will know tomorrow

166
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,840
Brother Xiang, please

167
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,920
good…

168
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,640
What I want to raise is not a bunch of dogs that I am flattering.

169
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,240
Be a disciple of this prince

170
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,400
We must try our best to show our true skills

171
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,640
Cuju is not a game

172
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,200
Think of it as a battle formation on the battlefield

173
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,520
So we must win and come again

174
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,520
Mr. Hou, Zhongli’s leg bone seems to be broken.

175
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,840
It's really vulnerable, since it has no use anymore

176
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,280
Drag him out and chop off his feet

177
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,040
Lord Marquis, I still have a noble family to support.

178
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,520
Okay, just in case you are unfilial

179
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,800
Even your high hall has been buried, go away

180
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,600
Mr. Hou…

181
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,560
What a disappointment today, that's it for now

182
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,120
Mr. Hou, is everything done?

183
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,520
Everything has been done

184
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,920
crystal clear

185
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,200
It’s really the best of jade, a unique treasure

186
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,600
Obtaining this rare treasure is a great joy in life

187
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,920
But the most important thing

188
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,000
It can prevent Qin and Zhao from making peace

189
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,480
Zhao Guo couldn't get He's Bi

190
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,800
We will definitely not let Ying Zheng go

191
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,480
Qin returned He's Bi, but could not get Yingzheng

192
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,480
They will definitely send troops to attack Zhao Guo

193
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,000
When the time comes, Qin and Zhao will fight

194
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,160
What is most beneficial to our Chu country

195
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,040
Lord Marquis, you have made great contributions to Lord Chun Shen again.

196
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,440
You won’t lose a share of the credit this time

197
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,280
I will give you a good word for you.

198
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
Mr. Xie

199
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,280
Lord Marquis, please forgive me for speaking frankly.

200
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,720
Your Majesty sent Lord Marquis to the State of Zhao to lurk for many years.

201
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,680
Now King Zhao also obeys the advice of Lord Hou

202
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,280
Why don't the Marquis rebel as soon as possible and achieve great success?

203
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,440
Bold, I have always been loyal to you.

204
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,560
How dare you say something treasonous?

205
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,880
I only hope that Mr. Hou will achieve great success as soon as possible.

206
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,440
When the time comes, your Majesty will have your own instructions

207
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,320
You don't have to worry, just do your part

208
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,280
Yes, Mr. Hou

209
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,520
This treasure hunt is of great importance

210
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,920
Are you sure you didn't leave any survivors?

211
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,400
All the horse thieves in the village have long been gone.

212
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,720
but…

213
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,240
Tao Fang, the general manager of the Wu family

214
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,840
Before the subordinates arrive at the village

215
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,080
Already escaped, not knowing where to end up

216
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,840
Did anyone escape alive?

217
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,040
Mr. Hou can rest assured

218
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,400
Tao Fang only knew that it was a horse thief.

219
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,720
Absolutely no idea that the oriole is behind

220
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,320
Things will always go wrong

221
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,680
Lord Marquis, come to the palace tomorrow morning

222
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,200
If the Lord of Wubao fails to hand over He's Bi, it is already a capital offense.

223
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,600
Tao Fang, the general manager of the Wu family, failed to escort

224
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,800
Even if you return to Wujiapu

225
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,040
It will also end badly

226
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,400
This time Wushi lost the priceless Heshi Bi

227
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,320
I am afraid that only by killing the nine tribes can King Zhao be appeased.

228
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,640
About Wei and South Korea

229
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,840
Asking for an alliance with one's own country

230
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,960
Your Majesty, don't worry, I'll take care of it on my own

231
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,240
Your Majesty, this matter should not be delayed and a decision should be made early.

232
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Qin is a country of wolves and tigers, and a foreigner has just ascended the throne...

233
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,720
Doctor Feng

234
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,400
Your Majesty has handed over this matter to me.

235
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,160
You don't have to be nagging anymore

236
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,920
Lord Uburg arrives

237
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,800
Juluhou, what you say makes sense.

238
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,200
Has the Lord of Uborg arrived? Quick message

239
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,840
Yes, Your Majesty

240
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,800
Juluhou

241
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,160
This time the Qin State returned He's Bi to its own country.

242
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,400
What a surprise

243
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,640
Things are unpredictable, Your Majesty, don’t expect too much

244
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,480
Are you afraid that Qin will go back on its word?

245
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,000
Under Wu Yingyuan

246
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,360
Take Tao Fang, a general from the same family, to see the king

247
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,640
Lord Wubao, you don’t have to be polite

248
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,640
Where is He's Bi now?

249
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,960
I did not bring anyone with me to the palace

250
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,720
When you meet the king, you must bring He's Bi

251
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,720
The Lord of Uborg came empty-handed

252
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,080
Do you want to deceive the king?

253
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,120
Your Majesty, please listen to Tao Fang’s explanation.

254
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,120
Say it quickly

255
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,000
The villain was ordered to escort He's Bi from Qin back to Zhao

256
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,720
But when they were about to reach Handan, they encountered horse thieves.

257
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,360
He Shibi was robbed by horse thieves

258
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,240
Heshibi was robbed by horse thieves?

259
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,840
It’s really a shameful thing to entrust to someone. He’s Bi is priceless.

260
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,520
You failed to escort me well and were taken away by mistake

261
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,240
Should be sentenced to death

262
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,920
How unreasonable

263
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,360
Your Majesty, there is more to this matter

264
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,480
Your Majesty, please introduce me to someone.

265
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,680
Who?

266
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,080
He is a young knight named Xiang Shaolong

267
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,160
With this person's help, He's Bi was saved.

268
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,720
Quick pass to Xiang Shaolong

269
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,520
Lord Wubao, are you trying to be mysterious?

270
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,960
Since He's Bi was lucky enough to be preserved,

271
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,280
Why not submit it immediately?

272
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,840
See the king

273
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,800
Tell me quickly, where is He's Bi now?

274
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,520
at his home

275
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,400
Nonsense

276
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,480
It is indeed in the Marquis's mansion

277
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,240
What is the meaning of this statement?

278
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
In fact, He's Bi was successfully recovered this time.

279
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,960
It's entirely his fault

280
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,840
He first sent Lian Jin to Mazhai to kill all the bandits.

281
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,600
Then put the He's Bi in your own home

282
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,040
He knows things like a god

283
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,080
I couldn't help him even though I wanted to.

284
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,480
He could just go and set up a stall to read photos.

285
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,840
Julu Hou, are you serious about this?

286
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,040
Why don't you make it clear early on

287
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,760
I think he wants to give you a surprise

288
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Scare you

289
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,160
Bold Juluhou

290
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,800
He actually made a fool of himself and made fun of others

291
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,080
He's simply audacious

292
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,680
Please forgive me, Your Majesty

293
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,200
What are you guilty of?

294
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,560
Julu Hou, you have made great achievements

295
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,160
Prepare your horse immediately

296
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,160
I will go to your house immediately to welcome He Shibi

297
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,160
I dare not bother the king, so I will go back to the mansion immediately to get it.

298
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,680
No need, I can't wait anymore

299
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,520
Quickly spread the news that the descendants of the He family are traveling together

300
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,200
The two Qing family members also traveled with the widow's chariot and horse.

301
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
Thank you, Your Majesty...

302
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,480
Brother Xiang, you are so witty

303
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,160
It is indeed much more transparent than the fake one in the palace.

304
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,240
He is the king

305
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,640
You are the only one who has seen this jade

306
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,600
Please identify it for me. I obey.

307
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,360
Kiya...

308
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,520
Congratulations, one look at you

309
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,280
Both handsome and wise

310
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,520
You must be his assistant

311
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,760
You have indeed made a great contribution by finding the Heshi Bi.

312
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,640
Remember to treat me to a meal, you know?

313
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,800
your hands are so wet

314
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,600
Are you nervous? Relax

315
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,680
He family, which one is true and which one is false?

316
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,800
Originally on the edge of jade

317
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,160
There is a tiny fetal stain

318
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,280
has disappeared now

319
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,480
Fake?

320
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,280
No, this is the authentic Heshi jade

321
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,240
I heard that King Qin Zhao was alive

322
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,240
Likes to hug He Shibi while sleeping

323
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,480
Biyu absorbed the popularity of King Zhao

324
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,640
So even a little bit of fetal stain has disappeared.

325
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,320
Congratulations, king

326
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,640
He's Bi finally fell into the hands of a few people

327
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,080
The Lord of Wubao, the Marquis of Julu has made great contributions to the people.

328
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,920
Tomorrow we will hold a banquet in the palace

329
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,320
Thank you to the two noble families

330
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,560
Thank you, Your Majesty...

331
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You are familiar with Miss Wu family

332
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,280
Did he collude with Wu Yingyuan to frame me?

333
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,360
The subordinates will only be loyal to the Marquis

334
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,600
No different intentions

335
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,560
But how do you explain this?

336
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,160
I just blame my subordinate for being careless

337
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,440
Didn't realize that Wushi sent people to follow his subordinates

338
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,920
You've always been smart

339
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,840
Why don't you notice that you are being followed?

340
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,480
Do you have any other feelings?

341
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,840
If my subordinates intend to murder the Marquis,

342
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,640
You should offer jade to the king in private

343
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,760
If one of my subordinates has an affair with Wushi

344
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,080
There is no need to hand over He's Bi

345
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,680
Subordinates kneel down to plead guilty to show their loyalty and courage.

346
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,680
You'd better remember your identity and status

347
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,080
Never try to eradicate me

348
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,800
can be replaced

349
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,080
The subordinates will only serve the Lord and the Marquis with all their heart.

350
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,200
I hope your words and deeds will be consistent, get up

351
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,400
Mr. Xie

352
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,920
Now that Wu Yingyuan has learned that this Marquis has privately collected He's Bi,

353
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,520
Not only did he report the slander, but he also gave the credit to me.

354
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,960
Really ulterior motives

355
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,280
And Xiang Shaolong is not a simple person either.

356
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,920
Wu Yingyuan relied on herding war horses for Zhao Guo.

357
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,640
Don't take this prince seriously

358
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,280
He also targets me at every turn

359
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,000
I must punish him

360
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,440
Sooner or later, Wujiapu must be eliminated

361
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,920
You are familiar with Miss Wu family

362
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,440
Just make good use of this chess piece

363
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,360
Yes, Mr. Hou

364
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,120
Xiang Shaoxia, thanks to your ingenious plan this time

365
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,240
Otherwise, Wu Mou would have been dead.

366
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,640
Lord Wubao, you are too polite.

367
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,440
In fact, everyone worked well together this time

368
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,280
Only then will there be such a good effect

369
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,040
Brother Xiang is not only witty

370
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,240
Be a humble and trustworthy person

371
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,680
He is truly a rare gentleman

372
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,080
Is he a gentleman? I said he is simply a thief

373
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,400
Fang'er, don't be rude.

374
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,240
Xiang Shaoxia, please sit down. Okay

375
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,600
That's right, compared to your crush Lian Jin

376
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,800
I am indeed not as gentlemanly as he is.

377
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,320
The peep show was torn down and he still kept his appearance.

378
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,120
Brother Xiang, what is a diorama?

379
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,120
The peep show was a treacherous trick that was discovered

380
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,600
I see

381
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,760
He must be furious this time

382
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,920
Steal the chicken but lose the rice

383
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,280
I feel so happy when I think of the expressions on Lian Jin’s master and servant’s faces

384
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,320
I sat

385
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,920
Brother Xiang, this seat is mine

386
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,000
Your seat is over there

387
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,160
Xiang Shaoxia, please take a seat. Okay.

388
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,080
Xiang Shaoxia’s wise words just now

389
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,120
It's really apt description

390
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,120
In addition to being furious this time, he

391
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,160
We should also smash the fake He's Bi.

392
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,520
Dad, Lian Jin will never exchange fake for real.

393
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,800
Embezzling He's Bi

394
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,960
Don't listen to this pervert's nonsense

395
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,320
But the fact is before us

396
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,200
Dad, the origin of this thief is unknown at all.

397
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,320
He might be a spy. Don't let him deceive you.

398
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,120
Dad, there is something unclear about my child

399
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,240
Now that we know that Zhao Mu secretly exchanged He's Bi,

400
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,520
We can tell the truth

401
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,720
It is a capital crime to deceive the king

402
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,360
Can't we use this to eradicate Zhao Mu?

403
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,760
Dad has also considered this matter

404
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,040
But our greatest purpose

405
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,120
It is to rescue the proton and return to Qin safely.

406
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,480
Moreover, Zhao Mu’s power overturned the state of Zhao

407
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,640
Even the king wants to avoid him

408
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,200
If he is forced too hard on this matter,

409
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,120
Might be bad for protons

410
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,840
So Xiang Shaoxia’s plan can be said to be the best of both worlds

411
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,960
Lord Wubao is so complimentary.

412
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,920
Dad, my daughter is unwell. Please forgive me for being with her.

413
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,920
I have been waiting for you at the East City Gate for two hours.

414
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,880
I just saw the banner too

415
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,360
What's the urgent matter for brother Lian to ask Fang'er?

416
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,120
I heard you were robbed by horse thieves

417
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,040
So I'm a little worried

418
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,560
Fang'er wants to know

419
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,080
Did Brother Lian go to the village to kill horse thieves?

420
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,480
Seize the He clan's jade

421
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,600
have

422
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,280
I was ordered by the Marquis, so I couldn't help myself

423
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,320
Mr. Hou knows things like a god

424
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,240
He's afraid that your Wu family doesn't have enough troops and will make mistakes.

425
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,760
So I was sent to pick him up

426
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,920
As a result, I encountered a horse thief in Changting Valley.

427
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,400
Even if I want to get back He's Bi

428
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,200
There is no need to kill all the horse thieves

429
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,640
Unless you have selfish motives and want to keep silent

430
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,120
Because I know they disrespect you

431
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,040
Even rude, so I killed them all

432
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,560
Why exchange falsehood for truth on the way?

433
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,320
Substituting the fake for the real is just a safety measure

434
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,680
In case someone robs you on the way

435
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,280
What is lost is just fake

436
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,000
Why did Zhao Mu get He's Bi?

437
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,480
Not presented to the king

438
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,240
Do you want to trap the Wu family into injustice?

439
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,480
I was just following the order of the Marquis to take back He's Bi

440
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,040
As for what the Marquis’ intention is?

441
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,480
I don't know

442
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,680
But if the Marquis does not present He's Bi

443
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,120
And framed by the Wu family

444
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,360
I will definitely stand up and tell the truth

445
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,360
really?

446
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
Absolutely no lies

447
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,880
Fang'er has long believed that Brother Lian

448
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,560
I will never embezzle He's Bi.

449
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,320
That pervert wants to slander Brother Lian

450
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,120
Which thief?

451
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,760
Xiang Shaolong

452
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,600
It was he who teamed up with the group of thieves to seize Heshi Bi.

453
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,720
Being rude to Fang'er in the cottage

454
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,720
He has been following Brother Lian and slandering him to his father.

455
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,240
He also secretly gave laxatives to Brother Lian

456
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,280
I see, no wonder I had a stomachache that night

457
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,880
This Xiang Shaolong is really cunning

458
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Fang'er wants to peel off his skin and pick out his bones

459
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,280
Miss Wu, there is no need to be angry

460
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,360
If I have the chance, I will definitely help you out.

461
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,440
good

462
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,160
Brother Lian no longer needs to keep calling Miss Wu

463
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,720
Just call me Fang'er

464
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,600
OK, Finger

465
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,440
Brother Xiang, how is it?

466
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,960
The clothes are already made and there are buckles

467
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,760
this

468
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,760
Thank you, guest

469
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,280
I don’t know if the guest officer needs to be behind the scenes.

470
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,040
Make a famous name

471
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,800
Okay, please spell it out

472
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,320
Just a moment

473
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,200
The two guests can go to the teahouse in front to have a bowl of tea first.

474
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,440
How much?

475
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,680
Very cheap, twenty dollars

476
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,320
You come and pick up the goods and then pay.

477
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,000
Quite honest, okay, see you later, let's go

478
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Brother Xiang, what do you mean by what you just said?

479
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,440
There will be a period soon

480
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,440
The two guest officers take a look casually

481
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,240
The engraving on this buckle is very special and exquisite.

482
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,840
Brother Lian, look

483
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,240
Very suitable for you, buy it

484
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,760
Okay, boss, I want to buy this buckle

485
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,160
Sir, I'm sorry

486
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,120
This buckle has been bought by someone

487
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,440
Someone bought it

488
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,680
I pay double the price

489
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,000
Be true to your word

490
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,600
ten times

491
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,000
Sir, you'd better choose another one.

492
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,640
Is there anything exactly the same as this one?

493
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,520
Our store's buckles are unique

494
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,240
Really disappointing

495
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,520
Twenty times the price

496
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,800
Sir, money is not everything

497
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,680
But if you don’t have money, you can’t do it.

498
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,120
Miss

499
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,960
Since this uncle likes this buckle so much

500
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,360
Just sell it to him for twenty times the price.

501
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,880
Besides, this old man smiled for Bo's beauty

502
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,720
How could I let him down with this beauty?

503
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,440
Thank you, four hundred dollars, uncle

504
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,400
Thank you, guest officer…

505
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,840
It's better to meet by chance than to invite, and it's better to have a meal together.

506
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,960
Thanks

507
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,920
Is this your first time to Handan City, Brother Xiang?

508
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,440
so to speak

509
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,160
I'll be the host for this meal, so you're welcome

510
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,800
No need, I have to spend money on my brother

511
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,040
Everyone just pays what he deserves.

512
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
To each his own?

513
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,600
Everyone pays his own way is my country dialect

514
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,160
It means you pay your own money

515
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,440
I see

516
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,360
Brother Xiang’s accent is so unique

517
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,840
Where is the unknown hometown?

518
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,080
Hongkong

519
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,920
Hongkong?

520
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,400
Stop talking about this. Is there anything delicious here?

521
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,760
It's already written on it

522
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,520
Stop playing tricks on me

523
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,800
You know I can't understand your words

524
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,560
If you don't mind, why don't I take the order?

525
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,400
What are your orders? Two pounds of wine.

526
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,880
Brother Xiang is brave and resourceful. In these troubled times,

527
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,760
If you can find a wise king to show your talents,

528
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,040
Will definitely become famous all over the world

529
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,680
I still prefer to be free

530
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,120
How can you be as broad-minded as my brother-in-law?

531
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,160
Find an owner to follow up with

532
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,000
Brother Xiang defected to Wujiapu

533
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,480
Isn’t it a follow-up?

534
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,440
No, I can leave at any time

535
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,400
Brother Xiang's way of eating is really unique

536
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,160
I heard that uncivilized southern barbarians eat like this.

537
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,680
We in southern China use chopsticks

538
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,560
This method of eating with a knife and fork

539
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,000
Only used in Western countries

540
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,840
Ridiculous, I once went to Xianyang, the state of Qin in the west

541
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,120
Never seen the weird utensils in your hands

542
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,640
Little girl knows little

543
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,480
The West I am talking about is a West further west than Qin

544
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,360
nonsense

545
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,640
Even eldest brother and Manager Tao have traveled around the world

546
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,160
They are all well-informed people

547
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,520
Have you ever seen it?

548
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,040
I really haven't seen it

549
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,800
Sorry for my ignorance

550
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,920
I've never seen such a strange fork

551
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,920
No, sir

552
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,040
You spilled rice wine on me

553
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,120
I didn’t even blame you

554
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,960
I just want to kiss Fangze, no

555
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,280
Toast, don’t drink, drink as punishment

556
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,320
This is really unreasonable

557
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,200
Brother Lian, go over and teach him a lesson

558
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,720
I don't know what happened before

559
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,160
Don't mind your own business

560
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,360
It's obvious that he is a big pervert who is teasing women from good families.

561
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,200
Don't mess with him, he's a young master

562
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,720
His mother is Mrs. Huang Meiya

563
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,120
And Zhao Mu is backing him, so he can’t be offended

564
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,480
Spare your life, young master... drink...

565
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,640
Are you okay? It's okay

566
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,640
bull riding…

567
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,960
You just spilled your wine on the girl

568
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,880
I don’t blame you, I just want to ride the bull

569
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,000
Scream, sir, no

570
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,880
Master, please spare my life. Master, please let me go.

571
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,560
Please let me go quickly, call it like this

572
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,160
What does this young master’s business have to do with you?

573
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,320
It’s not called, is it? This cheng is good

574
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,760
Scream or not... spare your life

575
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,600
Louder, please forgive me

576
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,880
By the way...a bit sadder

577
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Spare your life, sir

578
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,200
Okay, you look so good

579
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,320
Apologize to the girl now

580
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,080
This strong man, let it be done...

581
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,560
No apology...I'm sorry...

582
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,560
Be louder, be happy

583
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,760
Sorry, louder

584
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,440
Sorry, be louder

585
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,360
sorry

586
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,320
Brother Xiang, forget it

587
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,480
I see that you are very well behaved today.

588
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,760
I've had enough riding

589
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,160
Don't do this next time, you big pervert

590
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,840
Don’t let me see you again in the future

591
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,440
I should have said what he said

592
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,680
I'm afraid there will be more trouble in the future

593
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,480
Have you ever heard that the emperor committed the same crime as the common people?

594
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,040
Can he act unscrupulously just because he is the emperor's sister's son?

595
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,120
That's right

596
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,840
Did I hear correctly?

597
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,240
For the first time, the eldest lady agreed with my words

598
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,440
This young master Pan’s evil words and deeds

599
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,880
The whole of Handan knows

600
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,000
This time he learned a lesson, which was really satisfying

601
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,480
Brother Xiang is brave enough to do what is right, I really admire him

602
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,880
Maybe you are new to Handan

603
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,400
I don’t know the sentiments of the people here

604
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,400
There are some people here who should be avoided

605
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,080
If you push ahead, you will only be self-defeating

606
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,480
I beg you...this is your salary this month

607
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,560
You go back to the countryside and farm the fields.

608
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,240
Boss, you pity me

609
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,000
The fields in the countryside are not cultivated enough to make a living.

610
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,840
You have offended Mr. Pan

611
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,200
If you don't leave, we won't be able to do business here anymore.

612
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,560
You should pity me and please leave quickly...

613
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,720
That girl just needs to be bullied by Young Master Pan

614
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,280
Or just apologize and beg for mercy, and everything will be fine.

615
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,800
Now she has lost her job

616
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,520
Might starve to death on the streets

617
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,680
Or be forced to sell to a place of drinking and prostitution

618
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,040
Her fate is even more tragic

619
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,440
Please untie the sword and wait here for a moment.

620
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,840
He also said that there was music to listen to, dancing to, and food to eat.

621
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,000
There's nothing, and we're trapped here

622
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,760
This is the place where you wait to be summoned

623
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,600
I'm going to the toilet

624
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,160
Be careful to get lost

625
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,000
Thanks

626
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,160
Where is the toilet?

627
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,240
Go straight, turn left, then turn right

628
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,640
Across the corridor, next to the kitchen is the toilet.

629
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,040
Thanks

630
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,000
Dad, I want to find...

631
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,240
Do you want to find your soulmate?

632
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,400
soon

633
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,280
come back soon

634
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,960
Go straight, turn left, then turn right

635
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,960
Across the corridor, next to the kitchen is the toilet

636
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,440
Don't lie to me, eunuch

637
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,840
Xiaobai, don't run

638
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,360
Xiaobai, come here

639
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,360
Madam, where is the bathroom?

640
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,320
Xiaobai...don't run

641
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,360
Xiaobai, come here, danger

642
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,080
noob…

643
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,440
Working

644
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,280
Found it, great

645
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,360
Otherwise, I will be blamed by the queen again

646
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,800
He is...

647
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,320
let's go

648
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,000
Don't I need to go to the toilet?

649
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,320
Princess

650
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,280
Tingfang, you finally came back from Qin

651
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,280
I waited so hard for you

652
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,040
What did you experience in Xianyang?

653
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,600
Did you encounter any thrills along the way?

654
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,840
Have you ever encountered bandits?

655
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,600
What gifts did you receive from Qin?

656
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,800
Is there Qian'er's share?

657
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,720
It's a long story, please let me have it easy

658
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,160
I envy you so much

659
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,160
I envy you that you can travel around and experience things

660
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,600
There are also many people who envy you for your golden branches and jade leaves.

661
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,280
The glorious princess

662
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,360
The princess is like a caged bird, unable to leave the palace

663
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,160
What is there to envy?

664
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,520
Everyone has their own merits

665
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,720
The king has the airs of a king

666
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,400
A high official has the authority of a high official

667
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,400
The princess has the nobility of a princess

668
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,680
Look at you, you're always wearing palace maid's clothes

669
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,640
I must be feeding the rabbits again

670
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,160
I didn’t know the truth, so I thought you were a palace maid.

671
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,600
Look at how I'm dressed today, I look more like a princess than you do

672
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,120
Even if you dress up beautifully, no one will appreciate it.

673
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,080
Stop talking about this, what does Qin know?

674
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,960
Tell me, you will be very happy

675
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,720
There are not many happy things

676
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,760
But there are more things to be angry about

677
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,240
I met a thief

678
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,160
A thief?

679
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,320
This pervert is despicable and shameless

680
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,080
This time I got He's Bi back.

681
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,640
Thanks to the dedicated efforts of Lord Wubao and Marquis Julu

682
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,160
Their disciples Xiang Shaolong and Lian Jin

683
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,120
He is a rare talent, which is really gratifying.

684
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,280
Congratulations to the king for getting back the treasure

685
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,880
This time I finally lived up to my expectations.

686
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,080
Your Majesty, Prime Minister Lu hopes that the two countries will be reconciled.

687
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,960
Since the State of Qin kept its word, it sent back He's Bi

688
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,760
I also hope that the king will keep his promise

689
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,880
Sending Ying Zheng’s mother and son back to Qin

690
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,800
What Lord Wu Bao said is true

691
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Your Majesty, what Lord Wu Bao said is wrong.

692
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,120
He's Biben is a treasure of the State of Zhao

693
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,840
At that time, King Zhao of Qin threatened and deceived

694
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,400
Promise to exchange fifteen cities for this treasure

695
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,360
At that time, Shangqing Lin Xiangru

696
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,520
Although he is both wise and brave, he does not disgrace the national constitution.

697
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,160
But he was still regarded as an old fox by King Zhao of Qin

698
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,320
Secretly pretending to be real and deceiving the country

699
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,080
The State of Qin is so unkind and unjust, and has broken its promise before

700
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,400
Now the king does not need to keep his word to Qin

701
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,800
Besides, there was no covenant in this matter

702
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,880
Even if we don't send the proton back

703
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,080
Qin can’t do anything to us

704
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,520
how can you say that

705
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,520
That means you can go out and fool around behind Mrs. Ling's back

706
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,480
Madam Ling no longer has to keep her chastity

707
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,960
You can go out and have an affair

708
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,840
How dare you insult me?

709
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,560
sorry

710
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,200
Your Majesty, the people of Qin have strong horses and strong soldiers, and they have many generals.

711
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,200
If the king breaks his promise and angers Qin,

712
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,640
Therefore, sending troops to attack Zhao is not a blessing to Zhao.

713
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,800
Your Majesty, Lian Jin has a foolish opinion. Tell me quickly.

714
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,640
Qin is a country of wolves and tigers

715
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,200
And they continue to use troops to attack foreign countries and conquer cities and territories.

716
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,400
Ruoran, the king will return the hostage

717
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
Qin will definitely use troops against Zhao

718
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,800
And no worries

719
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,520
Now the King of Qin and Lu Buwei attach so much importance to proton politics

720
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,320
Don't hesitate to exchange He's Bi

721
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,400
If Zhao Guo has a proton in hand,

722
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,760
Qin must be wary of using troops against Zhao

723
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,320
Never dare to act rashly

724
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,800
Lian Jin said it well

725
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,280
No, Your Majesty, if you really don’t let me go

726
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,760
When Qin really attacks, wouldn't it be very miserable?

727
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,680
Your Majesty, what Xiang Shaoxia said makes sense.

728
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,080
Lord Wubao is always worried about Qin

729
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,240
Could it be that Lord Wubao has colluded with Qin?

730
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,640
Why did the Marquis say this?

731
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,200
Your Majesty, I am loyal to you.

732
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,400
Please, Your Majesty, take a closer look

733
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,440
There is no need for you two good ministers to argue anymore.

734
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,920
Now He's Bi is in hand

735
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,600
As for the protons, we will decide later.

736
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,440
Come and have some singing and dancing

737
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,840
Wait a minute

738
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,320
Your Majesty, I have a suggestion

739
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,160
please say

740
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,320
Lian Jin, a disciple of Weichen

741
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,280
and Xiang Shaolong, the main gatekeeper of Wubao

742
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,680
A swordsman with superb swordsmanship

743
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,440
Why not invite the pair to perform impromptu to spice things up

744
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,240
Good suggestion. Come on, get your sword.

745
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,240
Your Majesty, Lian Jin has a request

746
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,120
It's too monotonous to play swordsmanship alone

747
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,840
I want to invite Xiang Shaolong to compete with me

748
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,880
Okay, guard, get another sword.

749
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,880
King, you are so handsome

750
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,320
It's better to invite the girl to dance.

751
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,040
What’s so cool about dancing with knives and guns?

752
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,840
Be bold, you dare to go against the king's will

753
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,720
This is really unreasonable

754
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,760
Do you want to behead? Kneel down

755
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,000
Your Majesty, Xiang Shaolong is a grassroots man in the mountains.

756
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,480
I don’t understand etiquette, please forgive me.

757
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,120
Please forgive me, Your Majesty

758
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,840
The king's golden mouth has been opened. He will resist the decree without using a sword.

759
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,560
If you resist the decree, your head will fall to the ground. Come here.

760
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,160
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

761
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,920
Your Majesty, I mean

762
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,080
Dancing with knives and guns is too dangerous

763
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,400
It would be bad if it bleeds

764
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,200
It’s both disappointing and unlucky, and it also hurts the harmony.

765
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,120
What I'm most worried about is

766
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,840
With such a handsome appearance, the king

767
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,840
It would be bad if such a ridiculous thing got spread.

768
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:15,120
It sounds unreasonable, but it seems to make sense

769
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,920
It is indeed unlucky to splatter the palace with blood, so retreat

770
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,320
Your Majesty, I think dancing with swords and guns is too childish.

771
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,840
Let's play a more exciting game, shall we?

772
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,760
But I wonder if Brother Lian has the guts to play?

773
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,120
What is it?

774
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,640
This game is very simple

775
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,720
Let’s get a fruit first

776
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,840
Then put the fruit on the other person's head

777
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,240
Draw your sword and chop it down

778
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,120
If you don’t lose your hair or bleed, you win.

779
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,720
On the contrary, you lose

780
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,880
quite interesting

781
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,240
Interesting, right? Why don't I go first?

782
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,800
Brother, please lend me a sword

783
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,520
Why don't I go first?

784
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,880
King, I have already put it away

785
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,800
Brother Xiang

786
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,920
Don't worry, Brother Lian is so smart

787
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,600
He won't make me bleed

788
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,280
And made his own head fall to the ground

789
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,160
Brother, it’s time to start

790
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,920
Do you want to chop or not?
