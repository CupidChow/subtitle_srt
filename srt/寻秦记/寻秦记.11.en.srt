1
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,360
Fang'er

2
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,960
Thank you for having the nerve to call me

3
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,040
I slapped you last time

4
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,040
Do you think I'm not strong enough?

5
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,280
Do you want a few more slaps?

6
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,160
Aniu, what are you standing for? Hurry up and do the work

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,160
Lian Jin

8
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,600
I haven't settled the accounts with you about what happened at Tianxiang Tower last time.

9
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,880
You actually colluded with that bastard Zhao Mu

10
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Forged a treason letter to frame my father for injustice

11
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,880
Are you still a human being? I don’t want to see you in the future

12
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,960
I really didn't expect it

13
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,280
You, the eldest lady of the Wu family, are quite anxious.

14
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,280
Do you think I only lose my temper?

15
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,720
You have to thank me this time

16
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,000
Isn't it? Thank you very much?

17
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,800
What are you doing? Do I look ugly?

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,040
A beautiful person can be prettier even if she wears a piece of cloth casually

19
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,640
I'm not as glib as you

20
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,240
Gong...Xiaoqian, you will stay here for the time being.

21
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,840
I'll find a more comfortable place for you later

22
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,800
It's very comfortable here too

23
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,960
You have your awesome brother to accompany you

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,680
You feel comfortable wherever you live

25
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,440
Miss Wu...

26
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
Uncle Wu, Aunt Wu

27
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,080
Miss Wu

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,680
Necessities for daily life are included here

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,440
Do you think your friends are enough?

30
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,840
I'm really sorry to bother you two this time.

31
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,440
Miss Wu, don't say that

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,080
Your Wu family’s favor to us

33
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,400
We will never be able to repay you in this life.

34
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,920
It's so rare to have this opportunity now.

35
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,360
Xiaoqian, Uncle Wu and Aunt Wu are very nice people.

36
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,560
If you need anything after you settle in, just ask.

37
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,800
Yes, Miss Xiaoqian

38
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
Sorry for bothering you two.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Miss Xiaoqian, you don’t have to be so polite.

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,880
I want you to live in a hut like this

41
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,640
It’s only the two of us who feel very sorry.

42
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,360
Dirty and shabby

43
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,880
Don't be so polite. Let's do this.

44
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,320
We're having a big meal tonight to celebrate

45
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,280
A big meal? What a big meal?

46
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,600
A big meal means a rich meal

47
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,280
Don't worry about it. Anyway, I'll go out and add some food later.

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,080
Get a table of "Nine Big Gui" tonight

49
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,360
Nine Gui?

50
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,560
Yes, you managed to escape with great difficulty

51
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,160
Of course, I have to eat Jiudagui to be worthy of you.

52
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,840
No need, Brother Xiang spends so much money

53
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,800
Not breaking the bank...will be back soon

54
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Miss Xiaoqian

56
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,000
Look how much your lover cares about you

57
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,880
Lover?

58
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,560
Old woman, don't talk nonsense

59
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,120
Look at it, it made the little girl's face turn red.

60
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,440
Did I say something wrong?

61
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,880
A discerning person will look at Miss Xiaoqian

62
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,080
I knew she eloped with that Uncle Xiang

63
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,720
Miss Wu, right?

64
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,040
You still say? Let’s go…

65
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,000
Uncle Wu

66
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,400
Miss Xiaoqian, let me help you

67
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,760
Gong…Xiaoqian, how are you?

68
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,720
Just accidentally stabbed

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,040
Isn’t that right? I told you before

70
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,560
How can you two girls do such menial work?

71
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,760
Just let me do it

72
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Yes, if Uncle Xiang finds out

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,200
If we want Miss Xiaoqian to do rough work

74
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,080
They will definitely blame us two.

75
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,520
Yes, I'm so sorry...

76
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,080
See what I bought back?

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,520
Brother Xiang, are you back?

78
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,520
Why are you all standing here?

79
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,000
Uncle Wu and Aunt Wu won't let me help

80
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,880
You want me to sit here and be a slacker

81
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,080
Dare you say that? I’ve already been pricked by thorns for doing a few things.

82
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,440
Puncture?

83
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,920
It's all my fault that Miss Xiaoqian was stabbed

84
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,920
Where was the prick? Finger

85
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,840
have a look

86
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,640
The thorn has not been pulled out yet, it will become inflamed.

87
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,800
I'll help you suck it out

88
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,080
I think it should be sucked out

89
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,720
Wash it with water, come on, let's go

90
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Does the food I cook taste bad?

91
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,200
You two just eat buns

92
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,120
Eat the chicken

93
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,560
I finally bought it after shopping around the whole market.

94
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,160
Want to eat the whole chicken?

95
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,280
certainly

96
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,480
You won't live up to my kindness to you, right?

97
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,040
You don't have to look at her, she's already lucky

98
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,080
There's a chicken butt to eat

99
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,520
Stop protesting, I'm worse off than you are

100
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,520
I only have one chicken head to eat

101
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,440
Eat quickly

102
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,440
I've helped you

103
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,360
I haven't felt so full in a long time.

104
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,840
It would be great if it could be like this in the future

105
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,920
after?

106
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,800
Don't worry, I'll see how you look

107
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,600
He should be the kind of person who can eat whatever he wants without getting fat.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,920
What about me?

109
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,760
You? You act like a restless monkey

110
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,840
I think it’s not easy for you to gain weight.

111
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,200
What is a restless monkey?

112
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,920
It's easy to explain the restless monkey, just look at her look

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,640
Xiang Shaolong, you...

114
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,080
Seriously, how long do you plan to live here?

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,800
I plan to wait until the wind outside is not so tight.

116
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,600
Then help Xiaoqian find a more comfortable place

117
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,680
Then we will have to live there for at least half a month.

118
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,360
Well, let's go out and help her buy furniture.

119
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,320
Do you know what is the most important thing about a home?

120
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,840
Just a big comfortable bed

121
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,440
I'm not very good now? No need to bother

122
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,520
No trouble, even if you don’t live here forever

123
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,840
But a home must always feel like a home to live happily

124
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,280
This home is not mine, you two decide

125
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,200
that's great

126
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,160
The most troublesome lady has no objections

127
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,200
Then let me decide

128
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll sleep for a while

129
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,800
So be it

130
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,760
Buy a pig for her tomorrow to make her fat

131
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,280
Then take her out for a walk and do some exercise

132
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,200
Let her be happy and lively, okay?

133
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,440
Would you like to take her out for a walk?

134
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,760
If you are happy, take Xiaoqian out.

135
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,920
Tell me what to do?

136
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,640
What's wrong?

137
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,280
What did you say?

138
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,440
If you keep a straight face without your benefit, are you sick?

139
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,680
You are the one who is sick

140
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,480
Have I offended you? Curse me to get sick?

141
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,000
Please be cheerful

142
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,320
I'm just playing with you, but you have a stern face

143
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,800
I really don't understand

144
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,600
A girl is so intoxicating

145
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,400
The other girl is so intolerable

146
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,160
Listen, today I'm doing this for Xiaoqian's sake

147
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,440
Not familiar with you

148
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,600
but i tell you

149
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
Now Xiaoqian is alone outside, helpless

150
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,000
You have to treat her well

151
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,200
Don't worry, I will treat her better than I treat you

152
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,040
Let's go back together to find Xiaoqian, don't be angry

153
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,800
The thorn has not been pulled out yet, it will become inflamed.

154
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,080
I'll help you suck it out

155
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,160
Did I say something wrong?

156
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,480
A discerning person will look at Miss Xiaoqian

157
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,280
I knew she eloped with that Uncle Xiang

158
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,320
The princess is missing?

159
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,520
May I ask, Your Majesty, when did this happen?

160
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,760
It was yesterday

161
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,120
I have ordered people to search the palace

162
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,640
The whereabouts of the princess could never be found

163
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,280
It seems so

164
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,040
The princess has most likely left the palace

165
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,920
Won't

166
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,960
The princess usually never leaves the palace even half a step

167
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,600
This time I was able to leave the palace unnoticed.

168
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,160
How strange

169
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,960
King, it may not be possible for the princess alone

170
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,040
It wouldn't be surprising if someone was there to help

171
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,080
Julu Hou, what do you think should be done?

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,600
The princess is engaged to the prince of Wei

173
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,600
If this matter spreads

174
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,640
I'm afraid it will jeopardize the relationship between Zhao and Wei

175
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,840
So Weichen thinks

176
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,080
The king can only order people to secretly investigate the whereabouts of the princess

177
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,480
Never be too showy

178
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,600
So who should be responsible for detecting the whereabouts of the princess?

179
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,680
King

180
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,440
The villain is willing to take the responsibility of investigating the whereabouts of the princess

181
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,720
Lian Jin, now the king orders you to do it within two days

182
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,440
Are you sure you can find out the whereabouts of the princess?

183
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,960
Lord Hou, you can rest assured

184
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,920
I will never disappoint Mr. Hou in this matter.

185
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,360
Lian Jin, the disappearance of the princess

186
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,480
Do you know the reason?

187
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,680
Due to the importance of the matter, it is temporarily inconvenient for me

188
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Reveal the whole story to the Marquis

189
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,240
But if I'm not wrong

190
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,160
I will definitely be able to take the princess back to the palace within two days

191
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,600
That would be best, otherwise if something goes wrong

192
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,280
I'm afraid I can't protect you either.

193
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,240
yes

194
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,640
You have to take care of yourself

195
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,760
Did Brother Xiang really come after dinner?

196
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,720
I even called her Aunt Wu

197
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,240
Teach me how to steam honey buns

198
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,200
I plan to steam it for him to eat later.

199
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,440
Could it be that your brother Xiang doesn’t come?

200
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,040
I won’t be able to eat your honey buns, right?

201
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,360
That's not what I meant. Don't get me wrong.

202
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,360
Just kidding

203
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,200
Let's go...

204
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,320
Uncle Wu, Aunt Wu, what's going on?

205
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Lian Jin?

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,040
The villain was ordered by the king to take the princess back to the palace.

207
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,760
Tingfang

208
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,920
Princess, don't panic, what do you want?

209
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,080
Didn't I make it very clear just now?

210
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,800
I am here to take the princess back to the palace on your orders.

211
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,760
What if I don't agree?

212
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,800
You don't want to stop me from taking the princess back to the palace, do you?

213
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,200
You have to know that harboring a princess is a capital offense

214
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,280
Are you threatening me like this?

215
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,920
No, I just want you to understand

216
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,680
Others are innocent

217
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,480
Listen, I left the palace privately this time

218
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,040
It's my princess's business alone

219
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,360
Has nothing to do with anyone else

220
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,360
I hope the princess understands

221
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,760
I'm just following the king's will

222
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,160
Okay, this princess will follow you back to the palace

223
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,040
Princess

224
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,080
Tingfang

225
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,120
I'm afraid I won't have the chance to steam honey buns for you to eat in the future.

226
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,400
princess please

227
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,200
Also, please tell Xiang Shaolong

228
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,760
The contribution he made this time

229
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,400
The Lord Marquis will definitely be richly rewarded in the future

230
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,480
What do you mean?

231
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

232
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,120
If he hadn't come to the Hou Mansion to report the news,

233
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,920
How do I know the princess is here?

234
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,160
Was it really Xiang Shaolong who tipped off the news?

235
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,000
Believe it or not, it’s up to you

236
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,480
This stinky thief

237
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,560
I will never let you go

238
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,960
Why can't you move?

239
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,560
Didn’t you agree to wait at Uncle Wu’s house?

240
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,560
What are you doing standing here? Where is Xiaoqian?

241
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,800
Xiang Shaolong, are you still pretending to be crazy and stupid in front of me?

242
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,600
Let me ask you, why do you do this?

243
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,040
do what?

244
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,920
If you don't want others to know, you have to do nothing unless you do it yourself

245
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,840
It’s hard for the princess to leave the palace for you

246
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,200
You are greedy for wealth

247
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,280
He actually went to Zhao Mu to inform him?

248
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,760
Are you happy that the princess is now brought back to the palace by Lian Jin?

249
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,040
What princess? What Zhao Mu? What Lian Jin?

250
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,040
What to take away? What are you talking about here?

251
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,520
Do you still want to quibble?

252
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,280
That girl Xiaoqian is the princess

253
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,800
Isn't it?

254
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,080
You're pretending to be the same

255
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,560
I don't believe you from beginning to end

256
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,400
I don’t even know that Xiaoqian is a princess.

257
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,840
Of course I don't know

258
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,560
It was you who told me she was a palace maid

259
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,640
Now you tell me she is a princess

260
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,440
It's all what you said

261
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,520
Even if she is taken away, it has nothing to do with me

262
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,520
What are you telling me for?

263
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,880
Of course it's about you

264
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,800
The princess wants to elope with you

265
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,400
Elope? Why elope?

266
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,040
Because she likes you, didn't you promise the princess?

267
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,240
Take her far away and live a happy life?

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,240
Damn it, I thought she was just a palace maid

269
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,520
I just planned to take her to see Mrs. Ya.

270
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,120
Then tell King Zhao to redeem her body

271
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,880
I didn't know that so many things would happen

272
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,120
Then why did you promise me

273
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,200
Venture into the palace to rescue the princess from the palace?

274
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,800
She's just a maid

275
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,160
It's not a big deal to take her away.

276
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,520
Have you never liked princesses?

277
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,640
Of course not, she and I are just...

278
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,640
Just the feeling between brother and sister

279
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,440
What do you like or dislike?

280
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,360
Even so, you shouldn't go snitching

281
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,160
People say beautiful women are brainless. I didn’t believe it.

282
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,640
But now I really believe it

283
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,400
you always knew

284
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,160
Zhao Mu, Lian Jin and I don’t bite the strings

285
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,840
How could I snitch on both of them?

286
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Even if I really want to take credit

287
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,880
I also went to Zhao Wang to ask for credit. Why do so many things?

288
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,920
If you hadn't tipped off the news

289
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,520
How did Lian Jin know that the princess lived in Uncle Wu's house?

290
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,600
How do I know?

291
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,080
Also, don't forget

292
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,040
That night Lian Jin saw the two of us leaving.

293
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,000
It wouldn't be surprising if he had doubts

294
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,880
Could it be that Lian Jin is secretly following us?

295
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Then I don't know

296
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,960
Anyway, hurry up and help me explain it to the princess.

297
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,360
I don't want to be misunderstood by her

298
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,000
Explain clearly? How do you want me to explain it to the princess?

299
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,080
Should I tell the princess?

300
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,600
Say you always just treated her as your little sister

301
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,040
Never liked her?

302
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,280
In fact, it is rare for a princess to fall in love with you

303
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,360
Why don't you just make the mistake?

304
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,720
How to make mistakes right?

305
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,720
How do I explain this to my girlfriend?

306
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,000
I mean...the one you want

307
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,760
Do you already have someone you love?

308
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,240
Too lazy to pay attention to you

309
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,680
Well, I see that you often make soup for me to drink.

310
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,680
If you still praise me, I will give you a gift

311
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,680
as a reward for you

312
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,600
Was this hosta given to me?

313
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,200
You lecherous person, I will return the hosta to you.

314
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,040
Why are you so anxious to get this hosta back for no reason?

315
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,240
This hosta was already given to me.

316
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,560
I just take back what's mine

317
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Wake up... hurry up

318
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,960
Then I just gave you artificial respiration

319
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,360
Didn’t I want to... you still said

320
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,760
Don’t worry, I, Xiang Shaolong…

321
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,360
How do I explain it to the princess?

322
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,960
The servant greets Mrs. Ya

323
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,160
Does the princess refuse to eat again?

324
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,040
Princess

325
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,800
Aunt, is that you?

326
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,960
The princess refuses to eat, what should I do?

327
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,360
Health is important

328
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,720
Don't worry, aunt, Qian'er is fine.

329
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,440
I just have no appetite

330
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,200
By the way, the flower seedlings that the princess planted in her aunt’s garden

331
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,200
Just bloomed for the first time

332
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,640
Auntie brought it specially for you to see

333
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,120
See if you like it?

334
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,400
Auntie, it’s better to take the flowers back.

335
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,160
If this potted flower could be planted in my aunt's house,

336
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,560
More flowers will bloom

337
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,320
It's all my fault, if I hadn't made my own decision

338
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,440
If I take you to my mansion for a short stay, the princess will not...

339
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,920
Auntie was wrong

340
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,800
The half month I lived in my aunt’s house

341
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,200
It can be said to be the happiest day in Qian'er's life

342
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,560
It's a pity that happy days are always very short

343
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,720
To be able to live this happy life

344
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,520
Qian'er is also satisfied

345
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,040
The princess can think so, and the aunt is also relieved

346
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,440
Since ancient times, being a woman

347
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,320
How many of them can decide their own destiny?

348
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,800
In that case, let's face reality

349
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,320
Sometimes it makes me happier

350
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,320
Facing reality? The reality that Qianer faces now

351
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,920
Just have someone by your side at all times

352
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,960
until getting married

353
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,840
The aunt knows the princess’s feelings for Xiang Shaolong

354
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,400
It’s just that the identities of the princess and Xiang Shaolong are different

355
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,840
Great disparity in status, fate but not destiny

356
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,760
Instead of everyone suffering

357
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,440
Princess, why not forget him soon?

358
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,760
Tingfang greets Mrs. Ya

359
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,200
Miss Wu comes to visit

360
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,920
Don't know what's important?

361
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,360
Tingfang wants to ask Mrs. Ya for a favor.

362
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,800
Take Tingfang into the palace to meet the princess

363
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,200
Princess, who do you think is coming to visit you?

364
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,680
Tingfang?

365
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,200
Princess, I haven’t seen you for a few days. You have lost a lot of weight.

366
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,920
Why don't you?

367
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,000
How could I? I can eat and sleep every day

368
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,520
Why did you bother to hide it from me?

369
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,880
Tingfang has nothing to hide from the princess

370
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,240
why don't you tell me

371
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,520
Is Brother Xiang the perverted thief you call him?

372
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,800
Princess, do you understand?

373
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,840
Actually you don't have to do this

374
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,680
By the way, Tingfang is coming today

375
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,280
In addition to visiting the princess

376
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,120
I still want to tell the princess

377
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,960
The reason why Lian Jin found us last time

378
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,680
It has nothing to do with Xiang Shaolong at all

379
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,640
He doesn’t know your identity at all, princess

380
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,600
Not even going to tell the truth

381
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,120
So don't misunderstand him

382
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,560
I have never doubted Brother Xiang

383
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,720
I believe he is definitely not this kind of person

384
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,360
Tingfang, Brother Xiang is a good man

385
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,920
you can't give up on him

386
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,520
Princess

387
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
I have been thinking very clearly these days

388
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,320
I am a princess

389
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Should live the life of a princess

390
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,960
You shouldn’t have too many unrealistic dreams

391
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,720
Princess, how can you be discouraged by one failure?

392
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,840
I'm not discouraged, this is just my fate

393
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,920
Tingfang, can we be considered good friends?

394
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,320
Of course

395
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,960
Just because we are good friends

396
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,920
So in order to fulfill me

397
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,880
Willing to sacrifice one's lifelong happiness

398
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,200
Give me the one you love

399
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,000
Also because you and I are good friends

400
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,480
I can also help you give Brother Xiang to you

401
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,560
Princess, how can this be done? I...

402
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,080
Tingfang, you once encouraged me

403
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,400
Try your best to strive for your own happiness

404
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,000
I listen to you

405
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,640
I finally tried, had fun, and failed

406
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,360
Now is the time for you to fight for your own happiness

407
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,440
Since Brother Xiang and I are not destined to be together,

408
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,840
I hope that one day you and Brother Xiang will come to an end.

409
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,000
Tingfang, I sincerely wish you the best

410
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,880
Juluhou, you really have a unique vision.

411
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,720
There are many capable people under the door

412
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,120
It is a great contribution that we were able to find the princess this time.

413
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,120
The king has rewarded you

414
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,720
The reason why we were able to find the princess this time

415
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,480
Lian Jin really made the greatest contribution

416
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,320
Lian Jin, you can find the princess

417
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,640
If you need any reward, you might as well tell me directly.

418
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,400
Your Majesty, I want to track down the princess.

419
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,720
It's Lian Jin's responsibility

420
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,160
I really don’t dare to have any extravagant expectations

421
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,120
But Lian Jin has a wish

422
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,000
If King Meng can make it happen,

423
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,360
I can't thank you enough

424
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,520
Lian Jin, what is your wish?

425
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,800
Great King

426
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,480
Lian Jin has always been in love with Wu Yingyuan's apple

427
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,880
If the king can serve as the elder of the moon, he will be granted a marriage.

428
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,760
I believe it must be a beautiful thing

429
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,480
A graceful lady, a gentleman is a good man

430
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,520
It's a matter of course

431
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,800
This marriage is all about the widow.

432
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,240
Thank you King

433
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,720
Have you really explained it clearly to the princess?

434
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,880
How many times do I have to tell you before you believe it?

435
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,160
I told you to explain it clearly to the princess on your behalf.

436
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,960
Then she has nothing, right?

437
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,080
What do you want the princess to do?

438
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,840
Are you fighting for your life or do you want to live or die?

439
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,680
No, just to avoid deepening her misunderstanding

440
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,880
Don't worry

441
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,760
The princess said that she has always treated you like a brother.

442
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,680
I told you not to misunderstand

443
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,000
Did she really say that?

444
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,360
If you don’t believe it, go ask the princess yourself

445
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,520
No need, that’s fine, finally the sky is blue after the rain

446
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,640
By the way, where is my dad?

447
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,760
I haven’t seen him for so long since I came back.

448
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,400
I don’t know, King Zhao just sent someone to take him into the palace

449
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,560
He said he had something important to discuss with him, but he didn’t know what it was.

450
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,240
The king summons his father to the palace?

451
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,440
The king wants to betroth his daughter to Lian Jin?

452
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,240
Yes, Lian Jin and Ling Qianjin can be described as talented men and beautiful women.

453
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,480
If we can be together

454
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,320
What a match made in heaven

455
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,920
Lord Wubao, what do you think?

456
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,280
I am truly grateful for your kindness, Your Majesty, but...

457
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,760
Lord Wubao, is it possible that you have something to hide?

458
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,720
Return to your Majesty, my daughter has already been betrothed to someone else

459
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,040
Your Majesty’s good intentions can only be understood with my heart.

460
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,880
Your daughter has already been betrothed to someone else?

461
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,360
I dare to ask Lord Wubao, who can be so lucky?

462
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,440
This person is Xiang Shaolong

463
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,440
Then...a gentleman does not take away what others love

464
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,160
Since Lord Wu Bao has betrothed his daughter to Xiang Shaolong,

465
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,960
Even a few people dare not force each other

466
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,400
Your Majesty, as for...

467
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,800
Wei Chen has a few words, but I don’t know if I should say them directly?

468
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,000
Julu Hou has something to say, so you might as well say it directly

469
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,640
Dare to ask Lord Wubao

470
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,920
Just now you said that your daughter has been betrothed to Xiang Shaolong

471
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,760
When exactly did it happen?

472
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,720
It was a few days ago

473
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,680
A few days ago? How could it be such a coincidence?

474
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,440
May I ask Lord Wubao, whose idea was this?

475
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,960
Of course it was my idea

476
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,560
It turned out to be Lord Wubao’s idea

477
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,200
Dare to ask Lord Wubao

478
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,360
If I want you to change your mind

479
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,480
I wonder if it is possible?

480
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,240
Lord Marquis, please forgive me. I personally agreed to the marriage.

481
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,480
How can you regret it casually?

482
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,080
Lord Ubau is indeed right

483
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,200
You really can't go back on what you promised someone personally.

484
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,480
However, the king promised Chrysostom to marry Lian Jin

485
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,880
I don’t know how to deal with this matter?

486
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,760
Juluhou, what do you mean...

487
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,520
King

488
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,720
The Lord of Wubao still knows not to break trust with others

489
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,280
The king is the king of a country

490
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,040
Once Chrysostom comes out, how can we not keep our word?

491
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,280
Your Majesty, I forgive you, but my daughter is alone.

492
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,800
Of course, one person cannot have two husbands at the same time

493
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,480
And Lian Jin and Xiang Shaolong

494
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,720
He is a rare knight in the Zhao Kingdom

495
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,360
Your Majesty, I have a suggestion

496
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,640
Just ask the king to order the two of them to choose an auspicious day to compete with each other in front of the emperor.

497
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,280
The winner

498
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,000
It’s natural to become Wujiabao’s son-in-law.

499
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,400
OK

500
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,200
Marquis Julu’s suggestion is indeed a good idea

501
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,920
Lian Jin, what do you think?

502
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,160
Lian Jin has no objection

503
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,960
Everything is subject to the king’s will

504
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,120
It's really good to speak quickly

505
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,120
Lord of Uborg, this is how the duel will be decided.

506
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,280
But the king...

507
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,720
As soon as Chrysostom is opened, Lord Wubao, you don’t need to say anything.

508
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,440
As for the decisive battle, I will leave it to Marquis Julu.

509
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,920
The humble minister obeys the decree

510
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,640
No? You want me to duel with Lian Jin?

511
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,480
You also know how much he hates me

512
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
Now you ask me to duel with him

513
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Wouldn't it give him a chance to kill me?

514
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,760
Shaolong, given the situation at that time

515
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,880
If I don't agree, Fang'er will marry Lian Jin

516
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,360
Of course not. How can the lady marry him?

517
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,920
Brother Xiang, I really wronged you this time

518
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,400
This is not a matter of grievance or not.

519
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,120
I really can't beat him, I'm dead

520
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,680
master

521
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,280
Shaolong is right. Besides, Shaolong lost the battle.

522
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,840
Fang'er also wants to marry Lian Jin

523
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,840
The only solution now is to end the pasture and return to Qin

524
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,600
End the ranch and return to Qin?

525
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,280
Then who can help me save Ying Zheng?

526
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,000
After this matter returned to Qin State,

527
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,400
Let’s have a long-term discussion with Prime Minister Lu

528
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,080
Are you planning on taking a long-term view? Isn’t that good?

529
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,880
Although you have plenty of time, if you delay it any longer

530
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,200
If Ying Zheng really dies, won’t I be finished?

531
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,520
Shaolong, I know you really want to save Ying Zheng and his son.

532
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,120
But the problem is for Fang'er's happiness

533
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,480
for your safety

534
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,640
This matter... That's enough... Lord of the castle

535
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,920
I duel

536
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,040
Brother Xiang, do you agree?

537
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,000
What else to do?

538
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,800
Shaolong, your life is at stake, you have to think carefully

539
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,920
What else are you thinking about? There is only one way now

540
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,720
Are you willing to fight hard?

541
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,640
Is the king really proposing marriage to his father on behalf of Lian Jin?

542
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,160
Of course it's true

543
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,760
So what should dad tell the king?

544
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,360
It’s just for this matter that my brother rushed to find you.

545
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,240
Didn’t dad agree?

546
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,400
That would be great if yes

547
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,960
Lian Jin is a talented person and has good swordsmanship.

548
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,080
He is also the most powerful swordsman in Juluhou’s sect.

549
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,520
If we in Wujiapu get this kind of quick son-in-law riding a dragon,

550
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,840
What's wrong with that?

551
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,000
Did dad refuse?

552
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,240
That's right, to tell you the truth, sister

553
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,880
I think dad is getting more confused as he gets older.

554
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,440
Not only did he reject Lian Jin’s marriage proposal,

555
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,840
He also said to the king

556
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,200
You have been betrothed to Xiang Shaolong

557
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,800
Did dad really say that?

558
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,440
I don't know what dad thinks

559
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,880
Look horizontally and vertically

560
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,360
Even Jin is more than a thousand times better than Xiang Shaolong

561
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,440
I don’t know why he decided to betroth you to Xiang Shaolong

562
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,640
Did dad really betroth me to him?

563
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,560
But you don’t have to worry

564
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,360
You don't necessarily have to marry him

565
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,560
Why?

566
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,760
Your Majesty is still wise. Your Majesty makes the final decision.

567
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,120
Lian Jin and Xiang Shaolong need to choose an auspicious day to compete with each other in front of the emperor.

568
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,280
Whoever wins can marry your sister.

569
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,720
But just think about it

570
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,240
How could this Xiang Shaolong be Lian Jin's opponent?

571
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,560
Did Brother Xiang agree?

572
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,880
I don't know that

573
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,080
As soon as dad came back, we went into the study with him.

574
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,120
Dad must want to ask him

575
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,440
Do you have the courage to compete with swords in front of the emperor?

576
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,840
But I said he must not be brave enough.

577
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,760
Isn’t it exaggerated? It’s like making a martial arts movie

578
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,200
Take a walk?

579
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,680
Are you so diligent?

580
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,000
The sun is about to go down and you are still practicing sword practice?

581
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,440
Who said I can't beat others?

582
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
So I had to practice more.

583
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,640
If you don’t have the confidence to defeat Lian Jin

584
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,040
You can tell my dad

585
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,600
Maybe my dad can think of a way

586
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,640
I beg your Majesty to cancel this sword duel.

587
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,200
Even if I say not to duel now

588
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,720
Even Jin won't agree to it

589
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,720
What's more, behind Lian Jin's back

590
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,560
There is also Zhao Mu, who is worried about the world being in chaos, supporting him.

591
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,080
It's all my father's fault

592
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,960
What's none of your dad's business?

593
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,960
I have no choice now, there is only one way to go

594
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,600
Why don't I ask dad to find a way?

595
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,920
Let you leave Handan secretly

596
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,720
Then you don’t have to compete with Lian Jin.

597
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,080
No, how could I just walk away and be so irresponsible?

598
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,200
No one said you have to be responsible

599
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,000
Men must be responsible for what they have done

600
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,920
Besides, this game has a lot at stake

601
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,800
Even if you know you're going to die, you still have to fight.

602
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,280
I won't tell you anymore. I want to practice sword practice more.

603
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,040
You either go for a walk, or you go home

604
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,520
If you practice the trick just now a few more times,

605
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,280
I will definitely be able to express myself freely

606
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,880
Don't snicker here with your lips pursed

607
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,680
I can't practice sword practice anymore

608
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,920
Why are you here?

609
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,080
You are so majestic

610
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,120
Everyone in Handan knows you

611
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,800
Do you also know that I compete with swords?

612
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,120
How could I not know about such a big thing?

613
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,280
So you just add insult to injury and kick me more?

614
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,680
Your hometown slang is also quite unique.

615
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,920
I'm here to discuss a deal with you.

616
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,120
Buy or sell?

617
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,840
We all know each other so well, we might as well tell the truth.

618
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,640
You know very well how valuable your swordsmanship is.

619
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
This time the imperial sword showdown

620
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,880
There is no way you can defeat Lian Jin

621
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,520
I also know, look at my current posture

622
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,880
Can't move

623
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,320
Can you help me up before we talk?

624
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,200
Are you having a hard time?

625
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,560
Of course, my waist hurts

626
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,000
you should know very well

627
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,280
This time you and Lian Jin are not just competing with each other.

628
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,840
You and I finally got to know each other

629
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,520
So be it, if you can afford it

630
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,000
I'll help you kill Lian Jin

631
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,240
don't tell me

632
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,200
The current relationship between Xiang Shaolong and Wujiabao

633
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,840
Can’t afford the price?

634
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,160
I think you must have been crazy about poverty recently.

635
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,840
But these are men's problems

636
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,880
I have a way to solve it

637
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,160
I've never been able to do it using other methods.

638
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,000
Sometimes I really don't understand what you mean

639
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,600
You clearly knew that you lost to Lian Jin

640
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,080
Why are you still dueling him?

641
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,320
There are some things that you don’t understand even if I say them.

642
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,520
Anyway, no matter whether we win or lose this time

643
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,200
I will use my own method to solve it

644
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,600
Although your opinion is good, it still doesn't work

645
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,040
No, I have to go home and go drinking.

646
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:34,080
91, 92, 93, 98, 99, 100

647
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,200
master

648
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,600
Master, Pan'er has done a hundred palm presses

649
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,600
So fast?

650
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,760
Master, you are absent-minded

651
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,400
Of course I don’t feel that time has passed

652
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,000
It's hard for Pan'er to make both hands numb.

653
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
master

654
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,960
Are you still worried about the sword duel with Lian Jin?

655
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,880
No

656
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,800
Lian Jin and his master are going to have a sword showdown in front of the emperor

657
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,200
Now it has spread to the whole city of Handan that it is very lively

658
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,040
Yeah?

659
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,360
more than that

660
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,160
I heard that Zhao De and Zhao Jia also set odds

661
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,600
Bet on who will win between Master and Lian Jin

662
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,280
Do you also understand the word odds?

663
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,240
certainly

664
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,520
What are my odds?

665
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,400
Say it quietly, not too loudly

666
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,480
I told you that Master can't be unhappy

667
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,120
Okay, hurry up and say it, wait a minute

668
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,840
Let’s talk…

669
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,120
It's what Master asked Pan'er to say.

670
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,040
Hurry up

671
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,840
Betting on winning streak is 3 for 1

672
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,800
But I bet the master will win

673
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,960
It's one hundred compensation

674
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,320
One hundred for one? Yes

675
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,480
Master, you said you wouldn't be unhappy

676
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,400
Look at me like this

677
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,680
Where does it look like you are unhappy?

678
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,920
Come here quickly

679
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,640
come over?

680
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,240
come here

681
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,040
Come, come here and let me punch you twice to vent my anger

682
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,920
Master, you can't be so petty

683
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,040
Is it really that excessive?

684
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,480
So unpopular? It’s almost impossible to be cold

685
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,640
Of course

686
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,080
Honestly speaking

687
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,080
Do you think I will lose to Lian Jin?

688
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,200
Be conscientious

689
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,800
As the master’s disciple

690
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,640
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

691
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,240
Finally you care about me

692
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,440
But I want to hear what's in your heart

693
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,800
Don't treat me like this

694
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:37,160
But...if you want to place a bet, then...

695
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
How about it?

696
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,000
Of course it’s a winning streak

697
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,480
So be it, if I win

698
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,240
Master, doesn’t he have money for soup and medicine?

699
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,680
The cost of soup and medicine? Do you want me to give you money to buy it?

700
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,040
You come here first

701
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,760
Coming again?

702
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,720
come here

703
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,080
You really want me to punch you twice, please

704
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,880
Master, you asked me to tell the truth

705
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,360
Brother, do you think I can stop being annoyed?

706
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:09,920
I don't care about you

707
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,920
You can do tens of thousands of palm presses no matter what

708
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,720
Go out and run more than a hundred laps and come back

709
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,600
Master, have you forgotten?

710
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,440
Just now Pan'er has done a hundred palm presses

711
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,640
I'm so tired now

712
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,960
You little naughty boy

713
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,040
Do you really think my soul just wandered into space?

714
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,800
123 then count 91, 97, 98

715
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,720
That's outrageous, do it quickly, do it

716
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,480
Madam, you play so beautifully

717
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,360
Why doesn't it stop playing halfway?

718
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,560
If the song doesn't work, why bother to keep playing it?

719
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,320
Madam Ya, are you worried?

720
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,640
Shaolong, you really want to have a sword showdown with Lian Jin in front of the emperor.

721
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,760
Do you know Juluhou

722
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,200
I want to take advantage of this opportunity to eliminate you during the imperial sword show?

723
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,040
I know, he has long wanted to eliminate me

724
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,800
But Lian Jin is the number one swordsman in Juluhou’s sect.

725
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,280
I'm afraid... I know

726
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,560
I know I may not be Lian Jin's opponent

727
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,840
But some things are unavoidable

728
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,520
Could it be that the eldest daughter of the Wu family is in Shaolong’s mind?

729
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,120
Is it really that important?

730
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,040
Shaolong could put his life and death aside for her?

731
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,560
There are some things that you won’t understand even if I say them.

732
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,880
But frankly

733
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,040
I don’t want Wu Tingfang to marry that despicable guy either.

734
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,480
What about Xiaoqian?

735
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,320
Don't you have any affection for her at all?

736
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,040
To put it bluntly, I don’t know what will happen tomorrow

737
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,920
Now I'm in this situation

738
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,960
How can you still be in the mood to talk about love?

739
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,840
You can stop yourself from liking someone else

740
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,960
But I'm afraid it may not be so easy for you

741
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,480
Prevent others from liking you

742
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,920
What are you doing here again?

743
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,720
I want you to see something

744
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,160
What did you see?

745
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,640
my swordsmanship

746
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,040
Your swordsmanship?

747
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,160
Why can you push so hard?

748
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,120
What I just used was the Killing Lian Jin Sword Move.

749
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,160
As long as you remember it well

750
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,760
You can crack it one by one

751
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,400
Why do you know?

752
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,240
Don't worry, I can only do so much

753
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,000
It depends on your destiny in the future

754
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,360
What? Are you hurt?

755
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,880
You don't need to pay attention

756
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,760
Have you approached Lian Jin?

757
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,440
You don’t need to know this either

758
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,600
Why are you doing this?

759
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,600
If something really happens to you

760
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,000
Wouldn't I be more unhappy?

761
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,320
Don't think I'm doing it for you

762
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,640
I just don’t want the eldest lady of the Wu family

763
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,480
Marry someone you don't like

764
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,800
Don't worry, I will try my best

765
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,320
Are you telling me to feel relieved?

766
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,920
Just now I only used half of Lian Jin's strength

767
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,000
I'm afraid you're on the day of the sword showdown in front of the emperor

768
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,120
Even ten moves may not be able to support it

769
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,360
I heard that a mysterious person is attacking you

770
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,440
Who did it?

771
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,040
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Hou.

772
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:08,760
i believe

773
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,120
He is the person sent by Xiang Shaolong to test my sword skills.

774
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,800
It seems that Xiang Shaolong is also very active in preparing for the war

775
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,680
I have fought with this person before

776
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,320
Although his tricks are strange and mysterious,

777
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,840
But the heat is not enough

778
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,680
The foundation is also very superficial

779
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,680
Within ten moves, I will definitely be able to kill him

780
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,960
Can he be killed within ten moves?

781
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,520
Will it be too underestimated?

782
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,880
Xiang Shaolong will definitely die

783
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,760
I hope it's as you said
