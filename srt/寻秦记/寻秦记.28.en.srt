1
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,600
How is his condition?

2
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,960
The king's condition is very strange

3
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,400
What is the disease?

4
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,120
Maybe it's an invasion of evil spirits

5
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,640
Evil invasion?

6
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,760
May I ask what the witch doctor can do to drive away evil spirits?

7
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,160
Let this doctor go back and ask for divination

8
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,920
Seek guidance from the gods, maybe you can turn the tide

9
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,880
Such a useful witch doctor

10
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,080
OK…

11
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,120
According to my opinion, the king's condition is not serious.

12
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,440
The king is sick, why not ask the imperial doctor?

13
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,000
Instead, ask a witch doctor?

14
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,560
All the imperial doctors came, but they were all helpless.

15
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,800
That's why I dare to invite the witch doctor

16
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,080
Mr. Xiang, what do you think?

17
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,400
Taifu Xiang is proficient in foot massage

18
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,680
I wonder if it will be useful this time?

19
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,000
The so-called life and death are destined, history is destined

20
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,000
It doesn't matter if my medical skills are better

21
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,040
The king has always taken good care of his body

22
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,640
How could he be infected with this strange disease if he only had minor ailments?

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,040
From what I see, his condition should be chronic poisoning.

24
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,560
What is chronic poisoning?

25
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,680
Chronic poisoning means that he has been poisoned by some kind of poison

26
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,240
But it doesn’t happen immediately

27
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,160
It takes a certain amount of time to get poisoned and die.

28
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,960
What is the solution?

29
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,480
What’s the solution? There’s no blood test here

30
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,560
Indeed, if the toxicity is unknown

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,320
If medicine and stones are thrown randomly, it will be more dangerous.

32
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,800
Since it was poisoning, was it accidental?

33
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,000
Or is there someone out there trying to do harm?

34
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,280
Taifu, since you are a person from the future

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,080
Is this event recorded in history books?

36
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,600
What is the truth?

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,560
History books? History books have published

38
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,440
But the historians in the past wrote randomly

39
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,200
How could they write about how the emperor died?

40
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,640
So I just casually wrote that the emperor died well

41
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,200
So forget it if you die with a grand burial.

42
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,080
In this case, wouldn't the king's illness be...

43
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,800
The prince succeeded to the throne of Qin, which means...

44
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,880
The day when Taifu Xiang will leave this place is not far away.

45
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,440
Lu Buwei is both a god and a ghost

46
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,800
Why come here to pray to ghosts and gods and pretend to be

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,080
Otherwise, how could he show his loyalty to the emperor and his patriotism?

48
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,480
I pray for the blessings of my ancestors and may my father, King Long, be in good health.

49
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
I hope that our country, Qin Dynasty, will prosper

50
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,120
I rely on God and all the late kings to bless me.

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,120
The king has a humble character and is filial and considerate of his people.

52
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,560
You really shouldn’t arouse the jealousy of ghosts and gods

53
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,080
May the late king bless you all

54
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,640
Loyal to the emperor and patriotic? What he loves most is himself

55
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000
Prime Minister Lu

56
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,240
Heaven is above, all the ancestors are in front

57
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,080
If the king can be restored to health

58
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,160
Chen Lu Buwei is willing to lose his life

59
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,640
Prime Minister Lu

60
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,480
The king has a long and prosperous life

61
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,760
It seems that the person named Lu also has a short life expectancy.

62
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,360
After all, it was us who provoked them.

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,800
The king treats his concubine well

64
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,920
Now that the king is in trouble, I don’t feel at ease either.

65
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,120
Neither of them ever loved you at all

66
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,000
Just treat you as a piece of cargo

67
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,280
No consideration for your happiness

68
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,080
I wish I could tear them into pieces

69
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,080
To vent my hatred

70
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,400
As long as you love and cherish me, I will have no regrets

71
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,400
Only two of them died

72
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,320
Only then can we truly have no regrets

73
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,200
The man named Lu is cruel and ruthless

74
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,880
I'm afraid it won't be easy to deal with

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,800
When the king dies, the prince ascends the throne at a young age

76
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,000
When the time comes, you will be able to assist the government

77
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,080
What does a mere Lu Buwei mean?

78
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,000
Then we can really be together

79
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,760
King

80
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,360
lady

81
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,760
You guys stand down

82
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,200
Has the king gotten better after taking the medicine?

83
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,760
Madam, I'm afraid the lonely king's time is running out.

84
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,600
The king's long life and long life

85
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,120
Don’t worry, Your Majesty, after Your Majesty retires,

86
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,080
Lu Buwei will take good care of his wife

87
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,640
Your Majesty, and your precious prince

88
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,000
In fact, his surname is Lu, and his name is Lu Zheng, not Ying Zheng.

89
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,160
The time has come for your Majesty to leave, so get on your way

90
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,800
From now on, Da Qin Jiangshan will belong to my surnamed Lu.

91
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,840
The king dies

92
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,560
Uncle, let us go

93
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,800
Help

94
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,440
What's up?

95
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,720
We are acting on orders

96
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,560
What? Acting on orders

97
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,080
No, don't go...

98
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,480
Although the king is not my biological father

99
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,600
But he treated me well after all

100
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,080
It’s rare for me to get a little paternal love from my father.

101
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,760
Unexpectedly, he died so early

102
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,120
What did you do?

103
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,080
Do we really need so many palace maids and eunuchs to be buried with us?

104
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,720
Master, not only them

105
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,240
Even the concubines of the late king’s harem

106
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,680
If you have nothing to do, you will be buried with him

107
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,480
Let me teach you, you don’t have to do this

108
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,360
Just make some pottery figurines to be buried with you.

109
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,400
pottery figurine?

110
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,760
Yes, you make pottery figurines out of cement

111
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,000
As tall as a real person

112
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,520
Just look like the person you like

113
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,160
No need to kill people and be buried with them

114
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,480
I have read history books

115
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,720
Two thousand years later, pottery figurines became popular in Qin

116
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,080
In our time we call it Terracotta Warriors

117
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,360
I sincerely ask Mr. Xiang to speak carefully.

118
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,560
If only terracotta warriors and horses were used for burial

119
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,120
I am afraid that the late king is lonely under the spring with no one to serve him.

120
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,040
Are you crazy? Can you be sure of dead people?

121
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,120
Will you definitely serve your late king?

122
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,520
But this seems to be against the ancestral rules

123
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Please, rules are dead, people are alive

124
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,880
If the rules are not suitable, of course they need to be reformed

125
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,760
Otherwise, how can society progress? How can people be enlightened?

126
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,280
The master is right, okay, I'll give the order right away

127
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,120
Starting from today, we will use pottery figurines to accompany burials

128
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,960
No more human lives should be sacrificed

129
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,080
Don't sigh all day long

130
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,840
You're going to be a king soon

131
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,360
I don't want to be a king at all

132
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
If you are destined to be the king

133
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,680
You always want to be the king

134
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,880
Don't worry, Li Si will help you when the time comes.

135
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,600
The master is both wise and brave, a hundred times better than Li Si

136
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,480
Why do you always ask him to help me? What about yourself?

137
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,840
The day you ascend the throne, I will leave

138
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,040
I left this time, and I may never come back again.

139
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,080
On the day you ascend the throne, I may not be able to come either

140
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,000
The master came here from Zhao State and did many things

141
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,280
It’s just to help me become the king

142
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,760
Now that you have succeeded, you have to leave

143
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,600
Don’t you enjoy glory and wealth?

144
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,400
I have a lot of experiences here this time

145
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,600
I think the most important thing in life is...

146
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,040
I said you wouldn’t understand either

147
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,680
Anyway, if I can go back

148
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,520
Even if I have to shorten my life by a few years, I am willing to

149
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,680
Master, I have no relatives or friends here

150
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,560
The person I love the most is you, don’t leave

151
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,120
When you grow up, stop treating me like a wet nurse

152
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,520
Follow me often, be good

153
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,080
li adult

154
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,200
What advice does Taifu Xiang have?

155
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,640
Mr. Li, after the crown prince ascended the throne

156
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,560
You have to take good care of him for me, you know?

157
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,920
Please rest assured, Taifu Xiang

158
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,400
The prince and the tutor were kind to Li Si.

159
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,040
Li Siding will do his best

160
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,360
Assist the prince in running the government

161
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,360
With your words, I can walk with confidence

162
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,920
Is Taifu Xiang leaving?

163
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,560
Here are my ancestors, the kings and ancestors of the Great Qin Dynasty

164
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,080
The foundation of Da Qin is now inherited by the orthodox Ying Zheng

165
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,400
One should not ascend the throne during the period of mourning, but should observe filial piety

166
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,240
But a country cannot live without a king for a day

167
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,640
May all the late kings bless the new king after he succeeds to the throne.

168
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,400
The weather is smooth, the country is peaceful and the people are safe

169
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,040
Your Majesty Lu Buwei must do his best

170
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,600
Assist the new king to achieve the hegemony of the previous kings

171
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,440
The sages and ancestors of the Qin Dynasty are here

172
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,480
The unworthy son Ying Zheng kowtows

173
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,000
Although I am not the real Ying Zheng

174
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,160
But I must do my best to be a good king

175
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,080
The master said that I will definitely unify the six countries

176
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,600
I lost my father when I was young. It’s rare for my father to treat me like his own son.

177
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,800
I know it was Lu Buwei who killed you

178
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,640
I will definitely avenge my father.

179
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,560
The prince finally ascended the throne and became the king of Qin

180
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,240
I thought I was going to mess up something by coming here.

181
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,680
But history has never changed

182
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,320
Ying Zheng finally became the King of Qin

183
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,120
history is history

184
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,720
Always run on its own track

185
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,800
no one can stop

186
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,080
Just like Taifu Xiang’s departure, no one can stop him

187
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,600
I never thought I would be leaving tomorrow

188
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,400
I'm really reluctant

189
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,800
It's strange, people are still people after all

190
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,200
Besides, we've been together for a long time

191
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,200
It would be nice if they had a phone

192
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,440
Call your second brother or third brother when you have time

193
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,520
Or call Qin Shihuang

194
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,960
Or call Tingfang

195
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,560
I just went to Wushi Ranch

196
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,560
It turns out she hasn't gone back yet

197
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,520
Has Miss Wu come back yet?

198
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,960
I know she is avoiding me

199
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,440
In fact, it's all my fault

200
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,360
She is a truly affectionate woman

201
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,480
It's all my fault, if it weren't for me

202
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,600
Then she won't be so tired that she can't return home.

203
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,320
if she didn't know me

204
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,960
I think she'd be much happier now

205
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,400
Miss Qin, I want you to do me a favor

206
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,280
If I can do it, Qin Qing is bound to do it

207
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,680
I want you to give this thing to Tingfang

208
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,680
Although I leave tomorrow

209
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,160
I can't say sorry to her in person

210
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,680
But at least I wrote this note to her

211
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,040
So that she can know my feelings

212
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,880
I know she might not understand

213
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,840
words of my time

214
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,600
But I think my conscience will feel better

215
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,520
Miss Wu knew that Brother Xiang also remembered her before he left.

216
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,720
It must be very comforting

217
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,720
At least Brother Xiang still has her in his heart

218
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,280
I'll leave tomorrow

219
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,040
Let’s have tea instead of wine and cheers

220
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,480
Cheers Cheers

221
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,080
Today, people break willows in long pavilions, but in your time

222
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,320
What do you do when you say goodbye?

223
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,800
A lot of friends will go out for dinner to say goodbye

224
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,400
Or go to karaoke to sing and take sticker photos

225
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,760
By the way, we can take pictures

226
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,800
Photograph?

227
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,560
Is the painting done?

228
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,360
Very similar

229
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,600
Then I’ll give it to you as a souvenir.

230
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,280
No, it would be better if this painting stayed with you

231
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,760
The king lives forever

232
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,320
The prince finally ascended the throne and became King of Qin

233
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,800
I can’t imagine the yellow-haired boy of the past

234
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,680
Today I have become a different person

235
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,560
History will not change

236
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,080
Everyone's destiny is different

237
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,680
Just like me, come back this time

238
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,400
The happiest experience is getting to know you

239
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,720
Brother, see you later

240
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,840
Goodbye Goodbye

241
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:59,160
Mr. Xiang...fortunately he was able to make it in time

242
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,400
Mr. Zou, are you also here to see your eldest brother off?

243
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,600
Taifu Xiang returned to the future today, which is an important event for the ages.

244
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,360
I should treat you with respect

245
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,760
Qin Qing won’t come today

246
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,960
It would be better not to have such an environment

247
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,640
So as not to cry later

248
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,320
Master, is your communicator ready?

249
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,360
You can use it, he was also at this time

250
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,760
received my message

251
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,520
Brother, this communicator is so small

252
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,360
Is it really powerful enough to take you back to the future?

253
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,840
I think it's ok

254
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,760
Take care of yourself

255
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,120
Take care of yourself…

256
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,800
There seems to be something wrong with Taifu Xiang.

257
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,960
No, is it so troublesome to have no electricity now?

258
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,720
Is eldest brother really gone?

259
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,120
But why is the body still here?

260
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
Qing'er... something serious is going wrong

261
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
What's the matter, dad?

262
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,240
Xiang Shaolong said his communicator had no power

263
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,080
Can't go back to the future

264
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,400
Didn't he leave?

265
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,640
Is there any e-mail?

266
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,600
No, bro

267
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,320
No, can't you find it, third brother?

268
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,840
I don’t have one here either.

269
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,160
What happened? Your Secret Records of Lu Gong

270
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,320
This is the latest revision at this time.

271
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,520
There is not even the word "electric", the word "electric" is like this

272
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,200
I know electronic characters

273
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,360
Why are you looking at him? Find him quickly.

274
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,560
What happened? There is no power now

275
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,080
No, when I was studying

276
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,600
The teacher said that dilute sulfuric acid can generate electricity

277
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,440
Looking for dilute sulfuric acid...find it quickly

278
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,280
Dilute sulfuric acid?

279
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,080
yes

280
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,640
What's sour, brother?

281
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Anyway, look for dilute sulfuric acid

282
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,520
If you find dilute sulfuric acid, there will be electricity. Find it quickly.

283
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,280
In short, if there are rare words, look for them; if there are acid words, look for them.

284
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,440
If there is a word for sulfur, look for it. For example, sulfur. Look for it quickly...

285
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,040
hurry up

286
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,120
The new king is still in his weak years

287
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,960
The late king has the order to be assisted by this prime minister and the queen mother.

288
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,760
Until the day of crowning ceremony

289
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,640
Today is the first morning meeting since the king ascended the throne

290
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,800
Dear friends, what important matter do we want to discuss together?

291
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,000
Your Majesty, I have something to report.

292
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,640
Accurate performance

293
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,880
Hundreds of imperial officials are in charge of national government affairs

294
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Everyone must perform their duties according to their functions

295
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,880
Therefore, Weichen has drawn up a list

296
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,120
In order for the king to deploy hundreds of officials and appoint talents

297
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,320
Promoted Meng Ao to general and commanded the three armies

298
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,400
Prime Minister Zuo Yang Quanjun moved to the Shanzao Department

299
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,240
In charge of meals in the palace

300
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,880
Wang Luqian was appointed as Daliang in charge of local education.

301
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,400
Your Majesty, the bones of the late king are not yet cold.

302
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,920
Transferring officials from the previous dynasty without authorization is disrespectful to the late king.

303
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,000
Reforms come and go, and this is true throughout the ages

304
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,080
Could it be that the Yang Qing family does not trust the Queen Mother and the current king?

305
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,800
The late king has his destiny, and I will assist Prime Minister Lu in governing the country.

306
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,200
Could it be that all the ministers disobey the late king’s order?

307
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,000
I don't dare

308
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,880
I have no objections. Please take a look at it.

309
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,640
In addition to the proposal to transfer General Lao to another

310
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,840
I have no objection to this memorial

311
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,960
Queen Mother, what do you have to say?

312
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,920
Commander-in-law Lao has served many times in escorting you

313
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,680
Therefore, I believe that he should continue to serve

314
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,440
In compliance with the Queen Mother's decree

315
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,680
I also have a suggestion

316
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,880
Your Majesty, please tell me

317
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,320
Li Si, the servant of the widow, is very knowledgeable.

318
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,760
I want to promote him to Taishi

319
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,720
Your Majesty, when governing a country, we must look at the big picture

320
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,320
There is no need to take too much care of the attendants around you

321
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,640
Otherwise, you will mislead yourself and others.

322
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,320
Your Majesty, I will put this proposal aside for the time being.

323
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,280
The prime minister is polite

324
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,120
As expected, he looked arrogant.

325
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,160
Just like the way he used to beg for mercy in the Prime Minister's Mansion

326
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,760
It's really different

327
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,200
This also requires more promotion from the Prime Minister.

328
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,400
It’s not who you are that promotes you

329
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,760
It's a woman who was deceived by her appearance

330
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,880
The Prime Minister is not the only one who is destined to be supported by a female noble.

331
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,640
I'm just learning from you

332
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,040
Don't act recklessly just because the Queen Mother is happy.

333
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,680
I, the Prime Minister, can do my best to serve as an excellent minister.

334
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,960
It depends on intelligence and strategy

335
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,600
If you only rely on color, it will take less than three to five years.

336
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,960
When you are weak and lustful

337
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,040
The queen mother will abandon you like a piece of shit

338
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,160
It's hard to predict people's fate

339
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,440
In three to five years, it is unknown who will be the most powerful minister.

340
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,760
But I'm sure some people have gray hair on their temples

341
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,040
Entering the Year of Sangyu

342
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,760
See the king

343
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,200
From now on, I have to go to court early every day, which is really a chore

344
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,200
Your Majesty, what you said is wrong.

345
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,720
Your Majesty, to be a king, you must first be diligent and love your people.

346
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,600
Besides, the king has just ascended the throne, so this matter cannot be neglected.

347
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,360
Listening to politics is like sitting around and waiting

348
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
Don't address the king with the word "Hey"

349
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,560
The king should be called the king

350
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,800
Brother, can you please stop making noise?

351
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,280
Master, aren't you leaving?

352
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,520
It's not that I won't leave, it's that I can't leave

353
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,840
can you help me

354
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,240
Can

355
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
Send someone quickly now

356
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,000
Quickly find sulfur and sulfuric acid and bring them back to me

357
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
sulfuric acid?

358
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,080
Have you never heard of sulfuric acid?

359
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,600
Have you ever heard what sulfur and sulfuric acid are?

360
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,360
I have also heard of sulfur

361
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,280
But for sulfuric acid, please forgive me for being ignorant.

362
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,920
Okay, now I need it urgently

363
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,320
Find these two things and come back

364
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,760
Because I want to use these two things to generate electricity

365
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,960
Generate electricity?

366
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,640
I know you don’t know what power generation is.

367
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,400
No, you go find someone now

368
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,920
Maybe you are familiar with the geographical environment

369
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,360
Or maybe it’s someone who usually mines?

370
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,200
Know where the man from Brimstone will come back

371
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,040
You can find it for me and I'll just ask him.

372
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,000
This is easy to do

373
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,440
Taifu Xiang and Taifu Qin read many books

374
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,120
I am also very familiar with the geography of Qin, but...

375
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,600
Can you make electricity yourself?

376
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,760
Yeah, I'm assuming it's a box

377
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,120
It's full of sulfuric acid

378
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,120
This is a copper wire, that is a zinc wire

379
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,000
Or other metal

380
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,600
Sulfuric acid will ionize them

381
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,000
After ionization, the positive ions will pass through this copper wire

382
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,000
Go to the negative ions

383
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,360
This will create a circuit, which will generate electricity

384
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,680
What is ionization?

385
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,320
Ionization is actually...

386
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,280
In fact, it is a problem of potential difference

387
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,960
So the positive and negative ions will move around

388
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,560
What are positive ions and negative ions?

389
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,720
Actually, it’s because my academic performance is not very good.

390
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,080
So I don’t read much

391
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
I don't know how to answer this question for you

392
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,120
But don't be afraid, I understand

393
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,880
If electricity can really be generated

394
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,960
How to put it in your communicator?

395
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,880
Good question, because my communicator has a charger

396
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,800
Just use two wires to connect its positive and negative terminals

397
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,200
Once fully charged I can go back

398
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,360
What you mean is, as long as the communicator has power

399
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,800
you can go

400
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Yeah, as long as it has power

401
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I can receive information from the future world

402
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,200
Then I can go back

403
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,040
Is the sulfuric acid Brother Xiang wants in water form?

404
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,040
So to speak, but we are called a liquid

405
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,200
When Qin Qing traveled to Bashu

406
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,080
Passed by some stone mountains and saw medicinal stones

407
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,160
The stone contains sulfur

408
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah?

409
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,920
Finding sulfur is not difficult

410
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,480
But sulfur is a piece of medicinal stone, not water.

411
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,600
I know, but if you could get it back

412
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,440
I have a way to turn it into a liquid

413
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,200
But now I don’t even have a chance to do experiments

414
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,800
Qing'er, you have nothing to worry about and are in a hurry.

415
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,320
But have you ever thought about yourself?

416
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,360
Why did the godfather say this?

417
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:59,160
What if you really find a way to turn sulfur into sulfuric acid?

418
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,080
Xiang Shaolong can make electricity

419
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,920
Then you will never see each other again

420
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,280
Brother Xiang just looked anxious

421
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,520
Qin Qing naturally wanted to help him

422
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,320
Never thought about anything else

423
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,280
Originally, Brother Xiang had already decided to leave

424
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,920
Qin Qing shouldn't have selfish motives

425
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,080
The whole world is big

426
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,360
Find someone with matching character and talent

427
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,520
It’s not difficult to say it’s easy, but it’s really not easy to say it’s easy.

428
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,480
It's rare that you just meet one

429
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,440
You should keep him well

430
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,200
Instead of sending him away

431
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,440
Qing'er, think it over yourself.

432
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,000
Your Majesty, the memorial has been processed

433
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,960
A stack that needs to be dealt with immediately

434
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,160
The other stack can be a little later, please take a look at it

435
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,240
There's no need to look at it, you can just look at it on my behalf

436
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,400
yes

437
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,280
Such laziness is not the behavior of a benevolent king

438
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,440
See Prime Minister Lu

439
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,520
See Prime Minister Lu

440
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,000
No need to clean up

441
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,160
How to handle state affairs without reading memorials?

442
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,360
The Queen Mother and the Prime Minister assist the government

443
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,520
I just listen to my words

444
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,840
What difference does it make if you have read the memorial or not?

445
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,000
The ministers and the queen mother assisting the government are the orders of the late king.

446
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,640
The king's slight words are disrespectful to the late king.

447
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,280
The Prime Minister is disrespectful to others

448
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,560
After entering, he has not yet performed the courtesy of a monarch and his ministers.

449
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,640
you…

450
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,080
You...how can you use the word "you" to address a widower?

451
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,760
You guys retreat first

452
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,000
Wei Chen resigned

453
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,320
The slave resigns

454
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,560
Queen Mother See Queen Mother

455
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,440
You guys retreat first

456
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,760
Yes, Queen Mother

457
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,760
Why does the Prime Minister look so angry?

458
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,240
The king kept talking to the ministers about the etiquette of the king and his ministers.

459
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,920
Can a son disobey his father?

460
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,280
The king is still young and made a blunder.

461
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,880
Why does the Prime Minister need to be so angry?

462
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,360
For years I have endured the humiliation

463
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,240
It’s all for the future of my parents and children

464
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,440
Now, someone actually oppresses me with the courtesy of a monarch and a minister

465
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,120
It really makes me sad

466
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
Queen Mother

467
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,320
Your Majesty, just apologize to the Prime Minister.

468
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,680
If the king forgets who is his biological father

469
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,080
There’s no point even if I apologize

470
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,600
So how can the Prime Minister calm down?

471
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,440
I ask your Majesty to respect me as your father-in-law and announce it to the world.

472
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,760
The civil and military officials of the Manchu Dynasty knew this

473
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,520
I, Lu Buwei, am both a minister and a father.

474
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,960
The king will not forget his ancestors

475
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,880
But so blatantly

476
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,760
Afraid of causing people to gossip

477
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,960
The overall situation has been decided, who dares to say anything?

478
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,160
Besides, I have military power

479
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,240
I will kill anyone who goes against my will

480
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
In this case, the king will pay homage to Father Zhong as a filial son

481
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,480
Queen Mother

482
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,800
Still not kneeling?

483
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,200
middle father

484
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,080
good boy

485
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,360
I'm so happy today

486
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,720
Zhu Ji

487
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,240
It's getting late, the Prime Minister will have an early court appearance tomorrow

488
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,160
It's better to go home and rest early.

489
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,000
You and I have been tortured for more than ten years

490
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,200
Now we finally wait until the big thing is decided

491
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,400
Has the Queen Mother forgotten our many years of kindness?

492
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,240
Prime Minister, don’t get me wrong. It’s true that I have not taken off my filial piety.

493
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,240
Although I have no love for the late king,

494
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,360
But we finally became a couple

495
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,560
The period of mourning has not passed yet, so just throw yourself into the arms of others at this time

496
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,640
I always feel a little uneasy inside

497
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,480
Filial filial piety? The filial piety of the Queen Mother

498
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,520
Haven't you already taken it off for someone?

499
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,480
Why did the Prime Minister say this?

500
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,640
Queen Mother

501
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,880
The Zhu Ji of those days is no longer what she used to be

502
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,960
But don’t forget, Queen Mother

503
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,200
As my father-in-law, I hold a high position and have military power.

504
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,920
Want to kill a mere chief of the imperial guards?

505
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,120
It's so effortless, you can do it yourself

506
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,480
Lu Buwei could kill the late king

507
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,800
It can kill you too

508
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
Let's not tangle with him anymore

509
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,000
Go to a deserted place to spend the rest of your life

510
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,400
Do you think it’s okay?

511
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,560
for us

512
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,680
There is still a long way to go before we can live the rest of our lives in peace.

513
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,720
We worked hard to get the throne of Queen Mother

514
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,240
Are you willing to give up?

515
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,360
Zhu Ji has never been attached to power

516
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,840
I just want to be with Ai Lang

517
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,840
Live an ordinary life happily

518
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,520
Do you think Lu Buwei

519
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,320
Will it make us happy and happy?

520
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,720
With his ruthless character

521
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,880
Even if we escape to the ends of the earth

522
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,960
He will never let us go

523
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,600
Subject to others

524
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,320
It's better to eradicate him as soon as possible

525
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,000
What can we do?

526
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,760
You have the important responsibility of assisting the government

527
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,160
The king is your biological son again

528
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,560
He will definitely listen to your words and promote me

529
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,040
What rank do you want to be promoted to?

530
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,240
Taiwei

531
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,360
Lieutenant? Do you want to take charge of the country's military power?

532
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,400
Yes, as long as we have military power

533
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,280
There is no need to be afraid of Lu Buwei

534
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,520
But I'm afraid it won't be easy to promote you to Taiwei.

535
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,920
You are the queen mother, if you can't do it

536
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,360
Who else can do it? The question is whether you are willing to do it

537
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,680
OK, the time is right

538
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,000
Zhu Ji will definitely help you fight for military power.

539
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,080
Get military power as soon as possible

540
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,440
Happy days will come soon

541
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,120
It will rain heavily in less than two hours

542
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,400
Qing'er and Brother Xiang are visiting

543
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,080
Brother Xiang

544
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,720
Miss Qin, I came here to ask you about sulfuric acid.

545
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,720
Can't find it?

546
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,480
Sorry, nothing was found

547
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,000
Painting?

548
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,120
actually…

549
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,840
Just draw slowly

550
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,240
Brother Xiang

551
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,040
It's useless for you to look through the brochure for him until midnight

552
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,640
Leave as soon as you say you want to leave

553
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,000
Brother Xiang didn’t hold an umbrella

554
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,000
Brother Xiang

555
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,280
Thank you

556
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,040
Too bad, I only brought an umbrella in a hurry

557
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,880
Let's take shelter under a tree

558
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,520
No, never take shelter under a tree during thunder and lightning

559
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,240
Otherwise, it is easy to be injured by lightning.

560
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,400
Thunder and lightning?

561
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,400
Brother Xiang, actually you need electricity

562
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,840
Is it the same as thunder and lightning in the sky?

563
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,160
Yes, why couldn't I think of this?

564
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,720
It would be great if we could bring down the electricity from the sky

565
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,840
Yes, just bring down the electricity from the sky.

566
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,640
Brother Xiang, do you have any idea?

567
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,240
real?
