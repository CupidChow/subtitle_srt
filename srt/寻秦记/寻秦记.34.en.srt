1
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,400
Look, I can't see myself in the mirror

2
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,040
How come even you, Mr. Xiang...

3
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,000
Tell me quickly

4
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,200
Is the widowed person going to die soon?

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,600
Taifu Xiang, you can know the past and the future

6
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,560
you must know

7
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,400
Is there someone who wants to do harm to me? Is that right?

8
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,880
You calm down first

9
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,440
You tell me to calm down?

10
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,360
Now I can't see myself in the mirror

11
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,560
How to calm down?

12
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,720
Also, even you, Taifu Xiang, are like this

13
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,520
It must be a bad omen, it must be

14
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,520
Your Majesty, Taishi Li has something urgent to see you.

15
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,120
Don't let others know about this

16
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,800
Quick pass

17
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,920
Li Si meets the king and Taifu Xiang

18
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,120
Li Si, you are so anxious to find me.

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,160
What happened?

20
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,720
Your Majesty, something bad is going on

21
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,280
What happened?

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,960
Your Majesty, Lu Buwei has borrowed Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals.

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,920
To stir up resentment among the people earlier than

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,440
Unexpectedly, this unhealthy trend

25
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,280
It was brought to the court this morning

26
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,960
What does it mean?

27
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,400
Your Majesty did not come to court this morning

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,800
Lu Buwei's party actually started talking a lot

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,400
It implies that it is difficult for the king to take on the important task of being a king.

30
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,240
What's more, they are secretly planning to select another talented person.

31
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,040
intended to replace

32
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,240
Brother, I really can’t see your appearance in the mirror

33
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,560
Godfather, why is this happening?

34
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,880
This kind of thing is really unheard of

35
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,120
For the moment, I couldn't figure out why.

36
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,160
It's just that I saw a vision this morning

37
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,280
What vision?

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,040
All the snakes, insects, rats, and ants inside and outside the humble house this morning

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,280
It is common for families to move

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,080
Godfather, is it possible that in nature?

41
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,760
Something big will happen?

42
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,120
Common snakes, insects, rats and ants

43
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,840
Everyone has the ability to predict misfortune and fortune

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,920
When snakes and ants move, it means there are changes in the world.

45
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,400
According to my horoscope

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,680
and all records in ancient books

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,400
Within three days, a broom star will appear

48
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,920
That would be bad. According to legend, whenever a broom star appears,

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
There will definitely be a great disaster coming

50
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,040
In our time, the broom star is called Halley's Comet.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,240
Appears every hundred or so decades

52
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,520
It's just a very common astronomical phenomenon.

53
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,680
But if this broom star doesn’t appear sooner or later,

54
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,040
It just happened to appear when the image in the eldest brother's mirror disappeared.

55
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,960
I'm afraid...

56
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,040
What I fear most now

57
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,120
It was Lu Buwei who took advantage of this opportunity

58
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,680
Attack the king further

59
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,600
If so, it's really not good

60
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,240
Mr. Zou, don’t worry

61
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,400
Big brother said that history is destined

62
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,040
Lu Buwei failed in the end

63
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,520
I don't believe he has the ability to change history

64
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,880
I want to emphasize again

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,920
your mission this time

66
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,640
Just go back and witness

67
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,280
The historical moment when King Qin Yingzheng ascended the throne

68
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,120
During this period, you must not act rashly

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,360
Because every time you did something in ancient times

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,840
Very likely to change history

71
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,320
What would happen if history really changed?

72
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,280
That's serious, you know?

73
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,840
The reason why you and I exist in this space is history

74
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,320
What do you think would happen if history changed?

75
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
That means…

76
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,600
Everything in this space will disappear

77
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,200
you are right

78
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,120
I understand, think about it

79
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,960
If Lu Buwei really became the king

80
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,560
Do you think he will keep the king alive?

81
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,480
With Lu Buwei’s treachery

82
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,800
I'm afraid that he will wipe out the roots and avoid future troubles.

83
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,800
good

84
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,800
So as long as the king has three advantages and two disadvantages

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,120
History will have a chance to change

86
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,240
Shaolong, according to what you said, if history changes

87
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,120
Then you can't stay in this world

88
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,720
If this is the case

89
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,480
The reason why Big Brother’s image in the mirror disappears

90
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,240
It's an omen

91
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,120
good

92
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,400
Then I don't understand

93
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,680
Big brother said that history has a chance to change

94
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,880
That's why the image in your mirror disappears

95
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,560
Why did the King's image in the mirror disappear at the same time?

96
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,000
If I guess correctly

97
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,920
The reason why Ying Zheng became the king

98
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,720
It was caused by Shaolong alone

99
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,240
Also for this reason

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,600
There is a causal relationship between Shaolong and the King

101
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,440
Now there is a problem with this "cause"

102
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,800
Therefore, "fruit" will naturally be affected

103
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,680
If the king's position is not guaranteed

104
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,640
Then brother, aren't you in danger?

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,320
Since the threat comes from Lu Buwei

106
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,200
Just let me strike first and kill Lu Buwei by force.

107
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,520
Okay, don't act rashly

108
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,080
Now Lu Buwei is not openly rebelling.

109
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,880
If we rashly step in,

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,080
Wouldn't it mean that giving him a chance would be detrimental to the king?

111
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,560
Are we just going to sit back and wait for death?

112
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,800
Don't worry

113
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,000
Lu Buwei worked hard

114
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,200
Wrote a copy of Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals and came out

115
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,760
I'm sure he will make the next move

116
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
It's not too late to take action after we see clearly

117
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,320
Shaolong

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,840
Don't worry, I'll be fine

119
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,040
Your Majesty, flying rocks from the sky are indeed a bad omen.

120
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,680
Never underestimate

121
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,960
As the old saying goes: flying rocks suddenly fall, and disaster is coming.

122
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,200
Your Majesty, this is very unfortunate.

123
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,880
Gentlemen, could you please be quiet and listen to what I have to say?

124
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,360
Flying rocks from the sky are rare

125
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,160
But it doesn’t necessarily mean disaster will come.

126
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,040
All the ministers are making wild guesses here

127
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,080
It would be ridiculous

128
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,800
Your Majesty, this is wrong.

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,560
Flying rocks from the sky are signs of divine punishment

130
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,200
The implication is that it refers directly to the king, and the king must be on his guard.

131
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,600
I dare to ask Mr. Lu, how did you know?

132
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,520
Does the moral of this vision refer directly to Renjun?

133
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,720
This relative is slightly involved in the study of Yi Gua

134
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,600
After the phenomenon of flying rocks appeared yesterday,

135
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,480
Wei Chen made a divination about this phenomenon.

136
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,720
The result is a divination of heaven and earth.

137
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,120
Mr. Lu, may I ask what the hexagram Tiandifu is?

138
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,680
I have little talent and little knowledge, so I am afraid that I will misinterpret the hexagrams.

139
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,440
Li Taishi was a learned man

140
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,280
You must be familiar with the sixty-four hexagrams of the Book of Changes

141
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,040
May I ask Li Taishi, what does this hexagram mean?

142
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,920
Li Si, what does this hexagram mean?

143
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,560
You might as well just say it

144
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,280
Yes, Your Majesty

145
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,080
The hexagram Tiandifu is the twelfth hexagram of the sixty-four hexagrams of the Book of Changes.

146
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,200
There is a cloud in the hexagram

147
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,680
Otherwise, it is not good for a gentleman to be a bandit, and he will go as far as he can and come back as small as he can.

148
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,240
Li Taishi, what do you mean by this?

149
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,280
Back to the Queen Mother, the hexagram "Heaven and Earth" is a symbol

150
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,960
Heaven is superior and earth is inferior, outer yang and inner yin

151
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,880
As the saying goes: Heaven and earth are not connected, and everything is blocked.

152
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,000
There is no country

153
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,800
Li Si, could you put it more simply and directly?

154
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,440
Li Si's Symbol of Yi Gua

155
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,040
I really don’t know much about it, please forgive me.

156
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,000
It’s not that Li Taishi doesn’t know how to speak, it’s that he doesn’t dare to speak.

157
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,200
Since Prime Minister Lu is so bold to speak

158
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,640
I would like to hear the details

159
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,080
Prime Minister Lu, just say it and let everyone listen.

160
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,840
Your Majesty, please forgive me for speaking frankly.

161
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,120
Heaven and earth are not hexagrams, Qian hexagram is on top

162
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,880
It originally represented that the monarch was aloof.

163
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,360
只可惜坤卦在下, 乾坤相隔

164
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,280
It means the king of this country

165
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,000
No longer supported by his subjects

166
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Prime Minister Lu, how dare you speak such arrogant words?

167
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,920
Is it possible to commit the following crime?

168
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,480
This is what the hexagram refers to, and Wei Chen just said it directly according to the book

169
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,720
Your Majesty, please ask Li Taishi

170
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,440
See if Wei Chen is talking nonsense?

171
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,200
Li Si, is this true?

172
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,640
Please forgive me, Your Majesty

173
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,240
It seems that Li Taishi still dare not say it

174
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,880
Because the meaning of this hexagram is to be a king

175
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,480
If you lose the support of the people, you should abdicate and make way for someone more worthy.

176
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,480
So bold, Lu Buwei

177
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,160
How dare you ask the king to abdicate?

178
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,480
Prime Minister Lu is too eloquent.

179
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,240
I think all the kings of the Qin Dynasty have been passed down from generation to generation.

180
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,080
I have never heard of anything about abdicating one’s throne in favor of a worthy person.

181
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,920
Has the deer man forgotten?

182
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,560
In ancient times, Yao and Shun both had the virtue of surrender.

183
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
Is it praised by the world?

184
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,080
The king should imitate the sages and obey the will of heaven

185
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,920
To accumulate virtue for Qin’s subjects

186
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,800
Otherwise, you will be punished by God

187
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,080
That's not necessarily the case

188
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,360
Great King, the last line of the hexagram "Heaven and Earth"

189
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,800
Is it really possible to achieve peace of mind and turn danger into disaster?

190
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,760
Things may not be as dangerous as Mr. Lu said

191
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,760
The so-called good luck

192
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,080
It means that if the king can abdicate the throne and make way for a worthy person,

193
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,880
How to avoid this disaster

194
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,320
Reporting to the king, Taifu Xiang asked for an audience outside the palace.

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,560
Mr. Xiang? Please come quickly

196
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,760
yes

197
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,200
Such an exaggeration? I really don’t know if I don’t tell you.

198
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,200
Taifu Xiang is well-informed

199
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,520
I wonder what your opinion is on this matter?

200
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,320
I have no idea, I think the best thing now is

201
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,800
The king brings all his ministers

202
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,480
Go and see that flying stone from the sky

203
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,640
What's going on

204
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,360
Unexpectedly, from the sky

205
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,640
How could such a huge stone fall?

206
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,480
It's incredible

207
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,960
According to Mr. Zou’s opinion

208
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,040
What is the mystery of this flying stone from the sky?

209
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,120
King, come and take a look

210
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,360
Your Majesty, look at those cracks

211
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,640
Your Majesty, this flying stone from the sky really has a lot of mystery.

212
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Mr. Zou, what is the mystery of this stone?

213
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,600
Everyone, please read clearly the words on the stone.

214
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,160
The king of the text is appointed by heaven

215
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
It's simply baffling

216
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,640
What is the king of text? It’s totally meaningless

217
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,120
What General Meng said was wrong

218
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,440
King of text

219
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,920
The two characters in the main text combined are the character "policy"

220
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,160
The word "policy"? This sentence is the king of the text

221
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,120
Isn’t he referring to the King?

222
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,760
This mystery

223
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,360
God has bestowed upon you the king as your true destiny.

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,160
It turns out that this flying rock from the sky is a good omen.

225
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,320
Long live the king

226
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Long live the king…

227
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,720
Long live the king, long live the king...

228
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,440
Long live the king... OK

229
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,800
How unreasonable

230
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,000
I never imagined that I have worked hard for so many years

231
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,880
Hundreds of people worked together to compile this book of Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals

232
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,960
Hundreds of thousands of words

233
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,000
Not as good as a few words on a piece of rotten stone

234
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,280
From a humble perspective

235
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,760
The carvings on this so-called flying stone from the sky

236
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,720
Xiang Shaolong must have asked someone to carve it in advance.

237
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,600
He clearly wanted to use this so-called secret

238
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,560
Support Ying Zheng’s momentum

239
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,120
True intention

240
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,520
I want to make a big fuss out of this piece of flying rock from the sky.

241
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,760
Now Xiang Shaolong actually has the opportunity to take advantage of him

242
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,880
Come on, use Zi's spear and attack Zi's shield

243
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,320
Xiang Shaolong, I am incompatible with you.

244
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,280
Ronger

245
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,120
Dad, come here

246
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,560
Where do you want to go?

247
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,760
My daughter wants to go to a clothing store to do some shopping.

248
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,960
Ronger, stop using clothing stores as a cover-up

249
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,840
Do you think dad doesn’t know?

250
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,480
You've been meeting that Jing Jun a lot lately.

251
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,400
Even if it is, what's the big deal?

252
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,880
What's the big deal?

253
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,240
You clearly know that dad and Xiang Shaolong are mortal enemies.

254
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,000
You actually secretly interact with his people in private?

255
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,120
My daughter and Brother Jing have always been upright.

256
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,720
Never sneaky

257
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,720
What's more, Brother Jing is Brother Jing

258
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,120
Xiang Shaolong is Xiang Shaolong

259
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,560
The two cannot be confused at all

260
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,000
Damn it, daddy is warning you now

261
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,080
If you open a clothing store, dad can still tolerate it.

262
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,400
If I let dad know in the future

263
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,840
You continue to interact with his people

264
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,520
Dad will be rude

265
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,440
Now, has my daughter said she wants to see Jing...him?

266
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,520
My daughter just wants to go to the clothing store

267
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,640
Okay, if dad you are so unhappy

268
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,280
My daughter immediately closed the clothing store

269
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,880
Stay at home for the rest of your life, never see anyone

270
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,880
you…

271
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,840
Prime Minister, please calm down.

272
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,440
The eldest lady has grown so big, she should be sensible

273
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,080
You take care of yourself

274
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,760
Follow me into the study room

275
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,440
I don’t know where that guy is hiding again.

276
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:00,120
Niangrong...are you feeling uncomfortable?

277
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,880
You are so shy every time you ask someone out

278
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,680
Now we are not sneaking around

279
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,080
What is there to hide from the light?

280
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
Niang Rong, it’s not like you don’t know

281
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,080
Now your father and my eldest brother are at loggerheads

282
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,720
I can't go to the clothing store to see you

283
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,520
You can't come to Taifu's Mansion to find me

284
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,760
If I hadn't made an appointment at a place like this

285
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,440
How can we meet?

286
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,040
Anyway I don't like this

287
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,200
Now it seems like the two of us are having an affair

288
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,120
be seen by others

289
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,440
I thought we two were adulterers and adulterers.

290
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,880
Niangrong

291
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,680
I do this because I don’t want you to be scolded by your father.

292
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,720
Don't be angry

293
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,960
don't be angry

294
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,760
To be honest, there was a lot of uproar in the city a few days ago

295
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,080
What mystery appears on that flying stone from the sky?

296
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,640
It must be your good big brother again

297
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,000
A trick, right?

298
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,920
Big brother is just doing this because he wants to help the king.

299
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,240
Then you admit it

300
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,840
You have done anything on that flying rock from the sky?

301
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,360
Your elder brother is really cunning too

302
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,200
What about your dad? Isn’t your dad just doing some tricks?

303
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,160
Find someone to write this Lu Shi Chun Qiu

304
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,520
Basically, I want to use it to mobilize public opinion in the DPRK.

305
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,920
Then force the king to take the Zen position

306
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,400
Isn't your father more cunning?

307
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,240
If one day

308
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,440
Your eldest brother and my father are really fighting each other.

309
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,720
Who will you help?

310
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,480
What do you think of me? That's my big brother

311
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,840
That's my dad too

312
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,680
Do you want me to turn against you?

313
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,360
I…

314
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,240
Can't you answer?

315
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,080
Okay, come back to me after you can answer the question

316
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,560
Niangrong

317
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,560
Don't chase me anymore

318
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,040
Otherwise, I won’t even let you look for it again.

319
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,600
Okay, I finally see my elder brother in the mirror

320
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,240
I was very worried before

321
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,960
Shaolong, you will suddenly disappear before my eyes

322
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,560
You don't have to worry now

323
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,320
I always thought that everything in the world

324
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,720
The yin and yang and the five elements are mutually reinforcing and inhibiting each other.

325
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,760
Unexpectedly, even people’s fate is the same

326
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,160
It’s like the life between you and the king, Shaolong

327
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,640
It’s really incredible that they are involved in each other

328
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,040
The reason why I found Pan'er to replace Ying Zheng was

329
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,920
I want to go back to the 21st century quickly

330
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,000
Unexpectedly, it would turn out like this

331
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,960
Could this be called God's will to trick people?

332
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,280
Now I only hope that you, Shaolong, and the king

333
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,960
It will be safe and sound from now on

334
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,000
Then you don’t have to worry anymore

335
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,680
Brother, it’s too bad

336
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,000
What's up?

337
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,600
I just heard it at the market

338
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,400
The State of Zhao learned that the king and Lu Buwei were at odds with each other.

339
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,840
Taking the opportunity to dispatch General Li Mu

340
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,480
Led the Zhao army to suppress the border

341
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,760
Your Majesty, do you want me to lead an army on an expedition?

342
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,040
good

343
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,320
I have discussed this matter with Li Si

344
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,800
Li Si’s analysis makes sense.

345
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,520
all the time

346
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,440
Lu Buwei was in charge of the country's military power

347
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,960
And the generals in the DPRK such as Meng Ao are all his party members.

348
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,880
This time it happened to be the widow who got it from Lu Buwei.

349
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,080
Great opportunity to regain military power

350
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,800
Your Majesty, I don’t know how to fight at all.

351
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,960
You'd better find someone more suitable than me

352
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,720
Now beside the widow

353
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,320
The only people I trust the most are Taifu Xiang and Li Si.

354
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,920
Li Si was born as a scribe and had no ability to tie a chicken.

355
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,600
Could it be that Taifu Xiang wanted the widow to send Li Si to lead the army?

356
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,440
That's not what I meant, Your Majesty

357
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,080
Mr. Xiang no longer has to refuse.

358
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,880
As long as Taifu Xiang returns victorious,

359
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,120
Not only did he achieve military merit for me,

360
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,880
You can also take advantage of the opportunity to help others regain military power.

361
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,200
Your Majesty, it would be great if we win the war.

362
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
What if we lose... in the eyes of the few?

363
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,840
There is absolutely no word for failure

364
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Have you forgotten, Mr. Xiang?

365
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,160
Are the fates of you and me involved in each other?

366
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,200
Only a few people sit firmly on the throne of the king

367
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,720
The widow and Taifu Xiang

368
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,240
Only then can you get real peace of mind

369
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,720
What about Lu Buwei?

370
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,760
If Lu Buwei knew that your Majesty sent me to go on an expedition,

371
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,440
He will definitely oppose it vigorously

372
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
I am the king of a country

373
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,760
Now, coupled with the support of the Queen Mother,

374
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,520
I don’t believe that I can’t beat Lu Buwei

375
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,680
So what about Zhao Guo’s coach Li Mu?

376
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,520
His relationship with your Majesty...

377
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,240
Mr. Xiang, please remember this carefully

378
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,200
Li Mu is just the godfather of Zhao Pan in the past

379
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,680
Now I am the king of Qin

380
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,720
It has nothing to do with this person at all

381
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,120
It is said that there are no fathers and sons on the battlefield.

382
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,120
Now that the two armies are at war, how can there be any sense of friendship?

383
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,960
Even if one day I have to kill this person personally

384
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,040
No mercy either

385
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,400
Does the king really intend to order Xiang Shaolong to lead the army?

386
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,480
yes

387
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,240
According to the opinion of the prime minister

388
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,920
Will the king take advantage of this opportunity to fight against Zhao Jun?

389
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,280
How about taking advantage of the situation to regain military power?

390
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,760
The truth has long been known that the king has such a move

391
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,080
But it's a pity that he doesn't seem to have such strength yet.

392
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,720
Now the Qin State has great military power

393
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,760
The foundation is in our hands

394
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,080
Who should be appointed to lead the army?

395
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,040
I'm afraid it's not up to him to decide on his own

396
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,480
The prime minister is your assistant minister

397
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,520
The king’s father-in-law again

398
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,320
The prime minister could have suggested that the subordinates should lead the army

399
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,640
Then we are not afraid that the king will take advantage of the opportunity.

400
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,720
You are definitely not suitable to lead

401
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,640
The truth is that I want you to stay in Xianyang

402
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,440
To make the king have some scruples

403
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,720
I have heard of Wang Jian under your command.

404
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,960
Brave and good at fighting, and repeatedly accomplished extraordinary feats

405
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,400
The truth is to recommend that he take charge

406
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Wang Jian was loyal to his country and fought hard to kill the enemy.

407
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,440
I believe he will live up to his trust and come back victorious

408
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,400
At that time, the military power held by the Prime Minister will

409
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,960
Naturally, it is even more impregnable.

410
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,600
What? You want me to recommend it to the king?

411
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,040
Will you be the coach?

412
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,920
Yes, I want to take this opportunity to fight against the Zhao army

413
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,880
When people heard that they were about to go on an expedition, they were afraid that it would be too late to run away.

414
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,160
You actually offered to lead troops to fight

415
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,720
Actually I did this this time

416
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,680
It is also for the future plans of the Queen Mother

417
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,920
Queen Mother, just imagine

418
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,960
If I go on this expedition and return with meritorious service,

419
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,280
Reused by the king

420
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,800
Then we don’t have to be afraid of Lu Buwei anymore

421
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,280
No, I can't let you take this risk

422
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,080
I don't want any power at all.

423
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,360
I just want to be with you forever

424
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,880
How could I not know the Queen Mother's feelings for me?

425
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,080
It’s just that you should have a long-term perspective when doing things.

426
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,760
You shouldn’t just focus on the present

427
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,800
If we really can't hold real power

428
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,400
Then I'll have to spend my whole life being secretive

429
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,680
I really don’t want to wrong the Queen Mother

430
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,200
I don’t even want to live my life like this

431
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,000
Queen Mother, do you understand or not?

432
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,320
Of course I understand, but...

433
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,160
To ensure that we live a happy life in the future

434
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,360
Even if I go through fire and water, I will not hesitate

435
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,560
It’s not that I don’t want to help you

436
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,640
But even if I recommend you before the king

437
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,120
I'm afraid Lu Buwei may not agree with it either

438
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,760
You can rest assured about this Queen Mother

439
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,960
As long as the Queen Mother is willing to recommend me in front of the King

440
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,760
I am naturally confident that I can win the handsome seal

441
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,040
Report to your Majesty, according to reports from border guards

442
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,800
Li Muzheng of Zhao State led an army of 100,000 to invade Qin

443
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,560
Intention to invade Qicheng, the situation is not good

444
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,200
Wei Chen thinks

445
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,400
We should send a large army to Qicheng for reinforcements

446
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,560
To prevent a large-scale invasion by the Zhao army

447
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,240
This is what I mean

448
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,240
Everyone prefers to appoint Xiang Shaolong as the head coach

449
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,960
Lead the battle in person

450
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,720
This is absolutely impossible

451
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,200
Since Xiang Shaolong entered the Qin Dynasty

452
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,440
He has always held the position of Taifu

453
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,560
No experience in deploying troops and generals

454
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,280
According to my opinion

455
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,920
Meng Ao's general Wang Jian should take command and go on the expedition.

456
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,600
Wang Jian?

457
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,640
Your Majesty, I intend to personally lead the army into battle.

458
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,400
Changxinhou has extraordinary swordsmanship and unstoppable courage

459
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,600
He is truly a great general, so he serves as the head coach.

460
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,440
He will definitely defeat the Zhao army and return with meritorious service.

461
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,600
Changxinhou is the same as Xiang Taifu

462
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,000
Although proficient in swordsmanship

463
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,520
It's a pity that I lack marching combat experience

464
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,560
If he leads the army, how can he convince the people?

465
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,600
Even if Wang Jian leads the army

466
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,480
It’s not necessarily a sure win

467
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,880
What if we lose the battle?

468
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,360
Your Majesty, war is imminent

469
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,120
The appointment of a head coach should not be delayed

470
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,720
Now that we cannot make a final decision on these three candidates,

471
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,080
It is better to follow the Qin tradition

472
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,920
Order these three people to compete in the school field

473
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,920
To determine who belongs to the handsome seal

474
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,720
Your Majesty, what Mr. Lu proposed is a good idea.

475
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,520
The winner of the contest takes command

476
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,920
He will be able to convince the crowd and lead the army in an advantageous manner

477
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,360
Okay, let Xiang Shaolong, Wang Jian and Lao Ai

478
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,640
Let's compete on the school field tomorrow morning

479
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,920
Retreat from the court

480
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,160
Shaolong, are you really planning to grab the handsome seal and come back?

481
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,040
Do you think I want to rob it? The king ordered it

482
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,160
What's the difference? The result is the same

483
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,760
Shaolong, do you know that my late husband

484
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,200
That’s why I went out with the army

485
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,720
Gone never to return

486
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,960
I don't want you to make the same mistake again

487
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,800
Come on, I'm not the only one who wants to grab that handsome seal.

488
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,000
There is also Lao Ai

489
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,280
At worst, I will compete with him tomorrow

490
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,440
If I lose to him on purpose, then I won’t have to go on an expedition.

491
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,880
But if you can't get the cool seal

492
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,400
How to explain to the king?

493
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,200
Then I can only say that my skills are inferior to others.

494
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,680
Then I will really lose to the opponent

495
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,160
I don’t think your Majesty will blame me.

496
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,920
You won't cheat on me?

497
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,800
How could I deceive you?

498
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,080
I don’t know how to fight. Do you think I don’t like my longevity?

499
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,720
I've already thought about it, after this matter is over

500
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,320
I will resign to the king

501
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,200
Then I will go everywhere with you to play

502
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,040
Take you shopping for clothes and perm your hair

503
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,000
Go change your hairstyle

504
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,280
Like inserting a ball of flour and placing a piece of iron on top

505
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,320
Don't know what it looks like

506
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,760
Where to play?

507
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,080
Is it good to go to Japan, Milan, or Venice?

508
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,240
Venice? What place is it?

509
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,000
Venice is a city built on water

510
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,720
You have to take a boat to get in and out of this city.

511
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,240
In fact, the world is very big

512
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,880
Divided into Asia, Europe and America

513
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,840
Asia, Europe, America?

514
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,920
You don't understand even if I tell you, you act like a country woman

515
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,440
Lao Ai, are you awake?

516
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,400
What time is it now?

517
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,360
It’s still Yinshi now

518
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,160
Oops

519
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,920
Are you okay?

520
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,120
Why am I so weak? How could this be?

521
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,760
You'd better rest for a while and stop competing.

522
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,520
I know the reason

523
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,520
You kept dragging me to drink with you last night

524
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,240
You must have drugged the wine, right?

525
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,600
Lao Ai

526
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,680
you go away

527
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,600
I can't bear to do this.

528
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,280
I saw you risking your life to lead troops into battle

529
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,120
Do you know how long I have been waiting for today?

530
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,400
You actually ruined my life?

531
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,000
Just think of it as me

532
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,360
I really can't lose you

533
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,760
In case something happens to you

534
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,440
What do you want me to do?

535
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,440
Did you know?

536
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,160
I really need you by my side

537
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,280
You only care about yourself

538
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,640
Have you considered my feelings?

539
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,320
Lao Ai…

540
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,560
This slave deserves death. Please forgive me, Lord Marquis.

541
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,120
Lao Ai

542
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,080
Queen Mother, are you okay?

543
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,840
Queen Mother... Queen Mother, are you okay?

544
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,960
Because Chang Xinhou was seriously ill

545
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,320
Withdraw from this contest

546
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,720
Now Xiang Shaolong and Wang Jian compete

547
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,640
Competing for the seal of command

548
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,960
This time, it happened to be from the hands of Lu Buwei.

549
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,200
Great opportunity to regain military power

550
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,040
Your Majesty, I don’t know how to fight at all.

551
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,120
You'd better find someone more suitable than me

552
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,440
Could it be that Taifu Xiang has forgotten

553
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,360
Your fate and that of the widow are intertwined.

554
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,840
King

555
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,280
Too bad, I'm good at driving

556
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,080
But if I fight him on horseback, I will definitely lose.

557
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,080
Taifu Xiang, are you ready?

558
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,800
General Wang, no matter what the outcome of today's battle is

559
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,320
I hope everyone will stop clicking and not hurt the peace.

560
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,240
Taifu Xiang is indeed a gentleman, you can rest assured

561
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,480
Although I, Wang Jian, am not a hero,

562
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,240
But he always behaves openly and clearly, keeping public and private affairs in mind.

563
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,640
OK please

564
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,960
Taifu Xiang is indeed very skilled.

565
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,120
General Wang, thank you for letting me

566
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,920
Otherwise I will lose, thank you very much

567
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,080
Taifu Xiang, your martial arts skills are extraordinary and varied.

568
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,840
Wang Jian was convinced that he had lost.

569
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,200
No matter what, all competitions are based on victory or defeat.

570
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,960
Now that Xiang Shaolong is superior in skill,

571
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,160
The few people consecrated Xiang Shaolong as the general who protects the country.

572
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,760
Take command of the three armies and rush to Anyi immediately

573
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,320
Guard the city and defeat the Zhao army.

574
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,720
Yes, Your Majesty

575
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,560
Wang Jian, you said

576
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,520
Why was he defeated by Xiang Shaolong?

577
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,160
In the end, I will ask myself that my skills are not as good as others

578
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,160
I really live up to the Prime Minister’s high expectations.

579
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,080
You are wrong, it does not mean that you are inferior in skills

580
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,280
It's because you can't know yourself and the enemy

581
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,160
If you are competing on horseback

582
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,400
with your riding skills

583
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,480
Xiang Shaolong is not your opponent at all

584
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,880
But you are competing with Xiang Shaolong on the ground

585
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,120
You're simply making a fool of yourself

586
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,680
A competition on the school field is not as good as killing the enemy on the battlefield.

587
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,880
The first thing is to pay attention to fair competition

588
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,680
If so, it will end in fraud

589
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,680
It's a bit overwhelming

590
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,840
Damn it, you can't win with just one word

591
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,440
As a result, the handsome seal fell into Xiang Shaolong's hands.

592
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,160
It ruined the truth

593
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,960
The general really doesn’t understand

594
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,520
The reason for this competition is to fight for the seal of command.

595
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,600
The main reason is to choose someone who is wise and courageous.

596
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,640
The right person to lead the expedition

597
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,440
As for who wins and who loses

598
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,040
Doesn't seem so important

599
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,320
Wang Jian, you...

600
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,320
Prime Minister, please calm down.

601
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,560
Wang Jian, why don't you apologize to the Prime Minister?

602
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,520
Will finally be convicted

603
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,000
Prime Minister

604
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,920
Since the handsome seal is now in the hands of Xiang Shaolong,

605
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,360
It seems we all…

606
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,760
Wang Jian, you have nothing to do here, you go out first

607
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,880
The general will retreat first

608
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,480
I really don’t understand

609
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,560
Why did General Xiang pay so much attention to Wang Jian?

610
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,640
King, you don’t know something

611
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,680
King, can you unify the world in the future?

612
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,280
Wang Jian is actually a very key figure

613
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,080
But Wang Jian is Meng Ao's deputy general

614
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,080
In other words, they are Lu Buwei’s people

615
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,960
Maybe before, but this time he lost to me

616
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,320
I'm afraid Lu Buwei will put him in the cold palace.

617
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,480
If the king can take this opportunity to recruit him

618
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,920
I am sure that Wang Jian will swear allegiance to him in the future.

619
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,120
A defeated general shows no courage

620
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,240
Since Wang Jian was defeated by General Xiang on the school field this time,

621
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,080
This person is only afraid of...

622
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,720
King, honestly

623
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,080
In fact, my victory this time was all due to luck.

624
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,960
If we really face thousands of troops on the battlefield,

625
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,800
I'm afraid I'm not as good as General Wang Jian either.

626
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,000
Your Majesty, what General Xiang said is true

627
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,480
As far as Li Si knows

628
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,040
Wang Jian is a rare military talent

629
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,760
The so-called one goes down and the other goes up

630
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,080
If you can use this person as your own

631
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,600
Relative to Lu Buwei, his power has also been weakened a lot.

632
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,600
You two also make sense.

633
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,640
Your Majesty, General Wang is waiting outside the palace.

634
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,520
Quick pass

635
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,960
Your Majesty, Wang Jian, comes to see you.

636
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,240
Free of charge

637
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,280
Thank you King

638
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,680
Your Majesty, I don’t know what the instructions are for summoning the ministers into the palace.

639
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,480
Wang Jian, because General Xiang tried his best to raise his head

640
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,880
I decided to appoint you as deputy general

641
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,800
Accompany General Xiang to lead the army on the expedition

642
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,120
King

643
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,400
Since Wei Chen is a defeated general under General Xiang,

644
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,760
Dare to ask, what virtue and ability are there?

645
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,520
Are you lucky enough to follow General Xiang on the expedition?

646
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,920
General Wang is too polite

647
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,400
In fact, everyone knows

648
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,240
In addition to being proficient in horse riding and archery, you

649
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,960
The combat experience on the battlefield is also very experienced.

650
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,720
If we can get help from General Wang this time,

651
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,680
Presumably the chances of repelling Zhao Jun will be greatly improved.

652
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,800
General Xiang actually asked the king

653
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,360
Recommend a defeated general

654
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,320
Wang Jian was deeply impressed by his broad mind.

655
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,760
General Wang is too polite

656
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,640
Well, with a talent like General Wang

657
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,640
It is actually the blessing of my great Qin

658
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,440
By the way, General Xiang

659
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,280
I don’t know what your strategy is for facing Zhao Jun this time?

660
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,160
General Wang, what do you think?

661
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,280
Zhao Jun sent Li Mu to lead the army this time

662
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,240
Li Mu has always advocated the main attack

663
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,880
It seems that our army should prepare all defenses this time

664
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,200
Use defense as offense

665
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,280
Your Majesty, I have a plan, but I don’t know if it’s feasible or not.

666
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,760
Does Li Taishi have any clever ideas? You might as well tell him directly

667
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,240
Yes, Your Majesty

668
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,560
The so-called war is never tired of deceit

669
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,720
Wei Chen proposed that General Xiang should lead the leading troops

670
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,560
Rush to Qicheng and help the troops in the city to defend the city.

671
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,320
To contain the main force of Zhao army

672
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,680
Later, General Wang Jian led reinforcements to cover the area.

673
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,440
At the moment when Zhao Jun attacked the city with all his strength,

674
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,040
Implement internal and external cooperation

675
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,840
This will definitely put Zhao Jun to death

676
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,080
Li Taishi really has a good plan

677
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,200
If General Xiang personally leads the troops to defend Qicheng,

678
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,760
Zhao Jun must have thought that our army could only defend but not attack.

679
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,160
With Li Mu’s character

680
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,800
He will definitely use all his strength to attack the city

681
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,680
In this way, his defense will be neglected

682
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,400
If we are caught by surprise at this time and attack from both front and back,

683
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,000
Zhao Jun will definitely be defeated. It is indeed a good plan.

684
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,560
General Xiang, it’s not too late

685
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,640
I order you to leave immediately tomorrow

686
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,040
Lead the army and rush to Qicheng

687
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,320
Yes, Your Majesty

688
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,200
Shaolong, there is a competition on the school field this morning.

689
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,640
In the end, did Lao Ai or Wang Jian get the seal of command?

690
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,960
Lao Ai, he was sick today, so he didn't come

691
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,760
Wouldn’t that be an advantage for Wang Jian?

692
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,920
But it's irrelevant

693
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,280
The most important thing is, Shaolong, you don’t need to lead troops to go to war.

694
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,720
Shaolong, didn’t you promise to take me to Venice?

695
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,120
I've prepared something for this journey

696
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,120
Come here

697
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,200
I prepared this pot of camellia

698
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,400
If the climate, water and soil are suitable,

699
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,640
I will transplant it

700
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,880
I hope to plant it all over Europe

701
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,520
Do you think it is a beautiful thing?

702
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,200
Ah Qing, I'm afraid...

703
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,160
I know what you are afraid of

704
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,840
Are you afraid of this camellia because of the long journey?

705
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,320
Has it already withered before going to Europe?

706
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,040
But it doesn't matter

707
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,760
I prepared a handkerchief made of woven silk

708
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,880
Hope to take it to Europe

709
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,320
Let Europeans see it

710
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,360
Do you think the silk weaving technology of China is good or not?

711
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,520
Okay, but I'm afraid we might not be able to go this time

712
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,680
Why? Could it be...

713
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,320
No, Lao Ai suddenly fell ill.

714
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,240
So the king must ask me to grab this handsome seal

715
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,160
Don't let this handsome seal fall into the hands of Lu Buwei

716
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,920
So you defeated Wang Jian and obtained the handsome seal

717
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,560
Consecrated as a general by the king

718
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,280
We're about to lead our troops on an expedition.

719
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,960
Ah Qing, I don’t want to either

720
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,160
I am also forced to

721
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,960
Why...why is this happening again?

722
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,600
Is this my destiny?

723
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,520
My late husband is like this, Shaolong, you are like this too

724
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,560
Anyway I promise you

725
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,880
I will definitely save my life and come back to see you.

726
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,480
Aqing

727
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,280
Why...why are these sentences exactly the same?

728
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,520
I don’t want you to promise me anything

729
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,880
As long as you promise me not to lead troops on an expedition

730
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,280
Please resign to the king

731
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,440
How then?

732
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,720
No? That’s all my fault. I’m the one making things difficult for you.

733
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,920
Aqing

734
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,280
Qing'er...

735
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,280
I already told him to go away

736
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,160
You shut yourself up

737
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,920
Xiang Shaolong waited from dawn to dusk

738
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,160
Now I can't wait any longer and I'm gone

739
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,640
Although my godfather is proficient in astronomy and geography

740
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,960
But the emotional problem between men and women

741
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,600
Really powerless

742
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,760
I hope you can think about it quietly

743
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,680
It's best before Xiang Shaolong sets off tomorrow morning

744
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,280
you have decided

745
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,400
If not, keep putting it off

746
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,160
I'm afraid it's not good for either of you.

747
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,960
Deputy General…Changping is in an emergency, and the General has an order

748
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,120
Ask the deputy general to prepare everything immediately and set off immediately

749
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,280
Wife, I promise you for my husband, no matter what

750
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,560
I will save my life and come back to see you

751
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:20,960
lady
