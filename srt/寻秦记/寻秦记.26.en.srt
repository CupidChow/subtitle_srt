1
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,840
Why are there only rose petals left?

2
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,160
One of you can help me pick lilacs

3
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,200
Go pick narcissus alone, go ahead

4
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,240
Yes, slave knows. Yes, madam.

5
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,800
Madam, do you want cloves?

6
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,920
Someone is coming

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,120
Don't call for help

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,400
They'll catch you and throw you into a well

9
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,520
Someone is coming

10
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,960
Don't call for help

11
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,200
Laotingwei, what happened?

12
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,720
How could that madman go without any hindrance?

13
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,640
Breaking into the madam's bedroom?

14
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,680
Report back to the prince, the madman is the cook of Dazheng Palace

15
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,040
Because his affair with the maid Ding Xiang was exposed

16
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,560
Lilac committed suicide by throwing herself into a well

17
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,360
So the cook goes crazy

18
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,320
when something goes wrong

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,520
It’s the time when the guards at the east and west gates take over their shifts.

20
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,400
The cook then took advantage of the opportunity and rushed straight into the palace.

21
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,240
If it weren't for the villain who happened to pass by,

22
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,160
I'm afraid something will happen to Madam

23
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,240
How could the guards in the palace be so negligent?

24
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,560
Don't worry

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,320
The lonely king will send more guards to patrol the palace in the future.

26
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,960
The king, the villain thinks

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,520
Even if we add more manpower, it won't help.

28
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
What is the meaning of this statement?

29
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,240
Because the villain has been paying attention

30
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,680
Loopholes in the Palace Guards

31
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,520
Take Dazheng Palace as an example

32
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,400
Divided into two teams of guards from the east and west gates

33
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,640
If something happens to the east gate, the west gate will never provide support.

34
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,360
It's really worrying that the loopholes are so big

35
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,720
Lao Ting Wei was so aware of the palace guards.

36
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,640
From what you see, what improvements should be made?

37
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,880
The villain thinks that the guards in the palace

38
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,520
There should be a commander-in-chief of the Imperial Guard

39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,840
The guards who command the two palaces and four gardens

40
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,120
This approach can coordinate manpower

41
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,480
Also ensure the safety of everyone in the palace

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,480
What Lao Tingwei said is true

43
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,640
There should be a chief of imperial guards in the palace

44
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,480
It's a pity that Taifu Xiang is depressed and has no interest in political affairs.

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,840
Otherwise, Taifu Xiang will assume this position

46
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,400
It will be foolproof

47
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,440
Now I can only find someone else

48
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,640
This fact is urgent

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,240
The Consul-General of the Imperial Guard is located in the palace

50
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,200
There must be a trustworthy person in charge.

51
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,240
The king believes that among the imperial guards

52
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,080
Who is the most loyal and has done the most meritorious deeds?

53
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,160
At the court meeting tomorrow

54
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,520
The lonely king will appoint Lao Tingwei as the commander-in-chief of the Tingwei.

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,960
Thank you for your trust

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,360
King Hui

57
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,760
Prime Minister Lu specially ordered the villain to ask the king for instructions.

58
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,160
Whether the parliament should continue, as ministers are still waiting

59
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,840
Tell Prime Minister Lu that we will continue the government affairs tomorrow

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,320
obey the decree

61
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,600
Your Majesty, state affairs are the most important thing

62
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,520
My concubine is no longer in serious trouble

63
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,520
Please also ask your Majesty to put all political affairs first

64
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,600
Well, the lonely king will come to see you tonight

65
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,400
Laotingwei, protect your wife well.

66
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,760
The villain obeys the decree

67
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,360
Mother, Zheng'er also resigned first.

68
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,080
Madam, the villain is waiting outside.

69
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,800
Ensure Madam's safety

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
you've got what you wanted

71
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,000
How could this lady still be in danger?

72
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Thank you madam for your support

73
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,520
God is also you, ghost is you too

74
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,760
That crazy cook

75
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm afraid you put it in too, right?

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,800
Why did Madam say this?

77
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,400
I just do my part

78
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,680
Do your duty well? Will you keep your integrity?

79
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,360
Villains only treat people they like

80
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,040
Having wrong thoughts

81
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,280
You are so brave

82
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,600
How dare you speak rudely in front of my wife?

83
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,800
The villain just said it sincerely

84
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,240
There are some things you can't say sincerely

85
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,000
Otherwise it will become a bold lie

86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,240
Thank you madam for reminding me, I will definitely remember it

87
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,000
The villain resigns

88
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,480
It’s been a long time since I’ve had a fight with Master.

89
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,840
Really a bit rusty

90
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,000
It's not that you're unfamiliar, it's just that you're lazy

91
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,360
Did you practice Qigong while your master and I were away?

92
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,480
Now the master has washed away the dejection and regained the courage of the day

93
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,440
Prince and Tutor, tea is ready

94
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,080
Actually I've figured it out

95
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Being happy is also a day spent

96
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,200
Even if you are unhappy, you can live a day

97
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,640
Why do you have to keep a straight face all day long?

98
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,120
It's better to be happy

99
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,360
People are not afraid when they see me

100
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,280
I was shocked when I saw myself

101
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,400
It would be best if Master figured it out about the princess.

102
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,360
Zhao Gao, scratch this place for me

103
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,800
A little higher…

104
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,160
It's really impressive, such a big man

105
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,000
You even need someone to scratch your itch

106
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,200
Okay…

107
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,400
Master, you were in a state of mourning before

108
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,560
Zheng'er would not dare to invite any banquets in the palace.

109
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,280
Master is now calm again

110
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,440
Tomorrow, my father will host a banquet to entertain everyone from Yin and Yang.

111
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Mr. Zou Yan, and the talented girl Qin Qing

112
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,520
I hope Master can come by then

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,120
The lonely king toasts you two

114
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,200
Thank you King

115
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,640
Thank you King

116
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,720
Although my wife has little talent and little knowledge,

117
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,320
I have also heard Mr. Zou’s “Five Virtues from the beginning”

118
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,640
It's a novelty, but it's a pity that it's not very clear.

119
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,240
Please give me some advice. I dare not

120
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,680
I think everything in the world

121
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,160
They are all mixed with the five qi of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.

122
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,000
These are the five virtues

123
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,840
From the changing seasons of nature to the change of dynasties

124
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,840
All are subject to the turn of the five virtues and fortunes

125
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,800
Take turns to dominate with the five virtues?

126
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,120
May I ask, sir, what is the general trend of the world today?

127
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,240
What kind of luck is it in?

128
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,480
The Zhou family belongs to fire, so its clothing system tends to be red.

129
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,280
Later, they moved eastward, and the power of the Zhou Dynasty gradually weakened.

130
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,640
Melt gold with fire, and if metal melts, water will be born

131
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,320
Therefore, now it is Shui De's turn

132
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,480
The place of black water is the land of Qin

133
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,640
Infer from this

134
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,400
Should the Qin State rise from Zhou Dynasty and unify the six kingdoms?

135
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,240
That's exactly it

136
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
good…

137
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,360
But after water virtue comes wood virtue

138
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,600
Will Qin’s National Games come to an end?

139
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,440
Mr. Zou means

140
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,880
After Qin unified the six kingdoms,

141
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,360
There will be a new environment

142
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,000
Of course it is no longer Shuide.

143
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,840
But will have another better luck

144
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,880
Mr. Zou, right?

145
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,280
This is exactly what Taifu Xiang said

146
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,320
Xiang Taifu

147
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,560
Since we are destined to meet each other in Qin State,

148
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,960
Why not go to the humble house to catch up on old times?

149
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,880
OK

150
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,160
You mean that Wang Zizheng we just met?

151
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Yes, he is not only a prince

152
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,440
He will become the prince in the future, and then the king of Qin

153
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,120
Then he unified the six countries

154
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,160
The meeting of intellectuals discussing politics in the state of Wei

155
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,600
When I first met you

156
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,440
You have categorically said that Qin will definitely unify the six countries.

157
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,680
Why are you so sure?

158
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,360
I'm also guessing, don't talk about this.

159
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,200
By the way, Miss Qin

160
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,720
did you know

161
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,680
Why do I really want to ask you to teach Wang Zizheng how to read?

162
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,480
Why?

163
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,160
Because the future government of Qin will be very heavy on tax collection.

164
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,280
In short, the life of civilians is not good

165
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,840
I'm worried that Wang Zizheng will become a tyrant in the future

166
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,600
That’s why I hope you can teach him to read

167
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,640
You want me to use Confucianism, Mohism and Taoism to influence him

168
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,320
Lest he favor Legalism?

169
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,080
Yes

170
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,120
Because I saw that Miss Qin is good at chess, calligraphy and painting

171
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,080
Erudite and talented

172
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
If you are willing to teach him

173
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,520
He will definitely become a good king in the future

174
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,040
OK, I decided to teach Wang Zizheng

175
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,600
Then on behalf of Wang Zizheng, I would like to thank Miss Qin.

176
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
You also have great thoughts for Wang Zizheng

177
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,600
We are two masters and apprentices

178
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,200
Xiang Taifu

179
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,800
You seem to know the situation in various countries very well

180
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,160
And you are indeed brilliant in predicting the future.

181
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,440
I really benefited a lot from my conversation with you.

182
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,880
Actually, I just said it casually.

183
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,360
This is our country dialect

184
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,040
You said you have no way out as a teacher

185
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,120
So how do you know such profound knowledge?

186
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,920
That's because I did a lot of social work before

187
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,560
Therefore, rich experience in social work

188
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,120
So I know a lot of knowledge

189
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,960
Could it be that you know the magic of supernatural powers?

190
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,120
The art of supernatural power? I don’t understand the art of supernatural power

191
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,040
But I know some weird arts.

192
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,640
The night is as cold as water tonight, I need to go in and put on some thick clothes

193
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,760
You two talk slowly and in detail

194
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,120
Firefly

195
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,160
Yes, so beautiful

196
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,320
Remember the fireflies in Zhao country

197
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,640
More artistic than tonight

198
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,360
Yes, they are also fireflies

199
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,280
But in two different places

200
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,960
One is in the state of Qin and the other is in the state of Zhao.

201
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,280
It's like people from two different worlds

202
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,320
What is the meaning of this statement?

203
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
You really look like my old girlfriend

204
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
girlfriend?

205
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,960
when i first saw you

206
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,000
I already have a very cordial feeling

207
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
It's like we've known each other for a long time

208
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,680
you to me

209
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,880
Just because I look exactly like your crush

210
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,320
It's because I can't go back to my hometown

211
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,240
But I miss her very much and want to see her

212
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,800
So when I first saw you

213
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,160
I thought you were...

214
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,640
I know this is wrong

215
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,680
But for some reason when I saw you, I...

216
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,840
I seem to want to put away the unhappy things in my heart

217
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,320
tell you everything

218
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,760
It seems like there are many things I want to tell you

219
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,440
Qin Qing understands very well, so you don’t have to worry about it.

220
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,800
Qinqing was very honored to know Taifu Xiang

221
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,200
It's getting late, I have to leave

222
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,800
Please forgive Qinqing for not sending it.

223
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,400
King Zhaoxiang adopted the policy of making friends with distant people and attacking those close to home.

224
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,600
First cannibalize Han and Wei, then weaken Yan and Qi

225
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,480
Now the only powerful enemy left is Zhao Chu

226
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Han and Wei were close to Qin

227
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,280
The two great powers Qin and Chu faced each other from afar

228
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,760
And Zhao is in the narrow gap

229
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,840
If Qin wants to advance eastward, he must first remove Zhao

230
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,840
The seven kingdoms are so chaotic

231
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,920
I'm already a little dizzy just remembering place names.

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,080
A prince wants to rule a country

233
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,280
You must first understand the environment of the country you are in

234
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,560
It is even more important to understand the situation in the surrounding countries

235
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,480
Only when you know yourself and the enemy can you stand firm

236
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,680
Unexpectedly, Miss Qin

237
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,640
More chatty and nagging than Li Si

238
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,560
It's just your first day of class

239
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,360
It's already so powerful that it pours out

240
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,720
If you bear the name of Taifu

241
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,320
I'm afraid I won't sleep

242
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,280
It’s also difficult to load what you teach every day

243
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,120
prince

244
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,040
You brat, why are you so sleepless?

245
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,880
What are you talking about? I’m teaching you how to read.

246
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,240
You study like everyone else

247
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,200
People are sitting in the room

248
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,080
But you moved a table and sat on the bridge to read

249
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,080
Miss Qin, are you working hard?

250
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,760
No hard work, children can be taught

251
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,720
The piano girl teaches you the piano

252
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,280
Told a lot about geography and history

253
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
But I never understood it

254
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,440
Still feeling a little tired

255
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,560
Maybe I'm talking too fast and boringly

256
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,480
But frankly speaking, the subject of history

257
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,400
When I was reading, I felt like vomiting when I heard it.

258
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,200
It's of no use, I don't know what to do with it?

259
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,880
No, when I was studying

260
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,200
There are many teaching methods

261
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,680
Is there any mother tongue teaching…

262
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,640
You can try activity teaching

263
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,280
Activity teaching?

264
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,520
On the eve of the Battle of Changping

265
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,520
Old General Wang Hao captured the Shangdang Headquarters in South Korea

266
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,600
The upper party headquarters is here?

267
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,280
good

268
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,640
After the city fell, the Koreans fled to Changping on the border of Zhao State.

269
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,240
A fierce battle ensued between the Qin army and the Zhao army.

270
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,800
The location of Changping is probably right here.

271
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,040
The Qin State surrounded the Zhao army in Changping and fought fiercely for forty-five days.

272
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,520
Zhao Jun suffered 450,000 casualties

273
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,920
Qin also suffered numerous casualties

274
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,960
It was the most brutal war among the Seven Kingdoms

275
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Why are you so sad?

276
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,600
Did your relatives die tragically in this battle?

277
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,040
In fact, my late husband was the deputy general of Qin State.

278
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,680
Was ordered to go to war on the day of marriage

279
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,280
Before the ceremony of husband and wife

280
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,880
Already died on the battlefield

281
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,040
That's it. No wonder your father calls you a widow.

282
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,440
In this way

283
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,160
Doesn’t it mean that Miss Qin is not married even if she is married?

284
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,360
So I have always opposed countries attacking each other.

285
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,640
I hope the war can subside soon

286
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,680
If you can do it without fighting

287
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,160
It would be best if we could unify the six countries.

288
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,640
It's a pity that Qin Qing also knows that this is absolutely impossible

289
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,200
The seven kingdoms attacked and annexed each other without hesitation.

290
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,920
to complete the great cause of unification

291
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,000
In the end, it is the common people who suffer.

292
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,360
But if you don’t annex people, they will invade

293
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,920
The Seven Kingdoms all belong to the Zhou Dynasty

294
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,120
What is the benefit of attacking each other?

295
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,760
In fact, the biggest disaster is the Huns in the north

296
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,600
Once they cross the border

297
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,240
They will plunder and kill innocent people at will.

298
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,040
So Qin, Yan and Zhao both built the Great Wall to protect against the Xiongnu

299
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,040
It's a pity that there is a gap in the Loop area

300
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,600
It’s a dangerous place

301
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,840
It is a serious problem for Qin State

302
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,520
If there is a chance to unify the six countries in the future,

303
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,720
Build the Great Wall in this gap

304
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Then we can prevent the invasion of the Huns

305
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,280
Protecting the homeland is the duty of the monarch

306
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,800
It's best if you have such lofty ideals

307
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,200
What Miss Qin taught me today will definitely be remembered by Zheng'er.

308
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,200
You should thank Taifu Xiang very much

309
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,960
It was he who taught me how to use this activity to teach

310
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,720
Although your father has not named you Taifu,

311
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,520
But Zheng'er has decided to call you Taifu

312
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,960
Ask your father for advice

313
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,560
What was Qin's foreign policy like when King Hui was on the throne?

314
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,680
It’s Zhang Yi’s policy of liaison and horizontal cooperation.

315
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,880
King Zhaoxiang changed his strategy during his reign

316
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,800
How do earnings change?

317
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,080
It is a strategy of distant friendship and close attack.

318
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,440
Make friends with Zhao Chu and isolate Han and Wei

319
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,640
As a result, Qin successfully annexed most of the land of Han and Wei

320
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,080
Good answer

321
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,920
Okay, but history cannot be memorized by rote

322
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Add your own opinions

323
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
What do you think about the Battle of Changping?

324
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,760
Zhao Jun was defeated. Where was the defeat?

325
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,480
Defeated by…

326
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,080
Yi Shuai was defeated in front of the Zhao Guo formation.

327
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,880
Listen to Qin's counterintuitive plan

328
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,840
Replace Lian Po with Zhao Kuo in the battle

329
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,480
If you were King Zhao and heard rumors about Lian Po

330
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,000
what will you do?

331
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,720
I will send people to monitor secretly in case something changes

332
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Waiting to repel the enemy, the situation has been decided

333
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,800
It's not too late to capture him and bring him back for interrogation.

334
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,080
Good answer

335
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,080
Your Majesty, Wang Zizheng is not only smart but also very smart.

336
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,160
A more far-reaching strategy

337
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,160
He is truly the king’s talent

338
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,520
The most rare thing is to be filial to your parents

339
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,720
Zheng'er is both resourceful and brave.

340
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,280
It's better than Cheng Xi, who is indecisive and has no opinion.

341
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,360
Decide on the crown prince as soon as possible, and the lonely king will be happy and at ease

342
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,680
The king is going to announce a big event today

343
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,080
I have tested two princes

344
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,440
and after careful consideration over the past few days,

345
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,080
Decided to make Wang Zizheng the crown prince

346
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,840
Father, wait a minute

347
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,200
Cheng Xi, the lonely king knows that you have not been appointed as the crown prince.

348
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,040
I'm a little disappointed, but...

349
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,600
In terms of talent, you are indeed inferior to Zheng'er

350
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,400
Father, my son is not doing this for his own reputation and benefit.

351
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,720
and oppose this

352
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,920
It’s for the reputation of the royal family surnamed Ying

353
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,080
It has been spread among the people

354
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,920
It is said that the king's brother Ying Zheng was not born from his father.

355
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,440
But the illegitimate son of a big businessman

356
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,760
It's nonsense

357
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,200
Prince Cheng, there is no basis for it, why do you say this?

358
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,640
Prime Minister Lu, since you have a clear conscience

359
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,160
Why should you be a thief with a guilty conscience?

360
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,720
you…

361
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,960
Cheng Xi, how can you rely on the rumors in the market?

362
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,720
Are you questioning your brother Wang's identity in court?

363
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,840
King, folk rumors

364
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,360
It may come out of nowhere, but it may not be without reason

365
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,600
The songs sung by the common people have specific meanings.

366
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
The king must not be careless

367
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,200
What kind of songs are the people singing?

368
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,000
Your Majesty, please listen. There is a wild flower on the roadside.

369
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,680
Act as a luxury and turn into a golden branch

370
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,080
Seven months pregnant

371
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,920
Two businessmen save mother and son

372
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,800
Why spend all your money and effort?

373
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,480
How can a tiger father and a dog son be selfless?

374
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,280
What does this sentence mean?

375
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,440
first two sentences

376
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,840
A wild flower on the roadside serves as a luxurious and golden branch

377
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,800
Refers to the luxurious lady Zhu Ji

378
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,320
And the pregnancy in July is pregnant with a fetus

379
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,840
It refers to the fact that Zhu Ji gave birth to Prince Zheng in the seventh month of her pregnancy.

380
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,560
Something fishy

381
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,120
As for the two merchants saving the mother and son?

382
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,400
The combination of two words is the word "LV"

383
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,840
The last two sentences

384
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,360
Why do you spend so much money and effort? How can a tiger father and a dog son be selfless?

385
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,000
It refers to a businessman named Lu who spent all his money

386
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,520
Rescued his wife and Wang Zizheng from Zhao Kingdom

387
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,680
The reason is that he and Wang Zizheng

388
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,520
There is an ulterior relationship between father and son

389
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,960
Yang Quanjun

390
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,520
You know so well the meaning behind the insinuations.

391
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,480
Could it be that you are the one who started the rumors?

392
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,680
I'm just explaining it straightforwardly.

393
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,960
King Mingcha

394
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,280
Those who maliciously create rumors should be killed

395
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,760
These songs are so ridiculous

396
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,440
Although Mrs. Huagui gave birth to Zheng’s son prematurely,

397
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,160
But this is not surprising

398
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,000
How could I, the king, listen to the rumors?

399
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,560
Father, the song is widely spread

400
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,760
If something happens for no reason

401
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,920
How can you sing and be heard in every street?

402
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,400
For the reputation of the royal family

403
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,640
I sincerely ask my father to verify the prince’s government.

404
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,080
Whether he is his father’s biological son or not is another decision to make.

405
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,720
How to prove blood relationship?

406
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,800
Your Majesty, the method of blood test has been passed down among the people since ancient times.

407
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,320
As long as the king's precious blood

408
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,480
And the precious blood of Wang Zizheng drips out

409
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,000
Two bloods can be blended into one

410
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,240
It means that they are biologically related to each other.

411
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,800
Vice versa

412
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,240
Absolutely ridiculous

413
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
Blood test is just a folklore

414
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
no one has ever seen

415
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,760
King

416
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,520
Folklore is unreliable, how can it be accurate?

417
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,600
The blood of kings and princes is so precious

418
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,800
How can it be dropped casually?

419
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,520
Your Majesty, the method of blood test

420
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,600
It has been circulated for a long time, and it is said with certainty

421
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,360
In order to maintain the true origin of the royal family, I sincerely request you to give it a try

422
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,120
Your Majesty, what Mr. Deer said makes sense.

423
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,200
Your Majesty, why don't you give it a try?

424
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,320
The child is indeed the father’s biological child

425
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,280
How can we use the method of legend to verify such a child's play?

426
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,800
You insist on not verifying

427
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,520
I think you must be feeling guilty

428
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,880
If you can't be a prince, then you will spread rumors and cause trouble.

429
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,880
I ask you what is your intention?

430
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,320
I said you are simply a bastard

431
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,280
How dare you be so rude to the prince?

432
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,680
He has not even determined the identity of the prince.

433
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,160
Why is he a prince?

434
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,280
Yang Quanjun, you have gone too far.

435
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,640
Meng Ao, do you want to use force in court?

436
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Do you dare?

437
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,920
What kind of behavior is it for the noble families to make noise in court?

438
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,560
General Wang, you are the most pertinent

439
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,960
What do you think?

440
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,320
Your Majesty, since the method of blood test has been passed down since ancient times,

441
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,520
Your Majesty, why don't you give it a try to set your sights straight?

442
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,000
The King must consider carefully

443
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,640
The matter of establishing a prince will be discussed later.

444
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,320
father

445
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,960
What's the matter?

446
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,520
The daughter designed a new dress for her father

447
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,560
Look

448
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,320
Dad, wear it and let your daughter see it

449
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
Ronger

450
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,200
You will only do these boring crafts all day long

451
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,000
Do you know that Dad is worried about many things?

452
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,960
It’s not like you who have enough to eat and have nothing to do all day long

453
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,360
You never worry about dad

454
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,960
The father was angry in the palace, so he took it out on his daughter

455
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,400
The daughter is not a man and cannot inherit her father’s business.

456
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,360
He even lacks the wisdom and strategy to plan for his father.

457
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,840
My daughter only likes to make clothes

458
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,400
I just hope dad can wear it

459
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,280
You will be very happy if your daughter sews clothes for you.

460
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,000
Dad is not taking it out on you

461
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,280
Dad also wants to do what he likes

462
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,400
But things in the world are often not just what you like.

463
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,680
There are many treacherous villains

464
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,600
They will be jealous of you and attack you

465
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,280
Trying every possible means to murder you

466
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,920
Dad can have the status he has today

467
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Not something that comes easily

468
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,320
Life is short, time is short

469
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,920
What happened?

470
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,240
Dad only cares about his reputation and power

471
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,880
Welcome everyone with a smile as soon as you come to court

472
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,800
Surrounded by princes and nobles

473
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,200
Will you be happy?

474
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,920
My daughter won’t tell you anymore

475
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,480
Why give the slave family to a foreigner?

476
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,040
So-called: Siloto Arbor

477
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,720
A foreigner is very likely to become the prince of Qin

478
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,440
if you follow him

479
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,560
You can also enjoy all the glory and wealth in the future

480
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,120
The slave family doesn’t want any glory or wealth.

481
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,440
The slave family just wants to be with Uncle Lu

482
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,240
The slave family doesn’t want to leave you, besides…

483
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,600
The slave family already has your flesh and blood

484
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,400
really?

485
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,560
The slave family is about to tell you

486
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,320
Who knew you wanted to give your slave family to a stranger?

487
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,600
This is even better, you can use it to your advantage

488
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,320
One day you become the wife of a foreigner

489
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,520
You treat our flesh and blood as his.

490
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,520
How can this be so? You don't care about your flesh and blood?

491
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,160
Just because I care about my flesh and blood

492
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,280
So I count on you and my biological flesh and blood

493
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,760
Enjoy honor in the future

494
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,680
lady

495
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,000
Wang Zizheng asks for an audience

496
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,840
please quickly

497
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,840
stand down

498
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,600
Mom, do you really want your father to take a blood test?

499
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,360
Zheng'er, you don't have to panic

500
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,960
No one knows better than mother whose son you are

501
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,160
Mom can tell you

502
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,320
You are indeed the king's biological son

503
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,120
But Cheng Xi, Yang Quanjun and others

504
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,480
They seem to suspect that Zheng'er is the illegitimate son of Prime Minister Lu

505
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,680
Zheng'er, you have grown up

506
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,880
Mom doesn’t want to hide it from you either

507
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,360
Mother before following the king

508
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,600
She is indeed Lu Buwei’s singer

509
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,560
I also had a relationship with him

510
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,600
Lu Buwei gave his mother to a stranger as his wife

511
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,760
On the night of farewell, my mother told him that she had his flesh and blood

512
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,440
My mother was lying at that time

513
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,480
I thought he would keep his mother by his side for the love of flesh and blood.

514
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Who would have thought that in order to climb to power, he would not care about family ties?

515
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,000
I want my mother to treat the child in her belly as a stranger.

516
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,760
I see

517
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,280
Didn’t Prime Minister Lu always think that

518
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,240
Is Zheng'er his biological flesh and blood?

519
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,680
Not bad, but my mother knows very well

520
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,920
She became pregnant only after she and the king were actually married.

521
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,240
And it just so happens

522
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,000
You are rushing to give birth when you are less than ten months pregnant

523
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,360
So that outsiders have an excuse to slander us, mother and son.

524
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,640
It turns out that the whole thing is like this

525
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,640
So Zheng'er, you don't have to be afraid of blood tests.

526
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,600
You are indeed the king's biological son

527
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,240
I think about the father-son relationship between the king and Prince Chengyu

528
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,440
Everyone should have no objections, right?

529
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,760
Of course this

530
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,960
Since there is no objection

531
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,280
Let me first ask the king and Prince Chengyu to drop their blood for a marriage test.

532
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,080
If their blood could dissolve together

533
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,600
This means that the blood test is reliable.

534
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,680
Father, what Taifu Xiang said is true

535
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,040
The child and his father might as well give a demonstration first

536
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,120
good

537
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,800
Everyone has seen it

538
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,560
Their blood can dissolve together

539
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,360
Because they are father and son, there is no rejection.

540
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,720
Okay, now it’s time to go to Wang Zizheng and the King

541
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,640
Everyone has seen these two experiments

542
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,440
It is enough to prove that both princes are the sons of the king.

543
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,200
But I still need to do one more experiment

544
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,080
That's proof

545
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,800
Wang Zizheng is not Lu Xiangcheng’s son at all.

546
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,480
For the sake of accuracy, I will use another bamboo

547
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,760
Because I don’t want the blood of the king and Prime Minister Lu

548
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,680
Mixed together, biasing the results

549
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,160
everyone has seen it

550
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,200
Their blood is mutually exclusive

551
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,880
And there were a lot of particles

552
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,680
This can be proved

553
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,520
Zheng'er and Prime Minister Lu have nothing to do with each other at all.

554
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,200
Let's put an end to the rumors

555
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,040
Zheng'er

556
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,120
daughter

557
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,440
How are you?

558
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,280
It's okay, I was just too nervous just now

559
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,840
You retreat first

560
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,200
The slave obeys the order

561
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,640
This time finally

562
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,320
This left Cheng Xi, Yang Quanjun and others speechless.

563
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,280
Things finally come to an end

564
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,800
Now all that remains is how to explain to Lu Buwei

565
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,960
It turns out that this bastard is not mine at all.

566
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,480
You've been lying to me all this time

567
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,720
Today is the day you and this scoundrel die.

568
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,400
stop

569
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,240
The blood test is just a show

570
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,400
You must not kill them

571
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,120
A nest of snakes and rats, what trick do you want to play?

572
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,240
I'm not doing any tricks, I tell you.

573
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,120
Even if the king has no blood relationship with him

574
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,000
I can also dissolve their blood together

575
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,640
You saw it

576
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,800
The blood of the two of you can dissolve together.

577
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,080
Why couldn't we get along with each other in the palace just now?

578
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,280
The answer lies on this bamboo

579
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,520
Why is this so?

580
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,200
Because I added acetic acid powder to this bamboo

581
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,680
When blood encounters acetic acid powder, it coagulates

582
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,160
So it can't be mixed together at all

583
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,040
If you don’t believe it, you can smell it

584
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,600
Sure enough, it has the sour smell of vinegar

585
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,920
So just now in the main hall

586
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,840
You don't have to pay any attention to the blood test.

587
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,120
If you really want to know if Zheng'er is your son

588
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,560
You'd better ask Madam

589
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,880
Prime Minister and Taifu Xiang also wanted to quell the rumors.

590
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,120
Only then did we come up with this solution for our mother and son.

591
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,320
Buwei, Zheng'er is indeed your child and mine.

592
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,440
You should remember that before I follow the king

593
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,680
I told you, I have your flesh and blood

594
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,440
As a mother, how could I not know who the child belongs to?

595
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,480
In this way

596
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,880
Doesn’t Taifu Xiang know about my relationship with Zheng’er?

597
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,880
What are you doing?

598
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,480
Zheng'er, it's a big deal

599
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,920
What if this gets leaked out?

600
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Our family of three will be destroyed.

601
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,280
So this matter must not be known to outsiders.

602
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,280
Master is not an outsider, you cannot kill him

603
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,000
Zheng'er, do you dare to disobey dad?

604
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,280
If Prime Minister Lu must repay kindness with hatred,

605
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,720
Then there's nothing I can do

606
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,400
But I don't think you don't remember

607
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,160
I rescued Zheng'er

608
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,240
And I am Zheng'er's master

609
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,560
How I taught him, you saw with your own eyes

610
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,360
If I want to betray you

611
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,160
No need to wait until today

612
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,880
Buwei, Taifu Xiang is a trustworthy person

613
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,840
He has always been protective of Zheng'er

614
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,760
Those who can support our mother and son in the court

615
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,280
Just you and him

616
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,720
Okay, I won't kill him

617
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,760
It’s just Mr. Xiang’s trick of blood test.

618
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,760
You planned it

619
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,600
If you reveal this secret

620
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,760
Just be careful if your head falls to the ground

621
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,640
Don't worry, Prime Minister Lu

622
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,400
I think you also know

623
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,800
I'm as nervous as you Zheng'er

624
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,400
I will never tell anyone about this matter

625
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,320
That would be best

626
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,640
An extraordinary country must treat extraordinary people

627
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,720
The succession of sages to the throne is not based on elders and younger ones.

628
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,920
Talent and virtue must come first

629
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,440
The son Yingzheng was filial, loyal, intelligent, brave and resourceful.

630
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,480
I can trust the future to succeed the king.

631
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:34,600
His edict establishes Ying Zheng as the crown prince.

632
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,400
The Crown Prince has decided that there will be no objections in the future.

633
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,480
The lonely king wants to confer three heroes today

634
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,200
It is said that Taifu Xiang, Miss Qinqing and Li Si

635
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,000
See the king...

636
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,040
Thanks to the three teachers who taught Prince Ying Zheng

637
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,280
The lonely king wants to be promoted to three places

638
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,240
Your Majesty, Wang Zizheng can be appointed as the crown prince.

639
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,360
I'm already very happy

640
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,960
Besides, it’s my job to teach Wang Zizheng how to read.

641
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,400
No canonization required

642
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,280
This is the first time I have seen the lonely king

643
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,480
There are people who are unwilling to be promoted

644
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,840
Well, I won’t force you

645
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,520
Thank you, Your Majesty

646
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,320
Miss Qin, you are a woman

647
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,760
The lonely king will make an exception and make you the Taifu

648
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,320
Thank you King for your grace

649
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,040
Li Si

650
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,320
Prince Yingzheng has repeatedly recommended you to the lonely king.

651
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,760
Say you have read enough poems and books

652
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,880
Unique political commentary, full of economic knowledge

653
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,160
The lonely king promotes you to censor

654
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,480
Thank you King for your grace

655
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,400
Big brother, second brother

656
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,680
Are you possessed by a ghost?

657
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,040
Doesn't this dress look good?

658
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,200
Looks good if you wear this dress out

659
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,680
If someone wants to kill you, he will shoot you from a distance.

660
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,160
I think you are really nondescript

661
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,120
Don't say he's neither fish nor fowl.

662
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,840
Be more open-minded

663
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,400
He is called an avant-garde

664
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,040
Brother really knows his stuff

665
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,800
Brother, you are really my confidant

666
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,400
Fuck that girl who gave you the clothes.

667
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,000
Do you think of me as a confidant?

668
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,880
I only know myself

669
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,760
Brother, what are you whittling?

670
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,240
Don't ask for help

671
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,640
Not asking for help? What is it?

672
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,240
Won’t you know when it’s done?

673
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,840
That's right, brother

674
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,840
Ever since Ying Zheng ascended the throne and became the crown prince,

675
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,280
You seem to be relaxed

676
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,360
Of course

677
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
After he ascends the throne, I can return to the countryside.

678
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,320
How long is it until the coronation ceremony?

679
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,720
Soon

680
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,840
You two, don't be so grim.

681
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,920
I'll help you find an official position before I leave.

682
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,480
Then you two will have enough food and clothing.

683
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,520
You know I have never wanted to be an official

684
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,960
That's not true, if you have to do it

685
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,760
It doesn't hurt to do it, brother

686
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,920
You are pursuing Miss Lu

687
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,600
She is the prime minister’s daughter

688
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,760
You want to be a good match, right?

689
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,760
This is also human nature

690
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,800
But I don’t think you look like an official.

691
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,760
you should be a model

692
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,120
What does "touch" mean?

693
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,360
Even if I tell you, you won’t understand

694
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,080
In other words, you... picked it up

695
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,800
You found Miss Lu because you picked it up

696
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:29,560
Of course, I would rather be a "toucher" than an official

697
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,720
father

698
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,600
Ronger, come, come here

699
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,920
I played chess with my dad before he went to court.

700
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,840
Okay, but I want you to promise me one thing first.

701
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,240
Did you see any precious jewelry?

702
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,840
Do you want dad to buy it for you?

703
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,240
I want to open a clothing store

704
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,960
Specializing in selling clothes designed by me

705
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,320
Do you agree? Dad

706
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,680
A lady from a wealthy family goes out to sell clothes.

707
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,840
What's wrong? You used to be a businessman.

708
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,760
Opening a clothing store is also a kind of business

709
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,480
It's not something disgraceful

710
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,400
No, you are the prime minister's daughter

711
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,600
How can you hang out with the people in the market?

712
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,760
Become a lowly tailor?

713
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,280
I am not a tailor, I design clothes

714
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,080
Dad, you always say that I am not good at learning.

715
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,560
Now I have learned a trade and want to share it with others

716
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,840
You don't let me use my talents

717
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,120
That's right... It's okay if your father appreciates your talent.

718
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,600
I know you are just perfunctory with me

719
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,960
You don’t appreciate it from the bottom of your heart at all

720
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,920
It's time for dad to go to court

721
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,680
Let’s talk about this later

722
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,080
father…

723
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,720
It's almost done, give it a try

724
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,400
Is that okay?

725
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,400
fine

726
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,040
take it back

727
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,000
Brother, why don't you give it to me?

728
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,360
Don't be delusional

729
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Be careful not to break it

730
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,960
You have to believe in my sword skills

731
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,560
Hurry up and draw a few more paper patterns

732
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,320
I'll help you carve it later.

733
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,720
Brother Jing, how did you print it?

734
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,560
It's actually very simple

735
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,280
You just need to take this seal

736
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,240
Put it on top of different dyes

737
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,360
Then…

738
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,160
Isn’t that enough? Yes

739
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,640
If you don't like it, you can put your hand down

740
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,320
Then print it

741
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,160
So there are two palm prints, right?

742
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:21,960
yes

743
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,480
Do you think it looks good?

744
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,080
No, it's like being slapped twice on the chest

745
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,880
no

746
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,320
Quite pretty

747
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,000
Teach him to dye fabric and use it to chase girls

748
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,520
And take advantage of others

749
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,720
But they also match well.

750
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,040
Isn’t this great? In the future, men can farm and women can weave.

751
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,000
master

752
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,760
Xiang Taifu

753
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,920
Li Si has not yet thanked you for your kindness that day.

754
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,800
Don't say that

755
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,280
You will be able to cover the sky with one hand in the future

756
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,360
Almost as great as being an outstanding young man

757
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,360
I hope Chengxiang Taifu will give you your words

758
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,080
Taifu Xiang has something important to discuss with the prince

759
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,320
Li Si can’t be disturbed, so he will leave first.

760
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,720
OK please

761
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,120
Zhao Gao, go prepare hot tea and cakes for Master

762
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,560
obey

763
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,960
Master, today you have to teach Zheng'er

764
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,920
Nunchaku or kickboxing?

765
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,880
Before I teach you

766
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,800
I want to give you something first

767
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,440
This is it

768
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,520
This thing has a small palm

769
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,920
What exactly is it?

770
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,880
It's not a toy, this thing is called not asking for help.

771
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,200
Not asking for help?

772
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,400
Do you know how to use it?

773
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,520
That's when you get itchy back

774
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,560
No one is around you

775
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,600
You can scratch yourself

776
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,360
interesting…

777
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,720
why master

778
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,080
Meet so many weird and weird things

779
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,520
Don't worry about how we met me

780
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,560
I just want you to know not to ask for help

781
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,920
What do these three words mean?

782
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,400
Do you know what it means?

783
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,680
Not asking for help means

784
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,640
Don’t leave everything to others, rely on yourself

785
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,200
Do you know that you rely on others for everything?

786
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,800
You can never learn anything

787
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,280
Besides, your master and I have to leave one day.
