1
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,360
The doctor tells you to rest more and not to walk

2
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
Are you still coming out?

3
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,120
I lie down every day until I get rusty

4
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,520
Please let me come out for a walk

5
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,000
What is rust?

6
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,600
Did you know that if you lie still all day?

7
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,680
Without blood circulation, it is not helpful for the recovery of the feet.

8
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,520
Come out and walk around, in our time

9
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,240
There is a way to express

10
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,120
It's called physical therapy

11
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,240
Physical therapy? Yes

12
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,760
careful

13
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,440
Why is this bracket so short?

14
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,160
Lend me a shoulder to lean on

15
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,400
You stand better

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,200
No...it hurts...

17
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,760
Come and sit over there

18
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:39,400
It's terrible...please, give it a few blows, give it a blow

19
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,160
搥?

20
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,160
Whatever you want, pinch, whatever

21
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,240
In my time, this was called a bruise.

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,320
Come on... hurry up

23
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm cramping, hurry up

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,760
It's just a four-legged snake, what's there to be afraid of?

25
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,520
Come and say hello to your sister

26
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,560
Brother Lian?

27
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,760
Fang'er

28
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,800
Your elder brother is here too

29
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,920
Brother, you are so awesome, you can walk without making any sound

30
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,240
My walking is not silent

31
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,320
It's just that you didn't hear it

32
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,120
Brother Xiang’s foot healed so quickly

33
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,840
It's really gratifying

34
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,960
You still couldn't stand firm just now

35
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,880
全都靠你, 幸好你有空就帮我搥搥

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,280
Just squeeze it for me when you have time, that's why I feel better so quickly

37
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,840
Thank you for your four-legged snake.

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,400
It's really strange, why did Brother Lian arrive?

39
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,280
Will this four-legged snake fall down?

40
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,760
Could it be that you two brothers have a spiritual connection?

41
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,440
So it jumped down and said hello to me first

42
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,240
I said no, I thought it was this four-legged snake

43
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,840
I can't stand it, Brother Xiang, you're cheating me to get a blessing

44
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,560
So I ran out

45
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,760
Brother, you are really awesome

46
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,000
He actually understands the four-legged snake’s mentality so well

47
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,480
You can really publish a book

48
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,000
Fang'er, you haven't practiced sword practice for many days

49
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,240
You'd better go over there and practice sword practice.

50
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,200
Dad said that as a daughter, you should not use swords or swords.

51
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,120
Yes, what kind of swordsmanship does the girl practice?

52
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,600
When I have nothing to do, I just embroider and cook soup at home.

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,320
Wouldn’t it be enough to stir-fry vegetables and paint landscapes?

54
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
Weren't you making soup just now?

55
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,320
You boiled it for me to drink

56
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,840
You put so much thought into making soup

57
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,200
It would be bad if it dries out

58
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,800
Come back quickly and take a look

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,640
Brother Lian, bid farewell

60
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,360
Say goodbye to him, goodbye

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,280
Mr. Hou, the secret letter you sent ten days ago

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,840
It's already in your hands

63
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,480
The person who sent the secret letter has also returned to Chu State

64
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,240
He said that your Majesty had no instructions this time

65
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,520
By the way, what’s going on in Wujiapu?

66
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,440
No, but Xiang Shaolong’s injury has recovered

67
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,360
Xiang Shaolong's injury recovered so quickly?

68
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,480
He was just committing fraud before.

69
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,560
I always think this person is very cunning

70
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,080
The assassin who escaped from the Proton Mansion

71
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,520
I believe he is one of them

72
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,880
I also know that this person must not be taken lightly

73
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,160
Lord Marquis, in order to avoid long nights and many dreams

74
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,760
Just let me kill him

75
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,960
I don’t want to kill him yet

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,120
The robbery of the hostage house was planned so carefully

77
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,280
We set up a dragnet, but he escaped.

78
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,840
It is enough to prove that this person is quite extraordinary

79
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,000
has its own merits

80
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,960
If he is the one who rescued Ying Zheng and Zhu Ji

81
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,600
Then it's definitely not my species

82
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,200
Everything is just speculation

83
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,800
This man is brave and resourceful, and he is even good at Cuju.

84
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,200
I am becoming more and more interested in this person

85
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,840
Have you checked his origins?

86
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
I've inquired from many sources

87
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,680
But I still can't find out where he came from.

88
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,680
Based on your friendship with Miss Wu family

89
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,960
Why not start here?

90
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,640
This person is very cunning

91
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,120
He has already won the favor of everyone in the Wu family

92
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,360
Even the eldest lady of the Wu family who was originally targeting him

93
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,320
I also have a great change in my view of this lewd thief.

94
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,520
A thief?

95
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,200
I'm really lucky to go out for a walk

96
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,640
Otherwise, I would have thought I was a horse

97
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,240
Seeing more horses than people every day is really boring.

98
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,160
Brother Xiang is an active person

99
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,640
It's really depressing to be stuck in the pasture for many days.

100
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,200
Having said that, Handan City is actually quite big.

101
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,680
It's also difficult to find someone

102
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,800
Do you still remember the proton thing?

103
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,560
Of course, if I can't find them

104
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,000
I can’t go back to Qin

105
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,400
If I can’t go back to Qin, I can’t go back home.

106
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,560
I'm also very worried

107
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,200
But this matter can’t be rushed.

108
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,240
Now that we are at the market

109
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,960
Just go eat and drink enough

110
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,680
Stop eating and drinking

111
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,720
The stuff in this shop is pretty good, let’s go in and have a look.

112
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,680
good

113
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,600
Sir, are you coming to visit the shop again?

114
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,640
Just watch it ok

115
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,960
Let’s see if there’s anything that suits the uncle’s wishes?

116
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,880
This one is quite...

117
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,560
This hairpin is perfect for an uncle

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,160
i am a man

119
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,160
So it’s most suitable for an uncle to buy as a gift to your lady.

120
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,280
I'm not married yet

121
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,360
It can also be used for engagement

122
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,480
I don’t even have a lover yet

123
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,040
Brother Xiang, in fact, it may not necessarily be given to the person you love.

124
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,080
since you got hurt

125
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,320
The eldest lady often makes soup for you and takes care of you

126
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,280
You should repay her by giving her a hosta.

127
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,280
Then wrap it up

128
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,320
Thank you sir, I’ll give you sixty yuan.

129
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,960
I'll wrap it up for you, okay

130
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,400
Wait...

131
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,800
You want this one?

132
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,640
yes

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,880
I'll wrap it up for you, okay

134
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,040
How much does it cost?

135
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,600
It’s also sixty dollars

136
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,200
Really? This one costs 60 cents, and that one costs 60 cents too.

137
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,560
Is there any cheaper one?

138
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,160
In fact, the price is already very cheap

139
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Then forget it

140
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,720
I'll wrap it up for you

141
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,320
Brother Xiang has always been very straightforward in his speech.

142
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Just like my eldest daughter, she is outspoken.

143
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,760
I'm different from her. I use my brain more than she does.

144
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,240
Use your brain?

145
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,280
That is to say, I am more resourceful than her

146
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,560
In fact, girls don’t need to be resourceful.

147
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,920
Who says it’s not necessary? It’s not necessary now

148
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,320
Two thousand years from now, you won’t be able to survive without a little bit of resourcefulness.

149
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,240
Two thousand years? Get out of the way...

150
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,800
The villain deserves to die...it frightens the lady

151
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,520
Mrs. Ya?

152
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,440
Fortunately, thanks to Xiang Shaoxia, Crazy Horse was subdued

153
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,280
Xiang Shaoxia, thank you very much

154
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,160
You're welcome, it's just a little effort

155
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,360
Farewell since the palace

156
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,480
I can actually meet you again in this busy city

157
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,160
What a fate

158
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,480
Destined? It's just a coincidence.

159
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,360
Xiang Shaoxia, see you later

160
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,520
See you later

161
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,080
How could it be such a coincidence?

162
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,440
Yes, it's so coincidental that it seems like an act

163
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,240
By the way, hosta

164
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,920
Thanks

165
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,400
Are you cooking Pangasius chicken again?

166
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,600
You and Mr. Tao have recovered from their injuries.

167
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,400
Of course, there is no need to boil the Tianqi chicken anymore.

168
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,760
Not a frog?

169
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,120
Don't tell me, let me guess what it is

170
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,480
Pork Stewed with Wolfberry Balls

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,120
Your nose is more sensitive than a dog

172
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Why do you go around calling me a dog?

173
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,760
I didn’t mean that, I just wanted to praise you

174
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,640
Well, I see that you often make soup for me to drink.

175
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,400
Will also praise me

176
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,760
Give you a gift as a reward

177
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,400
Give me this hosta?

178
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Yes, I said I gave it to you

179
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,520
Why do you keep repeating it?

180
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,800
Just treat it as a courtesy and never default on each other.

181
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,400
The jade quality of this hosta is not too mild

182
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,160
Old style, rough carving

183
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
It is difficult to enter the elegant hall

184
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,440
Take it back, don't forget it

185
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,640
I usually wear expensive jade hairpins.

186
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,600
Occasionally, I have to wear low-quality goods.

187
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,840
It’s not a pity if you lose it, you can also reward others.

188
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,920
Let me put it on and see if it fits?

189
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,440
It’s really good, “perfectly flattering”

190
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,960
Perfectly flattering?

191
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,320
Perfect lining means that they fit together perfectly.

192
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,280
Can produce mutually reinforcing effects

193
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,000
really?

194
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,040
Seriously, this is such a low-grade product

195
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,360
To cooperate with such a low-level person like you

196
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,360
Still not cooperating perfectly?

197
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
You Xiang Shaolong

198
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,600
Brother Xiang, you are right here

199
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,760
I worked so hard to find you

200
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,320
What's up?

201
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,720
See it for yourself

202
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,720
I've said it many times

203
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,680
I don’t know how to read the characters of your dynasty and what to write.

204
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,000
We said goodbye in a hurry at the market, without even saying thank you.

205
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,360
Please come over and get together to repay your life-saving grace.

206
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,960
Mrs. Ya?

207
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,560
Will the future be due so soon?

208
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,400
I was at the market just now…

209
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,200
Did Mrs. Ya deliberately...

210
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,760
Mr. Tao, what happened in the market just now?

211
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,800
Mrs. Ya passed through the market in a carriage

212
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,720
The horse suddenly went crazy

213
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,080
Fortunately, thanks to Brother Xiang’s timely help

214
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,280
Stop the horse

215
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,600
How could it be such a coincidence? I'm afraid there is another purpose

216
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Brother Xiang, it’s better to refuse Madam.

217
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,960
Reject her? No, she is also a beauty after all

218
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,600
Do you want to accept the appointment?

219
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,080
Of course I accepted the appointment, I was very sincere.

220
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,640
erotic

221
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,440
No, it’s better that you go back and pick out fancy clothes for me

222
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,280
Let me go to the appointment

223
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,000
Don't you want to drink soup?

224
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,000
But I'm afraid I don't have enough clothes

225
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,320
Can you lend it to me?

226
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,880
My clothes? Yes

227
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,400
this set of clothes

228
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,840
It was the one you wore last time you went to the palace for a banquet.

229
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,520
You are really good, you can recognize this too

230
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,960
You just went to see Mrs. Ya

231
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,680
Is it necessary to do something so solemn?

232
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,200
Is it very grand? I feel like tying rice dumplings

233
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,400
Hands tied all over

234
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,320
But that's right, she is a lady after all.

235
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,560
Of course you have to dress appropriately

236
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,440
Only then can I be worthy of the word "Mrs."

237
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240
All men are lustful

238
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,400
Eyeing a woman who is in ecstasy and dissolute

239
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,480
Of course he is obsessed with ghosts, not to mention he is a thief

240
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,480
Mrs. Ya is a famous slut.

241
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,080
No wonder he likes lewd thieves

242
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,800
Please cultivate your moral integrity.

243
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,560
But you are right

244
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,800
A whore and a whore

245
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,520
It's simply a match made in heaven.

246
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,600
You lecherous person

247
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,680
I’ll give you back your hosta

248
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,880
Why are you so angry?

249
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,640
Anyway, I bought it for you with all my heart.

250
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,400
Just smash it like this

251
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,400
Is there any adhesive?

252
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,880
It’s here...Brother Xiang, it’s here

253
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,960
Arrived yet?

254
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,280
I get motion sickness every time I ride this thing.

255
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,880
Brother Xiang, you must be careful

256
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,120
Don't worry, Mrs. Ya won't "chew" me either.

257
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,720
Mrs. Ya "Chews You"

258
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,960
Does that mean she won't eat me alive?

259
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,040
But Mrs. Ya is not someone to be trifled with.

260
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,360
She is the sister of King Zhao

261
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,200
Moreover, he was closely associated with the traitor Zhao Mun.

262
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,720
She must have ill intentions towards you

263
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,320
Don't worry, my concentration is always sufficient

264
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,760
Mr. Xiang, I will inform Madam later.

265
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,000
Thanks

266
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,960
Great…

267
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,120
He plays like a symphony orchestra.

268
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,400
It's really pleasant

269
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,280
Xiang Shaolong is not only good at martial arts, but also good at Cuju.

270
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,560
I didn’t expect that even talking could be so funny.

271
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,240
Madam, don't be so polite

272
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,080
But I really didn’t expect that besides being beautiful, Madam

273
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,880
It turns out that he can even play the piano so well

274
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,640
It can simply be described by the phrase "three days of wandering around"

275
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,120
Walking around for three days? Xiang Lang, you really know how to talk.

276
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,600
But don’t be offended, madam.

277
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,520
Although I know nothing about playing the piano

278
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,320
But I could faintly hear it just now

279
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,160
Madam, you seem to have something on your mind

280
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Worried?

281
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,280
What is on my mind means

282
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,240
There are still some unresolved questions in your mind

283
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,240
The slave family is well clothed and well fed, and lives a carefree and happy life

284
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,400
Why are you worried?

285
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,240
If Xiang Lang wants to have a relationship with the Nu family,

286
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,800
Be a confidant and confidant

287
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,720
Why don't you go up to the small building and talk slowly?

288
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,400
The slave family has prepared fine wine and delicacies

289
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,120
Why is it so fast?

290
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,800
You guys stand down

291
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,120
yes ma'am

292
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,920
Is it Erwotou, so strong?

293
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,840
Xiang Lang, please

294
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,400
please…

295
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,760
Everyone talks about Handan City

296
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,440
An outstanding hero recently arrived

297
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,200
I already knew

298
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,240
Brother Wang’s banquet with Xiang Lang and Lian Jin

299
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,760
The courage contest between you and Lian Jin

300
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,920
I really admire the slave family

301
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,080
You're really over the top. Don't praise me too much.

302
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,760
Cuju in the palace that day

303
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,400
Xiang Lang's extraordinary skills opened the eyes of the slave family

304
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,320
I've long wanted to get to know Xiang Lang, but unfortunately I haven't had the chance.

305
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,560
Why do you say that?

306
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,560
I was already injured before halftime that day.

307
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,440
Are you teasing me?

308
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,600
It's not your fault that Xiang Lang was injured

309
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

310
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,080
You know a lot

311
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,800
I can really get a football certificate in the future

312
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,880
Xiang Lang is so skillful and witty

313
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,280
There must be something big done

314
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,000
I wonder which famous swordsman Xiang Lang studied under?

315
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,040
Which one? Actually, I didn’t learn from any one

316
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,280
I just train myself

317
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,440
That's what you call...

318
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
Self-taught without a teacher

319
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,520
Self-taught? You really know how to joke

320
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,080
Are you kidding? It's true

321
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,080
I don’t know which Mingjun Xiang Lang worked for before.

322
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,520
Mingjun? No

323
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,080
I used to work for the Hong Kong SAR government

324
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,800
Hong Kong SAR? It’s my hometown

325
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,680
It is possible for such outstanding people to appear in rural areas

326
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,560
It's really rare

327
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,000
Come, let me toast you three more glasses

328
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,520
Do you need three more drinks?

329
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,360
yes

330
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,880
A little bit will do, yes, a little bit, that's enough

331
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,280
Do you own a bar? You can drink so much

332
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,320
Come...drink, no need to be polite

333
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,160
Come

334
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,080
Come

335
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,320
It's really rude. No, it's not rude...

336
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,520
Xiang Lang, OK…

337
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,200
please forgive me

338
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,480
I'm a bargain, just wipe yours off

339
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,360
Come, help you. These are very cheap.

340
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,720
Yours is more expensive, just apply yours.

341
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,000
Smelling like alcohol, I still went to take a shower and change clothes

342
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,600
I also took the opportunity to take a shower, which is awesome

343
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,160
Really taking a bath

344
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,760
Really made of gold

345
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,000
You will get rich after two thousand years, these are antiques

346
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,400
Xiang Lang, are you still there?

347
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,160
In... you didn't tell me to leave, how dare I leave?

348
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,520
Why don't Xiang Lang take a bath and cool down?

349
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,000
No need, I'm used to taking a shower before going to bed

350
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,840
Take a bath yourself

351
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,680
But seriously

352
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,840
Your dishes are indeed worth appreciating

353
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,720
In addition to the dishes, the boudoir of the slave family

354
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,720
Is there nothing else worthy of Xiang Lang's appreciation?

355
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,800
No, you are also worthy of appreciation

356
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,880
Xiang Lang, can you do me a favor?

357
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,640
The servant forgot to bring replacement clothes

358
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,520
You bring in the clothes on the couch

359
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,800
On the couch?

360
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,400
It's the bed

361
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,440
Is it that one?

362
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,360
Even the see-through outfits are out, and it’s not just a trick.

363
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,000
Come on...you are pretty heat-resistant too

364
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,800
It's smoking, aren't you afraid of getting burned?

365
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,800
I'm tired

366
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,920
Don't be so polite

367
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,880
It turns out there really is foundation

368
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,080
What's up?

369
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,680
You can't go in

370
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,200
Does your own mother also want to spread the news?

371
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,880
She thought I was a good mother

372
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,640
Who are the important people here to meet?

373
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,520
It turned out to be just a dog from Wujiapu

374
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,360
Pan'er, you are too presumptuous

375
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,680
Xiang Shaolong, you pretended to be a gentleman before

376
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,120
Sternly scold me for bullying a weak girl

377
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,440
It turns out you are just a thief

378
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,560
It's just my mother throwing herself into my arms, you don't need to bully me

379
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,360
Shut up, you are too presumptuous

380
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,800
Am I so arrogant? Pan'er is never as arrogant as my mother.

381
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,400
There are different men hanging around you all day long

382
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,080
romantic and happy

383
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,680
This slap is worth a hundred taels

384
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,120
Pan'er

385
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,360
You continue to have fun, the child will not spoil your elegance

386
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,840
lady

387
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,200
go out…

388
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,960
Come, drink with me...

389
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,280
Want to drink again?

390
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,680
drink come drink

391
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,480
Drink, drink first

392
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,440
Awesome...awesome...

393
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,440
Don't drink so much

394
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,280
Forget it, just drink a little and forget it

395
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,600
Your heart must be laughing at me

396
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,160
You must be pitying me

397
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Yes, I didn't laugh at you

398
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,600
I am indeed shameless

399
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,640
Slutty and wild whore

400
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,560
Don't say that

401
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,560
Why do you have to pretend to be a gentleman?

402
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,320
Every man is a lustful person

403
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,800
Most of them don't mean that all of them are

404
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,160
You can't sink an entire boat with a penny.

405
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,960
You didn't? You knew I was a famous whore

406
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,000
You all came to accept the appointment, and your intentions are obvious

407
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,760
I might as well tell you the truth

408
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,440
I saw you doing so many things in the market that day

409
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,840
I guess you just want to get to know me

410
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And I saw a beautiful woman asking me out

411
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,920
In fact, there is also a little sense of glory and vanity

412
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,080
So I came here today just to be friends with you

413
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,440
Want to be friends with me?

414
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,200
Every man wants to get his hands on the slave family

415
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,760
then abandon me

416
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,840
I really want to tell you

417
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,320
In fact, I have seen countless beauties before

418
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,120
But I'm not interested in one-night stands

419
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,960
As for what’s the meaning behind yourself?

420
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,440
Or do you want to get to know me for some purpose?

421
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,760
Then I really don’t know

422
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,480
But I tell you, I'm coming today

423
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,480
I really want to be friends with you and just chat.

424
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,640
There are too many bad men in the world

425
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,960
There are too few good men

426
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,840
Bad man meets bad woman

427
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,080
Just like a bee seeing honey, it won’t let it go

428
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,360
But when a good man meets a bad woman

429
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,080
It will be a good thing to avoid it

430
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,840
none of my business

431
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,440
Did you borrow it? Borrowed it

432
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,480
Isn't this brother's sword?

433
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,880
The lady asked the slave to borrow the sword from Master Xiang

434
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,120
But the slave can’t see Mr. Xiang

435
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,440
So I had to borrow the sword from the young master.

436
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,600
I don’t want brother’s sword

437
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,080
That…

438
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,360
The moon is half-sky, and I haven’t come back yet in the middle of the night.

439
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,400
A real thief

440
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,880
Miss, do you still need to borrow a sword from Master Xiang?

441
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,000
No need, go to bed

442
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,800
You can borrow the sword from Mr. Xiang later.

443
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,720
You can go to bed only after I borrow it

444
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,240
Want to borrow again?

445
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,960
stinky thief

446
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,120
All men in the world are the same

447
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,600
Madam, are you awake? I will go and inform Uncle Xiang.

448
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,120
He hasn't left yet?

449
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,040
Yes, ma'am

450
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,960
Uncle Xiang saw his wife drunk last night

451
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,240
So I asked my slave to serve my wife before she goes to bed.

452
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,800
Dress the lady

453
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,720
Good morning

454
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,720
Xiang Lang What?

455
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,160
Did you never leave last night?

456
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,160
No, I saw you were very drunk last night

457
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,280
I don’t want to hinder you, so I went downstairs to have a rest.

458
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:45,880
But honestly

459
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,840
That garden downstairs is really cold

460
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,960
How was it? Did you sleep well last night?

461
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,080
Of course it’s good, with the gentleman Xiang Lang guarding me

462
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,400
What does it mean to say that a gentleman is not a gentleman?

463
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,360
By the way, I saw you were so drunk last night

464
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,720
I just went to the kitchen and found a piece of ginger

465
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,000
I made ginger tea for you to drink

466
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,680
It’s good for hangover, drink it while it’s hot

467
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,400
thank you for your kindness

468
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,400
Then I won’t hinder you. You drink slowly.

469
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,600
I'm leaving. If you need anything, just come to me.

470
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,560
Xiang Lang

471
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,360
Don’t call me Xiang Lang anymore.

472
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,160
You'd better call me Xiang Shaolong

473
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,720
I really can’t get used to calling me Xiang Lang

474
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,040
Then I'm leaving

475
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,000
By the way, if you chat with me next time

476
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,560
Especially if we have to talk all night

477
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,360
It's best not to come to this room

478
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,080
Because I'm not used to having a swimming pool in the room

479
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
goodbye

480
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,800
swimming pool?

481
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,520
Xiang Shaolong, who are you?

482
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,320
Why are you here?

483
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,280
I have never left

484
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,200
So powerful?

485
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,480
last night…

486
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,680
How was last night?

487
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,800
I slept very sweetly last night

488
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,640
Sleeping sweetly? Did Mrs. Naya talk to you...

489
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,120
Don't talk any more, let's talk after you have your morning tea.

490
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,880
Then tell me while walking

491
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,040
Those things just now were so fragrant and smooth

492
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,520
Not to mention anything else, just looking at it makes my hands slip.

493
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,160
I really need to give it another try someday.

494
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,240
Miss

495
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,880
Why are you staring so early in the morning?

496
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,000
Fortunately I had breakfast just now

497
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,720
Otherwise, seeing her like this would really make me want to vomit.

498
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,640
You thief, you are so dirty and shameless

499
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,720
You're a girl, don't do anything all day long

500
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,160
You lecherous person, you had a great time last night

501
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,560
But there’s no need to show off around

502
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,320
Miss, that's not actually the case

503
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,800
The eldest lady is really miserable. She is so old that she is crazy.

504
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,120
Brother Xiang, the eldest lady is so worried

505
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,280
There may be a misunderstanding. Please explain it to her.

506
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,080
You are more worried than me, so you should explain to her.

507
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,760
I want to go back to my room and take a shower now

508
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,840
I was soaked in wine last night

509
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,120
I still have to do laundry

510
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,080
It's so fun to take a bath

511
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,600
(There are a few close friends in this world)

512
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,600
(How many friendships can last forever)

513
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,640
(Today I say goodbye and I shake hands with you)

514
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,360
(Friendship is always in our hearts)

515
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,360
(No farewell for today)

516
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,920
(They will definitely be able to get together in court) You stinky thief

517
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,320
I can sing such a disgusting song

518
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:36,200
(Even if we can't meet, we will always be friends)

519
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,880
(There are a few close friends in this world)

520
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,640
(How many friendships can last forever)

521
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,840
(Today I say goodbye and I shake hands with you)

522
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,840
(Friendship is always in our hearts)

523
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,520
There is a snake

524
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,760
That snake is obviously not poisonous

525
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,000
Do you think this belt of mine is pretty?

526
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,480
Give it back to you, you like "letting snakes go" so much

527
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,280
Just become a policewoman

528
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,440
Brother Xiang, a new batch of horses came to our ranch today.

529
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,800
If you like it

530
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,800
Just tell me, no need to be polite to me

531
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,520
I only know how to choose Japanese cars and European cars, and choose horses...

532
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,440
There's something I want to ask you

533
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,640
You ranch so many horses

534
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,120
If you escape, how will you find it?

535
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,440
You didn't notice the horses at our Ushi Ranch

536
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,240
Do they all have Ublisian marks?

537
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,600
Yeah?

538
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,520
Our family is about to prepare for a new horse

539
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,880
Branded with Uzbekistan's mark

540
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,120
yes

541
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,720
Burn the iron red and brand it on the horse

542
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
Isn't it too inhumane?

543
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,360
Don't worry, it's okay, we're used to it

544
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,560
Do you want to try it?

545
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,160
OK

546
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,000
Mr. Tao, you came to brand the horse and you didn’t even give me a share.

547
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,680
Madam, are you interested in joining in the fun?

548
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,240
I'm not the only one joining in the fun

549
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,520
There is another idler

550
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,000
Brother Xiang is here to see the horses being branded.

551
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,440
Okay over here...

552
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,680
It's actually very simple

553
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,880
The horse's feet are already tied and it's very safe.

554
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,680
Just burn it in this position.

555
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,920
It's that simple

556
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,960
Can you let me try it?

557
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,920
Try it

558
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,760
What horses are yet to be branded?

559
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,600
there

560
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,640
Yeah, isn't it nice to pet a horse?

561
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,640
Why play with water snakes?

562
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,720
Water snake?

563
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,200
Yeah, I caught a water snake last night

564
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,920
I took it to make soup. You can drink it later.

565
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,560
Can it be baked?

566
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,520
Brand it

567
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,440
sorry…

568
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,440
Miss

569
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,160
your hands...sorry

570
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,160
I didn't know that horse was tied

571
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,600
He will also go crazy and kick around.

572
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,720
Don't be so angry

573
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,360
If you are angry, you are also angry at that horse.

574
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,000
But to be honest, you are lucky this time.

575
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,440
Just brand it on your hand, just in case you don't pay attention

576
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,240
If it were branded on the face, it would be terrible to look at.

577
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,440
Just joking

578
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,200
I have followed Brother Xiang's instructions

579
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,840
Go check out this thief Zhao Mu

580
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,880
Is there a secret place for protons in the city?

581
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,720
It's better not to check. Let's check.

582
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,800
That thief actually owns more than a dozen mansions in the city

583
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Distributed in the north, east, south and west of the city

584
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,120
Is he in real estate?

585
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,520
estate?

586
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,320
Real estate means that he bought a lot of houses

587
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,320
That's right

588
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,800
Zhao Mu, this thief, really enriched his own pockets

589
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,320
Oops, I can’t find anything yet.

590
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,880
What's the use of finding out only how many houses he bought?

591
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,840
The spy we sent

592
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,320
Almost everyone died

593
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,840
It turns out that the thief had already taken precautions.

594
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,240
That's even worse. What should we do if we alert the enemy?

595
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,080
We can't just stand here and do nothing.

596
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,760
What can be done now?

597
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,320
If he really takes hostages

598
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,880
Hidden in one of the rooms

599
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,680
I think even Jin and Zhao Mu should have some movement.

600
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,880
Can't we just send people to follow them day and night?

601
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,080
Recently our Wuzhi Ranch

602
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,080
There are suspicious people appearing

603
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,520
I think it was Zhao Mu who sent someone to monitor us.

604
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,920
I think maybe he sent someone to follow me

605
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,440
That's just right. How about I draw his attention away?

606
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,920
Let's make a move to attack the east and the west

607
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,520
Then wouldn’t Brother Tao be easy to do?

608
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,400
Boss, I would like to ask you something

609
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,560
Can this hosta be rejoined if it is broken?

610
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,400
uncle

611
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,280
The store also has many other reasonably priced items.

612
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,320
I wonder if it can be joined together?

613
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,080
You can try using thin gold flakes

614
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,560
Connect and encapsulate the two cut-off openings

615
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,240
But it takes a lot of effort

616
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,520
That is to say, it can be joined together.

617
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,200
Okay...Uncle, you can come back and pick it up in a few days.

618
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,240
Can I come back to pay in a few days?

619
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,160
Can…

620
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,120
good

621
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,200
Uncle, you...

622
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,800
Let me borrow a back door, thank you

623
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,840
Zenju?

624
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,600
Wait

625
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,240
They are assassins who want to kill you, but you actually...

626
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,120
Why should you do this?

627
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,760
Are you unhappy if you don't kill people?

628
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,040
You actually let that assassin go

629
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,480
You really hate your longevity

630
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,400
I told you not to kill him

631
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,760
I want to ask who sent him here

632
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,800
Is this also wrong?

633
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,960
Anyway I can tell you

634
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,880
Someone has paid an assassin to kill you.

635
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,640
I can save you once, but I can't save you a second time

636
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,840
Moreover, the assassin cannot return his orders to the lord when he returns.

637
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,520
No one can escape death

638
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,720
No one wants your help

639
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,560
If I hadn't let you go

640
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,760
You have already lost your head and are in a different place

641
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,160
Whatever, but for a money-minded person like you

642
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,520
Do everything for money

643
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,280
You suddenly helped me like this, but I felt scared

644
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Xiang Shaolong, you are really ignorant

645
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,560
You're the one who doesn't know what's good or bad

646
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,600
I wonder how much Zhao Mu will give you this time

647
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,880
What about asking you to help him?

648
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,000
It's very polite of me to say that you are jealous of money.

649
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,560
In fact, people like you should be greedy for profit.

650
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,480
Yes, I am kind and gentle but greedy for money

651
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,400
But why not Xiang Shaolong?

652
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,640
When you told me to go to Xianyang City

653
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,080
Find your beloved woman

654
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,600
Now you broke into the Proton Mansion to save people for no reason

655
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,360
You are also doing it for money

656
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,560
I can't think of any other reason besides money

657
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,280
Stop arguing and get down to business.

658
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,000
can you tell me where those protons are trapped

659
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Being an assassin has the morality of being an assassin

660
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,440
If you receive money from others, you must complete the task

661
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,960
Absolutely no turning against the enemy

662
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,080
This is the morality of assassins walking in the world

663
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,080
Besides, I really don't know where the proton is.

664
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,760
You are so moral

665
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,800
Just kill me last time

666
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,280
Even if you are moral, sometimes it depends on the circumstances.

667
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,600
Not like you

668
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,120
I already risked my life last time

669
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,760
Disobey the Lord's order to save you

670
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,600
You don't appreciate it, and you're still making sarcastic remarks here and there

671
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,960
Good intentions are not rewarded

672
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,440
Why does the Marquis want to see Lian Jin?

673
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,440
I asked you to send someone to follow Xiang Shaolong

674
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,040
You actually sent someone to assassinate him?

675
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,400
Xiang Shaolong is a man with many tricks and tricks

676
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,560
Repeatedly obstructing Mr. Hou’s good deeds

677
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,000
If he is not eradicated as soon as possible

678
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,320
I'm afraid there will be endless troubles

679
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,600
I don’t need you to teach me how to do things

680
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,720
Lian Jin is loyal

681
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,680
I just think about Mr. Hou at all times

682
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,160
Whether you are loyal or not, I will decide for myself

683
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,000
But Xiang Shaolong is indeed a rare talent

684
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,640
I want to take him for my own use

685
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,840
Even if Xiang Shaolong can be bribed

686
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,000
But he is definitely not a loyal person

687
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,040
Although you are loyal to me, you are too selfish

688
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,000
You target Xiang Shaolong everywhere

689
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,800
It’s just for Wu Tingfang

690
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,680
In short, there is no order from me

691
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,840
You must not act rashly

692
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,160
As for how to deal with Xiang Shaolong

693
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,400
I have my own sense of proportion

694
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,200
lady

695
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,280
You guys stand down?

696
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,400
Lord Marquis, I frightened the slave family.

697
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,120
Madam is getting less and less courageous

698
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,000
But the shelf is getting bigger and bigger

699
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,920
I want you to wait here

700
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,360
It's all Pan'er's fault for causing trouble outside.

701
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,760
That’s why the slave family is so busy

702
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,040
Who is so bold as to bully Madam’s precious son?

703
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,800
Wait for me to come forward and teach him a lesson

704
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,280
It's just a trivial matter, nothing to worry about.

705
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,640
Wait for the slave family to order the maids to prepare wine and food.

706
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,040
No need, madam

707
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,480
I just want to see my wife

708
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Does the Marquis want me to serve other people again?

709
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,480
Not someone else, but Xiang Shaolong

710
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,560
I have already told Mr. Hou

711
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,240
Xiang Shaolong is not a lustful person

712
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,280
He is a gentleman

713
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,120
Gentleman, Madam, have you ever seen a cat that doesn’t eat fish?

714
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,360
Maybe I'm old and losing my luster.

715
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,080
Madam's beauty remains the same for ten years

716
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,160
Madam in full bloom

717
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,960
Any man will be moved when he sees it

718
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,080
The last failure was all because Paner broke something big

719
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,480
Xiang Shaolong is not an ordinary person

720
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,960
I would never sell myself for beauty.

721
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,880
Everyone has a price at which they are willing to sell themselves

722
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,360
Even if you are not greedy for money or lustful, you will always have your weaknesses.

723
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,200
Please ask the Marquis to hire Gao Ming. The slave family doesn’t want to do it anymore.

724
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Xiang Shaolong is a talented person, I am determined to get it

725
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,800
Moreover, in Handan City, besides Madam

726
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,000
I really can't find a more ideal candidate

727
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,720
Marquis

728
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,600
Every time you push slaves into the arms of other men

729
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,960
Aren’t you heartbroken and reluctant to part with it?

730
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,320
Of course I am heartbroken, of course I am reluctant to part with you

731
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,080
Madam, I promise you

732
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,880
This time is the last time

733
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,360
Mr. Hou simply didn’t keep his word.

734
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,000
The last time I asked the slave family to serve Lord Xinling

735
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,760
Also said it was the last time

736
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,120
The result is again and again

737
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,000
You don't take the slave family to heart at all

738
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,720
If I don’t take you to heart

739
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,840
Care about everything and take care of everything

740
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,280
Madam may have been ostracized

741
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,520
She may have even married into the Huns.

742
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,120
Madam and Pan'er

743
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,440
You can enjoy such a comfortable life today

744
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,720
Could it be that I have not tried my best and tried my best?

745
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,560
Madam, as long as I achieve my merits

746
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,120
My wife also contributed a lot

747
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,680
So awesome, like a Rolls-Royce in Hong Kong

748
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,280
Rolls-Royce? What do you mean?

749
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,840
Rolls-Royce is Rolls-Royce

750
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,920
Uncle Xiang and Mrs. Ya held a flower viewing party

751
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,440
Sincerely invite Mr. Xiang

752
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,640
I hope Mr. Xiang will go and watch it

753
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,800
The flower viewing event is also very good, I have never been to it before

754
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,040
Flower viewing party?

755
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,640
I'm afraid it's the Flower Destroying Convention, the Evil Flower Convention

756
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,240
Yeah?

757
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,560
Regards, Mr. Xiang

758
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,120
Do I need to buy anything for the flower viewing party?

759
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,560
Purchase a coffin and carefully prepare the dead soul under the flowers

760
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,280
You are such a bitch, why do you talk so much?

761
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,840
Sit tight and be careful of the car tipping over

762
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,920
Let’s go…

763
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,920
Do you mean the eighth wife from Brother Xiang’s hometown is beautiful?

764
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,680
What does it mean that beauty is the eighth wife?

765
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,320
He's praising you, Baba
