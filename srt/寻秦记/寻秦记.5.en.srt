1
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,280
Really good skills, Xiang Shaoxia, it’s your turn

2
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,880
OK

3
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,040
Sorry, people make mistakes and horses make mistakes

4
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,480
Don't be offended if it hurts you later

5
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,720
If you really make a mistake, I will be buried with you

6
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,000
each other

7
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,480
This one?

8
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,040
Are you having a stiff neck?

9
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,160
Your Majesty, Lian Jin dodges, so he should be sentenced to lose.

10
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,240
Lian Jin, you dodge, you are so courageless.

11
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,800
Your Majesty, Xiang Shaolong also sheathed his sword and did not have the guts to strike down.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,240
I'm afraid he's afraid that his poor swordsmanship will hurt Lian Jin.

13
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,400
and make one's head fall to the ground

14
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,760
But Lian Jin dodges first

15
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,760
I think the whole thing should be like this

16
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,200
Brother-in-law knows that I am not good at swordsmanship.

17
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,400
So you dodge a little to accommodate me.

18
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,440
Let's do this, let's call it a draw.

19
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,600
Anyway, I’m very happy today

20
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,720
Xiang Shaoxia, everything you say makes sense.

21
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,240
Then let's call it a draw and everyone will be happy.

22
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Your Majesty, originally there was no need to use weapons in a competition.

23
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,080
A Cuju competition will be held in the palace next month

24
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,960
Then the two of them can compete

25
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, let's have a showdown between you two in the Cuju competition.

26
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
I want you to kill Xiang Shaolong

27
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,120
You actually chickened out in the face of battle, you are as cowardly as a mouse

28
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,920
Mr. Hou, you were also present at that time

29
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,560
What if I kill Xiang Shaolong and the palace is stained with blood?

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm afraid even Jin will be killed.

31
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,680
With my status and authority today,

32
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,560
How difficult is it to save your dog's life?

33
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,000
If you fail to do your job next time,

34
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,840
Just go back to Chu State and farm in the countryside.

35
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,920
Mr. Hou, how difficult is it to kill Xiang Shaolong?

36
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
I'm going to assassinate him now

37
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,240
You must not kill him now

38
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,040
Cuju competition set by the king

39
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,000
It is from Benhou Mansion to Wujiapu

40
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,360
If Xiang Shaolong dies, the finger of blame will be pointed at me

41
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,760
There is no need for us to give Wu Yingyuan an excuse to cause trouble.

42
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,200
After the Cuju game, Xiang Shaolong died.

43
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,880
This time the Cuju competition is going to be a failure.

44
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,640
You should be well prepared

45
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,920
Yes, Mr. Hou

46
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,480
After pouring for half an hour, there was only half a tank of water.

47
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,000
When will it be filled?

48
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,640
Brother Xiang, you take a bath every night

49
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,040
Aren’t you afraid of the invasion of wind and cold?

50
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,440
I'm just afraid of the invasion of smelly foxes

51
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
Of course you have to take a shower every day

52
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,720
It’s true that you only take a bath once a month

53
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,160
Aren't you afraid of getting lice?

54
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,600
Lice?

55
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Not clean

56
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,120
Not clean?

57
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,720
It's not hygienic. I understand.

58
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,920
Slave the Wu family's maids to serve a prostitute every night

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,120
Manager Tao, how do you become a manager?

60
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,240
Miss, the master said that Xiang Shaoxia is an honored guest.

61
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,240
So we should treat you with the courtesy of a guest

62
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,440
Honorable guest, what virtues and abilities does he have?

63
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,440
The thief is...

64
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,040
Don't cheat me out of my house anymore

65
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,640
You have to leave tomorrow, otherwise I won't be polite

66
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,440
You also know how to call me a pervert

67
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,200
You are the only beauty in Wujiapu

68
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,160
If I don’t stay to watch you, who will watch you?

69
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,120
Let's take a bath together

70
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,360
downstream

71
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,640
What's obscene, just taking a bath

72
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,600
Dead thief

73
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,440
Take a bath

74
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,200
Our eldest daughter is from a daughter’s family

75
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,600
It's not okay to play around. Don't put any more petals in it.

76
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm not shooting commercials

77
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,200
Just put one or two slices in for decoration, thank you

78
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,960
Brother Xiang, I won’t stop you from taking a bath.

79
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,360
How can you stop me? We are all men. Let’s wash together.

80
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,080
Wash together?

81
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,480
This is popular in my hometown

82
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,440
There is a kind of bathroom called sauna in my hometown

83
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,120
There are cold and hot pools, as well as steam rooms

84
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,240
The man put on a white towel and went in to bake it.

85
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,800
Jump into the cold pool again

86
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,320
That feeling is simply wonderful, have you tried it?

87
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,480
Brother Xiang, this is the custom in your hometown

88
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,840
So blatant, so exuberant

89
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,720
Aren’t you afraid of being criticized?

90
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,200
What criticism?

91
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,760
Two men

92
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,240
"Gay" (gay)

93
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,520
Gay?

94
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,800
Don’t tell me anymore. Even if I tell you, you won’t know.

95
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,080
Sit down, I don't know how long it will take

96
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,000
Speaking of which, it took a lot of effort

97
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,120
Only then can we present the He family's jade to our king.

98
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,040
But he couldn't return Yingzheng to Qin

99
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,240
What a waste of effort

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,120
All because Zhao Mu, the treacherous minister, was obstructing it.

101
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,320
Isn’t Zhao Mu in charge of the protons?

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
yes

103
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,520
So where is the Proton Mansion?

104
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,680
The tall building in the east of the city

105
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,840
Which one is the most heavily guarded?

106
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,000
Right

107
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,240
You said Lu Buwei knew

108
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,360
The king refused to hand Ying Zheng back to him

109
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,280
Do you think he will send someone to rescue Ying Zheng then?

110
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,200
I really don't know

111
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,640
But Ying Zheng is so important to Lu Buwei

112
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
I think he will send someone to rescue him

113
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,520
Do you think the castle master will send someone to help him when he arrives?

114
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,520
I really don't know

115
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,040
Brother Xiang, why are you so concerned about the proton?

116
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,680
I have nothing to say, just looking for something to talk about.

117
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,280
By the way, you are both wise and brave

118
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,960
Both the king and the master appreciate you

119
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,600
Just stay in the Wu family and help the master.

120
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,320
With your skills and talents, you must be able to accomplish something

121
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,680
A Cuju competition will be held in the palace next month

122
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,080
As long as you are willing to play

123
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,320
It will definitely help the Wu family win the championship.

124
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,320
At that time, you can also make a name for yourself in front of the princes and ministers.

125
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,520
I've wanted to ask you for a long time, what is Cuju?

126
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,680
You don’t know Cuju either?

127
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,000
So do you know what popcorn is?

128
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,440
Bakuya?

129
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
I know, it's a sport

130
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,560
amazing

131
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,360
Is this Cuju?

132
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,200
Right

133
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,200
What's in it?

134
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,480
full of feathers

135
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,680
What are the rules?

136
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,480
The game is divided into two teams, each team has six people

137
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,200
Try to shoot the ball into the opponent's goal

138
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,920
There are three gantry on each side

139
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,840
The team with more goals wins

140
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,920
That's very simple, no different from football

141
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,720
I don’t even know Cuju

142
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,160
It's easy to say at first glance, conceited and arrogant.

143
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,240
Since it seems easy, let’s divide it into two groups and compete.

144
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
good

145
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,680
Lord of the castle

146
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,760
Bounce and hit the wall, easy

147
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,720
It's better to turn left and right than to buy a house

148
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,600
Really good skills

149
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,360
upside down gold hook

150
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,640
Okay, three to zero

151
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,680
Good skills...

152
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,480
Xiang Shaoxia, I never imagined that your Cuju skills are superb.

153
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
if you are willing to help

154
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,520
Cuju competition to be held at the Royal Palace next month

155
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,920
Our Wujiapu will definitely win the championship

156
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,760
To wash away our decadence over the past three years

157
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
In fact, the sport of Cuju

158
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,720
It emphasizes teamwork and cooperation

159
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,720
No matter how well I play, it doesn't matter

160
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,720
Makes sense

161
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,560
Let's do this, our family will be led by Brother Xiang

162
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,040
Teach them to practice

163
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,840
good suggestion

164
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:29,160
Xiang Shaoxia, it’s up to you to revive the Wu family’s reputation.

165
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,360
Dad, do you expect too much from him?

166
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,880
Wei'er, you should humbly learn from Xiang Shaoxia

167
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,040
Xiang Shaoxia, please leave this matter to me

168
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,400
Do your best

169
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,640
You practice hard

170
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,680
Thanks a lot

171
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,040
Yes... know

172
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,520
Better go back and take a shower first

173
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,320
I’ll teach you again slowly, okay?

174
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,960
Are you dumb?

175
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
yes…

176
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,080
You see he is arrogant

177
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,760
This person doesn't take anyone seriously at all

178
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,040
I will definitely teach him a lesson if I get the chance.

179
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,840
Boss, is there any arsenic?

180
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,400
Yes, is there an infestation of mice in your house?

181
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,960
Inherit two cents

182
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,960
Thanks

183
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,080
These are all high-quality horses that Wu Mou carefully raised.

184
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,240
Feeding with high-quality feed and mountain spring water every day

185
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,960
There is also a dedicated back massage

186
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,320
And Massage?

187
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,280
Wouldn’t it be more enjoyable than Kobe beef?

188
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,480
Ma Shachu? What kind of horse is it?

189
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,560
Ma Shachu means that you treat horses as guests

190
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,640
In fact, Xiang Shaoxia is my honored guest.

191
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,720
In the Wu family, only distinguished guests are worthy of having good horses.

192
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,200
Please choose one of these horses

193
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,880
That's too polite, but seriously

194
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,720
All your horses are strong

195
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,800
These horses not only have strong single-leg strength, but also have long distances.

196
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,800
And can withstand cold and heat

197
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,000
That’s the “Ferrari” of horses

198
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,520
What does Ferrari mean?

199
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,840
Ferrari means you have many horses and will make a fortune soon.

200
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,480
Take your pick

201
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,720
I really don’t understand why dad treats this pervert like a distinguished guest.

202
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,280
He also gave him his beloved horse

203
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,320
Xiang Shaolong also has extraordinary qualities

204
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,520
You also think he is good

205
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,400
Stop talking about these things, I came here specifically to see you today

206
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,040
How about we go horseback riding by the lake to relax?

207
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,200
Did Brother Lian bring the medicine that Fang'er needs?

208
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,680
have

209
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,360
The drugstore owner said that people who take these medicines

210
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,600
I only have weakness in my limbs, dizziness and tinnitus.

211
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,320
Just an ordinary medicine powder

212
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,400
Since the potency of the medicine is so light, wouldn't it be advantageous to the prostitute?

213
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,280
Is it better to put it in soup or tea?

214
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Fang'er...

215
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,600
Big brother

216
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,640
Look, we have this thing this time

217
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,840
I can definitely punish that young dragon well.

218
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,240
You also have…

219
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,440
How strong is your pack of medicine?

220
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,880
The alchemist said that this is when the clouds rise and the mist disperses.

221
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,160
You will feel dizzy and weak after taking it.

222
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,400
It’s like flying through the clouds and riding on the mist as a fairy

223
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,640
Followed by the phenomenon of drowsiness and suspended animation

224
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,960
It will take several hours for the medicine to wear off

225
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,040
Then use your bag first

226
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,240
Brother Xiang, you said you practiced Cuju early in the morning

227
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,960
Now the whole family will gather and wait for you

228
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,640
Brother Xiang, get up

229
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,040
All the family members are waiting for you, get up

230
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,400
Brother Xiang, how are you?

231
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,800
What's the matter?

232
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,680
I had diarrhea more than ten times last night

233
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,400
Some fever and chills

234
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,520
you are hot

235
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,520
Gastroenteritis again

236
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,240
It must be serious, I'll call a doctor for you

237
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,120
No salt

238
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,440
Doctor, what's wrong?

239
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,920
Xiang Shaoxia’s pulse is strange

240
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,440
Sometimes it’s empty and sometimes it’s real, sometimes it’s weak and sometimes it’s not, it’s a pity…

241
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
What disease do I have?

242
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,520
Xiang Shaoxia

243
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,040
Doctor, you can tell me what the disease is.

244
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,840
Severe illness is difficult to treat

245
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,040
Xiang Shaoxia is seriously ill and cannot be cured

246
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
Xiang Shaoxia is about to die soon

247
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,840
You are not going to die soon? Doctor, are you sick?

248
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,320
Xiang Shaoxia, you have unfinished business and you need to finish it as soon as possible.

249
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,800
Soon?

250
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,800
What if history really changes?

251
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,600
That would be troublesome, do you know

252
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,560
The reason why you and I exist in this space is history

253
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,560
What do you think would happen if history changed?

254
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,360
What did I do wrong?

255
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,160
Brother Xiang, take medicine

256
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,680
There's no need to eat so frequently, right?

257
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,200
I drank four times yesterday

258
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
I drank five times this morning

259
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,360
Bitter medicine, don't you feel your condition is getting better?

260
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,640
One thing is, the fever and diarrhea are really gone.

261
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,280
As long as it gets better, drink it

262
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,360
It's very hot, wait until it cools down a bit before drinking it

263
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,600
You need to drink after a break, I'm out

264
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,400
Is it okay to fall down?

265
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,800
But it’s useless to drink it. It treats the symptoms but not the root cause.

266
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,240
No, we must hurry up and rescue Ying Zheng first

267
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,720
Otherwise there is no chance to go back

268
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,640
Shift changes occur approximately every four hours and ten minutes

269
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,040
Four people are on duty per shift

270
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,240
Each shift lasts about five minutes

271
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,600
This hook should be strong enough

272
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,320
If it's so high, will you fall to your death?

273
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,800
Is this considered infrared?

274
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,440
It’s almost like setting up a feng shui array

275
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,560
Brother Xiang, what Brother Xiang?

276
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,400
your sword

277
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,920
What happened to my sword?

278
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,440
Me

279
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,480
Is it you? What a coincidence

280
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,360
Tell me...

281
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,720
There are assassins…

282
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,440
Let's go

283
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,360
Why leave? There are assassins but not thieves

284
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,920
We are assassins, let's go

285
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,280
Brother Xiang, why did you visit the Proton Mansion at night?

286
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,400
The reason you came is my reason

287
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,480
You know the reason I came is to save the protons

288
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,560
If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger's cubs?

289
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,080
I've already guessed how to catch a tiger's cub.

290
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,560
You are here to save the protons

291
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,200
Don't use such a secret thing

292
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,240
Tell it in a secret way

293
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,120
Otherwise, it will be even more troublesome if others find out.

294
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,480
Who are you?

295
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,960
I am who you are

296
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,080
Could it be that you are from Qin?

297
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,520
By the way, we are all from Qin and we are on the same front.

298
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,040
Are you sent by Prime Minister Lu?

299
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,920
How can you often reveal such a confidential matter?

300
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,480
I'm not afraid to tell you anymore

301
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,600
In fact, I am the secret envoy sent by Mr. Lu

302
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,440
Great, I told the master a long time ago

303
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,360
Your background is not simple

304
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,640
Since everyone is one of our own

305
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,840
Don't say any more, let's talk about it after we go back to Wujiapu

306
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,200
By the way, secret things should be said in a secret place of course

307
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,400
Let's go

308
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Did Prime Minister Lu send you here? Yes

309
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,160
But I didn’t hear Prime Minister Lu mention it

310
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,800
By the way, Prime Minister Lu didn’t mention it when he protected the jade last time.

311
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,760
An emissary will be sent to assist in the operation

312
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,400
Such a confidential thing

313
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,800
Prime Minister Lu will not talk nonsense to others

314
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,440
Especially if your position is low

315
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,920
In fact, this is the case. Prime Minister Lu is afraid that

316
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,520
you will make mistakes

317
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,560
That's why I was sent to "make up the votes"

318
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,960
What does back-voting mean?

319
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,560
The meaning of supplementary votes is that I'm afraid you will make mistakes.

320
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,520
So I was sent to deal with the aftermath.

321
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,360
Did Prime Minister Lu make a mistake in his guess?

322
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,760
You haven’t arrived at Changting yet

323
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,120
They were intercepted by the Bearded Mountain Bandits.

324
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,920
Fortunately we took action in time

325
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,600
Otherwise, the piece of He's Bi would have been lost long ago.

326
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,040
Zhao Mu and Lian Jin have it in their hands

327
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,080
you're right

328
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,840
Are you really from Qin?

329
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:46,960
It’s true, it’s absolutely true, everything about the state of Qin

330
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,440
It's so easy for me

331
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,760
No, you should know everything

332
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,760
Let’s not talk about the distant ones, just talk about Prime Minister Lu

333
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,880
I also know how to get to know King Qin

334
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,400
That's what the story is called

335
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,880
Rare things to live in

336
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,800
What? A story about a rare find?

337
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,840
Yes, let me tell you

338
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,480
Actually this story is not too long

339
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,280
At that time, Prime Minister Lu was still a businessman

340
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
By chance, he

341
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,520
Got acquainted with the hostages of the Qin State at that time

342
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,920
His name was Stranger. After they met,

343
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,640
Prime Minister Lu discovered the stranger

344
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,480
Very potential and talented

345
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,400
So I kept spending money to cultivate him

346
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,640
And often in front of An Guojun and Mrs. Huayang

347
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,400
Said many good words and praised him

348
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,040
Ask them to make him the prince in the future

349
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,680
As soon as Lord An Guo died, he immediately ascended the throne.

350
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,760
Xiang Shaoxia, you can even live with Prime Minister Lu’s rare goods.

351
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,120
Also know very clearly

352
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,680
This is just idle business

353
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,920
I even sing with a stranger named Zhu Ji

354
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,640
It was a gift from Prime Minister Lu, I know it too

355
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,320
In fact, Zhu Ji is Prime Minister Lu’s second wife

356
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,280
Second wife?

357
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,160
The second wife is the first and second wife...

358
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,120
The second old…

359
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
That's a concubine

360
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,200
Beloved concubine, such a confidential matter

361
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,840
I don't want to say too much to you

362
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,280
Or maybe you accidentally said it?

363
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,920
I really don't know what to do

364
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,840
Xiang Shaoxia turned out to be the popular person next to Prime Minister Lu

365
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,920
Wu Mou was offended just now. Don't be offended, young hero.

366
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,200
Don't say that, let's find a way quickly

367
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,360
It would be better to send them back to Qin

368
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,120
Yes, in fact Wu is responsible for rescuing Zhu Ji’s mother and son.

369
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,840
It's a pity that this matter has twists and turns

370
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,240
Tonight's visit to the Proton Mansion almost revealed the secret

371
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,920
It seems that these matters need to be considered in the long term.

372
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,160
Are you planning on taking a long-term view? These things cannot be done slowly.

373
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,960
It must be resolved as soon as possible

374
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,760
Xiang Shaoxia, do you have a way to deal with it?

375
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,840
Frankly, I think

376
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,400
It's not difficult to save mother and son

377
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,800
But it will be difficult to send him back to Qin safely

378
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,600
Do you have a good idea?

379
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,760
There is... there is...

380
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,800
In fact, Wu Mou has opened a tunnel out of Handan City

381
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,800
You are so cunning, you have already dug a tunnel

382
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,280
We have to find a way to rescue them quickly.

383
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,480
Do I need to revise the book to discuss this matter with Prime Minister Lu?

384
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,240
No, it might take a month to send letters

385
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,480
We rescued him first

386
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,960
Wouldn't it be better to inform Prime Minister Lu again?

387
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,800
good

388
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,280
Just do it

389
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,600
Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen

390
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,560
Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty

391
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,480
Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three... Miss

392
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,960
What is that thief doing?

393
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,680
According to Brother Xiang, this is called palm pressure

394
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,040
Twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one

395
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:19,240
Thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five

396
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,360
Are you pregnant? You do it now

397
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,160
It looks like a palm pressure for prenatal and childbirth classes

398
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,840
Do you know what the basic requirements are for a palm press?

399
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,400
That is, the chest cannot be pressed and the abdomen cannot be bulging.

400
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,160
But the butt cannot swing from side to side

401
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,080
It won't work if you do this a hundred times, next person

402
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,520
Xiang Shaolong, you...

403
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,800
Why? With your qualifications, if you are allowed to compete

404
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,800
We are bound to lose, the next one

405
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,680
Xiang Shaolong, I am finally the young master of Wujiapu.

406
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,640
How dare you be so rude to me in front of my servants

407
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,520
Come on, give him a good 30 blows for me

408
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,000
Why? Do you want to rebel?

409
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,640
I don’t even listen to what I say, young master.

410
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,480
The castle owner’s name is Wu Yingyuan

411
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,720
Is your full name Wudangdang?

412
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,720
Or maybe there is a child named Ububu

413
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,000
If you come again, I will stuff a coconut into your mouth

414
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,800
I want you to be like a black-mouthed dog

415
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Young Master, please don’t get hurt and be kind.

416
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,640
Who do I want to teach you? It’s not up to you.

417
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,840
Go away without catching him

418
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,640
Don't be rude

419
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,720
Lord of the castle

420
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,800
Dad, you came just in time

421
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,680
Today is obviously the selection of candidates for the Cuju competition.

422
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,000
The person with this surname knows nothing about Cuju.

423
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,920
Also, he used some nonsensical monkey tricks

424
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,480
By making things difficult for everyone, he is clearly up to no good.

425
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,640
This test is to select elites with strong physiques

426
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,520
undergo rigorous training

427
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,480
This matter has been handed over to Xiang Shaoxia

428
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,880
Of course he has his own sense of proportion

429
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,240
No, dad...

430
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,040
Needless to say, I am not good at learning and do not reflect on myself.

431
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,520
stand aside

432
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,800
Xiang Shaoxia, leave him alone, please continue

433
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,280
Yes, Lord of the castle, Manager Tao

434
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,160
It’s not a good idea to test one by one, let’s do it together

435
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,960
Okay, let’s do it together

436
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:16,720
down, up…

437
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,520
What are the benefits of this thief?

438
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,520
Dad always obeys his words

439
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,520
Last time I gave him Teng Yun Jia Wu San to eat.

440
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,160
He's not afraid even if he's half dead

441
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,600
Looks like I have to teach him a lesson again

442
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,880
Another lesson?

443
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,760
What are you boiling? Do you want to burn me to death? What are you boiling?

444
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,800
Something to drink for you

445
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,240
What? You see me scolding your brother

446
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,760
Do you want to make me some soup to cheer me up?

447
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,680
Why does it taste a little weird?

448
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,080
How dare you, a pervert, to look down on me?

449
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,920
How can I be disrespectful to you? I'm just smelling your scent

450
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,880
You keep calling me a pervert

451
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,080
I never looked down on you

452
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,600
Believe it or not, I am really frivolous towards you

453
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,120
Don’t drink, don’t…

454
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,360
You poisoned?

455
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,120
I don't want to poison you

456
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,360
I just wanted to scare you, I didn't mean to

457
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,840
Are you crazy?

458
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,240
It's you who's crazy, you actually gave me a bag of poison

459
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,480
How is Xiang Shaolong?

460
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,880
I almost poisoned him

461
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,800
I said I wanted to teach him a lesson, not take his life.

462
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,080
Fortunately, it was a dog that died now

463
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,600
Otherwise I would have killed someone in vain

464
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,120
Absolutely impossible, the shopkeeper said that the packet of medicine powder

465
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,640
Only poison can kill rats

466
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,880
People will only feel dizzy and have diarrhea after eating it.

467
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,480
It won't be a big deal

468
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
Now you can make any excuses

469
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,200
The medicine powder is poisonous, if the dosage is wrong

470
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,000
Wouldn't it be better to poison him?

471
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,040
Xiang Shaolong has been rude to you over and over again

472
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,800
Another malicious slander

473
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,880
It's almost a deserved death

474
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,400
I'm sure there must be another conspiracy behind him

475
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,960
Although Xiang Shaolong is hated by others,

476
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,720
But it’s not like he would conspire to harm others.

477
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
Cunning people often pretend to be gentlemen on the surface

478
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,080
But Xiang Shaolong didn’t pretend to be a gentleman

479
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,560
Just always acting like a scoundrel

480
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,800
In short, Xiang Shaolong will not be a good person

481
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,040
He'll just be a villain

482
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,600
You are a swordsman, you cannot use it

483
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,800
Deal with him like a scoundrel

484
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,560
Yes, so next month’s Cuju competition

485
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,080
If he has a role to play

486
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,080
I will definitely discourage him and teach him a lesson

487
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Yes, you must win him

488
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,080
Lest he always feel complacent

489
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,960
My father thinks highly of him now

490
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,000
Ask him to personally train the Fuzhong family generals to cope with the competition

491
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,920
He is so majestic now

492
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,080
The Marquis also appointed me to compete

493
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,680
The team has also won in the past three years under my leadership.

494
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,120
I'm afraid this year will be no exception

495
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,680
When the time comes, I will forward the gifts your Majesty bestows on me to you.

496
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,520
Gifts are secondary, the most important thing is

497
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,480
Xiang Shaolong cannot be allowed to be so powerful and powerful.

498
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,920
You can rest assured that I will not disappoint you

499
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,680
After several days of physical fitness tests

500
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,720
Finally selected the best of you

501
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,600
Receive the following series of rigorous training

502
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,400
The purpose of this training

503
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,640
It’s about exercising everyone’s physical strength

504
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,480
Endurance and resilience

505
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,040
So no matter how hard everyone works, it’s okay

506
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,360
You have to grit your teeth and complete this training.

507
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,920
Only in this way can you become

508
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,240
Do you understand the elites of Wujiabao?

509
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,160
clear

510
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,160
Brother Xiang…

511
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,760
Can we start?

512
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,320
It's time to start

513
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,480
wait a minute

514
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,120
What are you waiting for? Just right

515
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,080
Go back and get something delicious. I'm very thirsty.

516
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,680
Name, please stop talking.

517
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,320
You are still talking nonsense

518
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,360
This time my dad specially asked us to come to the training

519
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,200
Yes, this is what the master meant

520
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,480
Okay, but their physical fitness is poor

521
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,760
I think they'll faint after doing it for a while

522
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,560
If I really faint later and I fall asleep again

523
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,040
You must not wake me up

524
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,360
If you faint, I won’t faint either.

525
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,640
Everyone, hurry up... pick up your spirits and hurry up

526
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,760
Are you asked to pretend to be An An and Jia Jia from Ocean Park?

527
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,040
Does this count as possession?

528
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,880
I'm in control of the ball now

529
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,000
If you can grab the ball, you're qualified. Come on

530
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,760
Then here I come

531
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,160
It would be bad for you if I lay on the ground

532
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,680
If you pretend to be seriously injured, the football team will give you a red card and expel you from the game.

533
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,720
lewd thief

534
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,120
What a pervert, of course there will be collisions when playing ball

535
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,440
You are a girl and you also play ball

536
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,240
If you can't do it, go home and carve flowers.

537
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,240
Don't be so high-spirited, I never admit defeat.

538
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,680
You are bound to lose

539
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Do you dare to look down on me? Do you dare to bet with me?

540
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,600
What to bet on?

541
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,880
Just give me a question

542
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,000
If I can't do it, I lose

543
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,960
But if I could do it...

544
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,680
I'm willing to do anything you can do

545
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,600
I am willing to be a pig or a dog

546
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,480
Of course

547
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,880
It’s a deal

548
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,040
OK

549
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,880
Wujiabao Cuju team is fully trained by Xiang Shaolong

550
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,200
His training is quite strange

551
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,120
I just walk over mountains and rivers every day to practice my strength.

552
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,200
do some unnecessary actions

553
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,360
But I have never been to a Cuju venue.

554
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,640
The origin of Xiang Shaolong is unknown

555
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,360
The behavior is quite strange

556
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,880
But every time, it seems that I come towards Mr. Hou.

557
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,880
First there was the hatred of seizing the jade

558
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,440
The assassin who broke into the Proton Mansion last night might also be him.

559
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,120
If this person is not eliminated for one day, he will become a serious problem

560
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,640
This person must be killed first and then quickly

561
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,320
It's not difficult to kill someone

562
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,440
Instead, I found one

563
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,480
It is difficult to retain talents for your own use

564
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,360
Does the Marquis want to take him for his own use?

565
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,360
Wu Yingyuan thinks so highly of Xiang Shaolong

566
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,280
He must have some skills

567
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,240
Moreover, the Cuju competition has not yet been held.

568
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,240
I really want to know about this competition

569
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,200
Is Xiang Shaolong the winner, or is it you?

570
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,120
To deal with this person, there is no need to rush

571
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,320
Wearing heavy makeup, are you going on a date?

572
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,880
Don't pretend to be angry and walk away

573
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,240
It seems like you won’t go to the training ground even if you’re wearing heavy makeup.

574
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,560
Don't forget that I asked you to compete today

575
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,920
I have important matters to go out today, so I have to suspend practice.

576
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,320
It doesn't matter. If you lose, you'll do whatever you want.

577
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,880
Then I need to think about what to do first.

578
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,560
I’m afraid you will be the one who is willing to do anything even if you lose.

579
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,040
I really don’t understand women

580
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,640
Knowing that Lian Jin is a pervert, he still throws himself into his arms

581
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,880
Sure enough it's here

582
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,760
Tingfang

583
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,800
I had already guessed that the princess must have come here to enjoy the scenery.

584
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,600
Even birds can flutter their wings and fly freely

585
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,840
It's really better to be a bird than a princess

586
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,160
Tingfang, you always want to tease others

587
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,920
In this case, Fang'er will no longer enter the palace

588
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,280
So as not to annoy the princess

589
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,480
Don't, even you won't come to the palace to visit Qian'er

590
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,040
Qian'er will be even more depressed

591
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,520
It's better to be annoyed than to be alone and do nothing

592
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,160
Sighed

593
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,400
Tingfang, are you happy these days?

594
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,720
There is nothing to be happy about, but there are many things to be angry about.

595
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,200
Are you annoyed by that lewd thief again?

596
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,520
Who else is there besides the lewd thief? Look...

597
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,520
Why are your hands blue and purple?

598
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,000
This is also a gift from the adulterer

599
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,320
He came up with a lot of weird and weird stuff

600
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,440
Although it is said that the trainer will play Cuju

601
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,520
Also, let Fang'er show it to you

602
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,720
More than just one piece of green, one piece of purple

603
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,400
you see

604
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,920
Originally I planned to tease him, but he teased me instead

605
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,000
Miss

606
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,840
This is what I carefully researched

607
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,240
Super invincible white mouse hell style training method

608
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,240
This is also where I made a bet with you

609
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,480
If you can within the time limit of the funnel

610
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,040
Completed all specified actions

611
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,920
This counts as you winning, otherwise I lose.

612
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,520
Do you understand how to play?

613
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,240
I see you don’t understand anymore, let’s start

614
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,960
What did you do? Did you not eat?

615
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,240
Even slower than last time

616
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,840
Doesn’t this count as not eating? It’s a good job

617
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,800
How's it going? Do you have the confidence to do it?

618
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,320
If you can do it, you win

619
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,680
start

620
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,240
Miss, are you okay?

621
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,200
Miss, are you okay?

622
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,080
Miss, you can join the Moscow Circus

623
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,520
The hourglass moves very quickly

624
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,880
It's impossible to do it

625
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,760
It leaks quickly? Mr. Tao, please replace it with rocks tomorrow.

626
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,880
stone?

627
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,800
Xiang Shaolong, don’t be arrogant

628
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,520
I, Wu Tingfang, will definitely do it

629
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,440
Fang'er, why do I come to see you every time lately?

630
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,840
All the generals in Wujiabao News said you are not available.

631
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,640
Did Mr. Wu stop you from seeing me?

632
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,120
Dad didn't stop him, he just kept coming for days

633
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,720
Fang'er practices Cuju with her elder brother and others.

634
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,560
Are you practicing Cuju as a daughter?

635
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,440
Cuju can exercise your body

636
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,440
Since my daughter’s family can practice swordsmanship

637
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,640
Why can’t I practice Cuju?

638
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,200
Of course. Don’t you want to practice sword practice again recently?

639
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,080
No, let me win and be willing to be punished before practicing sword practice

640
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,600
Willing to be punished for betting?

641
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,680
I just made a bet with that pervert

642
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,800
By the way, Brother Lian, you are looking for Fang'er today

643
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,240
You say there is something very important, but what is it about?

644
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,960
I remember you said last time

645
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,080
Your sword is too heavy, I want a lighter one

646
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,040
I've asked a blacksmith to make one for you

647
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,520
Sorry for bothering you

648
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,680
Shall we go to the lake and try the sword?

649
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,000
Let's go another day, Fang'er wants to rest early

650
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,280
We have to practice tomorrow morning, Fang'er said goodbye

651
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,200
Get up so early?

652
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,160
It's getting late, it's already three o'clock in the morning

653
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,920
How can you defeat Zhao Mu and the others if you are so lazy?

654
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,360
It seems like you came prepared today

655
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,120
Let me ask you, is our bet still valid?

656
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,200
Effective, I never lie

657
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,040
Then get ready to be a pig or a dog later.

658
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,120
Are you ready? Miss, let’s start
