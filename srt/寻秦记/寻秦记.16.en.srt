1
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,760
Brother Lian

2
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,080
don't want…

3
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,320
don't want

4
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,600
don't want…

5
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,560
Fang'er

6
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,200
Are you heartbroken? You must be completely ruthless and unjust

7
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,040
Don't look like a cat crying about a mouse

8
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,800
Don’t worry, since Lao got his wish

9
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,360
get what i want to get

10
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,160
I will also teach you the left-handed sword as you wish

11
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,640
Why don't you kneel down to worship me?

12
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,920
Respect the teacher, and the disciples will be taught with an open mind in the future.

13
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,360
Okay, are you willing to be a dog under Lao's feet?

14
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,040
I will teach you to become a dog that can kill people.

15
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,040
Fang'er

16
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,120
Don't come here, you beast.

17
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,640
Fang'er, don't do anything stupid, don't

18
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,320
You were afraid that I would die, why did you betray me?

19
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,840
What I don’t want is Xiang Shaolong

20
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,440
If it weren’t for Xiang Shaolong’s appearance,

21
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,000
You wouldn't be so decisive to me

22
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,640
I can't lose you

23
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,520
I must become my master and learn his left-hand sword technique

24
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,200
I don’t want to be a loser anymore

25
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,080
You beast

26
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,840
In order to learn the left-handed sword, you actually took Fang'er...

27
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,280
You are more despicable and shameless than Lao Ai

28
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,680
I know that I will die under the spring today

29
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,520
will never forgive you

30
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,960
don't want

31
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,080
Xiang Shaolong, I will never let you go

32
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,240
Come in

33
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,040
Shaolong, something is not good.

34
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,080
What's up?

35
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,000
I learned from Lord Xinling this morning that King Zhao issued an edict

36
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,000
The prince of Wei and the princess are scheduled to get married the day after tomorrow

37
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,240
the day after tomorrow

38
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,560
Prince Wei coveted the beauty of the princess

39
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,160
Of course, I have to be eager to hug the beauty back.

40
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,040
No, I need to find an opportunity as soon as possible

41
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,960
Go to Lord Longyang and steal the Secret Records of Duke Lu back.

42
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,800
Absolutely not, after the last battle at Waterside Pavilion

43
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,520
Lord Xinling has already suspected the person who stole the secret record

44
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,520
The secret record has been hidden in Shuixie

45
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,800
He has secretly sent people to monitor the area around the waterside pavilion

46
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,160
The slightest movement will alert the snake.

47
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,000
What else to do?

48
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,000
Even if you know the danger, you still have to give it a try

49
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,520
Lu Gong’s secret records are so important

50
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,880
Why don’t I want to get Lu Gong’s secret records?

51
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,400
What I mean is that I want to help you steal the secret record.

52
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,320
By the way, Long Yangjun sent someone to send you an invitation this morning.

53
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,640
I can't understand what he wrote, please help me read it

54
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,360
Long Yangjun is hosting a banquet at Shuixie at noon today

55
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,840
Inviting talented people to discuss politics, you must be there

56
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,360
The person who presided over the political discussion was Qin Qing

57
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,880
Is Qin Qing the person presiding over the political debate?

58
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,400
Have you met Qin Qing?

59
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,120
Qin Qing is a civilized and talented woman. As soon as she arrived in Daliang City, she

60
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,640
Even the King of Wei had to send word of mouth to receive her.

61
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,080
So amazing, even the King of Wei wanted to see her

62
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,360
Her adoptive father Zou Yan is the current concubine.

63
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,840
Long Yangjun is Zou Yan’s student

64
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,360
I want to ask you a question

65
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,480
That Long Yangjun obviously likes men

66
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,280
Why is Qin Qing always by his side?

67
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,400
What is the relationship between them?

68
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,840
They are brothers and sisters

69
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,400
Miss Qin’s husband died young and she was actually a widow

70
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,920
Widow? Then why do you call her Miss Qin?

71
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,360
It is said that they did not have a wedding on the day they got married.

72
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,400
Her husband was urgently summoned to fight

73
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,920
As a result, he died on the battlefield

74
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,640
Miss Qin became a widow as a virgin

75
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,240
In addition, he is famous for his erudition and talent.

76
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,200
Don't talk about this yet

77
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,240
Where is the political conference you mentioned just now?

78
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,320
waterside pavilion

79
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,000
Isn't this a good opportunity?

80
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,800
I'll go with you so that I can be taken care of

81
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,120
Mr. Zou, today’s political discussion banquet

82
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,520
There must be dignitaries and celebrities gathering again

83
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,240
Thank you for your appreciation

84
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,720
Mr. Li Yuan is an important minister of Chu State.

85
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,240
Come from a thousand miles away

86
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,480
It is actually an honor for Zou and his goddaughter

87
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,120
Mr. Li has always admired Miss Qin’s beauty and talent.

88
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,080
Wherever Miss Qin goes

89
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,000
Mr. Li must be with me everywhere.

90
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,440
A graceful lady, a gentleman is a good man

91
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,320
What's more, with Miss Qin's talent, she is not only pretty but also

92
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,680
Li has the qualities of a gentleman, so why not?

93
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,920
What Mr. Li said is true

94
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,000
Why doesn’t Miss Qin come out?

95
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,240
Not all guests have arrived yet

96
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,680
Goddaughter is still painting in the room

97
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,760
What about Long Yangjun, the owner of the waterside pavilion?

98
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,840
Your Majesty goes out to welcome distinguished guests.

99
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,720
What kind of distinguished guest? I want Mr. Long Yang to greet him personally.

100
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,440
Distinguished guests have arrived…

101
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,920
My mentor has already met Brother Xiang

102
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,400
This is King Zhao’s sister, Mrs. Ya

103
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,600
Lady Ya

104
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,320
This is Xiang Shaolong, the general of Zhao State’s marriage ceremony.

105
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,560
It seems that Brother Xiang is a martial artist

106
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,080
It is unknown whether he is as talented as Brother Han Chuang in both civil and military skills.

107
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,600
If you are only good at swordsmanship

108
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Today’s political banquet

109
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,200
I'm afraid it may not be suitable for Brother Xiang.

110
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Long Yangjun is the master

111
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,880
He must have a reason for inviting me here

112
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,240
Mr. Xinling arrives

113
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Someone came unexpectedly

114
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,640
Long Yangjun held a political discussion banquet today

115
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,000
I have come to listen to politics with an open mind.

116
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,280
Long Yangjun always treats guests with courtesy

117
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,440
I'm sure you won't shut me out.

118
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,360
I thought Lord Xinling was only used to studying political tactics

119
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,840
It turns out that I also wanted to listen to politics. It’s really disrespectful.

120
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
But today we are meeting friends through literature

121
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,760
Attendees must remove their swords before entering

122
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,400
Still don’t understand the sword

123
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,640
Subordinates obey orders

124
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,320
General Xiang, I didn’t expect you to have more dignity than me.

125
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,600
Come here at the invitation of Lord Long Yang

126
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,400
You can't say that

127
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,160
I am not the only one who has face today

128
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,200
Mr. Han and Mr. Li have arrived.

129
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,280
Mr. Han really appreciated me

130
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,560
This is Mr. Han Fei from South Korea

131
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,400
Nice to meet you…

132
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,000
Are you Han Fei from South Korea?

133
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,960
It's the one who brought together the Legalists in Dacheng

134
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,640
Han once worshiped Xunzi and respected the rule of law

135
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,880
I don’t dare to say that I can collect all the achievements.

136
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,320
This is Han’s classmate Li Si

137
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,960
It seems that Brother Han Fei takes good care of his classmates.

138
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,880
Aren't you in Qin? Why are you here in Wei?

139
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,000
You must have mistakenly admitted someone as your subordinate

140
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,920
Li has never been to Qin

141
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,080
Come this time

142
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,200
He followed Brother Han from South Korea to the State of Wei to borrow grain.

143
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,800
Listen to and discuss politics

144
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,440
Your Majesty, Mr. Zou, Miss Qin, please take your seats.

145
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,840
Please... everyone please

146
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,320
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

147
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,680
Mr. Han, Mr. Li, please, please

148
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
Brother Li Yuan and Brother Han Chuang, please

149
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,120
Both of you please

150
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,000
Mr. Qi and Mr. Jin, please

151
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,040
Mr. Long Yang, you don’t have to be polite.

152
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,440
Since I humbly listen to politics, I am willing to accompany you to the last seat

153
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,880
Everyone is polite

154
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,600
Miss Qin is polite...

155
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,320
Everyone, please take a seat

156
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,920
General Xiang is here too

157
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,480
Yes, Miss Qin, you are polite...

158
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,280
Mr. Han Fei also came to show his appreciation.

159
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,040
I just read the masterpiece "Speaking of Difficulties"

160
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,760
It mentions the use of methods, techniques, and momentum

161
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,880
The theory of governing the country by combining it is extremely innovative

162
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,880
It fits perfectly with the topic of how we govern our country today.

163
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,320
Miss Qin is too praised

164
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,160
Based on Mr. Han’s knowledge,

165
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,200
It should be highly used in Korea

166
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,840
Why is the young master so depressed in your country?

167
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,600
Prince Li Yuan was an important official of the Chu State.

168
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,440
Of course, I don’t understand what it means to show talent without appreciating it.

169
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,280
Mr. Han is a scholar who wrote books and established theories.

170
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,480
With this young man...

171
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,720
Your talent is incomparable

172
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,920
It's wrong of you to say that. What kind of young master?

173
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,840
Li Yuan of Chu State

174
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,960
A wise man can only be useful if he meets a wise master

175
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,000
Shang Yang was also depressed in his own country at that time.

176
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,680
Later I went to Qin and met Qin Xiaogong, which was amazing

177
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,480
A few years of reforms have already produced brilliant results.

178
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,520
Well said

179
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,680
Thanks…

180
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,840
No matter what changes are made, they are all due to favorable circumstances.

181
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,320
You can never escape from metal, wood, water, fire and earth

182
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,240
The Five Virtues of Luck Control

183
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,120
Only by fully understanding the principle that the five virtues are mutually reinforcing and restraining each other

184
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,160
Only then can we grasp the movement of heaven

185
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,480
Mr. Zou’s statement is too vague and too mysterious.

186
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,560
It’s because our understanding is limited

187
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,920
If one could steal the way of heaven and predict the strategy of governing the country

188
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,400
There is no need to waste time making random guesses.

189
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,920
Confucius said that people and affairs are unknown, but one knows the destiny of heaven.

190
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,920
Now a hundred schools of thought contend

191
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,800
The way to govern a country is nothing more than the rule of law and the rule of virtue

192
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,040
and the battle over inaction

193
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Governance by inaction will lead to chaos in the world

194
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,920
Therefore, it has never been adopted by those in power.

195
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,400
Human nature is evil

196
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,600
Governance by virtue is just an ideal and will not work

197
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,040
i support you

198
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,560
I support your method of governing the country by law

199
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,680
Otherwise, how will Qin unify the six countries in the future?

200
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,440
Why is General Xiang so sure?

201
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,800
If Qin adopts the rule of law, will it be able to unify the six countries?

202
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,400
Do you know how to predict the future?

203
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,000
I just guess

204
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,000
What basis does General Xiang have for making such an inference?

205
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,000
Guessing without justification

206
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,200
But the people of Qin like to practice martial arts so much

207
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,720
And the laws in the military are good

208
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,240
If Qin had a good law

209
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,640
Let the people follow it

210
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,880
I believe that Qin will be as rich as any other country in the future

211
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,680
Slowly we will be able to unify the six countries

212
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,040
If a country is maintained only by punishment

213
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,080
How can General Xiang ensure that

214
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,760
Those in power will not use punishment to oppress the people.

215
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,440
There is a saying in Confucianism that if good etiquette is good, then the people will not dare to be disrespectful.

216
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,520
If you love justice, the people will not dare to disobey

217
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,520
If you have good faith, the people will not dare to be without mercy

218
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,520
This is the way to be king

219
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,840
If the punishment is good, the people will become aggressive.

220
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,120
Isn't it bad?

221
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,480
This situation is because the rule of law is not clear

222
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,640
If the king breaks the law, he is equally guilty as the common people

223
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,400
You can no longer exercise power

224
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,920
It doesn't make sense, it's possible to say something like this

225
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,360
How audacious

226
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,040
The king is guilty of the same crime as the common people

227
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,960
General Xiang’s views are bolder than those of Han

228
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,680
The supremacy of kingship has existed since ancient times

229
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,080
I'm afraid General Xiang's argument is unrealistic.

230
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,400
Utopian

231
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,040
It’s not surprising that you think so

232
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,800
Because your vision has not yet jumped out of this era

233
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,400
What is this era?

234
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,160
Miss Qin, do you have paper and pen? You take...

235
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,880
There was no paper in your time

236
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,800
Just take out a piece of white cloth

237
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,720
Let’s take a look at who this painting is.

238
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,960
She is an old woman with Western ancestry.

239
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,880
It’s not simple, it can also be seen as a young girl

240
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,040
She's obviously an old woman

241
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,280
Why is she a young girl?

242
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,440
At first glance, she is indeed an old woman.

243
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
But when we cover part

244
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,000
It can also be seen as a young girl

245
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,080
Yes, this experiment is enough to prove

246
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,600
See different results from different perspectives

247
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,680
In fact, the way to govern a country is the same as this principle

248
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,760
Is it better to rule by law or by virtue?

249
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,200
Either way is better

250
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,840
I think practice is the best proof

251
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,080
Wonderful, General Xiang illustrates with interesting portraits

252
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,400
Really unique

253
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:00,960
Thanks

254
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,800
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

255
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,080
We've been talking for so long, why don't we have some drinks first?

256
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,440
good…

257
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,400
Don't stay in Korea

258
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,640
You have no chance of success in Korea

259
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,400
Go to the State of Qin. You can develop your talents if you go to the State of Qin.

260
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,040
Do you remember what I said today

261
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,960
Wei Mou is missing

262
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,320
In today's political debate, General Xiang is outstanding in eloquence

263
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,800
I'd like to toast General Xiang. Cheers, everyone.

264
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,080
good

265
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,280
Sorry, I got wet. Go out and wipe it off.

266
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,040
Someone coming

267
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,760
No, I'll do it myself

268
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,800
I'm so happy today, I want to invite Miss Qin

269
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,440
Would you like to play a song for us?

270
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,160
Okay, get the piano ready

271
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,840
Wait a minute

272
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,600
Qin girl, I want to give you a thousand-year-old Guqin

273
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,760
I’m so happy today, so happy…

274
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,200
Miss Qin's piano skills are certainly at their peak

275
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,600
But the guqin that Li gave to Miss Qin

276
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,400
Made from trees that are thousands of years old

277
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,360
It can be said that they complement each other

278
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,440
The sound of this piano is indeed rich and open.

279
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,800
Really rare

280
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,880
I'm just afraid that I can't bear Mr. Li's generous gift.

281
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,520
Miss Qin, you don’t have to refuse.

282
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,480
This guqin is only suitable for piano girls to play

283
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,040
If you don’t introduce Li as a close friend

284
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,320
I can only imitate Boya and break the harp

285
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,840
You're such a childish Qin... what's your name?

286
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,880
Li Yuan of Chu State

287
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,040
Li Yuan, you don’t need to be so exaggerated.

288
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,000
What is outrageous?

289
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,640
Outrageous is my country dialect

290
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,000
That is, if someone says that your piano playing is out of tune, it is outrageous.

291
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,080
I think your piano is only ten years old at most.

292
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
How can there be thousands of years?

293
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,200
General Xiang, if you don’t understand, don’t talk nonsense.

294
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,160
General Xiang's words must be justified

295
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,280
I also want to know how to know the age of a tree

296
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,120
I also asked Mr. Xiang for advice.

297
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,840
Long Yangjun, when I came in just now

298
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,600
I see your garden looks like a forest

299
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,440
I don't know if you mind

300
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,800
Let me cut down one or two trees for an experiment.

301
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,680
What's the big deal about just two trees?

302
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,200
Okay, everyone please go out and watch me do this experiment.

303
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,200
Okay, everyone please

304
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,280
Mrs. Ya, you also go out and join in the fun.

305
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,400
I have heard a lot of General Xiang’s novel arguments.

306
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,000
I don’t think it’s strange anymore

307
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,800
I'd rather have a drink here

308
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,600
Okay, please

309
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,160
Error 504 (Server Error)!!1504.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

310
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,440
Approximately how long has this tree been planted?

311
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,720
Planted about eight years ago

312
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,840
Please see, everyone, actually every tree has growth rings

313
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,840
This tree has eight circles, which means it has been planted for eight years

314
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
It’s very consistent with what Long Yangjun said.

315
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,600
It can be seen that the age of a tree can be calculated using its annual rings.

316
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,720
Mr. Li's guqin only has twenty circles.

317
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,560
In other words, it’s just a twenty-year-old tree

318
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,520
Not some thousand-year-old tree

319
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,560
That's right

320
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,040
Coincidence is not enough to prove that the tree has growth rings

321
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,200
What young man?

322
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,400
Li Yuan of Chu State

323
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,840
if you don't believe

324
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,400
I'll cut down another tree to prove it to you.

325
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,040
Fifty-three, fifty-four, fifty-five

326
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,440
Sure enough, it’s fifty-five circles.

327
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,960
It is consistent with the fifty-five-year-old Long Yangjun mentioned just now.

328
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,120
Prove that the age of a tree can be calculated

329
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,560
I bought this Guqin at a high price.

330
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,200
I didn’t expect that the other party would actually deceive me.

331
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,240
Said to be made from thousand-year-old trees

332
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,640
Miss Qin, please don’t be offended.

333
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,720
Li will look for a good piano for you next time

334
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,320
Mr. Li’s thoughts are understood by Qin Qing

335
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,040
In fact, is this piano made of thousand-year-old wood?

336
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,560
Qin Qing doesn't care

337
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,560
On the contrary, every time General Xiang comes up with something new,

338
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,520
Proposed to use growth rings to calculate age

339
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,440
It's really impressive

340
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,080
Miss Qin Qing

341
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Madam Ya, you missed the wonderful verification just now.

342
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,000
Miss Qinqing, I'm so sorry

343
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,960
The servants are greedy for wine and want to leave first.

344
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,880
Madam Ya, why don't you let me take you back home?

345
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,880
No, I'll just take her back

346
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,840
Everyone, let's go first

347
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,920
They left and we continued drinking

348
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,520
OK please

349
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,600
Your Majesty, what should we do now?

350
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,600
This would have been a great opportunity to retrieve the secret records

351
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,720
But you failed miserably

352
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,560
Your Majesty, that masked man's martial arts skills are extraordinary.

353
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,360
It's so new and strange that my subordinates will miss it for a moment.

354
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,120
I believe that the masked man has taken away the secret record

355
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,720
Now how do I find this person?

356
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,360
This person can enter and exit the waterside pavilion

357
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,320
Probably one of the attendees at the political discussion banquet

358
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,680
Your Majesty, have you noticed who has left the table?

359
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,040
Xiang Shaolong

360
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,600
he?

361
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,440
When your superiors and subordinates are fighting each other,

362
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,160
I once tore off a piece of his clothes

363
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,640
That's right, it's Xiang Shaolong

364
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,080
He once spilled wine on his robe

365
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,040
This dress also smells of alcohol

366
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,120
Why didn't he leave immediately after stealing the secret book?

367
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,600
Why is he sawing trees to check the growth rings?

368
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,120
Turns out it was to divert everyone’s attention

369
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,920
Mrs. Ya once lived alone

370
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,560
She's the one who took the stolen goods

371
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,440
Please give instructions

372
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,800
Immediately send people to search Daliang City

373
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,440
You lead people to chase you out of the city at the same time

374
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,400
The hunt for Xiang Shaolong and Mrs. Ya is back

375
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,320
Subordinates obey orders

376
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,600
See your Majesty

377
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,000
Go Yes

378
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,560
Have you collected the secret records?

379
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,880
Here, you can rest assured

380
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,840
Why hasn't the princess come for so long?

381
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,160
We have agreed to wait here until the end of time

382
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,840
She will definitely come unless something unexpected happens

383
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
General Xiang, something bad is going on.

384
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,160
The princess has been taken into the palace by King Wei.

385
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,960
What? How could this happen?

386
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,680
Prince Wei is eager to marry the princess

387
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,640
So I ask the King of Wei for permission to get married tomorrow in advance.

388
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,240
When we were about to take away the princess

389
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,560
It's too late

390
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,400
Shaolong, what should we do?

391
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,880
We can't leave the princess alone

392
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,960
I know

393
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,720
General Xiang please don’t take risks

394
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,160
when we were leaving town

395
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,040
The people who saw Lord Xinling searched the city everywhere.

396
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,720
Wei Mou also brought people out of the city

397
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,520
To capture the general and his wife

398
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,560
Madam, you will be escorted by your family to leave first.

399
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,400
when we come

400
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,840
Didn’t we pass a place called Baimapo along the way?

401
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,440
If tomorrow morning

402
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,120
If you don’t see the princess and I come back yet,

403
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,560
Just go back to Zhao State by yourself first

404
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,920
You go back to Daliang alone to save the princess

405
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,080
I promised the princess that I would not abandon her

406
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
I must go back to save her

407
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,240
General Xiang, let's fight back together

408
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,120
No, the other side has more people and strength.

409
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,320
If more of us go back, things will get messy.

410
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
I can go back alone

411
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,600
If you take the secret record with you and go back to save people, I'm afraid it will be a mistake.

412
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,640
Why don't you give me the secret record and take it away first?

413
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,920
That's fine, but you have to remember

414
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,040
Secret records are very important to us

415
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,200
Don't make any mistakes

416
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,760
I'm leaving first, take care of yourself

417
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,560
Princess, the prince is destined

418
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,400
The princess is not allowed to leave the bedroom

419
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,280
Don't be rude to the princess Yes

420
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,000
princess please

421
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,760
All out is...

422
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,440
Prince, you and I have not been married for a day

423
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,760
You can't even come in

424
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,000
Princess, since you came to Daliang

425
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,720
I think of you day and night

426
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,600
I wish I could get married to you right away

427
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,120
Prince, please follow the etiquette and go out.

428
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,640
Understand, I am also a knowledgeable person

429
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,200
Princess, let's have a glass of wine first to cultivate our relationship.

430
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,920
Prince, we haven’t been married for a day

431
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,320
You must not be rude

432
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,080
follow me yes

433
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,920
Princess, after drinking this glass of wine

434
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,800
We are husband and wife

435
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,240
Why do you need to observe any etiquette? Come on

436
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,840
Prince, please leave immediately

437
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,320
Don't know how to praise

438
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,640
don't want…

439
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,920
Walk

440
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,160
Who are you?

441
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,200
it's me

442
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,440
Brother Xiang, I thought I would never see you again.

443
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,200
Let's go

444
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,200
Xiang Shaolong, this is Daliang Palace

445
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,800
You'd better surrender

446
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,440
Otherwise, there is no chance of getting out alive

447
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,240
Bearded man, you talk nonsense

448
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,680
Why don't we have a quick fight?

449
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,480
Look, I'll cut off your head first

450
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,840
Should you chop off my head first?

451
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,240
don't want…

452
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,080
No, why don't you tell him to go away?

453
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,280
Go away, all go away…

454
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,960
Say it again calmly

455
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,880
go away, all go away

456
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,240
back off

457
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,320
Let's go

458
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,000
go away

459
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,880
Bearded man, you are so slow

460
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,960
You all turn around and take ten steps forward

461
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,600
Then shave the big beard

462
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,720
Walk

463
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,160
You two protect the prince, the others chase after me

464
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,600
yes

465
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,080
bring arrows

466
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,320
Chase

467
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,400
How strange that the king invited me to the palace for a banquet

468
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,120
It was to discuss the wedding of the Ming Dynasty prince

469
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,120
I wonder what it has to do with Lord Long Yang?

470
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,480
It is the duty of the royal guards to protect the safety of the palace.

471
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,080
Lord Xinling recommended Xiao Wei Mou to patrol the palace.

472
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,520
And I don’t know what the picture is?

473
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,640
Report to your Majesty, Xiang Shaolong entered the palace and kidnapped the princess

474
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,920
General Xiao is now leading his men to hunt down the two men.

475
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,360
Is that okay?

476
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,960
follow me

477
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,960
Be careful, I'll bandage your wound

478
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,520
Brother Xiang, go alone and ignore me.

479
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,440
No, I can't leave you

480
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,520
Brother Xiang

481
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
You are willing to come to save me, I am already satisfied

482
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,840
Ignore me

483
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,840
I'll only say it once, I won't leave you

484
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,440
How is it? Is there any trace of Xiang Shaolong?

485
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,440
The subordinates followed here and lost sight of the two of them.

486
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,080
Lead people to search other places

487
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,800
He must not be allowed to leave Daliang City

488
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,160
I obey, follow me.

489
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,760
Why don't we divide our troops into two groups to outflank and chase him?

490
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,360
Princess, you have to support me, nothing will happen to you

491
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,080
I would rather die than marry Prince Wei

492
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
The princess will fight to escape from the palace with you

493
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,080
It can be seen that this marriage is not what she wants

494
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,600
Brother Xiang risked his life to save the princess and escaped from the fire pit

495
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,320
I, Lord Longyang, betrayed you

496
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,600
It's just unkind and unjust

497
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,120
Daliang city gate has been sealed

498
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,120
The princess is seriously injured and it is not advisable to venture out of the city for the time being.

499
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,560
Brother Xiang, if you trust me, come with me

500
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,320
Xie Longyangjun, I really don’t know how to thank you

501
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,320
Brother Xiang's words are serious, you are willing to risk your life for the princess

502
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,320
It can be seen that you and the princess are together in life and death, and have a deep friendship.

503
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,800
I also enjoy the beauty of adulthood

504
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,880
Thanks

505
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,960
I hope the princess is okay

506
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,120
Teacher, how is the princess? How is she?

507
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,840
The arrow was inserted too deep, and the princess herself was weak.

508
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,600
If you forcefully pull out the arrow,

509
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,160
I'm afraid the princess will faint and die

510
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,840
But if you don't pull out the arrow

511
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,240
I'm afraid the princess's wound will become filled with pus and fester

512
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,400
Death from illness

513
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,840
It's a pity that there are no painkillers or anesthetics at the moment

514
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,760
Otherwise it wouldn't be so troublesome

515
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,480
Mr. Xiang, what did you say?

516
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,680
Do you have an ancient secret recipe?

517
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,080
You really have nothing to do?

518
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,720
Even my mentor was helpless

519
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,240
Even famous doctors in Daliang don’t have a good prescription

520
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,320
I want to see the princess

521
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,360
Princess

522
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,160
Brother Xiang, it was me who caused you trouble

523
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,080
You'd better leave Daliang as soon as possible

524
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,840
You're so seriously injured and you're still saying things like this

525
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,000
Princess, don't worry

526
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,680
I will definitely find a way to cure you

527
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,480
If you want to leave

528
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,520
I will definitely take you with me

529
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,280
If you don't pull out the arrow again

530
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,760
I'm afraid the princess's life can't be saved

531
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,720
But I'm worried that if I forcefully pull out the arrow, she will bleed.

532
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,760
Brother Xiang, I would rather give it a try

533
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,640
There may be a glimmer of hope

534
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,120
Do you really support it?

535
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,040
With you by my side

536
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,720
I'm not afraid of the pain no matter how great it is.

537
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,880
Mr. Xiang, love is a thing

538
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,120
It can give people a wonderful power

539
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,120
Just let the princess try it

540
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,360
All right

541
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,120
This pot of herbal water is for the princess after pulling out her arrows.

542
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,600
For washing wounds

543
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,480
come over

544
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,920
Bear it, princess

545
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,200
Help the princess up, slow down

546
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,960
careful…

547
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,000
Give it to the princess to bite

548
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,560
Bear it, princess

549
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,240
I count one, two, three, one, two, three

550
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Are you okay, princess?

551
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,920
Brother Xiang, don’t worry, I won’t die

552
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
Mr. Xiang, please step aside first.

553
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,400
I wash the princess's wounds

554
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,200
Hold the wound, be careful

555
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,280
Brother Xiang, how is the princess?

556
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,680
The arrow has been pulled out

557
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,240
I hope the princess’s wound won’t get worse

558
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,480
Your Majesty, Lord Xinling and Wei Mou

559
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,280
Are leading the troops to the waterside pavilion

560
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,120
Go and intercept it. Follow your orders.

561
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,760
Teacher, take General Xiang and Princess to escape

562
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,440
Let students deal with Lord Xinling

563
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,840
Shaolong, fast

564
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,040
Mr. Xinling, please stay.

565
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,400
I have been ordered by the king to capture the traitor.

566
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,840
You dare to stop me

567
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,920
Mr. Xinling, this is my villa.

568
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,040
The place where you captured the rebels and actually captured me

569
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,920
Long Yangjun, was at the political banquet that day

570
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,680
Everyone can see your friendship with Xiang Shaolong

571
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,800
If you really didn’t hide the traitor for your own benefit

572
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,560
Let me go in and search thoroughly to prove my innocence.

573
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,320
Xinlingjun

574
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,480
You and I are equal before the king

575
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,520
Why are you searching my place?

576
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,880
If you insist on refusing my entry and search,

577
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,520
I can only alert the king and let the king make a decision.

578
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,360
OK, just search

579
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,640
If the traitor cannot be found and he is disrespectful to me,

580
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,960
I must play in front of the king

581
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,960
Let’s see how you explain it to the king then

582
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,200
Don't worry, I have my own discretion

583
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,800
Neither you nor I want to alarm the king, so go in and search

584
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,280
Qingmei, please forgive me for disturbing you.

585
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,800
Be bold and reckless

586
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,760
Mr. Xinling, why don’t you go out yet?

587
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,440
Do you want to ruin the reputation of my beautiful sister?

588
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,400
I want you to file an imperial complaint

589
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,520
Miss Qin, excuse me

590
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,160
let's go

591
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,360
they are gone

592
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,960
Are you okay?

593
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,880
Thank you for coming up with this idea

594
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,280
Otherwise we are dead
