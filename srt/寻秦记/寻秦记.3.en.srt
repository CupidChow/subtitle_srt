1
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,960
Yan Ping, since you are here

2
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,760
Why don't you come out to see me?

3
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Senior Brother Yuan

4
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,960
I didn't expect that we would meet again so soon

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,760
Little brother, you and I are just afraid that this will end

6
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,840
It has nothing to do with you here, you go first

7
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,200
Senior, I won’t leave

8
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,440
Since the old timer told you to leave, let's go

9
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,200
If you are afraid, you go first

10
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,600
You don't have to push and pull.

11
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,720
No one can leave here today, kill

12
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,480
Little brother, go quickly

13
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:05,840
This huge order is related to the fate of the Mohists' Guild

14
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,960
You need to help me find a suitable successor

15
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,120
Everyone is dead and should go

16
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,240
Wasn't it you who brought Yan Ping here?

17
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,840
Ask the seniors to teach me martial arts

18
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,000
You just want to delay time

19
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,240
Wait until Yan Ping comes

20
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,120
Just use the old-timer to kill him, right?

21
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,040
Yes, everything is my arrangement

22
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,400
To survive in the arena, the law of the jungle means the strong eat the strong.

23
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,720
Either you die or I die

24
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,000
If you want to avenge Master, kill me

25
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,720
Xiang Shaolong, listen

26
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,080
Without me to lead the way

27
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,480
You can't go to Xianyang

28
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,160
Senior, although you may not regard me as your disciple

29
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,440
But you taught me swordsmanship

30
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,320
In my heart, you will always be my master

31
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,040
Please accept my worship

32
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,800
If I hadn't returned to ancient times

33
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,040
It probably won't kill you.

34
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,520
Don't be so mean

35
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,560
Do we have to go to Xianyang before we move?

36
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,760
Don't turn off your phone, wait a minute, I'm coming

37
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,560
Ah Qing, give me some iced lemon tea

38
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,040
Wait a minute...

39
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,280
take me back...

40
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,240
Xiang Shaolong, we finally succeeded in sending you back.

41
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,840
Our time travel experiment

42
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,000
This time it finally works

43
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,640
Xiang Shaolong, have you really returned to ancient times?

44
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,360
Have you ever met Qin Shihuang?

45
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,200
Is he as smart as me?

46
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Xiang Shaolong

47
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,280
I know you must really want to meet someone

48
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,120
Aqing Shaolong

49
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,320
Shaolong, I am not married to Peter Wong

50
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,920
I've been waiting for you to come back

51
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,200
I miss you so much, you know?

52
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,520
You're not really married to Peter Wong

53
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,160
No, I'm waiting for you to come back

54
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,200
I miss you too

55
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,040
I really want to drink the ice lemon tea you made

56
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,760
I’ll make it for you every day from now on

57
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,360
OK, let's get married

58
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,800
Open the door, why not open the door?

59
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,280
Ah Qing

60
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,840
open the door...

61
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,440
Ah Qing…

62
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,320
Ah Qing…

63
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,280
The sun shines and it rains

64
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,560
Play with me, I can definitely go to Xianyang

65
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,760
I will definitely see Ah Qing

66
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,680
Is there any soap? It’s so comfortable to take a bath

67
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,680
What would you like, sir?

68
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,040
What can I eat with this money?

69
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,120
You can eat three steamed buns and still have one money left.

70
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,160
It's over, penniless, and I'll starve to death sooner or later.

71
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,280
three steamed buns

72
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,080
Boss, how long does it take to get to Handan from here?

73
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,720
It’s not that far away from Handan.

74
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,560
If you ride on horseback, it will take about two or three days.

75
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,960
Boss, if I help you work here

76
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,720
How long does it take to buy a horse?

77
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,640
Can you make steamed buns?

78
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,560
Slaughter sheep and pigs

79
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,280
I'm sorry I can't help you. Thank you.

80
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,480
You should be able to sell your labor, right?

81
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,400
How come?

82
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,320
Isn't it true?

83
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,320
is true

84
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,200
don't want

85
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,880
good…

86
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,320
Coming

87
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,480
Stop touching me, I'm going to beat you up if you touch me again

88
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,680
You three guys only have three dollars

89
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,600
I was asked to take off my clothes in public, and then you were asked to touch me

90
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,800
I'm sending you off before I leave. Go and die.

91
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,440
Uncle, you are here, please sit down...

92
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,760
Three steamed buns, arriving soon

93
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,400
Sir, please use it slowly

94
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,800
I didn't call these, I called them three steamed buns

95
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,920
Enjoy it, uncle

96
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,960
Boss, I don’t have any money to give you.

97
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
An uncle has already paid

98
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,520
Ask me to entertain you well

99
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,920
who?

100
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,440
Sir, please use it slowly...

101
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,320
Who?

102
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,000
Dozens of layers of clothes and uncut hair

103
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,000
It's so frustrating

104
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,440
I beg you not to make a noise

105
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,600
Your voice is so annoying, it keeps making noise

106
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,680
If you were two thousand years from now

107
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,120
It would be great if Happy Valley was born

108
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,760
At least twice a week

109
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,360
There are tens of thousands of people shouting for you

110
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,840
Now you call me, I'll rub myself here

111
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,440
Don't even know why?

112
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,680
There's no soap, it's over, I've been rubbing it like this for three years

113
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,720
What? Have you finished eating? You want me to wipe your mouth?

114
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,920
Be quiet...

115
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,520
Don't wake up Uncle Xiang, you know...

116
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,000
Uncle Xiang, please bear with me.

117
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,520
This little worker didn't understand the rules and woke up Uncle Xiang

118
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,360
It doesn't matter, my feet are numb, don't say anything more

119
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,640
Uncle Xiang, did you sleep well last night?

120
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,240
Okay, look at me like this

121
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,720
I knew it was great

122
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,960
Is this horse for sale?

123
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,440
You said this horse

124
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,440
This horse already belongs to Uncle Xiang

125
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,360
The old man yesterday

126
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,360
Everything has been prepared for Uncle Xiang

127
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,760
Prepare the saddle for Uncle Xiang immediately

128
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Mr. Ma, you and I are really destined and we get along well.

129
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,440
You heard me say so much last night

130
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,720
Let's go on the road together so that you don't tell anyone.

131
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,600
Come on, Brother Ma, it’s third gear, it’s fourth gear

132
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,800
Stifled to death

133
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,000
Show up, sneaky

134
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,840
Brother Xiang once said, I don’t want to see you

135
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,840
What I hate most is seeing people who are blind to money.

136
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,520
Your Excellency is not much better.

137
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,000
If you have backbone

138
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,320
You shouldn't accept favors from your enemies

139
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,240
What you say is so annoying

140
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,960
Don't think you have arranged everything for me

141
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,200
You can atone for your sins

142
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,640
Pay your bills, rent a house, and buy a horse for you

143
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,680
It's just to return half of the reward you deserve.

144
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,280
It's so amazing, I don't want it anymore, I'll give it back to you

145
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,880
If you are so noble,

146
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,400
You should spit out the food you ate last night

147
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,400
Give up this horse and walk back to the blacksmith shop to make blacksmiths.

148
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,640
earn your wages

149
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,440
Don't fool me, I don't believe I will starve to death

150
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,040
Of course I won't starve to death

151
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
But I believe you go to Xianyang City

152
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,920
It was a few years later

153
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
By then the woman you like will be married to someone else

154
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,800
This is the map to Xianyang

155
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,000
As for whether you want it or not, it’s up to you to decide

156
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,480
Survive in this troubled world

157
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,200
There's no use sticking around

158
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,000
Survival of the fittest is the way to survive

159
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,960
Walk

160
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,640
Very good

161
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,360
I'm gray beard

162
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,280
I passed by this place with a group of brothers and it was a pleasure to meet them.

163
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,000
Hello…

164
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,520
Don't go, help me

165
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,880
Thanks

166
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Brother is awesome...

167
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,400
bearded brother

168
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,840
Your riding skills are really amazing

169
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,880
What this brother said is really true

170
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,680
Didn't ask for Gao's name?

171
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,880
Xiang Shaolong

172
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,800
Brother Xiang, it's a pity that I have to drive the horses back to the pasture.

173
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,480
Otherwise, you can have a few drinks with Brother Xiang

174
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,160
That's a pity

175
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,200
See you later

176
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,600
Will see you later…

177
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,560
So majestic

178
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,000
This way is north, this way is west

179
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,040
You have to go through Dongping to reach Handan.

180
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,320
There are no longitude and latitude lines, is that okay?

181
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,600
fight

182
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,520
Isn't he the bearded brother just now?

183
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,760
Miss, go quickly

184
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,160
You bunch of sterile thieves

185
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,600
Must not die well

186
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,000
Okay, leave no one alive, kill them for me

187
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,440
Kill you all...

188
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,640
How unreasonable

189
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,600
If you don't stop, I will bite my tongue and kill myself

190
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,720
don't want

191
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,200
Brother Beard, why don’t you take her back and play slowly?

192
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,280
good

193
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,080
The thief…

194
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,080
You all deserve to die, especially you

195
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,040
If you want to kill, just kill, no need to say more

196
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,560
What fun would it be to kill him?

197
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,920
He hurt so many of us.

198
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,600
Why don't you take him back and torture him slowly? Okay

199
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,880
take him back

200
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,520
let me go...

201
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,800
Brother Xiang, let’s go back to the village to celebrate

202
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,520
Come drink with me...

203
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,480
Drink

204
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,200
Drink more, smile, so happy

205
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:42,960
Cheers everyone, cheers…

206
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,480
Big brothers, hugging each other

207
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,080
There are beauties and delicious food, cheers

208
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,600
How can this be?

209
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,920
The girl gets a bottle of wine, you get a cup

210
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,520
Give you a piece

211
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
OK, give me one

212
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,000
Of course it’s a cheng, I’m happy

213
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,440
Come... drink, drink up... do...

214
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,880
Brother Xiang, if there's nothing important

215
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,320
Stay here for a few more days

216
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,120
If you don't tell me, I plan to stay here for a few days.

217
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,560
Brother, I’m so happy today

218
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,640
Let's have a drink too

219
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,080
Cheers, come

220
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,680
Brother, you look so heroic

221
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,200
Why only drink a small cup?

222
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,400
There is a bottle of wine here, let’s drink from the jar

223
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,640
Drink from a jar? Come on

224
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,440
Interesting. Drink it.

225
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,640
Brothers, let’s have a drink with Brother Xiang too

226
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,160
Okay, do it…

227
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,160
Brothers, I am so happy today

228
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,400
How about we have a good drink with Brother Xiang?

229
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,760
Come, everyone is happy, you're welcome

230
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,680
Bro, are you drunk?

231
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,760
Drunk but not drunk

232
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,360
If you don't get drunk today, you won't get home. I'll drink up the whole place.

233
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,560
OK?

234
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,160
drink…

235
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,640
I have this cup

236
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,840
No, just be happy

237
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,400
I drank the whole meal, so...

238
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,600
Happy, drink drink…

239
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,040
bearded brother

240
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,480
What is the treasure you just snatched back?

241
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,520
Why not take it out and let the brothers open their eyes?

242
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,800
Okay, brother, we also want to broaden our horizons...

243
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,120
Okay, I'll take it out for everyone to enjoy.

244
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,440
OK, come and take a look...

245
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,360
Brother, what is the significance of such a treasure?

246
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,880
It seems to be called He Shibi

247
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,800
Heshibi?

248
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,880
Isn’t it time for the Heshi Bi to be returned to Zhao intact?

249
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,360
How could he be snatched away by his elder brother on the road?

250
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,640
Then I don't know

251
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,960
Brother, why is this jade called He's Bi?

252
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,760
You don’t even know about He Shibi, you’re so out of date.

253
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,680
Listening to your tone, I heard everything in detail

254
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,520
Brother Xiang, I would like to hear the details

255
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,960
Actually, I know a little bit about it

256
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,160
This story happened a long time ago

257
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,400
There is a man named Bian He

258
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,960
Bian He discovered a piece of jade at that time

259
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,240
This piece of jade was not polished at that time.

260
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,160
He gave it to the King of Chu twice

261
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,440
King Chu actually didn’t believe it twice

262
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,280
The last time he ordered his feet to be cut off

263
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,760
How outrageous do you say?

264
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,840
So tragic?

265
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,120
Not tragic anymore

266
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,520
This Bian He did not believe in evil, so in the end...

267
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,480
Please hold it for me, please

268
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,600
But you have to drink it all

269
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,360
When Bian He presented this to King Chu for the last time,

270
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,880
King Chu actually believed it

271
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,240
I also asked someone to cut open this jade

272
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,160
I found that there was really a piece of beautiful jade inside.

273
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,760
This piece of jade is the He's jade that everyone sees.

274
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,240
I see…

275
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,920
It turns out that this piece of jade really has a great background.

276
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,920
Brother, you risk your life to win this jade for others

277
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,480
Just receive fifty taels of remuneration

278
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,960
Really too cheap

279
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,160
What? I only got fifty taels after working so hard to get it.

280
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,640
Otherwise I would be very angry

281
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,560
You must drink to vent your anger, come on, drink

282
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,280
drink…

283
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Five hundred taels is enough.

284
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,840
Okay, I will collect it from him then

285
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,480
Brother Beard, don’t be angry

286
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,080
We must collect enough five hundred taels from him by then

287
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,280
Let's drink this wine and make everyone happy

288
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,960
OK, drink drink…

289
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,680
There’s not only good food and wine tonight

290
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,120
There seems to be a beauty

291
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,600
Yes, that beauty we just snatched back

292
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
take her out

293
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,240
OK, take her out... OK

294
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,200
Brother Xiang, who can throw the arrow into the wine pot?

295
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,040
The beauty belongs to him

296
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,920
So simple?

297
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,720
But I think

298
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,520
The mouth of the pot is so big and placed so close

299
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,760
Even a blind man can put it in, why not change it?

300
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,840
Change to another one…

301
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,920
This is almost enough, the mouth of the pot is just right

302
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,680
Put it further away, where should I put it? Put it...

303
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,120
Might as well put it here

304
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,840
Put it here, that's it

305
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,360
Brother Xiang, I will definitely miss it from such a distance.

306
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,560
Are you sure you won't win?

307
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,880
If you don't win, you automatically give up, so you don't have to throw.

308
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,200
start

309
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,120
Come…

310
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,520
Go, next person

311
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,360
OK, not successful…

312
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,880
You just bought me a drink, I'll give you one more

313
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,200
good

314
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,840
So awesome

315
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,960
I won, Brother Xiang, I won

316
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,280
Brother, hit

317
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,240
Didn't you just say that it's difficult and far to throw, and the mouth of the pot is narrow?

318
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,520
How do you hit it with one throw?

319
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,200
I don't know why either

320
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
Beauty, you belong to me tonight

321
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,360
What tonight?

322
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,880
Can't you see? I haven't thrown it yet

323
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,240
you throw

324
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:34,520
I don’t know if it’s possible? It’s so far…

325
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,960
Put the wine bottle away

326
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,640
No need...you put it away and I'll throw it harder

327
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,560
How to throw? Such a small spout

328
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,760
This time I brought it upon myself

329
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,240
Brother Xiang, you've crossed the line.

330
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,640
Have you crossed the line? I'm so sorry.

331
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,760
hurry up

332
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,000
Brother Xiang, do you want to throw or not?

333
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,440
If you don't throw, you abstain.

334
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,200
I'm exchanging feelings with the jug

335
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,560
Is there a limited time to throw now?

336
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,320
I'll get it tomorrow morning and you'll have to wait too

337
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,520
Why don't you go have breakfast first?

338
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,280
It's great to use the tail end

339
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,280
Amazing skills

340
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,760
Brother Xiang is awesome. I won.

341
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,600
I won, thank you…

342
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,120
Brother Xiang is indeed very skilled

343
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,840
Beauty is yours

344
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,880
I'm so sorry, girl.

345
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,600
I have no choice but to hurry up, okay...

346
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,480
I'm leaving first, brother Xiang is awesome

347
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,160
Great, so happy

348
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,640
Don't make any noise

349
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,520
You are so heavy, close the door

350
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,240
frowning

351
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,560
Don't move, I'll help you untie the rope and let go...

352
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,480
What are you yelling for? Stop making noise...

353
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,160
You are a thief who is worse than a scumbag

354
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,440
Stealing people's property, raping women and children

355
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,400
Destined to be struck by thunder from heaven

356
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,400
The wilderness of violent corpses, dead bodies without intact bodies, no descendants or descendants

357
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,360
Are you done?

358
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,720
You stinky bitch is so articulate.

359
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,480
No need to spit, right?

360
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,000
You pervert, how dare you be rude

361
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,280
This girl will bite her tongue and commit suicide immediately

362
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,840
You're such a tongue-tied woman, your tongue is ten feet long

363
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,360
Even if I bite ten times, I still can’t finish it.

364
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,280
Don't move

365
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,280
Let go...don't move, let me help you...

366
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,160
If you are rude again, I will exterminate your children and grandchildren.

367
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,560
Absolute sons and great grandchildren

368
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,600
I really want to see how you can make me have no children or grandchildren.

369
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,840
It hurts and bites

370
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,440
If I don't kill you, you slut

371
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,800
It’s hard to express the anger in this girl’s heart

372
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,800
It's safer to hold a sword

373
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,720
count you lucky

374
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,320
No need to be so vigorous

375
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,080
Manager Tao

376
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,480
Miss

377
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,840
It’s no use, leave the dangerous area quickly and return to Wujiapu

378
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,960
Let's go together

379
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,840
you listen to me

380
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,040
Leave the dangerous area and report back to Wujiapu

381
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,800
Those bandits will definitely kill you

382
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,120
Fang'er can't leave without paying attention

383
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,520
My life is a small matter, but He's Bi is of great importance.

384
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,360
It is related to the future destiny of Qin State

385
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,440
Mr. Tao won’t leave, and neither will Fang’er.

386
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,440
Miss, it's a big deal

387
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,760
What are you doing? Don't mess around

388
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,320
beauty

389
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,880
So you are really here

390
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,040
you are so cunning

391
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,840
Knock me out while I'm taking off my pants

392
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,400
You really don't know how to appreciate it

393
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,440
Brother Xiang, execute him on the spot

394
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,440
It’s better to rectify the Fa on the spot

395
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,320
Anyway, there are cages and chains here

396
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,560
Come on then

397
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,800
let go

398
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,400
I really don’t know what to say, and it spoils our fun.

399
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Miss

400
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,840
The more the woman is beaten, the more obedient she becomes.

401
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,200
Brother Xiang, why not rectify the law on the spot?

402
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,320
OK

403
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
I wonder if you two are interested? You go first.

404
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,680
OK No

405
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:17,080
Can you walk? If you can walk, come with me. Come on

406
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,760
someone

407
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,760
May I ask your surname?

408
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,000
Xiang Shaolong

409
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,520
Brother Xiang, why do you understand that you were the accomplice of a tiger before?

410
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,240
Now I have to save Tao again

411
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,840
Because Brother Beard helped me catch that horse before

412
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,480
I saw him fighting with you, so I planned to help him.

413
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,800
Helping out? What is helping out?

414
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,120
In short, he did bad things with good intentions before.

415
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,120
Now make up for it

416
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,120
That's it. Stop talking and let's go.

417
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,880
Brother Xiang, Tao has a merciless request.

418
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,800
What's up?

419
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,320
I hope Brother Xiang

420
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,000
You can escort the eldest lady back to Wujiapu to report the news.

421
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,760
What about you?

422
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,120
I must go to the cottage once

423
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,640
You have been injured. If you go back, you will die.

424
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,280
No, I must take back He's Bi

425
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,000
Heshibi is important, but your life is also important

426
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,200
Tell the truth

427
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,280
The Wu family was entrusted by Prime Minister Lu of Qin State

428
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,960
Bring He's Bi back to the State of Zhao

429
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,920
In order to exchange for returning to the prince government and returning to the country

430
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,520
Huang Zizheng? Isn’t Huang Zizheng the same as Ying Zheng?

431
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,160
Is he still a hostage in Zhao State?

432
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,920
The matter is of great importance. Tao really cannot miss this important matter.

433
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,720
The eldest lady is going to leave it to you.

434
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,520
Ying Zheng is still in Xianyang, and I can't return to Hong Kong.

435
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,720
Brother Xiang said that Tao really didn’t know why

436
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,520
Okay... Anyway, you take care of her

437
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,440
I'll help you go back to the village to get He's Bi

438
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,880
Brother Xiang is so brave, Tao is really grateful

439
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,360
but…

440
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
Nothing better

441
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,920
I'm waiting for your good news in Changting Town ahead.

442
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,480
He's Bi depends entirely on you.

443
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,680
careful

444
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,240
It is indeed a unique treasure

445
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Thank you for your appreciation, uncle

446
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,080
The remuneration was changed from fifty taels to five hundred taels.

447
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,120
This treasure is priceless

448
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,120
Five hundred taels is definitely not expensive

449
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,200
Five hundred taels is not expensive at all

450
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,440
Will all Wushi’s generals be killed?

451
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,880
I originally arrested a man named Tao

452
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,280
It's a pity that he was rescued

453
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,800
Did Wujiapu send someone to rescue him?

454
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,800
No

455
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,920
Hui was rescued by a random friend.

456
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,880
Not friends at all, even the beauty was saved

457
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,880
It should be the eldest lady of the Wu family

458
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,640
Why is the eldest daughter of the Wu family here?

459
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,720
She disguised herself as a man and joined the team

460
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,240
When catching her

461
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,160
It seems like someone called her some kind of eldest lady

462
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,600
She is indeed a stunning beauty

463
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,000
The uncle will also be moved when he sees it

464
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,360
The three of them won't go far without riding horses

465
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,760
Should be able to catch up

466
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,400
No need, get your reward first

467
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,440
Anyone who offends Miss Wu family

468
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,560
There is only one way to die

469
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,560
Manager Tao

470
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,800
Don't keep claiming to call him Brother Xiang

471
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,560
He's basically a thief

472
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,840
Brother Xiang was misbehaving with the eldest lady in the village

473
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,560
It's an expedient measure

474
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,440
You still defend him, if he hadn't helped those horse thieves

475
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,360
There's no way we'd end up like this

476
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,040
He just hit it by mistake

477
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,040
Hit by accident

478
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,160
He looks like a thief and has a thief heart. He cannot be trusted.

479
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,520
Mr. Tao, you don't need to wait here.

480
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
Let’s go back to Wujiapu together

481
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,960
Bring all the men and horses to wipe out the stronghold of these horse thieves.

482
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,600
I must keep my promise and wait here for Brother Xiang

483
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,680
Miss, please go back to Wujiapu first to report the news

484
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,320
If he takes back He's Bi

485
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,560
I'll go back to Wujiapu right away

486
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,280
No, let's go back to Wujiabao together to ask for reinforcements

487
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,880
There is no need to pay attention to this thief

488
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,280
He will definitely not keep his word

489
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,600
If he takes back He's Bi

490
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,040
They will definitely be taken away by others.

491
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,120
Miss

492
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,760
It was indeed Brother Xiang who rescued us from the village

493
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,800
Let's just believe him once and go our separate ways, okay?

494
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,040
Okay, Fang'er will trust Mr. Tao once

495
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,520
Brother Xiang, how are things going?

496
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,280
I just returned to the cottage

497
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,720
meet a handsome man

498
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,320
He took away He's Bi

499
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,880
People who know our market route

500
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,320
Apart from our Wujiabao, there is only Zhao Mu

501
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,360
Could it really be him?

502
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,840
Who is Zhao Mu?

503
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,520
Zhao Mu was a powerful minister of the State of Zhao

504
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,400
It can be said that one person is inferior to ten thousand people.

505
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,640
He must have great power

506
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,040
He's handsome yet a bit cold and arrogant, and he's good at martial arts.

507
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,600
Isn’t it invincible?

508
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,960
you misunderstood

509
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,680
This person is Zhao Mu’s number one swordsman Lian Jin

510
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,200
Lian Jin?

511
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,680
I have a question that I've wanted to ask you for a long time.

512
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,000
please say

513
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,680
When I was a kid, I heard people telling idiom stories

514
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,120
Obviously Lin Xiangru has returned to Zhao intact.

515
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,080
Why are you transporting it back to Zhao now?

516
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:23,560
The Heshi Bi that Lord Lin Xiangru brought back

517
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,240
is fake

518
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,800
Can you please stop talking behind my back?

519
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,840
You sit down and look at me and say, I'm asking you

520
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,600
I really don’t understand you costume people

521
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,400
I like carrying people on my back so much

522
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,400
Or just go to the window and look at the moon and talk.

523
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,520
What if the jade is returned to Zhao?

524
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,920
I've finished

525
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,040
Finished? How about that?

526
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,040
At that time, Lord Lin Xiangru

527
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,200
The Heshi Bi brought back is fake

528
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,680
Fake? Did Lin Xiangru lie to the emperor?

529
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,240
No, the one who bullies others is King Zhao of Qin

530
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
On that day he pretended to have fifteen cities

531
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,960
Exchange He's Bi with Zhao State

532
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,840
Although Mr. Lin is witty

533
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,680
Seeing through King Qin Zhao’s lack of sincerity

534
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,840
Threaten King Qin Zhao by breaking the jade into pieces

535
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,000
King Qin Zhao superficially submitted

536
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,160
Show your sincerity by fasting and bathing

537
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,680
I see

538
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,480
Lin Xiangru must have taken advantage of this opportunity

539
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,240
Stole He's Bi

540
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,720
That's right, but King Zhao of Qin is more treacherous

541
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,840
When I was already admiring the jade in the main hall,

542
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,480
Taking advantage of the opportunity of various concubines and concubines vying to watch

543
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,560
Replaced the real jade

544
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,760
Clever move

545
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,800
A clever move?

546
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:38,800
It means good strategy, cleverness and cleverness

547
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,960
Yes, it's really a clever move

548
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,880
Now a stranger has ascended the throne and become the Emperor of Qin

549
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,280
So I was very anxious to get the real jade

550
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,440
Offered back to Zhao as a gift in exchange for political hostages

551
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,880
Then you are still sitting here

552
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
Let's go and keep an eye on that Lian Jin

553
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,120
What does it mean to keep an eye on it quickly?

554
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,560
I'm really pissed off by you, talking while walking

555
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,480
Go through the back door

556
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,360
This piece is the Heshi Bi that the old man imitated.

557
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,960
It really compares to the piece on the young master’s hand.

558
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,120
Are they exactly the same?

559
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,400
Really good handiwork

560
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,320
Thank you uncle for your appreciation

561
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,400
In those days, my late father also worked for a Qin man.

562
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,000
Forged a piece of He's Bi

563
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,280
The old man witnessed it personally

564
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,840
That’s why the imitation is so similar
