00:00:03,025 --> 00:00:08,504
(Magistrate Yoo Ji Sun)

3
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:16,274
I did not expect to meet you like this, Your Royal Highness.

4
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:19,774
I hear reproof in your tone.

5
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:22,714
If the royal court and the Royal Family find out...

6
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:24,184
you had been meddling with the lawsuits of the people,

7
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:27,484
not only will it put you in trouble, it will trouble His Majesty.

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,183
(His Majesty: The King)

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,995
Is that not great news for Executive Minister Yoo and Hungu?

10
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:34,925
I am sure you do not do this for my father and the Hungu.

11
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:38,464
No. Hence, I plan to carry on without getting caught.

12
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:41,804
Therefore, treat me as a stranger from now on.

13
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:50,175
How am I to turn away from a woman whom I am betrothed to?

14
00:00:56,645 --> 00:01:00,354
Scholar Yoo. No, Lord Yoo, your betrothal to the princess...

15
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:03,825
would stop your father's power from passing down to you.

16
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:05,993
That is why my father made such a decision.

17
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:07,194
However, he has passed.

18
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:10,065
And I believe his blood...

19
00:01:10,464 --> 00:01:12,265
is on the hands of Executive Minister Yoo.

20
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:15,604
Do you still wish to honour this betrothal?

21
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:21,474
Please excuse me.

22
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,875
Thank you for your boundless grace, Your Majesty.

23
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:38,015
(Sowongak)

24
00:02:43,654 --> 00:02:44,795
I hear...

25
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:47,695
you operate a merchant house to help the poor.

26
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:52,064
This is not much, but I wish to help the best I can.

27
00:02:53,064 --> 00:02:54,904
I wish to remain anonymous.

28
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:56,934
From your supporter.

29
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:23,364
Lord Yoo, there is trouble.

30
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,915
(Hanseongbu)

31
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:54,824
When one strangles oneself,

32
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:57,063
the mouth of the dead is usually opened,

33
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:59,594
hands clasped, and teeth show.

34
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:04,635
The wound on the neck is severe and crimson-coloured.

35
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:13,075
Just an observation.

36
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:15,044
Excuse me.

37
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:52,185
Commissioner Park...

38
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:55,024
did not take his own life.

39
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:58,895
He was forced to look as if he took his own life.

40
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:03,594
Who did this, why did they do this,

41
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,695
and to hide what?

42
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:15,604
Have you deserted him?

43
00:05:16,705 --> 00:05:18,544
He deserved to die.

44
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:19,843
This is murder.

45
00:05:19,844 --> 00:05:21,745
- Suicide. - Father.

46
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:30,354
If you wish to turn this into a murder case,

47
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:31,995
I will not stop you.

48
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:35,523
A few suspects will suffer as a formality,

49
00:05:35,524 --> 00:05:38,565
then the most adequate one will get framed...

50
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:40,995
and beheaded.

51
00:05:43,104 --> 00:05:45,274
That is how we lose yet another life.

52
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:48,174
That is the thing with law.

53
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:52,145
It is much easier to kill one than to let one live.

54
00:05:56,484 --> 00:05:57,544
Precisely.

55
00:05:59,214 --> 00:06:02,385
According to the law, Commissioner Park was to die soon.

56
00:06:02,885 --> 00:06:06,224
So I do not understand why you went out of your way to do this.

57
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,065
The longer I let him live, the more he will tell.

58
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,634
Then he will bring more shame...

59
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:15,464
upon Hungu's name.

60
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:18,834
However, do not take this the wrong way.

61
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:22,745
Among many things I can do in this land of Joseon,

62
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,705
that was a rather easy task.

63
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:32,614
- One, two! - One, two!

64
00:06:32,615 --> 00:06:36,454
- One, two! - One, two!

65
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:39,825
One, two!

66
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:44,325
Hey! I will do the rest.

67
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,995
You may leave.

68
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:48,534
Thank you for your help.

69
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:02,945
Mother.

70
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:07,015
Commissioner Park died...

71
00:07:08,524 --> 00:07:10,555
the same way you did.

72
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:17,024
This does not feel as gratifying or refreshing as I thought.

73
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:22,265
Both Master Jang and Commissioner Park...

74
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:25,674
are all nothing but minions.

75
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:31,544
The true power must be someone else.

76
00:07:35,015 --> 00:07:38,784
Our foe is much higher than we thought.

77
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:42,755
What must I do?

78
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:44,223
(Bundle Lady)

79
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:45,524
And where should I go...

80
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:48,395
to find out the truth?

81
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,794

(Episode 5: The Brutal History of Cheongsan 1)

83
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:02,474
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

Han Soo!

85
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:08,745
- Han Soo! - What?

86
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:12,255
Where have you been? I have looked everywhere for you!

87
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:14,084
I have looked everywhere for you too...

88
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:16,723
on the ship, all day long,

89
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:18,353
as I got hit by bird poop.

90
00:08:18,354 --> 00:08:20,195
Gosh, do not be so petty.

91
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,194
So? What?

92
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:26,164
Look!

93
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:27,835
What?

94
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:31,704
I found this in Commissioner Park's sleeve.

95
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:41,944
I have his wife's consent, so let us go check now.

96
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:43,145
Let us go.

97
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:53,255
- Start over there. - Okay.

98
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:05,934
Darn it.

99
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:08,505
Hey!

100
00:09:09,444 --> 00:09:11,204
- Goodness. - Move aside!

101
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:17,645
There it is.

102
00:09:17,646 --> 00:09:18,654
(Land Deed)

103
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:25,794
How much does this add up to?

104
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:28,255
It looks like Park Jae Soo...

105
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:31,324
was the fence for Hungu.

106
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:34,635
House deed.

107
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:36,404
- Thank you. - Sure.

108
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:38,834
He must have exchanged these for silk, rice,

109
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:40,903
jade, silver, and gold,

110
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:43,074
He must have exchanged it for gold and put it in the Hungu's storeroom.

111
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:46,074
- Yes, of course. - And this one.

112
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:47,444
Please take good care of this.

113
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:50,544
He was a fence and kept a bribe ledger as well.

114
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,755
He even acted as a bookkeeper.

115
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,724
The dead Master Jang...

116
00:09:57,725 --> 00:10:00,554
would have been the merchant he worked with.

117
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:04,794
It has been seven years since Park Jae Soo came to Hanyang.

118
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:07,595
Lord Chu also entered the central court around that time.

119
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:09,965
And Master Jang settled down in the Hanyang markets.

120
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:14,135
If all of that was in return for my father's life,

121
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:17,544
the one who provided all of these generous favours...

122
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:20,914
would be the person who ordered to kill my father.

123
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:24,444
Let us see.

124
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:26,884
If we follow Master Jang, Commissioner Park, and Lord Chu...

125
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:29,725
all the way back up, at the end is...

126
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:33,454
It is the executive minister, the leader of the Hungu.

127
00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:34,824
Right.

128
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:37,495
Come on, you went too far.

129
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:40,395
Gosh, I hope that is not true.

130
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:42,664
If that is the case, it will be too hard for us.

131
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:44,235
How about...

132
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:46,605
we just catch Lord Chu and beat it out of him?

133
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:48,334
That man is practically the mastermind.

134
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:50,105
He will never talk.

135
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:52,914
Then what do we do?

136
00:10:53,074 --> 00:10:54,975
Now, other than Lord Chu,

137
00:10:55,074 --> 00:10:57,644
all we have is that mysterious bundle lady.

138
00:10:57,645 --> 00:11:00,554
We tried to track her down for years but never succeeded.

139
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:10,765
I guess Park Jae Soo's soul still had some conscience left.

140
00:11:10,824 --> 00:11:12,835
He even left us a present.

141
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:18,204
Who gave it to him? Look it up.

142
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:33,813
Why?

143
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:37,154
It says it is from the governor of Cheongsan.

144
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:47,694
Cheongsan...

145
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:52,875
(Sowongak)

146
00:11:57,574 --> 00:11:58,814
Indeed.

147
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:01,745
This is the plum wine from before.

148
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:04,485
You cannot do this while out in disguise.

149
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:07,284
- I will pay enough for the drinks. - What?

150
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:24,365
What is all this?

151
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:26,904
Did I not say that in order to make Kang Han Soo act,

152
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:28,745
we will need quite a lot of wealth?

153
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:34,174
Thank you for your boundless generosity...

154
00:12:34,774 --> 00:12:36,085
But...

155
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:41,355
Even for you, Your Majesty, you would need permission...

156
00:12:41,414 --> 00:12:43,454
from the executive minister to take money from your private vault.

157
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:47,423
That is why...

158
00:12:47,424 --> 00:12:49,725
I have brought my personal wealth that I had kept aside.

159
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:54,034
Thank you...

160
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:55,964
Thank you again, Your Majesty.

161
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:57,304
Enjoy the food and drinks.

162
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:11,284
What are you looking at?

163
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:23,164
I thought you were going to make Kang Han Soo your man.

164
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:27,465
It seems...

165
00:13:28,835 --> 00:13:30,934
you are becoming more like him somehow.

166
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:32,574
I am?

167
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,174
I thought I saw more.

168
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:40,645
Why is it Cheongsan, of all places?

169
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:42,015
- Hey. - I know, right?

170
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:48,884
This is driving me crazy.

171
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:50,624
Do you still have something to say to me?

172
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,125
Master Jo asks to see that face of yours.

173
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:56,194
We let you keep your life, but you do not know to be grateful.

174
00:13:56,395 --> 00:13:57,464
You just had to...

175
00:13:57,465 --> 00:13:58,694
show up in court?

176
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:01,395
This time,

177
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:02,965
I will show you the afterlife.

178
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:07,674
I ought to show you the real deal this time.

179
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:09,804
- Dong Chi. - Yes, Han Soo.

180
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:17,444
- Let us use the bear tactic. - Right.

181
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:28,193
I am Daddy Bear!

182
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:29,725
I am Mommy Bear!

183
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:39,933
Then shall I attack after you?

184
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:41,234
Do you think you will run away on your own?

185
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:43,174
You sure are quick-witted.

186
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:51,985
My lord!

187
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:57,424
What is this?

188
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:00,654
Han Soo.

189
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:02,823
Hey!

190
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:03,924
After them!

191
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:07,034
Get them!

192
00:15:16,505 --> 00:15:18,204
Take a different horse.

193
00:15:19,615 --> 00:15:20,774
Your Highness!

194
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:25,245
- Wait... - Your...

195
00:15:32,324 --> 00:15:33,424
Your Majesty.

196
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:35,395
Have a comfortable journey.

197
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:39,595
But what...

198
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:45,704
- Come on! - Wait!

199
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:49,345
Get them!

200
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:55,174
Move!

201
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:56,585
I am going to kill you all!

202
00:16:01,654 --> 00:16:03,524
We are going to get you! Move!

203
00:16:06,054 --> 00:16:08,865
Han Soo, they are gone.

204
00:16:09,924 --> 00:16:11,064
Gosh, I am tired.

205
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:14,235
Since things have come to this, let us head to Cheongsan right away.

206
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,464
What? Right now?

207
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:16,664
Yes, get dressed.

208
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:18,265
- What about the meat? - Toss it.

209
00:16:18,335 --> 00:16:19,375
And the knife?

210
00:16:19,574 --> 00:16:20,875
- Toss it! - Okay.

211
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:46,995
Let me go to Cheongsan with you.

212
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:50,335
- Find them. - Chu Sal!

213
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:52,835
There they are. Run.

214
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,135
Run!

215
00:16:54,174 --> 00:16:55,704
Han Soo.

216
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:11,184
Move!

217
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:22,035
Hey, keep the ledger safe. I will meet you in Cheongsan.

218
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:23,164
What about me?

219
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:25,464
Let us go. Please survive!

220
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:27,535
Han Soo!

221
00:17:31,075 --> 00:17:32,275
Darn it.

222
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:42,424
This girl always appears in times like these.

223
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,355
When I am in the most embarrassing state.

224
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:47,125
And...

225
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:49,125
when I desperately need her.

226
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:54,764
Where are they?

227
00:17:54,994 --> 00:17:56,464
- Oh, my foot. - Look for them.

228
00:17:58,565 --> 00:17:59,775
Gosh, it hurts.

229
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:03,504
Oh, it hurts so much.

230
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:05,474
Oh, it hurts.

231
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:09,444
Oh, dear.

232
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:11,315
- Chu Sal. - Yes?

233
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:14,855
- Let us go. - Oh, it hurts.

234
00:18:15,924 --> 00:18:20,194
Oh, dear. It hurts.

235
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,635
Come on out.

236
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:33,404
That was close.

237
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:36,244
You sure are the best, Lady Hong.

238
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:38,874
You gave us drinks,

239
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,145
fed us food,

240
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,514
and even gave us a room.

241
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:42,914
Now, did you even...

242
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,315
give me your heart?

243
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:52,295
Did you just say...

244
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:55,095
my heart?

245
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:00,365
You are indebted to me.

246
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:02,404
I will write it down in my ledger,

247
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,335
so do not forget.

248
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:08,635
Gosh.

249
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:10,775
You are lying.

250
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:14,345
Lady Hong.

251
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:16,784
Wait for me.

252
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:17,984
You lost them?

253
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:21,615
He must have felt guilty about something.

254
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:24,924
He ran off the moment he saw my men.

255
00:19:27,224 --> 00:19:29,595
The attorney who did that to Commissioner Park.

256
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:31,525
I wanted to see his face.

257
00:19:33,065 --> 00:19:34,734
I heard the news.

258
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:36,835
That he killed himself.

259
00:19:37,264 --> 00:19:40,003
For our old friendship's sake,

260
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:42,875
I gave him numerous chances.

261
00:19:44,105 --> 00:19:45,443
But he could not even keep his wife under control...

262
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:46,545
and ended up dying.

263
00:19:48,974 --> 00:19:52,315
Send his family enough condolences money.

264
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:55,484
And take everything he left behind.

265
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:59,395
Before someone else gets their hands on it,

266
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,595
make a move yourself.

267
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:03,595
Yes, my lord.

268
00:20:03,895 --> 00:20:07,234
Darn him. How could he not do better than an attorney?

269
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:11,734
Let me be excused.

270
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:36,263
Why are we going to Cheongsan?

271
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:38,264
You have a line of clients in the merchant house.

272
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:41,934
And you? Have you decided to be my assistant again?

273
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:44,704
Does that mean I passed?

274
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:46,375
Well...

275
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:49,345
You saved my life,

276
00:20:49,845 --> 00:20:52,275
so I guess I can give you that much of a chance.

277
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:53,615
No way!

278
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:57,085
I have to risk my life to work with you?

279
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:03,085
I am just saying I am that grateful.

280
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:56,204
Help us, please.

281
00:21:57,474 --> 00:22:01,014
Look who this is. Han Soo, right?

282
00:22:01,414 --> 00:22:02,614
My mother and father...

283
00:22:02,615 --> 00:22:04,885
You should have known better.

284
00:22:05,545 --> 00:22:08,454
Had you thrown a feast with the money you got,

285
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:10,724
it would not have been this miserable.

286
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:13,724
What a filthy family.

287
00:22:47,754 --> 00:22:50,764
(Dabok-Ri, Cheongsan)

288
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:04,875
Come on.

289
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:07,744
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

290
00:23:08,014 --> 00:23:09,114
Yes!

291
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:10,514
Goodness.

292
00:23:11,845 --> 00:23:14,153
Do it. Harder.

293
00:23:14,154 --> 00:23:16,025
It is too weak. Do it with both hands.

294
00:23:17,724 --> 00:23:19,653
It feels so cool.

295
00:23:19,654 --> 00:23:21,924
- Seven, eight, - I want strong winds.

296
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:24,065
- nine, ten. - How cool.

297
00:23:24,865 --> 00:23:26,234
Let us go again.

298
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:29,535
Play rock.

299
00:23:31,065 --> 00:23:34,135
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

300
00:23:38,404 --> 00:23:40,344
- Come on. - Han Soo.

301
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:42,474
- Han Soo. - Father is here.

302
00:23:43,914 --> 00:23:45,954
Where are you going?

303
00:23:46,014 --> 00:23:48,154
Hey, Han Soo!

304
00:23:53,555 --> 00:23:55,654
Goodness, you brats.

305
00:23:56,264 --> 00:23:58,625
- Darn you! - Gosh.

306
00:24:01,635 --> 00:24:02,635
Got you!

307
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,104
Hey, Han Soo.

308
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:08,875
- Do not run. - You are so cheap.

309
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:10,444
- Be careful. - Goodness.

310
00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:21,115
My lord, look.

311
00:24:21,385 --> 00:24:24,325
I guess a family of four lived here. Is it not interesting?

312
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:27,994
No, it is not. Let us go.

313
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:29,764
My lord.

314
00:24:33,095 --> 00:24:35,135
Do it meticulously.

315
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:37,904
So this was what you were doing.

316
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:41,504
Is this the doorplate of our house?

317
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:45,545
Goodness.

318
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,683
I said that was not it. Look.

319
00:24:49,684 --> 00:24:51,785
- No. - Gosh.

320
00:24:53,085 --> 00:24:55,714
Gosh, must I really do this?

321
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:57,453
A single man and woman should stay apart from each other.

322
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,525
If we go around together, people might spread weird rumours.

323
00:25:01,224 --> 00:25:03,594
A countryside village like this tends to be...

324
00:25:03,595 --> 00:25:05,625
very closed and conservative.

325
00:25:06,595 --> 00:25:08,535
All right. Turn around.

326
00:25:19,545 --> 00:25:22,844
Well, you could disguise yourself as my servant.

327
00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:24,815
Why must I dress up like this?

328
00:25:24,944 --> 00:25:26,055
That is because...

329
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,525
This suits you way better than me in my disguise.

330
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:30,825
Are you kidding me?

331
00:25:31,855 --> 00:25:34,954
All done. You look cool, my So Won.

332
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:40,535
All right. I should also...

333
00:25:41,535 --> 00:25:42,934
How annoying.

334
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:45,865
That so-called compliment almost pleased me.

335
00:25:51,904 --> 00:25:55,714
No, only foolish amateurs do this.

336
00:26:08,724 --> 00:26:10,494
What, a secret investigator?

337
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:12,694
Lower your voice.

338
00:26:13,895 --> 00:26:16,864
He looks pathetic and dirty...

339
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:18,704
with dirt all over his body as if he has starved for days.

340
00:26:19,635 --> 00:26:21,934
But his eyes are sharp and clear.

341
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:24,775
And his voice sounds dignified.

342
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:33,754
Who are you?

343
00:26:35,514 --> 00:26:36,625
Me?

344
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:39,254
If you are to know who I am...

345
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:43,864
Anyway, we are exhausted and hungry...

346
00:26:43,865 --> 00:26:45,964
from a long journey.

347
00:26:46,065 --> 00:26:48,464
Is there an inn worth staying?

348
00:26:55,504 --> 00:26:56,875
Just a moment, please.

349
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:00,774
Anyone could tell he is a scholar official.

350
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:01,815
A scholar...

351
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:03,683
Of them all, one who manages the Royal Court.

352
00:27:03,684 --> 00:27:04,684
The Royal Court?

353
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:07,555
Of them all, a secret investigator. I am sure of it.

354
00:27:07,615 --> 00:27:08,785
A secret...

355
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:13,254
As he was requesting to stay at an inn,

356
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:17,264
he took a sharp look around, unintimidated at all.

357
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:20,335
It seemed like he was checking...

358
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:21,865
if the officials were not slacking off.

359
00:27:29,944 --> 00:27:31,504
I wonder where the toilet is.

360
00:27:32,545 --> 00:27:33,545
He is coming.

361
00:27:37,684 --> 00:27:39,785
His back and shoulders are bending more than earlier.

362
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:41,555
He has become polite.

363
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:43,423
I guess your idea worked.

364
00:27:43,424 --> 00:27:44,625
Of course.

365
00:27:53,164 --> 00:27:55,535
I apologize for not recognizing who you are.

366
00:27:58,204 --> 00:28:00,305
- That way, please. - Let us go.

367
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:03,674
Stay here, Bang Ja.

368
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:09,474
Unbelievable.

369
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:18,285
Well,

370
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,295
I know I should introduce myself first,

371
00:28:22,454 --> 00:28:23,663
but given my situation...

372
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:24,865
No.

373
00:28:25,325 --> 00:28:29,095
Please take your time and enjoy.

374
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:40,644
Words are spreading all the way to the government office street...

375
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:43,914
that this village is free of crimes.

376
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:45,743
I hear the local magistrate will be promoted...

377
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:47,453
to higher than two levels, at least like the former ones.

378
00:28:47,454 --> 00:28:49,453
It is just as I hear.

379
00:28:49,454 --> 00:28:52,684
It is too kind of you to say so.

380
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:02,395
Anyway, who told you what?

381
00:29:11,174 --> 00:29:12,174
The truth is,

382
00:29:13,914 --> 00:29:16,414
I must check one thing regarding this.

383
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:18,684
That is why I asked to see you.

384
00:29:19,414 --> 00:29:20,615
What is it?

385
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:50,845
That man wanted me to return this to you.

386
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:55,815
He promised to give me a nice position.

387
00:29:56,454 --> 00:29:59,085
So I thought he appreciated my sincerity.

388
00:29:59,724 --> 00:30:04,264
Since he has given it back to me, what now?

389
00:30:06,164 --> 00:30:07,365
By any chance...

390
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:11,635
Will I not get the position he promised as well?

391
00:30:12,264 --> 00:30:13,504
Most likely.

392
00:30:14,674 --> 00:30:17,174
But I was trying to break free from this countryside.

393
00:30:18,845 --> 00:30:20,514
Knowing it was a stolen good,

394
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:22,674
it would not have felt right to accept it.

395
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:24,014
"Stolen good?"

396
00:30:25,145 --> 00:30:26,484
No way.

397
00:30:26,684 --> 00:30:27,855
That was...

398
00:30:28,355 --> 00:30:29,514
"That was?"

399
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,385
That was...

400
00:30:33,754 --> 00:30:35,555
a gift I had received.

401
00:30:36,825 --> 00:30:38,065
So he got it as a bribe.

402
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,335
I knew that would happen.

403
00:30:42,365 --> 00:30:45,064
In the end, she just had to get her husband killed.

404
00:30:45,065 --> 00:30:47,335
Goodness. What an unlucky fate.

405
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:50,504
That wench who killed her husband...

406
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:52,644
could kill yours too.

407
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:54,315
Keep him under control.

408
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:34,484
From whom?

409
00:31:35,154 --> 00:31:37,484
Gosh, must I tell you that much?

410
00:31:38,585 --> 00:31:41,395
Well, if you do not want to clear up his misunderstanding.

411
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,424
No, wait a minute. Sit.

412
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,635
Gosh. All right.

413
00:31:48,095 --> 00:31:49,395
Well...

414
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:52,434
I will tell you.

415
00:31:57,605 --> 00:31:58,845
A persimmon tree.

416
00:31:59,974 --> 00:32:01,275
Is this the place?

417
00:32:14,754 --> 00:32:15,954
What?

418
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:33,075
Good grief.

419
00:32:52,424 --> 00:32:55,194
There are over ten stab wounds visible to the naked eye.

420
00:32:57,404 --> 00:32:59,163
A daring criminal act in broad daylight...

421
00:32:59,164 --> 00:33:00,904
despite the witnesses present.

422
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,345
This is murder for revenge.

423
00:33:08,744 --> 00:33:11,045
One that she even risked her life doing.

424
00:33:19,484 --> 00:33:21,494
The house just below the persimmon tree...

425
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:22,954
in Dabok-Ri, Pyeongan-myeon.

426
00:33:24,595 --> 00:33:25,895
She is called Lady Park.

427
00:33:45,184 --> 00:33:47,815
Should I thank her for killing her in my stead?

428
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:50,385
Or...

429
00:33:50,785 --> 00:33:53,754
should I ask her why she did such a thing?

430
00:34:09,804 --> 00:34:11,905
Why did you grab that with your bare hand?

431
00:34:27,224 --> 00:34:29,025
- What is it? - What is all the fuss?

432
00:34:29,355 --> 00:34:31,164
- Goodness. - This is driving me nuts.

433
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:33,094
- How could this happen? - Oh, dear.

434
00:34:33,395 --> 00:34:35,695
Good grief. A murder?

435
00:34:35,994 --> 00:34:38,134
How could someone get killed in our village?

436
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:39,533
Who was it?

437
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:41,634
Who was it that did such a crazy thing?

438
00:35:07,434 --> 00:35:08,895
Did you report this to the government office?

439
00:35:10,565 --> 00:35:11,834
If not, I will go and...

440
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:13,005
Catch him.

441
00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:15,034
What is it?

442
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:16,744
- What are you doing? It was not me. - Oh, no.

443
00:35:24,244 --> 00:35:25,414
My lord.

444
00:35:30,224 --> 00:35:31,485
It was not us.

445
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:34,925
We know.

446
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:36,395
The criminal...

447
00:35:36,664 --> 00:35:38,465
is that girl, Young Sil.

448
00:35:38,895 --> 00:35:40,034
Then why?

449
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:44,764
Because you saw it all.

450
00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:47,905
Excuse me?

451
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,014
Are you going to kill her?

452
00:35:57,815 --> 00:35:59,645
What to do with you two...

453
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:02,985
will be determined at a village meeting.

454
00:36:03,155 --> 00:36:04,324
Keep that in mind.

455
00:36:05,355 --> 00:36:06,655
What are you waiting for?

456
00:36:11,864 --> 00:36:14,134
I heard ten years was an epoch.

457
00:36:14,735 --> 00:36:16,395
But in this countryside,

458
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,364
nothing changed a bit.

459
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:24,304
Lock them in the shed.

460
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:25,545
- Understood. - Understood.

461
00:36:31,715 --> 00:36:33,344
None of them are in the right mind.

462
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,315
A day later...

463
00:36:37,255 --> 00:36:39,954
No. You should have killed her a bit later.

464
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:42,954
If only I finished my business... No.

465
00:36:43,695 --> 00:36:45,895
If only you had done it after we left.

466
00:36:47,295 --> 00:36:49,235
My lord. Why would you say that?

467
00:36:49,264 --> 00:36:51,204
That woman deserved to die.

468
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:55,704
I killed her...

469
00:36:57,344 --> 00:36:58,545
because she deserved it.

470
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:09,714
Then...

471
00:37:09,715 --> 00:37:11,625
I will trust you and wait.

472
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:15,054
Goodness. You are a big spender, are you not?

473
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,223
It will be a waste to lose...

474
00:37:18,224 --> 00:37:20,263
such a fine man. Yes, indeed.

475
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:21,895
Oh, please. Well then.

476
00:37:25,304 --> 00:37:28,634
Trust my words and just meet him once.

477
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:30,804
In my eyes, you two are a perfect match.

478
00:37:32,675 --> 00:37:33,775
No, please.

479
00:38:02,005 --> 00:38:03,174
Bride.

480
00:38:03,175 --> 00:38:05,045
Bow twice.

481
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:06,945
- Goodness. - How pretty.

482
00:38:07,045 --> 00:38:08,445
- Gosh. - She is so pretty.

483
00:38:12,914 --> 00:38:14,255
Look at her bowing.

484
00:38:15,855 --> 00:38:18,125
Man, the groom got himself a young wife.

485
00:38:18,324 --> 00:38:19,525
Groom.

486
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,795
Bow back.

487
00:38:24,795 --> 00:38:27,235
This is not a problem of wealth.

488
00:38:27,795 --> 00:38:31,335
She should have gotten the message when I gave her the hints.

489
00:38:31,864 --> 00:38:34,704
So how dare that wench get married in secret?

490
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:42,014
Is it true? The rumour about that newlywed bride.

491
00:38:42,344 --> 00:38:45,045
But she did not look like that kind of a person.

492
00:38:45,145 --> 00:38:47,684
Did she not lead a modest domestic life?

493
00:38:48,914 --> 00:38:50,113
You are right.

494
00:38:50,114 --> 00:38:52,854
Such a rumour only started spreading after her marriage.

495
00:38:52,855 --> 00:38:54,824
- It sure is strange. - Right?

496
00:38:56,454 --> 00:38:57,695
But that...

497
00:38:58,395 --> 00:39:00,194
only proves...

498
00:39:00,195 --> 00:39:03,364
what a good job that cunning fox did of hiding it.

499
00:39:03,835 --> 00:39:05,105
Granny?

500
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:07,605
I, too,

501
00:39:08,034 --> 00:39:09,375
have seen it once.

502
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,145
Seen what?

503
00:39:14,775 --> 00:39:18,145
I went out to use the toilet shed at night,

504
00:39:19,344 --> 00:39:21,384
and I saw her with my own eyes.

505
00:39:24,255 --> 00:39:28,025
Why would she walk out from the mill that late at night?

506
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:32,525
That was not the first time I have seen her.

507
00:39:35,494 --> 00:39:38,634
So that is why she suddenly got married.

508
00:39:38,804 --> 00:39:40,734
And with a man from a neighbouring village!

509
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:44,274
This means she had already been with the men in our village.

510
00:39:44,275 --> 00:39:46,375
That was why she got married so soon!

511
00:39:47,514 --> 00:39:49,614
- My gosh! - So there was a reason.

512
00:39:51,445 --> 00:39:52,884
Do you want me to tell you more?

513
00:39:53,085 --> 00:39:54,684
- Yes. - Come closer.

514
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:57,784
That is not all...

515
00:39:59,485 --> 00:40:01,924
Goodness, really?

516
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:03,964
- I have seen her. - I heard this.

517
00:40:03,965 --> 00:40:06,394
- That newlywed bride? - Really?

518
00:40:06,395 --> 00:40:08,034
- Is this true? - Yes!

519
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:10,334
- Oh, my! - That is preposterous!

520
00:40:10,335 --> 00:40:11,864
I heard it is so.

521
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:15,905
Whenever her husband goes out to work,

522
00:40:16,134 --> 00:40:17,574
she goes out every night.

523
00:40:21,715 --> 00:40:24,783
Men line up 40km out just to see her.

524
00:40:24,784 --> 00:40:28,454
Goodness, of course, you would. I would stand there for 100 days.

525
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:32,755
If I can hold her in my arms, I should stand in the line!

526
00:40:33,384 --> 00:40:37,024
You son of a dog!

527
00:40:37,025 --> 00:40:38,025
What?

528
00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:43,565
You son of a gun. Say that again.

529
00:40:43,664 --> 00:40:45,304
Say it again!

530
00:40:46,065 --> 00:40:49,104
Hey, you are the one who did not control your woman.

531
00:40:49,105 --> 00:40:50,675
Why are you taking this out on us?

532
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:53,505
What did you say?

533
00:40:54,945 --> 00:40:56,874
You son of a gun! What did you say?

534
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,784
- What did you say? - Darn it!

535
00:40:59,985 --> 00:41:01,014
You jerk!

536
00:41:17,704 --> 00:41:18,835
Get him!

537
00:41:38,884 --> 00:41:40,125
My husband.

538
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:43,895
My husband.

539
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:46,724
My husband!

540
00:41:47,934 --> 00:41:49,065
No...

541
00:41:51,505 --> 00:41:52,704
No...

542
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:57,375
No, my dear...

543
00:41:58,175 --> 00:42:00,744
No... Please do not leave me.

544
00:42:02,275 --> 00:42:03,344
No...

545
00:42:07,114 --> 00:42:11,454
Goodness.

546
00:42:12,985 --> 00:42:15,195
Goodness.

547
00:42:16,594 --> 00:42:19,525
Goodness.

548
00:42:22,295 --> 00:42:24,434
Goodness.

549
00:42:26,735 --> 00:42:29,775
Goodness.

550
00:42:30,945 --> 00:42:32,804
I do not regret anything.

551
00:42:33,005 --> 00:42:34,775
Even after I leave this world,

552
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:39,585
everyone will continue to spread this nonsense.

553
00:42:40,855 --> 00:42:43,315
Do not let the words...

554
00:42:44,684 --> 00:42:48,125
of that wicked old woman get to you.

555
00:42:49,824 --> 00:42:51,594
No matter what anyone says,

556
00:42:53,164 --> 00:42:54,835
I trust you.

557
00:42:56,634 --> 00:42:58,105
Goodness.

558
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:04,605
Goodness.

559
00:43:35,634 --> 00:43:38,704
- So did you do that? - Of course.

560
00:43:40,775 --> 00:43:42,045
Goodness.

561
00:43:44,315 --> 00:43:45,315
Look.

562
00:43:47,514 --> 00:43:49,954
My goodness.

563
00:43:52,485 --> 00:43:54,755
You are next.

564
00:43:55,324 --> 00:43:56,554
Okay.

565
00:43:59,195 --> 00:44:00,195
Goodness.

566
00:44:09,304 --> 00:44:11,105
That wench who killed her husband could kill yours too.

567
00:44:11,905 --> 00:44:13,445
Keep him under control.

568
00:45:20,645 --> 00:45:21,875
I do understand...

569
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,545
how you feel.

570
00:45:24,744 --> 00:45:26,844
But it was too harsh to kill someone.

571
00:45:27,954 --> 00:45:30,514
I am asking if she could have done this another way.

572
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:34,094
If the governor of Cheongsan refused to hear your case,

573
00:45:34,255 --> 00:45:36,655
you could have asked the governor of Chungcheong Province.

574
00:45:36,954 --> 00:45:38,924
You also could have gone to the capital...

575
00:45:38,925 --> 00:45:40,263
and complained to His Majesty.

576
00:45:40,264 --> 00:45:41,794
(Complaining to the King: People bang on a gong loudly...)

577
00:45:41,795 --> 00:45:43,093
(when the King would walk by to lodge a complaint.)

578
00:45:43,094 --> 00:45:45,105
How is she going to trust them?

579
00:45:45,934 --> 00:45:48,505
A servant is only as honest as his master.

580
00:45:48,675 --> 00:45:50,703
If the county governor of this rural village is that corrupt,

581
00:45:50,704 --> 00:45:52,144
how much more corrupt...

582
00:45:52,145 --> 00:45:53,743
will the officers of bigger offices be?

583
00:45:53,744 --> 00:45:55,145
No, even those who are in the royal court.

584
00:45:56,145 --> 00:45:57,844
You can only trust yourself.

585
00:45:58,344 --> 00:46:00,045
Revenge is something you do alone,

586
00:46:00,145 --> 00:46:03,255
and your trust in the King or officers to do your bidding...

587
00:46:04,684 --> 00:46:05,724
is just a fantasy.

588
00:46:06,384 --> 00:46:09,754
But not everyone kills another as their revenge.

589
00:46:09,755 --> 00:46:11,564
Then share a better option.

590
00:46:11,565 --> 00:46:13,093
Anything is better than murder.

591
00:46:13,094 --> 00:46:14,863
This is a rationalization for becoming a monster...

592
00:46:14,864 --> 00:46:16,234
to catch a monster.

593
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:17,533
That will end up killing everyone.

594
00:46:17,534 --> 00:46:18,863
Nobody is going to die.

595
00:46:18,864 --> 00:46:20,334
Our law says someone who killed another...

596
00:46:20,335 --> 00:46:22,274
must pay the price with one's life.

597
00:46:22,275 --> 00:46:25,775
That is only the case for offenders who have not met me.

598
00:46:27,675 --> 00:46:28,715
What?

599
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:34,454
Let us file a lawsuit.

600
00:46:34,815 --> 00:46:36,755
I will make you innocent, then released.

601
00:46:38,384 --> 00:46:39,985
- Innocent? - Yes.

602
00:46:41,224 --> 00:46:42,395
That is impossible.

603
00:46:42,554 --> 00:46:45,964
An attorney is someone who makes the impossible possible.

604
00:46:45,965 --> 00:46:48,195
And I am not just another attorney.

605
00:46:48,295 --> 00:46:50,164
I am the best attorney in Joseon, Kang...

606
00:47:00,715 --> 00:47:03,445
I am the most competent attorney in Joseon.

607
00:47:04,744 --> 00:47:06,184
An attorney?

608
00:47:06,485 --> 00:47:07,485
Yes.

609
00:47:08,114 --> 00:47:11,883
First off, we must leave this place.

610
00:47:11,884 --> 00:47:13,324
Is there an opening?

611
00:47:14,224 --> 00:47:15,395
Can I break this?

612
00:47:28,105 --> 00:47:29,134
Goodness.

613
00:47:30,105 --> 00:47:31,945
Some stupid novice came here.

614
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,243
Good grief.

615
00:47:38,244 --> 00:47:40,445
- Goodness. - What is this?

616
00:47:41,284 --> 00:47:43,054
Should I just go?

617
00:47:43,514 --> 00:47:44,925
I will not save you.

618
00:47:47,284 --> 00:47:50,223
Good grief. Come on.

619
00:47:50,224 --> 00:47:52,695
Young Sil!

620
00:47:52,724 --> 00:47:53,764
Mother.

621
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:06,474
Let us go while they let us leave.

622
00:48:09,074 --> 00:48:11,485
I will take my girl and leave.

623
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:13,645
Thank you, Village Head.

624
00:48:15,715 --> 00:48:16,755
Let us go.

625
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:18,425
One second.

626
00:48:19,324 --> 00:48:21,125
Where are you going?

627
00:48:21,224 --> 00:48:23,554
Who are you?

628
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:25,125
Kang...

629
00:48:29,864 --> 00:48:30,905
Kang...

630
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,675
He is Attorney Kang.

631
00:48:39,605 --> 00:48:42,114
- What? An attorney? - He is an attorney?

632
00:48:42,815 --> 00:48:44,074
An attorney?

633
00:48:44,284 --> 00:48:46,215
Are you saying that woman who murdered someone...

634
00:48:47,114 --> 00:48:49,414
will be defended by an attorney?

635
00:48:49,985 --> 00:48:51,925
What? Defended by an attorney?

636
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:55,155
Are you saying you will file a lawsuit?

637
00:48:56,755 --> 00:48:57,794
Yes.

638
00:48:57,795 --> 00:48:59,924
Through a lawsuit, we will reveal the hidden truth of this case...

639
00:48:59,925 --> 00:49:01,194
and make it known to the county.

640
00:49:01,195 --> 00:49:02,364
What hidden truth?

641
00:49:03,494 --> 00:49:06,804
In broad daylight, a county elder died...

642
00:49:07,005 --> 00:49:09,275
because she was stabbed by the hoe that girl wielded.

643
00:49:09,974 --> 00:49:12,005
What hidden truth could there be...

644
00:49:12,275 --> 00:49:13,573
in such a clear-cut case?

645
00:49:13,574 --> 00:49:15,545
We will have to listen to her side of the story as well.

646
00:49:17,815 --> 00:49:20,744
I do not know what great story there is,

647
00:49:21,485 --> 00:49:23,784
but the fact that this girl committed murder...

648
00:49:24,114 --> 00:49:25,454
does not change.

649
00:49:25,485 --> 00:49:28,395
We do not seek to hide or change that fact.

650
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:29,854
It is because...

651
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,164
this is the correct procedure according to national law.

652
00:49:33,965 --> 00:49:35,134
National law?

653
00:49:39,065 --> 00:49:41,134
Do you see Joseon here anywhere?

654
00:49:42,574 --> 00:49:43,634
Pardon?

655
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:46,244
As you can see, here in Dabok-Ri,

656
00:49:46,844 --> 00:49:49,645
we do not produce food as it is not a grain farming region.

657
00:49:50,114 --> 00:49:51,343
It is not an important crossroad,

658
00:49:51,344 --> 00:49:53,384
- so we do not get much trade. - I have heard it so much already.

659
00:49:54,085 --> 00:49:55,884
And it is not even a strategically important location,

660
00:49:56,155 --> 00:49:58,954
so there is not even a common military base here.

661
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,254
I see.

662
00:50:02,255 --> 00:50:05,124
This country was nowhere to be seen when we were facing...

663
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:06,724
all sorts of diseases and disasters.

664
00:50:07,465 --> 00:50:10,735
The Joseon that only showed up when they came to collect taxes!

665
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:13,735
What right does it have to ask us to be rightful?

666
00:50:15,835 --> 00:50:17,034
- That is... - Sure.

667
00:50:17,574 --> 00:50:19,973
During the lawsuit, our villagers will get called here and there...

668
00:50:19,974 --> 00:50:23,614
as witnesses and suspects and get tortured.

669
00:50:24,074 --> 00:50:25,944
And if someone is wrongfully blamed,

670
00:50:25,945 --> 00:50:28,254
who will take responsibility for that?

671
00:50:28,255 --> 00:50:31,054
- That is right! - He sure is.

672
00:50:31,884 --> 00:50:34,125
There will be people here to conduct an autopsy...

673
00:50:34,255 --> 00:50:35,994
and a horde of officers and soldiers.

674
00:50:36,155 --> 00:50:37,965
They will take up room in the best houses.

675
00:50:38,094 --> 00:50:40,464
They will ask for food and water every mealtime,

676
00:50:40,465 --> 00:50:41,834
complain about the side dishes,

677
00:50:41,835 --> 00:50:43,134
and demand us to slaughter chickens and pigs.

678
00:50:43,934 --> 00:50:46,364
If we put on a scowl from the exhaustion,

679
00:50:46,934 --> 00:50:48,374
they will say we look suspicious...

680
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:50,275
and arrest us as the suspect.

681
00:50:51,275 --> 00:50:53,374
Who will take responsibility for our households being drained...

682
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:55,215
and the people left to starve?

683
00:50:56,775 --> 00:50:58,913
We do not want to see that happen,

684
00:50:58,914 --> 00:51:01,613
so we gave you all the money we had.

685
00:51:01,614 --> 00:51:02,884
So you should just take it and leave.

686
00:51:03,184 --> 00:51:05,024
You even took the money, so why are you causing a fuss?

687
00:51:05,025 --> 00:51:06,655
- Right, they took the money. - They should leave.

688
00:51:06,724 --> 00:51:08,894
- How ridiculous. - Right.

689
00:51:08,895 --> 00:51:10,494
- Money? - Did you perhaps...

690
00:51:10,594 --> 00:51:12,295
already accept money as a settlement?

691
00:51:12,795 --> 00:51:13,895
Well...

692
00:51:17,264 --> 00:51:19,364
Your brother...

693
00:51:19,634 --> 00:51:21,474
already took the money.

694
00:51:22,175 --> 00:51:23,405
My goodness.

695
00:51:26,445 --> 00:51:27,675
Let us go now.

696
00:51:28,014 --> 00:51:29,445
Come on.

697
00:51:30,744 --> 00:51:32,815
- Just a minute. - Get out of the way.

698
00:51:34,715 --> 00:51:36,114
What do we do? Do we just let them go?

699
00:51:36,184 --> 00:51:39,155
What can we do? They already accepted money.

700
00:51:39,454 --> 00:51:40,925
How can we beat money?

701
00:51:42,355 --> 00:51:43,994
This is unbelievable.

702
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,275
- Hands up. - What is this?

703
00:52:14,695 --> 00:52:17,794
Consider yourselves lucky that we did not take things further.

704
00:52:17,795 --> 00:52:20,125
I dare you to try and come back. Got it?

705
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,864
If you do, we will seriously...

706
00:52:25,034 --> 00:52:26,235
- Let us go. - Darn it.

707
00:52:34,474 --> 00:52:36,244
I really cannot believe this.

708
00:52:36,914 --> 00:52:38,113
I know, right?

709
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:40,114
How could they do this to innocent outsiders?

710
00:52:40,384 --> 00:52:42,155
But why did they leave?

711
00:52:42,414 --> 00:52:43,585
How could they leave?

712
00:52:43,655 --> 00:52:46,324
I, Kang Han Soo, said I would file a lawsuit on their behalf.

713
00:52:46,425 --> 00:52:47,584
I said I would have her found innocent,

714
00:52:47,585 --> 00:52:49,453
not even a sentence of banishment or hard labour!

715
00:52:49,454 --> 00:52:50,594
(Hard labour: A legal punishment of doing manual labour)

716
00:52:50,795 --> 00:52:52,664
Are you angry at the young woman right now?

717
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:55,364
I just cannot believe it, you know?

718
00:52:55,565 --> 00:52:58,363
It is better than taking her case and things not going well.

719
00:52:58,364 --> 00:53:00,735
I said I would save her because I knew I could do it.

720
00:53:01,074 --> 00:53:02,275
How?

721
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,405
The law is meant to save people,

722
00:53:05,505 --> 00:53:07,375
not kill them.

723
00:53:10,045 --> 00:53:11,815
I wanted to give her that experience.

724
00:53:12,344 --> 00:53:14,045
The experience that the innocent live,

725
00:53:14,554 --> 00:53:16,084
and the guilty...

726
00:53:16,085 --> 00:53:18,485
eventually pay for their crimes.

727
00:53:20,855 --> 00:53:23,054
If she realizes that obvious truth,

728
00:53:24,324 --> 00:53:26,465
she would not make such a foolish choice like she did today...

729
00:53:27,664 --> 00:53:30,335
even when faced with another hardship.

730
00:53:30,965 --> 00:53:32,105
That was how...

731
00:53:32,465 --> 00:53:33,864
I wanted to root for the young woman...

732
00:53:34,505 --> 00:53:36,473
who chose to kill...

733
00:53:36,474 --> 00:53:38,145
rather than die herself.

734
00:53:41,145 --> 00:53:42,843
Gosh, but what does it matter?

735
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:44,445
She threw away her own good fortune.

736
00:53:45,485 --> 00:53:47,085
What if she comes back?

737
00:53:47,244 --> 00:53:49,155
Then will you save her as promised?

738
00:53:50,085 --> 00:53:52,355
Are you still against it?

739
00:53:53,954 --> 00:53:55,624
I believe that the crime of murder...

740
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:58,224
cannot be forgiven for whatever reason.

741
00:53:58,625 --> 00:53:59,663
So?

742
00:53:59,664 --> 00:54:01,295
Do you want that young woman to be punished?

743
00:54:03,264 --> 00:54:04,735
I do want to hear...

744
00:54:04,804 --> 00:54:07,235
how you will defend her side.

745
00:54:10,204 --> 00:54:12,804
Yes, I want to be persuaded by you.

746
00:54:14,474 --> 00:54:16,214
If you can persuade me,

747
00:54:16,215 --> 00:54:18,114
you could even persuade the King himself.

748
00:54:19,014 --> 00:54:20,414
The King, my foot.

749
00:54:21,954 --> 00:54:23,414
What are you two doing right now?

750
00:54:24,525 --> 00:54:26,125
Will you not try to untie these ropes?

751
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:29,324
Do not waste your energy.

752
00:54:30,025 --> 00:54:32,593
When the sun is about to go down, there will be a few peddlers...

753
00:54:32,594 --> 00:54:34,764
to come across from the Sanneomi Village over there.

754
00:54:36,895 --> 00:54:38,105
That is right.

755
00:54:38,764 --> 00:54:40,005
They will pass by.

756
00:54:40,505 --> 00:54:42,504
But I do not know if you remember this.

757
00:54:42,505 --> 00:54:44,875
From the Haeneomi Village on that side,

758
00:54:45,005 --> 00:54:47,344
a band of thieves show up after the sun sets.

759
00:54:50,045 --> 00:54:51,315
Oh, right.

760
00:54:51,344 --> 00:54:52,684
Oh, gosh. Hurry!

761
00:54:53,844 --> 00:54:56,114
The band of thieves!

762
00:54:57,485 --> 00:54:59,585
Oh, Hong... I mean, Lady Hong!

763
00:55:05,994 --> 00:55:07,195
Lady Hong!

764
00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:10,094
Why are you in this state?

765
00:55:12,804 --> 00:55:15,074
Thankfully, Lady Hong came alone.

766
00:55:15,505 --> 00:55:17,505
Unlike someone, who brought a group of people along.

767
00:55:24,884 --> 00:55:26,085
Mom.

768
00:55:26,485 --> 00:55:27,545
Yes?

769
00:55:28,114 --> 00:55:30,715
I want to have seasoned deodeok so badly.

770
00:55:34,054 --> 00:55:37,054
The deodeok in our village is the sweetest and tastiest.

771
00:55:42,664 --> 00:55:43,795
Young Sil,

772
00:55:45,965 --> 00:55:48,034
are you perhaps pregnant?

773
00:55:50,275 --> 00:55:51,774
When I was pregnant with you,

774
00:55:51,775 --> 00:55:54,045
I munched on deodeok roots so much.

775
00:55:55,275 --> 00:55:57,114
They say women take after their own moms for morning sickness.

776
00:55:59,414 --> 00:56:01,414
When did you last have your period?

777
00:56:01,755 --> 00:56:03,114
Did you have it in the past month?

778
00:56:05,954 --> 00:56:07,184
Mom...

779
00:56:07,224 --> 00:56:08,895
- What do I do? - Oh, dear.

780
00:56:09,454 --> 00:56:10,795
What do I do?

781
00:56:13,425 --> 00:56:15,164
What else can you do?

782
00:56:19,534 --> 00:56:20,764
Mom.

783
00:56:21,574 --> 00:56:23,105
I want to live.

784
00:56:23,934 --> 00:56:25,105
Of course.

785
00:56:25,675 --> 00:56:26,844
You should live.

786
00:56:27,105 --> 00:56:28,875
You are leaving now so you can live.

787
00:56:30,215 --> 00:56:31,584
If you go somewhere...

788
00:56:31,585 --> 00:56:33,485
and live off of the wilderness or something...

789
00:56:34,414 --> 00:56:35,755
Not like that.

790
00:56:36,284 --> 00:56:37,485
I want to live properly.

791
00:56:37,815 --> 00:56:39,155
I want to live like a human being.

792
00:56:40,054 --> 00:56:41,324
Sweetie.

793
00:56:42,695 --> 00:56:44,054
I want to file a lawsuit.

794
00:56:44,795 --> 00:56:46,124
I want to file a lawsuit...

795
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:47,695
and pay for my crimes with pride.

796
00:56:48,134 --> 00:56:50,065
And I want to live properly again.

797
00:56:50,195 --> 00:56:52,304
You will die if you file a lawsuit.

798
00:56:52,605 --> 00:56:54,633
Did you ever see someone live after committing murder?

799
00:56:54,634 --> 00:56:56,074
He says he can save me.

800
00:56:56,605 --> 00:56:58,144
That attorney says...

801
00:56:58,145 --> 00:56:59,803
that there is a way for me to live.

802
00:56:59,804 --> 00:57:01,275
How can you believe him?

803
00:57:01,474 --> 00:57:03,944
It will only be a gamble with your life at stake.

804
00:57:03,945 --> 00:57:06,044
I cannot make my child live its whole life in hiding...

805
00:57:06,045 --> 00:57:07,514
because of me.

806
00:57:08,855 --> 00:57:11,425
When it grows up, it will have to get married too.

807
00:57:15,525 --> 00:57:18,494
Still, what can we do now?

808
00:57:20,164 --> 00:57:22,934
We have already accepted money as a settlement.

809
00:57:22,994 --> 00:57:24,735
We can give it back.

810
00:57:25,204 --> 00:57:26,905
Where is my brother now?

811
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:32,005
Mom.

812
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:35,014
No.

813
00:57:35,775 --> 00:57:37,044
I cannot tell you.

814
00:57:37,045 --> 00:57:38,645
Your brother must live too.

815
00:57:40,914 --> 00:57:42,554
You are already...

816
00:57:46,425 --> 00:57:47,655
Already...

817
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:50,295
What?

818
00:57:52,164 --> 00:57:54,664
- Goodness. - I am already a lost cause?

819
00:57:55,594 --> 00:57:57,565
I am already a dead woman?

820
00:58:00,505 --> 00:58:02,074
Wait, Young Sil.

821
00:58:03,505 --> 00:58:04,675
Mom.

822
00:58:05,474 --> 00:58:06,675
You do not believe...

823
00:58:07,445 --> 00:58:08,875
that I can live.

824
00:58:11,215 --> 00:58:12,344
No.

825
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:14,585
You do not want me to live.

826
00:58:15,184 --> 00:58:17,214
You just want me to die, right?

827
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,384
No!

828
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:21,454
Young Sil! Sweetie!

829
00:58:21,954 --> 00:58:23,155
No!

830
00:58:24,525 --> 00:58:25,625
No...

831
00:59:12,175 --> 00:59:13,804
Where are they?

832
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,315
Who do you mean?

833
00:59:17,344 --> 00:59:18,744
The secret investigator.

834
00:59:19,414 --> 00:59:21,684
Out of the blue, he asked where the jade dragon was from...

835
00:59:21,855 --> 00:59:23,413
and left to meet Lady Park.

836
00:59:23,414 --> 00:59:25,054
We have not heard from him since then.

837
00:59:26,224 --> 00:59:29,125
- Maybe in the village... - He is no secret investigator.

838
00:59:30,925 --> 00:59:32,994
You got deceived.

839
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:37,534
Then do you know who they are?

840
00:59:45,244 --> 00:59:47,545
- We are here. - Gosh...

841
00:59:47,945 --> 00:59:49,473
- Goodness. - I am so tired.

842
00:59:49,474 --> 00:59:51,114
- Madam. - We are here.

843
00:59:51,684 --> 00:59:52,744
Finally.

844
00:59:54,184 --> 00:59:57,513
Madam, give me some water.

845
00:59:57,514 --> 00:59:59,724
- We are closed. - What?

846
01:00:01,625 --> 01:00:03,723
We have no rooms available nor do we have any food left.

847
01:00:03,724 --> 01:00:05,764
Just leave.

848
01:00:06,664 --> 01:00:07,895
Goodness.

849
01:00:07,994 --> 01:00:10,094
It is unusual for a merchant to turn down customers.

850
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,235
Why? Is it because we are not from this village?

851
01:00:17,005 --> 01:00:18,505
Have rumours spread already?

852
01:00:19,505 --> 01:00:22,674
That my people stirred up the village...

853
01:00:22,675 --> 01:00:23,815
or something like that?

854
01:00:27,184 --> 01:00:28,215
Goodness.

855
01:00:30,255 --> 01:00:31,654
Given the shoes on the racks,

856
01:00:31,655 --> 01:00:33,384
the corner room is empty.

857
01:00:37,755 --> 01:00:39,324
And smoke is coming out from the kitchen.

858
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:41,735
My guess is that you are in the middle of cooking.

859
01:00:42,065 --> 01:00:43,164
Gosh.

860
01:00:46,804 --> 01:00:49,434
Share the room or whatever.

861
01:00:49,574 --> 01:00:52,145
I am too tired, so have dinner on your own.

862
01:00:52,744 --> 01:00:53,804
We will do so.

863
01:01:39,855 --> 01:01:41,593
It is hot by the furnace.

864
01:01:41,594 --> 01:01:42,695
Do it outside.

865
01:01:45,025 --> 01:01:46,125
Oh, okay.

866
01:02:39,585 --> 01:02:40,614
Han Soo.

867
01:02:41,114 --> 01:02:43,514
What could be here? The granny is dead, and the house is empty.

868
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:47,884
If we get caught,

869
01:02:48,085 --> 01:02:49,925
we will be done for.

870
01:02:50,324 --> 01:02:52,895
I should have taken that woman's lawsuit.

871
01:02:53,594 --> 01:02:55,894
Only then, I would have used that as an excuse...

872
01:02:55,895 --> 01:02:57,735
to search the government office and village.

873
01:02:59,034 --> 01:03:01,065
Is that why you wanted to take it?

874
01:03:01,675 --> 01:03:03,835
- If not? - I mean,

875
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:07,174
it is so different from what you said to So Won.

876
01:03:07,175 --> 01:03:09,414
What was that?

877
01:03:10,545 --> 01:03:13,513
"I wanted to root for the young woman..."

878
01:03:13,514 --> 01:03:15,315
"who chose to kill rather than die herself."

879
01:03:16,884 --> 01:03:18,485
- Gosh. - Goodness.

880
01:03:19,655 --> 01:03:22,723
I almost thought...

881
01:03:22,724 --> 01:03:26,364
an admirable attorney came from this poor village.

882
01:03:27,425 --> 01:03:29,934
I meant what I said.

883
01:03:30,465 --> 01:03:32,134
It is just that I meant more than what I said.

884
01:03:33,804 --> 01:03:35,474
Keep looking. I will check the room next door.

885
01:03:40,945 --> 01:03:42,244
"I meant what I said."

886
01:04:00,224 --> 01:04:01,264
Gosh.

887
01:04:07,204 --> 01:04:09,204
I knew you would come again.

888
01:04:10,074 --> 01:04:13,474
Gosh, I got the wrong room. I apologize.

889
01:04:13,645 --> 01:04:15,514
Han Soo.

890
01:04:19,014 --> 01:04:20,384
It has been a long time.

891
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:30,755
I am surprised you became an attorney.

892
01:04:32,395 --> 01:04:35,195
I thought you would despise the law.

893
01:04:36,395 --> 01:04:39,703
"You live on what you have learned."

894
01:04:39,704 --> 01:04:41,034
People say that for a reason.

895
01:04:41,905 --> 01:04:44,474
Father!

896
01:04:45,445 --> 01:04:46,704
Father.

897
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:50,445
Young Sil ended up coming back.

898
01:05:02,454 --> 01:05:03,925
You should just leave.

899
01:05:06,965 --> 01:05:09,235
Stay out of this business.

900
01:05:15,235 --> 01:05:17,405
Why do you want to hide it so much?

901
01:05:22,514 --> 01:05:23,945
Jeong Wol.

902
01:05:24,614 --> 01:05:25,914
Come here.

903
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:28,954
Come over here.

904
01:05:30,855 --> 01:05:32,554
Gosh, that startled me.

905
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:57,315
You know better than anyone else...

906
01:05:58,715 --> 01:06:01,114
that the government office, the law,

907
01:06:02,014 --> 01:06:03,784
and the country cannot be trusted.

908
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:08,925
The court of laws...

909
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:11,895
is where your father died.

910
01:06:13,724 --> 01:06:15,065
Were you aware?

911
01:06:24,735 --> 01:06:26,405
You should have told me.

912
01:06:27,945 --> 01:06:29,974
If you still want to know,

913
01:06:31,014 --> 01:06:32,784
leave quietly.

914
01:06:33,744 --> 01:06:34,784
Then,

915
01:06:35,755 --> 01:06:37,715
I will tell you everything.

916
01:06:53,364 --> 01:06:56,504
- No, Han Soo! - Why are you doing this?

917
01:06:56,505 --> 01:06:58,034
- We did nothing wrong. - No! Han Soo!

918
01:07:39,414 --> 01:07:42,914
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

919
01:07:43,655 --> 01:07:47,025
(Special thanks to Kang Shin Il for his guest appearance)

920
01:07:52,125 --> 01:07:53,895
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

921
01:07:54,494 --> 01:07:55,663
Are you insane?

922
01:07:55,664 --> 01:07:57,965
Are you not even curious about what the village head knows?

923
01:07:58,134 --> 01:08:00,163
And to be honest, we are not even sure...

924
01:08:00,164 --> 01:08:02,804
whether we can save that woman or not.

925
01:08:06,405 --> 01:08:09,544
Young people these days do not know when to stop.

926
01:08:10,445 --> 01:08:12,115
They act up without knowing their place.

927
01:08:13,945 --> 01:08:17,115
You promised. That we will be each other's calming medicine.

928
01:08:18,084 --> 01:08:19,285
That we will always be together.

929
01:08:20,254 --> 01:08:21,525
When did you...

930
01:08:21,754 --> 01:08:23,424
let Attorney Kang in your heart?

931
01:08:24,594 --> 01:08:26,325
If it has not been long,

932
01:08:28,094 --> 01:08:29,264
get him out already.
