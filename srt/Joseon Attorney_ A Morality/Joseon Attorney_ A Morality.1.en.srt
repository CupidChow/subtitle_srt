(Characters, incidents, and period depicted are purely fictional.)

2
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:48,620
The lost spirits of those who died an unfair death...

3
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,919
wander on the other side to harass people...

4
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,020
and create natural disasters.

5
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,160
The law is one fair thing to all, among noblemen,

6
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:01,089
commoners, and slaves alike.

7
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,360
The people filed lawsuits...

8
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,629
to complain of injustice to their rulers.

9
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:09,800
And there came those who assisted the uneducated...

10
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:12,610
through their lawsuits.

11
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,440
People called them attorneys.

12
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,750
- Gosh. - This is great.

13
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,720
We are finally in Hanyang.

14
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,089
What will you do next?

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,429
I must establish an attorney's office.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,200
You have used your entire savings from the countryside...

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,629
to pay for that ship ride.

18
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,039
Nobody comes to Hanyang without a story to tell,

19
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:46,509
and nobody leaves Hanyang without a story.

20
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:49,979
Do you not understand?

21
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:53,910
Every single person you see now is a source of my finance.

22
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,250
This is the best place to open an office.

23
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:02,189
What do you mean by this place?

24
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:05,730
Here.

25
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,100
Pardon?

26
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:12,070
This place even smells different.

27
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,640
Something smells fishy.

28
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:21,640
I love it. The smell of Hanyang.

31
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:41,730
How much is this?

32
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,029
- This looks nice. - Get your fish!

33
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,230
Come and get your fish!

34
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,999
Come and buy some hats.

35
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,100
I have bamboo hats too! Come and buy some hats.

36
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:01,920
Two bowls of rice soup.

37
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,950
All right.

38
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,850
I have the most delicious rice soup in Hanyang for you.

39
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,459
- Excuse me. - Yes!

40
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:10,920
- Enjoy your food. - Of course.

41
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,390
- Eat up. - Let us eat.

Goodness, thank you.

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,770
On top of that,

46
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:26,209
let me share my condolences in advance.

47
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:28,839
You should get a nice casket...

48
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,610
on his way to the other world.

49
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,719
Thank you, Lady Hong.

50
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,350
I hope the funeral goes well without trouble.

51
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,649
Thank you.

52
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,860
A cold drink for you.

53
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:54,429
At first,

54
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:58,110
you were like the youngest daughter of a ruined nobleman,

55
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,939
but now, you look nothing more than a servant girl.

56

No one will come freely and ask for help...

57

at a merchant house operated by a princess.

58
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,620
What kind of a princess opens up a merchant house, to begin with?

59
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,120
That is why I did it.

60
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,520
No one else could do it,

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,890
and someone had to.

62
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,520
Prin...

63
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,299
Principal...

64
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,130
in four digits.

65
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,830
A principal in four digits.

66
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,299
How much is that?

67
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,979
You must do it like this,

68
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,640
Lady Hong, the owner.

69
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:40,209
Enjoy your beverage.

- Over here! I need one! - Give me a moment.

76
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,270
- Me too. - I was next!

77
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,969
- Take this! - Thank you.

78
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:09,209
This is awful!

79
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,820
The plum wine down the street has a much better fragrance.

80
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,120
What is wrong with your wine?

81
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,320
Can you tell me where it is too?

82
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,390
Why is this wine so bland?

83
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,789
- This is awful. - I want to know too!

84
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,200
What?

85
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,120
- Goodness. - You are here.

- Over here. - I need a drink.

89

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,330
I would like a glass too!

Goodness!

96

How dare you sell plum wine here?

97

Goodness, no!

98
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,479
Move aside, old hag.

99
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,520
Mother!

100
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,190
This is not a show for you!

Go, my son!

105
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,729
Get him.

106
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,000
Get him!

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,219
Pardon me!

110
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,649
Move!

111
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,359
You!

112
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,240
Out of my way!

113
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:21,880
Move!

114
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,140
Stop!

115
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,810
Come on, eat some.

116
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,909
No?

117
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,020
Please let me hide here.

118
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,919
I will get beaten to death once they catch me.

119
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,820
I cannot let you die. Please hide behind the stable.

120
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,859
Where did you go, you scoundrel?

121
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,159
Come out!

122
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,930
- We are going to find you! - A little more. Into the corner.

123
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,399
Darn it!

124
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,169
Where is he?

125
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,070
You.

126
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:53,870
Did you see anybody who just ran inside?

127
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,549
Where are you?

128
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:02,120
- Find him. - Good grief!

129
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,380
You better find him quickly.

130
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:06,990
There he is!

131
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,560
- You. - Get over here.

132
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:10,990
Good grief.

133
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,840
This is why...

134
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,340
you should have obeyed and given us our commission.

135
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,210
How dare you sell plum wine without our guild's permission?

136
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,809
You thieves!

137
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,949
I started the business first,

138
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:37,279
and I used my rice to make that wine!

139
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,220
Why are you entitled to a commission?

140
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,919
Get up.

141
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,929
You still do not get it, do you?

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,130
Get up.

143
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,000
Stop!

144
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,169
Who do you think...

145
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,610
Who are you...

146
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,309
Who is that?

147
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,149
Who are you?

148
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,960
What?

149
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,100
Let us go.

150
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,730
Get up.

151
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,939
What are you all doing in the backyard of my merchant house?

152
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:36,380
What do you want? Who are you?

153
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,380
She is the owner of Sowongak, Lady Hong.

154
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,120
Salted shrimp. Wine jugs.

155
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,250
Broken fodder and manger.

156
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,990
The damage is approximately 50 nyang, at least.

157
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,829
Are you standing around to pay for the damage?

158
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,299
Good grief.

159
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,470
Gosh.

160
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,510
Come on.

161
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,750
You got lucky.

162
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,360
Oh, boy. All this mess.

163
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:23,520
Oh, no.

164
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,529
That is okay. You may go.

165
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,100
- Pardon? - I only said it to scare them off.

166
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,569
Do not worry, and get going.

167
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,909
But these are very valuable.

168
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:46,049
Thank you, my lady.

169
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,809
Thanks, So Won.

170
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,449
I appreciate it, my lady.

171
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,890
Who were those ruffians?

172
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:01,590
They are part of Jang's guild.

173
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,199
Look into it.

174
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,630
Yes, my lady.

175
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,079
Alcohol that you cannot sell is worth less than waste water.

176
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,390
What a cold world.

177
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:36,659
Do you want me to starve to death?

178
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,380
(Attorney...)

179
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,960
(Attorney for Hire)

180
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,860
(We welcome advance payments.)

181
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,970
We meet again.

182
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:17,000
Are you really an attorney?

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,010
That is right. I am...

184
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,110
an attorney, Kang Han Soo.

185
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,740
You scum!

186
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:28,779
Why are you taking it out on me?

187
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:30,520
I was not the one that caused you distress.

188
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,860
You must help when you see someone in need.

189
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,860
But you are an attorney at that.

190
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,529
At the time, you had not hired me yet.

191
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,600
I...

192
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,569
only work for coins.

193
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,770
Excuse me?

194
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,340
Do you feel unfairly treated and upset?

195
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:56,340
Then file a lawsuit.

196
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,579
It is easier and faster...

197
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:00,350
to use the law than look for justice.

198
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,380
I would rather...

199
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,189
drown myself to death before I trusted you.

200
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,220
Where would you...

201
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:13,490
drown yourself?

202
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,130
Lunatic.

203
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,409
Do you have other means of living?

204
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,309
Worry and cry yourself to sleep for months.

205
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:35,279
See if anybody listens to you.

206
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,250
I simply offered to help to get you out of the predicament,

207
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,250
and you punched me in my face.

208
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,659
That is exactly why your life is so pathetic.

209
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,529
- Honey! - Dad!

210
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,799
What are you doing here?

211
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,240
What happened to your face?

212
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:56,600
Let us go home.

213
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,270
Come on.

214
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,069
That hurts.

215
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,809
Why you little... Come inside.

216
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,710
- You are hitting me too? - Just come in.

217
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,319
- Get in there. - Hey!

218
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,449
Have you lost your senses?

219
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:16,659
I went through so much trouble to bring that client!

220
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,230
He is not ready yet.

221
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:20,789
A lawsuit takes time.

222
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:22,659
Most of my clients started it without preparation...

223
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:24,399
and gave up along the way.

224
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,740
To prevent them from faltering...

225
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:32,039
due to any type of variables and temptations,

226
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:36,279
I must push them to the very edge of the cliff.

227
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:39,449
"The very edge?"

228
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,980
I am Park who sells plum wine.

229
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,990
- Will you help me with... - No.

230
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,250
Find somebody else.

231
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,559
Attorney, I sell plum wine to Jang's guild.

232
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,760
No, I cannot take it.

233
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,460
I cannot win against Jang's guild.

234
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,699
Get out of here.

235
00:14:58,699 --> 00:14:59,699
No!

236
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,770
Oh, boy.

237
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,390
Gosh.

238
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:48,350
I am certain he will come.

239
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,579
He will not have a choice.

240
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,569
You are leaving Hanyang?

241
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,569
But you were born and raised here in your hometown.

242
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:16,380
You have had that job for your whole life.

243
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,149
I have nowhere to depend on or turn to.

244
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,120
What is the point of a hometown?

245
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,289
There must be a way.

246
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,789
Hang in there, and...

247
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:33,760
I have endured long enough.

248
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,399
I would file a lawsuit,

249
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:40,600
but the only attorney that will take my case is that scumbag, Han Soo.

250
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,140
I will pay you back.

251
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,240
Thank you, So Won.

252
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,190
Your Majesty, Princess Yeon Joo has come.

253
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,099
- Your Majesty. - Sister.

254
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,470
Where did all these carp come from?

255
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,940
People must have caught them.

256
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,849
People like to catch and lock up anything they find, I see.

257
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:37,480
I am no different from a carp that has been caught unluckily.

258
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,059
Well...

259
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,930
Then, I guess I got lucky.

260
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,460
Thanks to my father's early death,

261
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,869
I live freely off the palace.

262
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,000
That is not what I mean.

263
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,710
I know. It was a joke.

264
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,210
I can never make a joke around you.

265
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,609
I do not know of anything else,

266
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,720
but do not joke about the royal throne.

267
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,849
After our uncle passed away so early,

268
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,359
I took this throne before my own brother.

269
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:20,089
I am on pins and needles.

270
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,660
I am also ashamed in front of you and the other siblings.

271
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:27,599
Why do you keep calling upon me if you are ashamed?

272
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,539
Because no one else will tell me true stories.

273
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,980
Now, what entertaining story do you have for me today?

274
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:50,559
It smells quite deep and flavourful.

275
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,990
Yes, it is alcohol.

276
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,559
This plum wine was made with the recipe that has been...

277
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,700
passed down for three generations.

278
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,569
It feels like a waste to drink it alone, right?

279
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,639
Would you like some?

280
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:09,309
I want the people...

281
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:11,879
to experience this taste as well.

282
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,510
But Jang's guild...

283
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,950
monopolizes liquor dealings in the capital.

284
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,789
Thus, other guilds like Jang's...

285
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:21,889
get kicked out, let alone do business as they want.

286
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:24,789
Because power means the law to them.

287
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:26,529
So we should make a path...

288
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,690
for small merchants to freely do business.

289
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,599
Yes, we should.

290
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:34,329
I may be a regent,

291
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,069
but I am still the King.

292
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:37,970
This kind of agenda is no big deal.

293
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:42,879
Then let me drink the rest...

294
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,710
Would you like some more?

295
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,650
I am Attorney Kang Han Soo.

296
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,720
Here, I am Attorney Kang Han Soo.

297
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,819
If you are wronged or resentful, just come to me.

298
00:20:56,819 --> 00:20:59,089
I will make you win your trial. You can count on me.

299
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,289
Pay 1 nyang to gain 10 nyang.

300
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:03,000
- I am Attorney Kang Han Soo. - What is this?

301
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,359
- If you are wronged or resentful, - Who is this guy?

302
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,869
just let me know.

303
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,730
- I will make you win your trial. - An attorney?

304
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,970
- Darn it. - I will defend you with devotion.

305
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:13,510
I can win any trial.

306
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,940
I am Attorney Kang Han Soo.

307
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,240
All right, I am Attorney Kang Han Soo.

308
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,000
A slave against a master.

309
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,460
A son against a father.

310
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,599
I am here to resolve your concerns.

311
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,569
I am Attorney Kang Han Soo. Here you go, lady.

312
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,299
I am Attorney Kang Han Soo.

313
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:46,510
I will make you win your trial. You can count on me.

314
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,109
(Attorney for Hire, Kang Han Soo)

315
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,440
"Kang Han Soo?"

316
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:52,779
I have never lost a single trial.

317
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:53,910
Gosh.

318
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,349
What?

319
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,920
I can win any trial.

320
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,450
I am Kang Han Soo, the best attorney in Joseon.

321
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,889
Despicable scum.

322
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:08,990
Who was that?

323
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:11,529
Han Soo!

324
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:15,629
We have a serious problem.

325
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,369
What is it?

326
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,069
I think...

327
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:20,940
Park is going to leave Hanyang.

328
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,010
He is packing his stuff.

329
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:30,180
Gosh...

330
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,349
- Well... - Come quick!

331
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,690
Executive Minister Yoo.

332
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,660
Eunuch Ko is here to meet you.

333
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,710
Executive Minister Yoo.

334
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,839
His Majesty is asking to see you.

335
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:59,039
(His Majesty: A respected way to address a king)

336
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,779
I have an urgent meeting to attend.

337
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,779
Tell him I will go afterwards.

338
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:09,920
Sure.

339
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,599
Then this agenda...

340
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,799
will be handed to the Ministry of Law Enforcement.

341
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,639
It is burning well.

342
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:40,510
Oh, dear.

343
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:53,389
- Fire! - It's a fire!

344
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:55,160
Fire!

345
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,760
- Gosh. - Fire!

346
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,569
Oh, no!

347
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:01,369
- Goodness. - Fire!

348
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,400
Oh, my.

349
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,010
Goodness.

350
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:08,940
My goodness.

351
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,410
Mother!

352
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:12,379
Honey!

353
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,279
Mother! Oh, no.

354
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,879
What do we do?

355
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,529
How are we going to support our living now?

356
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:29,829
What a great waste.

357
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:32,799
Goodness. What do we do?

358
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,599
What are we going to do?

359
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,299
Goodness.

360
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,279
I beg you.

361
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,720
Please...

362
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,190
be our attorney.

363
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:10,339
Are you trying to mock me?

364
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,770
I have desperately come...

365
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,270
You did not eat yet, did you?

366
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:18,480
We were just about to have a late-night snack.

367
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,920
Take a seat.

368
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,720
Make yourself comfortable.

369
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,990
All right.

370
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,990
Enjoy.

371
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,990
Eating comes first in any situation.

372
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:49,879
You came to the right place.

373
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,279
Attorney Kang Han Soo...

374
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,510
came to Hanyang only about a month ago,

375
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:57,549
but he is already renowned...

376
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,490
in Gyeongsang, Jeolla, and Chungcheong.

377
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:02,349
Regardless of any law that is involved,

378
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:04,319
he wins every trial he takes.

379
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,760
He has never lost before.

380
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,859
From now on, I will be your attorney...

381
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:11,660
and your last hope.

382
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:16,369
I have packed some for your family, so do not refuse.

383
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,480
I guess...

384
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,750
I was mistaken about you.

385
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,549
I am sorry.

386
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:36,420
How heartwarming.

387
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,589
All right.

388
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:40,059
From now on,

389
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,430
we will treat you like our older brother.

390
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:43,960
What, older brother?

391
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,329
Yes, brother.

392
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:46,670
Treat us...

393
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,770
- like your younger brothers. - Younger brothers.

394
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,770
Because I will be your younger cousin...

395
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,770
and introduce myself as your cousin to the judge.

396
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,240
Sure.

397
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:03,980
Do you not ask why?

398
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,279
I have heard.

399
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:09,990
Some from the Department of Justice see attorneys as louts and frauds.

400
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,760
So when they defend a client, they fake themselves as a relative.

401
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,430
That is not the only reason.

402
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,129
It is so that...

403
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,400
I will handle...

404
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,539
this lawsuit with devotion.

405
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,539
Yes, of course.

406
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,440
All right.

407
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:33,480
Then now,

408
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,220
please sign it,

409
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:38,750
brother.

410
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,329
No!

411
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,430
So Won?

412
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,230
Do you not know him?

413
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,099
It is that punk from the other day.

414
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,700
Yes, I know.

415
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,400
I know,

416
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,069
but all the other attorneys have turned down my request...

417
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:03,010
after knowing that I was against Jang's guild.

418
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,010
I do know about this guy's rude attitude,

419
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,750
but who knows?

420
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,549
He might win this lawsuit with that temper of his.

421
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,760
A bad temper cannot make you win.

422
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,230
It is better to persuade the judge by explaining your story genuinely.

423
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,029
Genuinely?

424
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:31,799
Do you still believe such a thing works?

425
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:34,270
It is not that I believe. It is what I desire.

426
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,339
If I wish and desire, the reality might become at least a bit better.

427
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,579
So,

428
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:39,750
has it changed?

429
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,960
Wait, no!

430
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,520
There you go.

431
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,059
Good thinking, brother.

432
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,059
I will count on him.

433
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,430
That is...

434
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:04,069
the only thing I can do now.

435
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,589
Look.

436
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,289
Great, yes?

437
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,730
Sir.

438
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:32,129
Please wait a little more. Actually, I...

439
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,299
I...

440
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,440
Give me a moment.

441
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,920
Along with an apology, His Majesty told me...

442
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,849
to pass along that His Majesty could not help.

443
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,039
What was that? A lawsuit?

444
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,579
Truly, a lawsuit?

445
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,490
Do you not know our guild is in an important period right now?

446
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,220
Answer me!

447
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,359
- We do know. - We do know.

448
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:35,029
And yet, you made such a mess?

449
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,160
This guild was wandering around in the countryside.

450
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,730
But I worked my fingers to the bone.

451
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,569
And now, we are in a crucial moment...

452
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:42,529
where we might supply the goods to Hanyang.

453
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,740
But what? We were what?

454
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,569
Of all things, a lawsuit? We got sued?

455
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,910
We were simply trying to teach them the custom of our guild.

456
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,980
Should we also look for a famous attorney?

457
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,990
Shut your mouth! Do not do a thing!

458
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,220
Why waste money on an attorney?

459
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,690
You see, money...

460
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:12,200
should be used for things that are worth it.

461
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,639
You useless jerks.

462
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,940
Along with an apology, His Majesty told me...

463
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,809
to pass along that His Majesty could not help.

464
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,000
Darn it. This was not part of the plan.

465
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,270
But this cost me a fortune.

466
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:26,639
Farewell.

467
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,520
Do not tell me...

468
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,069
I knew it.

469
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,270
So it was your doing?

470
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:00,809
And if it was?

471
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:02,770
I will report you to the government office at once.

472
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,079
Then who will take charge of Park's lawsuit?

473
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,480
Is it important to punish someone or to save someone?

474
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,619
Think about it.

475
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,590
I will not run away anywhere.

476
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,239
- He will lose, no question asked. - You never know.

477
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,710
- Gosh. - Is it today?

478
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,949
There is no way he can win against Jang's guild.

479
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,210
That is nonsense.

480
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,420
- How come? - Jang's guild is too powerful.

481
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:34,170
The good-looking man next to Park...

482
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,829
is the attorney Kang Han Soo.

483
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,139
What is wrong with him?

484
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,610
Did he eat something weird?

485
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:42,110
Why is he glaring at me?

486
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,380
Do not get cold feet.

487
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,550
Confidence is everything when it comes to a lawsuit.

488
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:54,889
Understood.

489
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,770
The plaintiff and defendant, read out your agreed oath.

490
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,070
(Agreed oath: A document stating an agreement...)

491
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,369
(between the parties to commence a lawsuit)

492
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,349
- We will undergo... - We will undergo...

493
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:24,820
- a fair lawsuit. - a fair lawsuit.

494
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,920
- Please rule justly... - Please rule justly...

495
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,150
- according to the law. - according to the law.

496
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:35,659
As I am a hillbilly, this is my first lawsuit.

497
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,559
Who is suing who?

498
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,500
And plaintiff and defendant?

499
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,429
What on earth do those mean?

500
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,869
Like I would know.

501
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,110
Think of it simply.

502
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,539
The one with the grudge who filed the lawsuit is the plaintiff.

503
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,909
The one who has to fight against them is the defendant.

504
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,349
I see.

505
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,949
So the plaintiff has a grudge.

506
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:03,759
And the defendant has to fight.

507
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,989
Yes, that is right.

508
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,869
What is this?

509
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,440
It contains pieces of evidence sent from Jang's guild.

510
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,780
He made a special request that you take...

511
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,750
a thorough look at them.

512
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,219
Goodness.

513
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:38,759
There is quite a lot of evidence.

514
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,130
All right. I will do so.

515
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,270
The plaintiff, Park,

516
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:51,270
filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Jang's guild,

517
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,309
demanding compensation for the damages...

518
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:57,539
on the grounds of violence, obstruction of business,

519
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,409
property damage, and more.

520
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:05,150
Now then, plaintiff Park,

521
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,090
begin your oral statement.

522
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,489
I barely make ends meet in my family of four, including my old mother,

523
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,090
selling 1 or 2 jars of plum wine a day.

524
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:17,800
But to close my business?

525
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:21,329
To put it bluntly, how is the fall in plum wine sales...

526
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:23,130
of Jang's guild my fault?

527
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,539
And to force me to pay commissions?

528
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,539
It feels incredibly unfair.

529
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:30,210
Goodness. What do mean by force?

530
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Magistrate.

531
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,250
My guild runs a legal business, paying taxes...

532
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,650
to the country every time.

533
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:38,380
If my guild's rights are violated,

534
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,449
should the country not protect my guild?

535
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,420
You are right. I am well aware.

536
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,829
Thanks to Jang's guild,

537
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,730
the marketplace in Mapo...

538
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:53,159
has become quite active.

539
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,130
Moreover, Jang's guild is paying...

540
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,900
quite a large sum of taxes.

541
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,800
We, too, pay taxes.

542
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:03,980
And a whopping four bills every month.

543
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,179
It states in the statute...

544
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,449
that every business pays four bills every month.

545
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,550
We only did business according to the national law,

546
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,789
so what did we do so wrong?

547
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:17,420
"National law?"

548
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,590
Is that...

549
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:25,429
even stated in the statute?

550
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,539
We simply followed the customs.

551
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,110
Alcohol is usually...

552
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,809
manufactured and distributed by one guild in each region.

553
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:38,079
Here.

554
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,309
There was a similar conflict in another region in the past.

555
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:45,619
Even then, the country ruled in favour...

556
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,489
of the official guild, not the street vendor.

557
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:50,559
I am handing in a copy of the case as evidence.

558
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,489
Hey!

559
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,940
What did you say?

560
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,110
- What was that? - What language did he speak?

561
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,320
I could not understand a thing.

562
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,320
Speak our language, will you? Our language.

563
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,349
That is my point.

564
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,460
We must speak our language in our country to communicate.

565
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,159
It is the same with the law!

566
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:29,759
However, why does he bring...

567
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:33,099
this absurd precedent from the Ming Dynasty?

568
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,679
I do not mean to brag,

569
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,110
but I remember everything I studied,

570
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,179
from the law books to regular books, and even the state newspaper.

571
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,949
I remember everything I see with my eyes.

572
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:51,949
(State newspaper: Government-issued newspaper)

573
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,270
Therefore,

574
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,840
I clearly remember this.

575
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,639
The precedent Merchant Cho brought is...

576
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:21,349
from the 4th month, the 3rd day of the Year of the White Tiger,

577
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:23,110
a decision made in the Ming Dynasty, not Joseon!

578
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,989
Also, this is just a summary, so the date, the location,

579
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:29,150
and other details are omitted from this scroll.

580
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,489
Let me ask you one more time, Magistrate.

581
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,199
Where are we right now?

582
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,329
Joseon?

583
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:40,869
Who are we?

584
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:44,639
The people of Joseon?

585
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,809
Do you abide by the national law...

586
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:49,869
of our own, Joseon's law?

587
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:52,210
Or the precedent from the Ming Dynasty,

588
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,849
as Jang's guild brought?

589
00:41:53,949 --> 00:41:55,579
- You are right! - I agree with him!

590
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,710
He is right!

591
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,020
Where are we?

592
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:08,889
Joseon!

593
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,929
Where are we?

594
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,960
- Joseon! - Joseon!

595
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,369
Who are we?

596
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:16,400
- The people of Joseon! - The people of Joseon!

597
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,969
What is our law?

598
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:19,469
- Joseon's law! - Joseon's law!

599
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:22,739
So why should we decide according to Ming's precedent?

600
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:24,679
Do you not think so, everyone?

601
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,440
- You are right! - You are right!

602
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,250
- That is right! - Yes, that is right!

603
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,530
Under these principles, he must have permission to sell plum wine...

604
00:42:44,659 --> 00:42:46,730
and receive compensation for the damages they caused...

605
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,099
to turn this into a fair decision.

606
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,409
Will you not stay for the decision?

607
00:42:58,579 --> 00:42:59,980
The decision has been made.

608
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,809
If he sides with the guild,

609
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:04,679
he will be framed as a traitor.

610
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,150
That magistrate...

611
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,820
does not have a lot of choices.

612
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:19,960
Jang's guild.

613
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,099
From now on,

614
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:28,639
do not disturb Park's business anymore,

615
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,880
and you must compensate...

616
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:33,280
for the damages you caused.

617
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:45,759
Magistrate.

618
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,259
Magistrate!

619
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:48,630
Wait, Magistrate!

620
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,530
- Stop. - The lawsuit is not over.

621
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,000
I will...

622
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:57,000
- Kang Han Soo! - Kang Han Soo!

623
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,369
- Kang Han Soo! - Kang Han Soo!

624
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:04,980
- Kang Han Soo! - Kang Han Soo!

625
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,050
The late King put so much work into the law book,

626
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,210
and it finally came to fruition.

627
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,719
- Kang Han Soo! - Kang Han Soo!

628
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:13,079
Yes, he is not so bad.

629
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:16,119
Even the district magistrate is yet to be well-versed in the law,

630
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,759
yet he knows everything by heart.

631
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,829
What an extraordinary man.

632
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:22,929
On top of that,

633
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:24,860
that mere attorney did...

634
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,300
something even His Majesty has given up on.

635
00:44:28,429 --> 00:44:34,570
- Kang Han Soo! - Kang Han Soo!

636
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:37,309
- Kang Han Soo! - Kang Han Soo!

637
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,320
How did you know I would bring the wrong precedent?

638
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,389
By walking in your shoes.

639
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,190
If I were the attorney for Jang's guild,

640
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,929
I thought I would go back to every single precedent there is.

641
00:44:58,259 --> 00:45:00,259
However, most precedent books...

642
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:02,369
come as summaries.

643
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,639
Not a lot of attorneys bother to look up the originals.

644
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:06,770
Why?

645
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,009
Because they are lazy.

646
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,509
Where have you seen the original?

647
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,679
I have not.

648
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,719
What?

649
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,550
Thankfully, our dear magistrate was also a lazy man, so he let it pass.

650
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,820
Therefore,

651
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,659
if you wish to lodge an appeal,

652
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,460
do it to the magistrate, who gets a lot...

653
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,590
of tax money from the people,

654
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:31,900
instead of me.

655
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,340
(Final Decision)

656
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:46,980
Goodness.

657
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,309
So?

658
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:51,219
Do you feel like you are now free from injustice?

659
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:53,119
Goodness, of course.

660
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,650
I had to avoid the guild's eyes to conduct my business,

661
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,719
and that frustration is now completely gone.

662
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,070
Why...

663
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,309
Then you must pay the price for lifting that frustration...

664
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:23,679
along with this decision.

665
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:26,380
Sorry?

666
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,489
"Sorry?"

667
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,250
You promised to pay him if he wins your case.

668
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,520
Do you not remember?

669
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:33,119
I do remember.

670
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,730
I can now sell plum wine,

671
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:36,789
so I will do that on the market day...

672
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:39,360
I see. You cannot pay him now?

673
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:42,969
Are you changing your words now that you won your case?

674
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:44,739
No, that is not what I mean.

675
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:48,239
My house is burnt down,

676
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,940
and I do not have any money right now.

677
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,179
- What is with you... - No, Dong Chi.

678
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,650
Do not worry.

679
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,880
We take goods as well.

680
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,989
Sorry?

681
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:02,949
Let us go.

682
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:05,520
Now, let us go.

683
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:22,610
- Han Soo. - Yes?

684
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,179
Why are you doing this to us?

685
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:29,179
How will I pay respect to my late father without those utensils?

686
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,150
There is no use in paying respect without paying us first.

687
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:35,150
How can your father accept your rite in peace?

688
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,789
You two are awful!

689
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,190
Awful?

690
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,690
We just saved you on the verge of death!

691
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,800
You are the awful one for yelling at us like that!

692
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,000
Goodness.

693
00:47:53,469 --> 00:47:54,969
Give them everything.

694
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:59,539
We got to start our business again thanks to these men.

695
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,780
We can always make more money.

696
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:06,750
But you cannot pay back his kindness if you do not do it now.

697
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:10,050
But...

698
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:16,460
Thank you for your thoughtful words.

699
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,400
I hope you live a long, healthy life.

700
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:28,610
What are you doing?

701
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,039
Can you not tell? Getting my attorney's fee.

702
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,750
Did you do that...

703
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:37,380
just to take such petty articles from them?

704
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,579
Petty articles?

705
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:42,349
How are you any different from Master Jang?

706
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,159
He is a man who came to suffocate him,

707
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:50,429
and I am his saviour, who came to his rescue.

708
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,400
Do you not think I am entitled to some fee?

709
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:56,400
You are a money-grubbing villain.

710
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,469
Do you know why blood smells like iron?

711
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,480
That is the smell of money.

712
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:07,110
People love money so much...

713
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,349
that even their blood smells like it.

714
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,679
There they are.

715
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:18,659
He set Park's home on fire.

716
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,289
What are you doing?

717
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,059
Wait.

718
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:29,070
Wait, Han Soo!

719
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,400
What is going on? Han Soo!

720
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,500
It really was not Jang's guild,

721
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:34,969
but you, Attorney Kang?

722
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,530
They say once people solve their own problems,

723
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:57,090
their attitude suddenly changes.

724
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,860
That man Park,

725
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,429
is doing this because he does not want to pay you.

726
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:05,369
He looks so kind, but inside that man is...

727
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,469
- I set the house on fire. - Yes.

728
00:50:07,469 --> 00:50:09,009
I set the house on fire.

729
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:11,809
What?

730
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,409
That is why I got hurt.

731
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:14,710
Really?

732
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,710
Why?

733
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,179
Why did you do that?

734
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:23,750
Park came to me just in time thanks to the fire.

735
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:29,730
Thanks to you,

736
00:50:30,929 --> 00:50:32,860
I will not die a natural death.

737
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,840
You set fire to a stranger's house!

738
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:39,400
Arson is...

739
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:41,940
punished by beheading.

740
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:46,139
Play innocent, no matter what. Tell them that it was a mistake.

741
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:49,750
Is that your solution?

742
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,050
It is the only possible solution, so keep that in mind.

743
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,550
Also, keep in mind that you and I are in the same boat.

744
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:58,119
Kang Han Soo!

745
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,059
That attorney...

746
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:06,199
once saved my life.

747
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:09,829
What do you mean?

748
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:11,000
I tried...

749
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,940
to kill myself.

750
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:25,150
My children risked leaving their hometown to survive.

751
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:28,050
I was afraid...

752
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:30,989
that I would be a burden because of my legs.

753
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,860
I thought it would be one less mouth to feed.

754
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,139
Fire!

755
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,070
Fire!

756
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,409
What?

757
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:52,980
What do I do?

758
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:55,550
Gosh.

759
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,780
Fire.

760
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,119
Oh, no. That is...

761
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,420
my family's livelihood.

762
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:05,520
What do I do?

763
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,630
You were going to kill yourself anyway.

764
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:12,500
Why do you care whether there's ash in your liquor jug?

765
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:16,670
Do you think the underworld is not in this life?

766
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,500
Ridiculous.

767
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,739
When you die, your children who live...

768
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:25,110
will experience the underworld wherever they go.

769
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,280
Every second that they live will feel like the fiery pit.

770
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,289
A child needs a mother,

771
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,989
no matter how old the mother is.

772
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,460
That is when I realized...

773
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:44,429
that I was a mother.

774
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,369
I am sorry, Mom.

775
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,210
- It is my fault. - Mother.

776
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,780
I am sorry, Mom.

777
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:04,880
It is okay, son.

778
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,050
No, I am sorry. And it is all in the past.

779
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,719
I am sorry.

780
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:11,489
No, I am sorry.

781
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,300
Mom?

782
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:15,389
Mom!

783
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,460
Mom.

784
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,099
Are you still thinking about that man?

785
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:48,369
It was my first time...

786
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,670
seeing someone save a person...

787
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:53,380
No, save a whole family's life.

788
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,650
Though he pulled some tricks,

789
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,320
I wondered if I could blame him.

790
00:57:02,349 --> 00:57:05,159
In fact, I had been frustrated.

791
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:07,389
I used the merchant house's income...

792
00:57:07,389 --> 00:57:09,530
to lend people money and give out relief rice.

793
00:57:10,289 --> 00:57:12,259
I do my best, yet...

794
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,469
Yes, it was the same as pouring water into a sieve.

795
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:16,900
It was only a temporary measure.

796
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,539
But that guy guaranteed a family's livelihood...

797
00:57:23,539 --> 00:57:24,980
using the laws, at that.

798
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,710
I remembered what my father said.

799
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,509
What did the late King say?

800
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:34,789
"What ultimately rules the people must be the law,"

801
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:36,690
"not the King."

802
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:40,920
I am starting to understand what he meant.

803
00:57:49,429 --> 00:57:51,400
No!

804
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,539
This is killing me.

805
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:55,210
Gosh!

806
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,840
This hurts like crazy!

807
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,909
Twelve!

808
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:01,849
How am I supposed to pay it all back?

809
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,309
Thirteen!

810
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,880
I went...

811
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:08,219
- Fourteen! - around the country...

812
00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:10,619
to feed him and dress him!

813
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:13,719
And this is what I get in return!

814
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,759
Please...

815
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,329
Did you talk to them? What will they do?

816
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:23,699
I told them that I startled him...

817
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,340
into dropping the torchlight that he was holding,

818
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:28,440
and that caused the fire.

819
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,539
I tried telling them...

820
00:58:31,539 --> 00:58:34,610
that he did not do it on purpose.

821
00:58:34,949 --> 00:58:37,550
His punishment was extenuated to 20 floggings.

822
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:40,480
Because arson was a huge crime, even though it was a mistake.

823
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:42,050
Oh, no.

824
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:44,420
Well, it is the law.

825
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:47,520
I will handle it since I reported.

826
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:49,759
Please take your mother back to your house.

827
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,989
Okay.

828
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,400
Please stop it.

829
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:56,829
Seriously.

830
00:58:56,929 --> 00:58:58,239
No!

831
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:01,199
Please.

832
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,009
Wait!

833
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:19,889
What?

834
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:44,250
We have hired the musician...

835
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,750
especially for you, my lord.

836
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,250
It is certainly nice.

837
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,590
It is lovely.

838
00:59:53,619 --> 00:59:54,619
Here it goes.

839
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,929
Be gentle, please.

840
00:59:59,259 --> 01:00:00,300
Wait.

841
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:02,199
- Do not be such a baby. - You startled me.

842
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:03,770
Twenty floggings cannot kill you.

843
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:05,770
Alcohol is the best remedy...

844
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,469
- to floggings. - Right.

845
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:09,009
Drink up.

846
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:12,210
All right.

847
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:14,710
But...

848
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:18,250
what did you get flogged for?

849
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,750
Do not get me started.

850
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,489
We were lucky to get 20 floggings.

851
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:26,719
Had it gone badly, this table would have been...

852
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,360
for our funeral.

853
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,099
It was not luck, but the law.

854
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,429
Someone who knew the law well told him and his mother to testify...

855
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:39,800
that it was not on purpose. This could have turned out worse.

856
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,070
And you!

857
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:44,340
I have heard everything you said.

858
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:46,980
I mean,

859
01:00:47,539 --> 01:00:50,880
that is not the point here.

860
01:00:51,579 --> 01:00:53,179
Because you did...

861
01:00:53,179 --> 01:00:55,719
something against your character,

862
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:57,489
we almost...

863
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,860
said goodbye to this world!

864
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,259
That is the point!

865
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:05,860
Do you feel bad?

866
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,460
Shall I make you do it?

867
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:10,070
But then,

868
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:12,139
is your outcome not too petty...

869
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:14,199
compared to the physical pain you endured?

870
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,340
Baked goods and spoons...

871
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:19,139
The real outcome will come from now on.

872
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:23,550
Are you going to take more from the wine sellers?

873
01:01:27,949 --> 01:01:29,690
I threw bait...

874
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:31,789
someplace else.

875
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,190
Someplace else?

876
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:38,099
Anyway,

877
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:42,630
I doubt you wanted to see me just to enjoy music.

878
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:47,670
You have not told us if we will be supplying goods to Royal Academy of Painting.

879
01:01:47,739 --> 01:01:48,969
Oh, that.

880
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:54,539
I meant to give you a chance this time,

881
01:01:54,949 --> 01:01:57,780
but I changed my mind yesterday.

882
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:00,780
Yesterday?

883
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:01,989
Oh, please.

884
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:04,320
How dense are you?

885
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:07,520
This is why you got humiliated at the trial.

886
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,989
What...

887
01:02:08,989 --> 01:02:11,159
That incident and this deal...

888
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:12,960
have nothing to do with each other.

889
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,130
Of course they have something to do with each other.

890
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:20,699
Good quality is not the only thing the palace sees.

891
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,770
The palace is full of those...

892
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:27,210
who are eager to find faults with others.

893
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:32,150
You need to do your job more properly.

894
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:36,650
No one is going to deal with a guild that lost a lawsuit.

895
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,219
Goodness.

896
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:39,759
Have some of this.

897
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:45,259
Myung Wol, I do not want to go home.

898
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:47,130
Please, my lord.

899
01:02:58,679 --> 01:02:59,880
Do you finally realize...

900
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:02,780
what you have done?

901
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,150
I apologize, my lord.

902
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:10,849
My lord.

903
01:03:15,389 --> 01:03:16,530
What?

904
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:18,929
- That punk is here? - Yes.

905
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:20,900
Are you okay?

906
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:24,770
You are better than Dong Chi.

907
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,000
I wish I could take the beating on your behalf.

908
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,869
- It would have killed you. - Seriously.

909
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,050
Goodness.

910
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:20,920
Is it you again?

911
01:04:21,389 --> 01:04:23,090
Well...

912
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:25,199
I have waited for you by the government office.

913
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:28,230
You disappeared while I was briefly off to buy tofu.

914
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,530
Why?

915
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,429
I get it.

916
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:33,639
Are you trying to play cat and mouse?

917
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,340
Well...

918
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:39,880
Well...

919
01:04:42,009 --> 01:04:44,309
I am sorry.

920
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:46,679
What?

921
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,489
You call that an apology?

922
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:55,530
It is my first apology in life.

923
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:58,530
Of course, I am not used to it.

924
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:09,869
I understand.

925
01:05:09,869 --> 01:05:11,170
All right, then.

926
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:13,210
Since I am generous enough,

927
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:15,250
I will teach you...

928
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:18,449
how to make a truthful, sincere, and genuine apology.

929
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,480
Gather your hands like this.

930
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:25,820
Do it.

931
01:05:31,289 --> 01:05:34,099
And close your eyes.

932
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,900
Good. Then...

933
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,780
How about a kiss on my cheek?

934
01:05:46,179 --> 01:05:47,340
Excuse me?

935
01:05:47,509 --> 01:05:49,980
You said you came to apologize.

936
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:53,179
Are you joking?

937
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,090
I am being serious.

938
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:56,789
Look.

939
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:59,259
Will you not make fun of my sincerity?

940
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:00,659
There is no need to apologize.

941
01:06:01,989 --> 01:06:03,690
It is true I started the fire.

942
01:06:03,929 --> 01:06:05,829
I just paid the price for what I did.

943
01:06:10,429 --> 01:06:12,500
My buttocks did hurt, though.

944
01:06:52,539 --> 01:06:53,809
What a lovely sight.

945
01:06:55,909 --> 01:06:57,050
Well?

946
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,409
What on earth?

947
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:34,420
Did you wake up?

948
01:07:36,289 --> 01:07:37,550
Gosh, wait!

949
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:38,789
Hey!

950
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:40,860
Hey, Dong Chi!

951
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,000
We meet again.

952
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:49,900
Jang?

953
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:52,369
Since you recognize me,

954
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:54,739
I guess you also know what is going to happen from now on.

955
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,469
Yes, of course.

956
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,639
- Did you just smile? - What took you so long?

957
01:08:01,639 --> 01:08:03,980
I waited so long for you.

958
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,320
What?

959
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:10,849
Did you have business with me from the start?

960
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,690
Otherwise,

961
01:08:14,089 --> 01:08:17,030
I would not be tied up here...

962
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:18,929
in this state.

963
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,290
Jang.

964
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,160
Arrest all the family members,

965
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:55,499
and search everywhere in the house.

966
01:08:55,629 --> 01:08:56,799
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

967
01:08:58,270 --> 01:08:59,799
How about a deal with me?

968
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,570
I will spare your life.

969
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:08,879
Who will spare whose life?

970
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,650
I am saying I will...

971
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:18,450
spare your life.

972
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:20,160
All right?

973
01:09:21,219 --> 01:09:22,490
Wait!

974
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:24,459
Hey! I am in the middle of talking!

975
01:09:24,559 --> 01:09:25,830
I am not sparing your life.

976
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:29,070
I am saying...

977
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:30,799
I will spare...

978
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:33,169
your life.

979
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:51,490
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

980
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:58,730
(Special thanks to Sung Byung Sook, Jo Hee Bong, Lee Jun Hyeok,)

981
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,259
(and Min Ji Ah for their guest appearances)

982
01:10:02,129 --> 01:10:03,669
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

983
01:10:03,669 --> 01:10:04,830
I mean,

984
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:07,299
how can she have a crush on you?

985
01:10:07,299 --> 01:10:08,870
I fell in love with you at first sight.

986
01:10:09,009 --> 01:10:11,270
You are gutsy, tenacious,

987
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:12,540
and crazy.

988
01:10:13,139 --> 01:10:15,139
So make sure you achieve your purpose.

989
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:16,780
I will make time for you.

990
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:20,950
The other side's attorney was a very skilled one.

991
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:24,219
Talking about the statute published by the former kings and whatnot.

992
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,089
The statute?

993
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:27,490
Come to think of it,

994
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:32,160
I have not heard from Princess Yeon Joo for a while.

995
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:34,459
Your Majesty,

996
01:10:34,799 --> 01:10:35,999
I would like to tame Kang Han Soo...

997
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,700
to be one of my people.
