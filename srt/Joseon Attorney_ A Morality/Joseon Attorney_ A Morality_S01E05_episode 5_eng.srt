1
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,500
 Second Rank Military Officer Ryu Ji Seon

2
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,300

3
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,720
I did not anticipate meeting you this way, Princess.

4
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,890
I hear a hint of reprimand in your tone.

5
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,530
If the court and the royal family find out you are meddling in subjects' lawsuits,

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,200
it will taint not only you but also the king.

7
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,950
Wouldn't that be good for your father, the minister, and the Hungu (clan)?

8
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,020
I don't think this is for my father and Hungu's sake.

9
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,250
Yes.

10
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,920
So I intend to do a good job and avoid getting caught. Thus...

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,910
please do not acknowledge me again.

12
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,310
How can I pretend not to know my betrothed?

13
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,720
Mayor, I mean, if you become the son-in-law of the king, Your Excellency,

14
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,100
my father determined that you will not inherit the minister's power,

15
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,700
at the least. However, he has passed away.

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,280
and I believe the minister is responsible for his death.

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,710
Do you still wish to be married?

18
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,160
Then...

19
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,890
 Your grace is boundless, Your Majesty.

20
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,070
 Wishes Inn

21
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,480
 I heard you help out subjects in need in an inn.

22
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,990
 It is small, but I would like to assist you from afar.

23
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,680
 I do not wish to reveal my name.

24
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,980
 From your benefactor.

25
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,400
Your Excellency, there is trouble.

26
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,480
 Hanyang Prefecture

27
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,090
If one strangles oneself, the mouth of the corpse is usually open

28
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,170
with the teeth showing, and their hands are in fists.

29
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,940
And the wound on the neck appears to be deep and is dark red.

30
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,960
I am just saying.

31
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,540
All right, then.

32
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:27,370
 Chief Advisor Park did not commit suicide.

33
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,930
 He was "suicided."

34
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:37,550
 Why? Who is trying to hide something?

35
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,560
Did you abandon him?

36
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,710
He certainly deserved to die.

37
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,960
- It is murder. 
 - You mean suicide!

38
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,830
Father!

39
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,830
If you want to handle it as a murder, I will not stop you.

40
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,490
A few innocent suspects will die in the process,

41
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:13,110
and the most likely one will be deemed the culprit and be beheaded.

42
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,610
That is how another life is lost.

43
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,810
That is how the law is.

44
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,220
It is much easier to kill a person with it than to save someone.

45
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,180
That is what I mean.

46
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,840
According to the law, Chief Advisor Park Je Su was to face death soon.

47
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,600
Even so, I do not know why you had to take it this far.

48
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,630
The longer he is alive, the more he will ramble on.

49
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,180
Then he will be tainting the reputation of our Hungu as well.

50
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,560
But do not misunderstand.

51
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,870
among many things that your father is capable of doing in Joseon,

52
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,920
it was quite an easy thing to do.

53
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,650
Pull!

54
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,440
One, two!

55
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,930
One, two, one...

56
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,800
two.

57
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,730
Okay!

58
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,250
I will wrap it up here. Get back to work.

59
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,670
Good work! Good work.

60
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,730
 Mother.

61
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,430
 That Park Je Su is dead,

62
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,660
 the same way you died, Mother.

63
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,300
 I do not feel as ecstatic or relieved as I thought I would.

64
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:57,660
 Both Merchant Jang and Park Je Su were just pawns in the end.

65
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,660
 There is someone else behind them.

66
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,810
 Our enemy is in a higher place than I thought.

67
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,210
 What do I need to do now,

68
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,340
 and where do I need to go to meet the truth?

69
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,920
 A woman with a bundle

70
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,120
 Episode 5: Brutal History of Cheongsan, Vol. 1

71
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,450
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

72
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,190
Hyeongnim!

73
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,020
- Hyeongmin! 
 - What?

74
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,370
Where have you been? I have been looking all over for you.

75
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,870
I have been looking for you all over as well.

76
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,420
On the ship. All day long, while getting pooped on by birds.

77
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,140
Geez, stop dragging that on.

78
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,070
And what?

79
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,730
Ta-da!

80
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,350
Huh?

81
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,870
 It was inside Park Je Su's sleeve.

82
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,190
I got permission from the chief advisor's wife, so let us hurry up and check.

83
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,770
Let us go!

84
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,370
- Look. Search over there! 
 - Okay.

85
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,370
Hey! What?

86
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,530
Move, move, move!

87
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,730
There. 
  Land Deed

88
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,140
How much is all this?

89
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:03,510
It looks like Park Je Su was the Hungu Party's goods receiver.

90
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,540
 I leave it in your care.

91
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,880
 He must have been exchanging all this with silk, rice, jade, silver, or gold,

92
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,170
 and supplying the Hungu Party officials.

93
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,260
 Please take this and...

94
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,290
 Thank you in advance, Sir.

95
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,560
 He received goods and even kept a ledger on bribes.

96
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,670
 He even worked like an accountant.

97
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,310
And I am sure the dead Merchant Jang must have worked hand in hand with him.

98
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,010
Park Je Su has been in Hanyang for seven years.

99
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,660
His Excellency Chu also entered the central royal court around that time.

100
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,420
And Merchant Jang settled down in Hanyang market.

101
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,960
If they received all that as payment for my father's life,

102
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,300
the one who shared his wealth with them, for it is

103
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,760
the one who ordered the deed.

104
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,610
Let me see.

105
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:01,180
If you follow Merchant Jang, Park Je Su, His Excellency Chu, and all the way up, at the end of it...

106
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,750
Geez! The head of the Hungu Party is Minister Yu.

107
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,740
Yes.

108
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,740
Gosh, that is too far-fetched.

109
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,520
My goodness! I wish it were not so!

110
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,060
If that is true, it would be too tough on us!

111
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,770
Then should we get His Excellency Chu and beat him to a pulp?

112
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:22,150
He will never open his mouth because he is the mastermind.

113
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,020
Then what do we do now?

114
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,580
Besides His Excellency Chu, there is that mysterious bundle.

115
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,400
The woman we've been searching for years for and could not locate...

116
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,950
Park Je Su's soul must have had a sliver of conscience left.

117
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,000
I cannot believe he left us a gift.

118
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,850
Who gave this to him? Look it up.

119
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,540
 Cheongsan Province

120
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,620
- Oh? 
 - What?

121
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,040
It says a magistrate from Cheongsan.

122
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,470
Cheongsan.

123
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,180
 Wishes Inn

124
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,030
As expected,

125
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,270
this is that plum wine from last time.

126
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,000
You should not do this while you are undercover.

127
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,700
I will pay plenty for my drinks.

128
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,180
What is all this?

129
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,770
You mentioned that you would need plenty of goods to move that Kang Han Su.

130
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,770
Your Majesty's grace knows no boun– But...

131
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,550
even for you, Your Majesty, you would need Minister Yu's

132
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,440
permission to withdraw from your private funds.

133
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,780
So I brought it from a private fund I have been putting away.

134
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,520
Your Majesty's grace—

135
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,320
Your Majesty's grace knows no bounds. Please enjoy.

136
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,260
What are you staring at?

137
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,260
You said you would train Kang Han Su to become your subordinate.

138
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,230
You seem to become more and more like him.

139
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,540
Me?

140
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,280
I thought there were a few more.

141
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,650
Of all places, why Cheongsan?

142
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,070
- Hey! 
 - That's what I'm saying.

143
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,450
Geez, this is crazy. Do you still have business left with me?

144
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,400
Grand Merchant Jo would like to see your face.

145
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,210
I helped him stay alive, yet he's so ungrateful.

146
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:31,040
How dare you show up at the trial?

147
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,080
I want to give you a proper tour of the afterlife.

148
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,100
I will have to show you what I am made of this time.

149
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,780
- Dong Chi. 
 - Yes, Hyeongnim.

150
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,490
Let us go with the bear attack method.

151
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,320
- I am a papa bear! 
 - I am a mama bear!

152
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,530
- Hyeongnim, should I attack after you? 
 - How dare you try to run?

153
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,600
You sure are quick.

154
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,610
Sir!

155
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,970
What the?

156
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,320
Hyeongnim!

157
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,220
Hey! Hey! Let's go!

158
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,130
Get him!

159
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,720
Take another horse!

160
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,500
Princess!

161
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,420
Your Majesty, please have a safe journey back.

162
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,100
I mean—

163
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,460
Help me!

164
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,090
Get him!

165
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,300
You!

166
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,010
Get over here!

167
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,810
They're gone! They're gone! Gone!

168
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,240
I'm so tired.

169
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,170
Let's leave for Cheongsan now.

170
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,380
Huh? Right away?

171
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,740
Yes. Get dressed.

172
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,210
- How about the meat? 
 - Throw it out.

173
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,310
- The knife too? 
 - Toss it!

174
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,090
Got it!

175
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,790
I'm coming with you to Cheongsan.

176
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,250
Hyeongnim!

177
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,200
There they are! Run! Run!

178
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,110
Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim!

179
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,810
Move!

180
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,810
Hey, take care of the ledger! I'll see you in Cheongsan!

181
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,590
H-How about me?

182
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,030
Let's go! Be sure to stay alive!

183
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,280
Hyeongnim!

184
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,690
 She always appears at moments like this.

185
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,830
 The most embarrassing moment.

186
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,060
 And when I desperately need her.

187
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,440
- Ouch. 
- Move!

188
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,460
Gosh, it hurts.

189
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,140
Aigoo, it hurts.

190
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,000
Aigoo, ouch.

191
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,660
- Hyeongnim! 
 - Huh?

192
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,860
- Let's go! 
 - Ouch.

193
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,880
Aigoo, it hurts...

194
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,560
Out. Get out.

195
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
That shaved ten years off of my life.

196
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,450
As expected of Innkeeper Hong.

197
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,580
You gave me drinks, food, and even a room.

198
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,350
Now, you give me your heart as well.

199
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,200
Did you say "heart"?

200
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,310
Yes.

201
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,440
It means you owe me one.

202
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,240
I will write it down in my ledger, so be sure to remember it!

203
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,590
Yes, Madam!

204
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,420
Sure will!

205
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,260
Innkeeper Hong!

206
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,640
You lost them.

207
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,950
I do not know what he feels guilty about, but

208
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,730
I heard he ran away as soon as he spotted my men.

209
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,400
I wanted to see the face of the attorney who did that to Park Je Su.

210
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,390
I have heard the news.

211
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,150
I heard it was suicide.

212
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:15,010
I had given him numerous chances to pull himself out of his troubles, considering our history.

213
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,460
But he could not even manage a woman and suffered something like that?

214
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,940
Send plenty of bereavement money to Park Je Su's family,

215
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,790
and bring me everything he left behind

216
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:31,100
before someone else gets their hands on it.

217
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,290
You do it yourself.

218
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,780
- Yes, Your Excellency. 
 - Damn it!

219
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,190
He's worse off than a mere lawyer!

220
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,260
Then.

221
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:10,110
So why are you going to Cheongsan? The clients are lined up at the inn.

222
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,570
How about you? Did you decide to become my assistant again?

223
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,140
Do you mean I passed then?

224
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,440
Well?

225
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,300
Since you saved my life, I guess I could give you a chance.

226
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:29,010
Whoa! You are saying I should put my life on the line if I want to work for you?

227
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,200
I just mean that is how grateful I am.

228
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,520
♫  For you and me, it's our first time &nbsp;♫ 
♫  Spring is blossoming &nbsp;♫

229
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,900
♫  Our love &nbsp;♫ 
♫  Will deepen in this spring &nbsp;♫

230
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,840
♫  When I hold you &nbsp;♫ 
♫  Nothing could be better than this &nbsp;♫

231
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,710
♫  This is how we are together again  ♫

232
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,320
 Please help me, Ajeossi.

233
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,600
 Aigoo, who is this?

234
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,560
 - It's Han Su! 
 - My father and mother.

235
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,460
 He should not have done that as a human.

236
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,560
 If he had shared some drinks generously with the extra money he got,

237
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,260
 I would not be so sad like this.

238
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,860
 What a dirty family line your household is.

239
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,210
 Dabok-ri, Cheongsan

240
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,230
 Let us do this.

241
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,940
 You lose if you don't play rock, paper, scissors!

242
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,920
 Great!

243
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,280
 Here. A little stronger. It's too weak.

244
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,600
 With two hands.

245
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,640
 Aigoo! Feels so cool!

246
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,180
 - Strong wind!
 - Seven, eight!

247
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,880
 - Nine, ten!
 - Harder!

248
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,080
 Okay, let's do it again.

249
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,180
 You lose if you don't play rock, paper, scissors!

250
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,290
-  Hurry up! 
 - Han Su!

251
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,850
 - Han Su! 
 - Father is home!

252
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,950
 Orabeoni, where are you going?

253
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,390
 Hey, you! Kang Han Su!

254
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,160
 Geez, come on now.

255
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,560
 Gosh, hey!

256
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,400
 Got you!

257
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,920
 Hey, Kang Han Su!

258
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,310
 - Gosh, stop it! 
 - You, underhanded one!

259
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,360
Sir, look at this.

260
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,560
It looks like four family members lived here before.

261
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,330
Doesn't it look like fun?

262
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,610
It doesn't. Let us go.

263
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,690
Sir!

264
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,860
 Do it more carefully.

265
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,900
 I was wondering what you were up to.

266
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,500
 Is this our door nameplate?

267
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,960
 - I said it wasn't. 
 - Oh, no...

268
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,810
Ouch. Must we go to this extent?

269
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,710
Men and women are different.

270
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,150
I do not know what scandal we might get pulled into if we go around together.

271
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:37,610
An isolated village like this is usually so closed off and conservative.

272
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,430
Okay, turn around.

273
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,700
Then you could have disguised yourself as my servant.

274
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,910
Why must I dress like this?

275
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,400
As for that, it is because this suits you much better.

276
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,810
What did you say?

277
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:07,100
All done. You look so cool, my So Won.

278
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,420
All right. My turn.

279
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,080
So annoying.

280
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,960
I can't believe I was excited about this.

281
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,340
No.

282
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,860
Only idiotic rookies would do something like this.

283
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,650
A s-secret royal inspector?

284
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,930
He's covered in dirt and dust, and he looks as if he has been starving for days.

285
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,600
He looks exhausted and even filthy.

286
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:57,060
But his gaze is very clear and his voice carries such dignity.

287
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,600
Who are you?

288
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,950
Me? If you knew who I was, you would...

289
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:11,870
That is that.

290
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:17,060
Because we are on a long journey, we are achy all over and hungry.

291
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,260
Is there an inn we could stay—

292
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,740
Please wait a moment.

293
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,670
 He is a noble, no matter how you look at him.

294
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:35,360
And a royal court official at that.

295
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,400
And of those, I am sure he is a secret royal inspector.

296
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,740
R-Royal—

297
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:45,580
He is asking if there is an inn he could stay at.

298
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,400
 But rather than being intimidated, he observes his surroundings very sharply.

299
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,900
He looked as though he was watching to see if the officials were being idle.

300
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,530
I wonder where the outhouse is.

301
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,860
He's coming. Coming.

302
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,270
His back seems more bent forward, right?

303
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,850
He seems more polite.

304
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:17,000
- I think your strategy worked.
 - Of course.

305
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,640
I did not recognize you earlier.

306
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,350
- Please come this way.
 - Let us go.

307
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,710
You stay here, servant.

308
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,670
Whoa, seriously.

309
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,950
So...

310
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,300
I should introduce myself first, but

311
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,270
- considering the circumstances—
 - Oh, no, no!

312
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:01,130
Please relax and eat. Take your time.

313
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,530
Even in Yookcho Street in Hanyang,

314
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:15,050
this village is known as a crime-free village.

315
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,470
They say the current head of the village will be promoted by two or more in rank,

316
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,240
and you are just as I have heard.

317
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,770
Gosh, you are too kind!

318
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,100
Well...

319
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,350
What did you hear and from whom?

320
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,040
Actually...

321
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,030
I have one thing I need to confirm about that incident.

322
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,300
That is why I wanted to meet you.

323
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,520
What...?

324
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,910
That man asked me to return this to you.

325
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,390
He said he would place me in a great position.

326
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,580
I thought he liked what I had given him.

327
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:36,200
Wh-What do I do if this is returned to me?

328
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,150
By chance, is the position he promised me also gone?

329
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,670
Probably.

330
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,420
I tried so hard to get out of this backwater...

331
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,670
Since he knew it was stolen goods, I am sure he felt uneasy accepting it.

332
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,180
Stolen goods?

333
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,660
No, no. There is no way that is the case.

334
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,300
This was...

335
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,900
This was?

336
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,840
This was...

337
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,740
given to me as a gift!

338
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,460
 It must have been a bribe.

339
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,310
I knew that would happen.

340
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,990
She ultimately ends up causing her husband's death.

341
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,400
Aigoo, how horrible could her fate be?

342
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,600
The bitch who caused her own husband's death is bound to cause the death of another woman's husband.

343
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,370
Be sure to mind your husbands.

344
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,150
From whom?

345
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,560
Gosh, I could not tell such a detail...

346
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,440
Well, I guess you do not care to clear up his misunderstanding, then.

347
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,610
H-Hey, hey, w-wait!

348
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,070
Wait. Aigoo!

349
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,940
I-I mean...

350
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,240
Well...

351
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,260
I will just tell you.

352
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,970
Oh, a persimmon tree.

353
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,670
Is it here?

354
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,190
 More than ten stab wounds caused by one's hands.

355
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,800
 A daring crime that took place in broad daylight, even with witnesses around.

356
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,690
 This murder is due to a deep-rooted grudge,

357
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,790
 knowing she is putting her life on the line when committing the crime.

358
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,520
Pyeongahn-myeon, Dabok-ri. The house under the persimmon tree.

359
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,700
A woman with the surname Park.

360
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,890
 Beginning of Good Luck

361
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,100
 Should I thank her for killing her in my place,

362
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,820
 or...

363
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,680
should I quibble over why she did this to her?

364
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,760
Why did you grab that with your bare hands?

365
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,250
 What in the world has happened here?

366
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,790
Aigoo! Aigoo! A murder?

367
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,140
A murder in our village?

368
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,460
Who did it?

369
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,610
Who did this crazy thing?

370
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,800
Did you report to the government office?

371
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,690
- If you haven't I'll go and– 
 - Get her.

372
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,290
What are you doing?

373
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,790
Why are you doing this? I did not do this!

374
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,010
Sir.

375
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,320
We did not do this.

376
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,050
We know.

377
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,810
That child Yeong Sil is the murderer.

378
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,840
Then why—

379
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,570
You saw everything.

380
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,020
Pardon?

381
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,890
Are you going to kill her?

382
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:34,030
As for what we will do with you two, we will decide in our village meeting.

383
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,230
Just know that.

384
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,310
What are you all doing?

385
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,610
They say even mountains and rivers change in a span of a decade.

386
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:51,210
But this country village has not changed at all.

387
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,150
- Lock him up in the storage!  
 - Yes, Sir!

388
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,230
We're out of our minds.

389
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,120
 Aigoo, just one day.

390
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,600
Why did you not kill her a little bit later?

391
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,570
I mean, after I found out what I needed to find out...

392
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:18,140
You could have killed her after we were gone from this village...

393
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,080
Sir, what are you saying?

394
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,070
That woman deserved to die.

395
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:30,500
I killed her because she deserved it.

396
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,840
Then I'll trust you and wait on you, Old Lady.

397
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,020
Aigoo, you sure are generous, young man.

398
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,030
If she misses out on marrying you, what a waste that would be.

399
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,420
Oh, yes, yes.

400
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,680
 Just trust me and meet him once.

401
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,820
The way I see it, he is perfect for you. Just perfect.

402
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,600
 Bride, bow to your husband.

403
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,810
 Aigoo, so lovely!

404
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,770
 Gosh, look how happy he is.

405
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,380
 Whoa, look at the bridegroom.

406
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,310
 Groom, bow to your bride!

407
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,660
 This is not a matter that concerns wealth.

408
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,730
 She should have understood, if I explained it to her like that.

409
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,700
 Look how that bitch is getting married in secret.

410
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,780
 Is that rumor true?

411
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,140
 The rumor about the new bride?

412
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,340
 Aigoo, but she does not look like the type who would do that.

413
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,680
 She's just a homemaker.

414
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,790
 But such a rumor going around only after she gets married

415
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,670
 - is quite strange. 
- Right?

416
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,200
 That just goes to say

417
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,690
 how that sly red fox hid it so well while going around!

418
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,160
 Granny.

419
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,510
 I have also seen her once.

420
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,120
 Seen what?

421
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,340
 I was on my way to the outhouse to pee in the middle of the night.

422
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,430
 And I saw her with my own two eyes.

423
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:59,200
 In the middle of the night, why would she be leaving the mill?

424
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,070
 I have seen such a scene numerous times.

425
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,750
 Then the reason she married so suddenly is...

426
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,640
 That's right! If she had men!

427
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,130
 That means the rumor has spread among all the men in our village.

428
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,560
 That is why she got married so quickly!

429
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,490
 - My gosh! 
- There was a reason!

430
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,380
 Do you want to hear more?

431
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,820
 Yes, yes, yes.

432
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,480
 She was quietly sneaking out of the mill...

433
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,180
 And the way I saw it was that she was in the mill with...

434
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,100
 Is that what happened?

435
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,780
 Aigoo, how could she have done such a thing...?

436
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,150
 Oh, my gosh!

437
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,110
 As soon as her husband leaves to sell his goods,

438
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,440
 every night she's, you know...

439
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,810
 I heard the line of men waiting for Yeong Sil is 100-li long.

440
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:59,790
 Aigoo, of course, they would wait. They would wait for 100 days if they had to!

441
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,410
 If only you could have her, of course, you should line up!

442
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,910
 You wretched animals, worse than dogs!

443
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,810
 What?

444
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,030
 You sons of bitches. Say it again! Go ahead and say it again!

445
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:23,060
 I mean, you are the one who cannot control your own wife. Why take it out on us?

446
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,840
 What did you say?

447
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,900
 You asshole!

448
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,090
 What did you say to me?

449
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,710
 You!

450
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,610
 Get up!

451
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,010
 Darling.

452
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,740
 Darling.

453
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,830
 Honey!

454
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,810
 No!

455
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,420
No.

456
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,170
 No.

457
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:32,420
 No... no...

458
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,310
 No...

459
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,870
 I do not regret it.

460
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:06,350
 Had I not fought them,

461
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:12,000
 they would have continued to ramble on with their nonsense.

462
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,530
 Don't ever be concerned

463
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:20,010
 about what that senile granny said.

464
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:24,010
 No matter what anyone says,

465
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,850
 I believe you, darling.

466
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,820
 She is bound to cause death for another woman's husband.

467
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,440
 Be sure to mind your husbands.

468
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,770
I understand

469
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:55,700
how you feel.

470
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,940
But still, killing someone was too much.

471
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:03,050
I am asking if there was another way to handle it.

472
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:05,250
If the magistrate of Cheongsan wouldn't hear you out,

473
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,860
there is also the provincial governor of Chungcheon province.

474
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,420
You also could have stopped the king's procession and pled inside the capital.

475
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,020
Ha!

476
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,890
How would you trust those people?

477
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:19,600
They say the water on top has to be clean for the water downstream to be clean.

478
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,800
If the village head of a country village is this corrupt,

479
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,140
how corrupt do you think higher regional officials or the royal court officials are?

480
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,250
You only have yourself to trust.

481
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,020
Revenge is ultimately mine

482
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,560
and the faith that officials or the king would resolve injustice done to me

483
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,240
is merely a fantasy.

484
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,690
Even so, not everyone repays their enemy by committing murder.

485
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:42,480
Then tell us a better method.

486
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,100
Anything is better than murder.

487
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,140
Turning into a monster just to catch another monster is only a justification.

488
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,880
- It's like saying you and I should both die.
 - Who's going to die?

489
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,250
The national law says that committing murder is punishable by death.

490
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:57,630
That is for criminals who have not met me.

491
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,350
Excuse me?

492
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,770
Let us file a lawsuit.

493
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:09,340
I will get you acquitted.

494
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,200
Acquitted?

495
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,490
That is impossible.

496
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:16,890
An attorney is someone who makes the impossible possible.

497
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:19,250
And I am not just another ordinary attorney.

498
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:22,250
I am the best attorney Kang–

499
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,060
I am the most competent attorney in Joseon.

500
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,420
An attorney?

501
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:43,050
All right. First, we have to get out of here.

502
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,180
There has to be a way out.

503
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,490
We can break this down.

504
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,150
Some idiotic rookie is here.

505
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,450
Aigoo, seriously!

506
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:12,270
Hyeongnim.

507
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:14,450
Should I go back? Huh?

508
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:17,080
I really w-won't rescue you.

509
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,440
- Aigoo!
 - Yeong Sil!

510
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,760
- Aigoo, Yeong Sil!
 - Mother!

511
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:38,430
Let us hurry up and go when they are willing to let you go.

512
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,190
Then I will take her home.

513
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,640
Thank you, Village Foreman.

514
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,170
Let's go.

515
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,090
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

516
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:52,110
Where do you think you are going?

517
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,990
Wait. Who are you?

518
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:57,170
Kang...

519
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,840
Kang!

520
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,810
He is Attorney Kang.

521
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,830
Attorney? What is that exactly?

522
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:15,210
An attorney?

523
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:20,880
Are you saying an attorney will defend that girl who committed the murder?

524
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,140
What? Defend?

525
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,700
Are you saying you will file a lawsuit?

526
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:32,150
Yes. We will reveal the inside story of this incident through a trial and let the village know—

527
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:34,420
Inside story?

528
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,000
With the hoe that girl wielded in broad daylight,

529
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,920
one of the village's elderly was stabbed to death!

530
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,520
What inside story for an incident that is so clearly laid out in front of us?

531
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,420
We should listen to what this new bride has to say as well.

532
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:52,350
I do not know what amazing inside story there is to tell,

533
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:56,360
but the fact that girl committed the murder does not change.

534
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,540
We are not trying to hide or change that fact.

535
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:04,020
It is the process laid out by national law.

536
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,040
National law?

537
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,540
Do you see Joseon anywhere around here?

538
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:14,990
Pardon?

539
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:17,780
As you can see, this Dabok-ri

540
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,050
does not receive any food from the government since we do not yield any grain.

541
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,980
- Any important...
 - I heard it so much that I have a scab in my ear.

542
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,070
And we are not even a strategic area, so

543
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:31,030
we do not even have a military base that is so commonplace.

544
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:33,120
Yes.

545
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,990
The government that was nowhere to be seen while we suffered through

546
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,450
all kinds of diseases and natural disasters.

547
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,890
The Joseon that showed up only when it was time to collect taxes!

548
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:45,670
What right does it have to ask us to be fair!

549
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,520
- That is because— 
 - That's right!

550
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,960
While the lawsuit is going on, our villagers

551
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:54,970
will be dragged around and tortured as suspects or witnesses.

552
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:59,420
And if we get framed or something, who will take responsibility for that?

553
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,650
That's right!

554
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:05,070
To examine the body, all kinds of autopsy examiners and assistants,

555
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:07,090
all kinds of officers and soldiers will swarm in.

556
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:08,970
They will take over the reception area of the best house in the village

557
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:11,300
and ask for food and water every mealtime

558
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,800
while complaining about the food and asking us to kill a chicken or a pig.

559
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,940
If we give the stink eye to express our exhaustion,

560
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:22,140
they will arrest us right away, saying our shifty eyes make us look like suspects.

561
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:26,740
Who will take responsibility for us sucking on our broken thumbs?

562
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,930
We did not want to deal with that

563
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,520
and gathered all the money we had and gave it to you.

564
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,950
You should take it and leave the village.

565
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,150
Why all the fuss when you took all the money from us?

566
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:39,760
I know. They have no right!

567
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,770
- Money?
 - By chance, did you already accept the settlement?

568
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,420
Well...

569
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:53,420
I heard your older brother already took the money.

570
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:58,940
Let us go. Hurry.

571
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,650
Let us hurry!

572
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:04,660
- Just a moment.
 - Step aside!

573
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,120
What do we do? Just let them go?

574
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,570
What can you do?

575
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,550
They already took the money.

576
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:13,300
How can we defeat money?

577
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,960
This is unbelievable.

578
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,900
Hands up.

579
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:48,690
Consider yourselves lucky that we are ending it like this.

580
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,230
Don't you dare come back to our village again!

581
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,870
If you do, I will just!

582
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:57,880
Geez! Let us go.

583
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,840
Whoa, this is so unbelievable.

584
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,320
I know! How could they do this to innocent outsiders?

585
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,610
I mean, why did they leave? How could they leave?

586
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:17,410
I, Kang Han Su, offered to defend her.

587
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:21,740
I told her I'd get her acquitted—not exile or slave-labor punishment!

588
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,020
Are you getting angry at the new bride?

589
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,500
I am baffled.

590
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,310
Well, it is better than taking the case and things going awry.

591
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:31,870
I am saying I could save her because I could.

592
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,690
But how?

593
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,410
The law was not meant to kill a person.

594
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:39,290
It was meant to save a person.

595
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,270
I wanted to give her a chance.

596
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:50,580
The innocent will get to live, and the guilty will end up paying for their crime.

597
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:55,180
Once she realizes such an obvious truth,

598
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:58,550
even if she faces difficulties like this again,

599
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,940
she will not make such a foolish choice as she did today.

600
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:05,470
By doing so, I wanted to cheer on the new bride,

601
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:10,030
who chose to kill rather than kill herself.

602
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,750
Geez! But what is the use?

603
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,380
She threw away her own good fortune.

604
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,210
What if she comes back?

605
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:20,950
Will you save her as you promised her?

606
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:24,750
How about you? Are you still against it?

607
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:29,490
I do not believe that the crime of killing a person should be forgiven for any reason.

608
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:33,320
So do you want that new bride to be punished?

609
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:39,270
I do want to hear how you plan to defend her state of mind.

610
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,690
Yes. I want to be persuaded by you, sir.

611
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:49,940
If you persuade me, you could probably persuade the king as well.

612
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,090
The king, my foot...

613
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:55,480
What are you two doing right now?

614
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,430
Hurry up and untie the rope!

615
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:00,950
Don't bother wasting your energy.

616
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:06,740
Around the time sun sets, a few peddlers from the village beyond the mountain will pass by here.

617
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:11,490
That is right. They are sure to pass by here.

618
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:13,450
But I wonder if you remember this.

619
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:15,950
From the village beyond that sunset,

620
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:19,450
rogue scoundrels roam all over the streets once the sun goes down.

621
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:24,720
- Oh, right, right...
 - Geez, hurry up!

622
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,420
Hurry! Hurry!

623
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,560
Court L– no, Innkeeper Hong!

624
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,030
Innkeeper Hong!

625
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:42,040
What in the world is going on with you all?

626
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:46,370
Fortunately, Innkeeper Hong came here by herself.

627
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:49,590
Unlike someone who was tailed.

628
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,340
Mom.

629
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,080
Huh?

630
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,810
I'm craving seasoned deodeok (a ginseng-like root).

631
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,980
Our village deodeok is the sweetest and tastiest.

632
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:20,030
Yeong Sil, by chance, are you pregnant?

633
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:26,160
When I was pregnant with you, I used to chew on deodeok roots.

634
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,100
They say you take after your mom for morning sickness tendencies.

635
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,670
When was your last period?

636
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:35,010
Was it in the last month?

637
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,400
- Mom, what do I do? 
 - Oh, my.

638
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,690
What do I do?

639
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,140
What do you mean what do you do?

640
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:52,510
Mom!

641
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,950
I want to live!

642
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,900
Of course. You must live.

643
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:01,120
You are leaving here so you can live.

644
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,310
Go somewhere and cultivate some wasteland—

645
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:07,130
Not like that.

646
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:08,760
I want to live properly,

647
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,050
like a human being.

648
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,790
Darling...

649
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,630
I want to file a lawsuit.

650
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:19,080
I will go through trial, pay for my crime,

651
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,050
and live my life properly afterward.

652
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:23,440
If you go through a trial, you will die!

653
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,510
Have you seen anyone who lived after killing a person?

654
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,500
He said he could save me.

655
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,720
That attorney said there is a way I could survive.

656
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,440
How could you believe that?

657
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,780
It is nothing more than gambling with your life.

658
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:39,640
I do not want my child to live in hiding all his life because of me.

659
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,280
When he's grown up, he'll have to get married as well.

660
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:50,270
But what can we do now?

661
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,780
We even received all the settlement money.

662
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:56,180
We can give it back.

663
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,880
Where is Orabeoni right now?

664
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:03,680
Mom!

665
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:08,000
No. I cannot tell you.

666
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,730
Your brother needs to live, too.

667
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,330
You will end up...

668
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,460
End up...

669
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,720
What?

670
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,460
- Aigoo... 
- I'm hopeless anyway.

671
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,520
That I will end up dying anyway?

672
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:34,320
Aigoo. Yeong Sil!

673
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,380
Mom. You don't trust me.

674
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,010
What he said about me surviving this.

675
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:45,960
No. You don't want me to live.

676
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,030
- You want me to die, do you not? 
- No!

677
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:53,240
Yeong Sil! Child!

678
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,720
Where are those people?

679
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,170
Who do you mean?

680
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:50,320
The secret royal inspector.

681
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,720
He asked where the jade dragon came from

682
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:57,140
and said he was going to meet Park. I have not heard from him since.

683
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:01,220
- In the village— 
- He's not a secret royal inspector.

684
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,090
You were deceived, Magistrate.

685
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:09,540
Then by chance, do you know those people?

686
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:18,740
We're here. we're here.

687
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,460
- Oh, my goodness. 
- Tavern keeper.

688
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:28,510
Please give us some water.

689
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:31,050
Aigoo, our tavern is closed!

690
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,680
I have no room or leftover food.

691
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,500
Go! Leave!

692
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,840
Aigoo, seriously!

693
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,430
The business owner is denying customers.

694
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:45,250
Why? Are you uneasy because we're outsiders?

695
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:50,420
Did the rumor spread already?

696
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:55,790
Something like my guys turned the village upside down?

697
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:05,350
Looking at the number of shoes, you have at least one empty room.

698
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:13,840
Seeing how the kitchen is filled with smoke, you're in the middle of cooking.

699
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:20,360
Whether you all sleep in one room or not, I don't care.

700
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,630
I am tired, so feed yourselves.

701
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:25,720
We will do so.

702
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,510
You are hot because you are standing next to the furnace.

703
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:14,640
Do it outside.

704
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:18,050
Oh, okay.

705
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:16,550
Hyeongnim. What could be in the empty house now that the old lady is dead?

706
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:19,460
At this rate, if we are caught,

707
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,120
it is all over for us!

708
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,440
Geez! I should have taken that new bride's lawsuit

709
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:29,970
so I could dig into things in the village or the government office using the lawsuit as an excuse.

710
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:32,600
Is that why you wanted that lawsuit?

711
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,940
- Why else? 
- I mean.

712
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:38,520
You had a  different reason in front of So Won.

713
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,430
What did you say earlier?

714
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:47,210
"The new bride who chose to kill rather than kill herself—"

715
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:50,680
Come on.

716
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,720
In this barren land of Cheongsan,

717
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:58,350
I thought an amazing attorney was born.

718
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:01,440
I meant it. Okay?

719
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,750
It is just that it was not the only thing I meant.

720
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,640
Hurry up and search more. I will go to the next room.

721
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,320
"I meant it."

722
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:40,930
I knew you would come back.

723
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:44,520
Oh, I am sorry for coming into the wrong room.

724
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,710
Han Su.

725
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:52,230
It has been a long time.

726
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:02,710
I cannot believe you came back as an attorney.

727
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:07,310
I thought you would not even consider studying law.

728
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:09,600
"Habits are hard to break."

729
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,780
As the saying goes...

730
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,780
Father!

731
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,470
Father!

732
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:18,530
Father!

733
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:22,550
That bitch Yeong Sil is back.

734
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,060
Leave now.

735
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:41,230
Do not involve yourself in this matter further.

736
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:49,540
Why do you wish to hide it so much?

737
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,720
Jeong Wol.

738
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,200
Come here.

739
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,890
Come, come.

740
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:04,720
Gosh, scared me!

741
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:29,690
You know better than anyone

742
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:32,940
that we cannot trust the government,

743
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,860
national law, or the nation.

744
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,520
The reason for your father's death

745
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,880
was none other than the books that were sent as gifts.

746
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:47,270
Did you know about it?

747
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:58,830
You should have told me!

748
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:04,540
If you wish to find out even now, you should leave quietly.

749
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:09,740
Then I will tell you everything.

750
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:26,720
 No! No! No, Han Su!

751
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:30,170
 Why are you doing this? What did I do wrong?

752
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:09,710

753
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:14,790
 We worked with animal experts for scenes involving animals for their safety.

754
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:18,040
 We thank Kang Shin Il for his special appearance.

755
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,440
♫  Run away  ♫

756
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:25,390
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

757
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:26,600
 Are you crazy?

758
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,950
 Aren't you curious as to what the foreman knows?

759
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:35,020
 To be blunt, we do not know whether the new bride will be there or not!

760
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:41,320
 Young people these days do not know when to stop.

761
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,120
 They are fearless and come at you.

762
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:46,530
 You promised me

763
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:49,000
 that we would become each other's cheongshimhwan,* 
(Herbal medicine to calm your nerves)

764
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,130
 to be together always.

765
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:52,710
 When did it begin?

766
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:55,420
 When did you start having feelings for Attorney Kang?

767
01:08:55,420 --> 01:09:01,380
 If it has not been too long, let him go.
