1
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,440

2
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,800
 (12-year-old Princess Yeon Ju)

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,500
 (Minister Yu Se Je)

4
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:01,594
Father, Father!

5
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,854
Father!

6
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:06,234
F-Father...

7
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:14,654
Court Lady Hong! Royal Guard Go!

8
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:19,704
 Daejeon (Great Collection of Laws)

9
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,690
Your Majesty, please come back!

10
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:26,840
Your Majesty, please come back!

11
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:31,684
Your Majesty, please come back!

12
00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:45,284
All of you, stay outside for a moment.

13
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:49,334
We were ordered not to move recklessly until all organizing was done.

14
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:54,054
So are you going to disobey the princess' order now?

15
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,434
I  will obey.

16
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:16,174
What are you looking for? Why are you behaving unreasonably?

17
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:21,724
 Why are you outside?

18
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,194
You were told not to leave the room under any circumstance.

19
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:27,004
- Her Highness said... 
 - What?

20
00:02:32,244 --> 00:02:36,114
Your Highness, the Princess, what brings you here?

21
00:02:39,154 --> 00:02:43,964
Even if you are the princess, violating palace custom like this ...

22
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,854
Rules?

23
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:53,104
It is the palace custom to document and store all documents left by the late king.

24
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:55,794
I only came because I missed Father.

25
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:58,794
I do not intend to interrupt my subjects' work.

26
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:00,584
Let us leave.

27
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,714
One moment, please.

28
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:19,864
Wait—

29
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:24,814
Wait, why are you hiding that book?

30
00:03:25,994 --> 00:03:29,444
It is what Father gave me to read.

31
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:32,904
I already told you.

32
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:40,034
It is our duty to collect and organize all of His Majesty's documents and books.

33
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:45,114
Please make sure to give it back to me.

34
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:07,494
Are you okay?

35
00:04:19,854 --> 00:04:24,294
 Daejeon (Great Collection of Laws)

36
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,710
 Present time

37
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:46,034
 Sister... could we possibly bring down the power of Minister Yu Je Se?

38
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:52,994
An envoy came from the Ming dynasty but spent most of the time with the minister.

39
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:59,154
With the thing you requested back then and welcoming the envoy...

40
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:02,034
There is not a single thing I can do.

41
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:06,344
I am ashamed to be called the king.

42
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:15,994
If the regency ends, will it be possible?

43
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:21,634
Your Majesty, the end of the regency is not really the end.

44
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:23,534
You must grow your power.

45
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:27,454
You must keep close to your subjects who can aid you.

46
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:31,254
You must establish a standard on which you can rely.

47
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:33,264
You are talking about laws, right?

48
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:41,804
Would you believe that laws can become your sword?

49
00:05:47,484 --> 00:05:52,644
Hanseongbu's mayor and chief advisor positions should be vacant at the moment.

50
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:55,394
How did you know?

51
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:59,084
 Resignation Letter, Park Je Su

52
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:05,054
 Chief Advisor requested to be released due to personal reasons.

53
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:11,534
Your Majesty, I deeply apologize for my crime!

54
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:15,084
 Hanseongbu's mayor, on top of accepting bribes,

55
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,304
 had set a vile criminal free recently with his flawed judgment,

56
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:20,554
so I punished him severely.

57
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:26,514
All of that started from the tip of Attorney Kang Han Su's tongue.

58
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:29,494
You should fill those seats with your people.

59
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:34,844
People who will aid you, the people, and the country.

60
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:38,244
I seek to use the law as my sword

61
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:43,534
to cut out the rotten parts of society and grow new seeds in their places.

62
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:49,284
The one who wields that sword better than anyone is Attorney Kang Han Su.

63
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:56,184
 Daejeon

64
00:06:56,184 --> 00:07:02,044
I will use you in a crucial role in the work for the country and the people.

65
00:07:02,044 --> 00:07:06,084
That your sharp eye for the laws, brilliant brain,

66
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:11,664
and the eloquent way with words will comfort the hearts of the unjustly treated.

67
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:17,264
So I can also take a step closer to the world Father hoped for.

68
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:19,624
That is my wish and desire.

69
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:26,654
My goodness. Then will that man just go,

70
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,334
"Aigoo, is that so?"

71
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:32,764
Is that what you think?

72
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:35,154
He probably never would.

73
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:39,164
He will not even believe it. He will just think I am a crazy woman.

74
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:41,534
You are well aware.

75
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:45,794
Let us get out of here first. This place has a leak!

76
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:48,674
Gosh, what do I do then?

77
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:50,804
What do you mean? Think about it outside.

78
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,504
- Hurry! Aigoo, your acting got better.
 - I need to take—

79
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:56,834
Just hurry up and come out!

80
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:59,114
Attorney Kang!

81
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:05,064
Please use me as an assistant to deploy workers.

82
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:06,854
What are you saying right now?

83
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,874
I am saying I want to be your assistant.

84
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:10,924
I also do not mind being an investigator or a manager.

85
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,844
- I am not okay with it. 
 - The government office also has personal servants.

86
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:17,184
I will become your personal servant lady.

87
00:08:17,184 --> 00:08:20,754
- Is being a personal servant for anyone? 
 - You will ask me one day then.

88
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:24,094
Are you hurt? I am hurt, too.

89
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:26,634
That is enough for me.

90
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:30,264
You are clearly...

91
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:35,734
ill somewhere. You are a patient.

92
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:39,284
Therefore, I definitely cannot use an ill person as an assistant.

93
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,884
- Wait– 
 - I need to feed them the carrot, so go!

94
00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:45,874
- Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim! 
 - Why?

95
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:47,424
What now?

96
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,574
- The ship... 
 - Yes.

97
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:51,344
is sinking!

98
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:53,944
- What? 
 - It is getting flooded!

99
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:56,524
Hurry up and come!

100
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:58,314
You should hire me as an assistant.

101
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:04,184
Then I will provide you with an office that does not have leaks or get flooded.

102
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:09,024
- Do you think I will be convinced— 
 - I will give you the largest room in this place.

103
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:11,974
That is great!

104
00:09:21,534 --> 00:09:27,774
 Episode 3: Divorce Suit Vol. 1

105
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:32,244
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

106
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,020
 Kim Ho Jun

107
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:48,544
Hey, hey, hey.

108
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:55,424
And this place is...

109
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:57,454
Is that the man the Princess— I mean,

110
00:09:57,454 --> 00:10:00,614
So Won brought?

111
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:04,024
Yes. That guy is the man.

112
00:10:04,024 --> 00:10:08,714
Unlike typical lawyers who memorize legal books, he looks so handsome.

113
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:09,640
I am sure he lives up to it.

114
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:13,404
Gosh, he's handsome. So handsome.

115
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,414
All right, and this room is...

116
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,744
Well, I'm just saying.

117
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:27,384
From living in my own house to renting a place in someone else's inn?

118
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:31,274
You talk as if you were kidnapped.

119
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:36,064
We house and feed you. What are you so unhappy about?

120
00:10:37,364 --> 00:10:39,654
Does this place also provide meals?

121
00:10:46,404 --> 00:10:47,984
Go ahead and receive them.

122
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:50,934
They are the top contributors to our inn's sales.

123
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:56,234
Geez. All soup and rice are the same soup and rice.

124
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:00,574
It's delicious!

125
00:11:00,574 --> 00:11:02,774
We have a house!

126
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:16,084
Gosh, let's accept her, all right?

127
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:21,014
I am telling you, it is the same as falling into a pot of gold.

128
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,854
No, it is dangerous, no matter how I think about it.

129
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:26,754
We cannot accept someone who does not know our circumstances as an assistant.

130
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:30,484
Th-Then, just let her work temporarily for now.

131
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:34,544
Gosh, we at least need to earn some time to fix the ship.

132
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:41,374
That is how you get trapped.

133
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:43,314
We need to keep a cool head at times like this.

134
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:47,774
Was your head not cool enough when you bought this faulty used ship for that high price?

135
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,244
What the hell is this?

136
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:55,364
This is nuts.

137
00:11:57,824 --> 00:12:01,664
I need to uncover his weakness, but I am so busy.

138
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:09,080
Let's just accept her offer!

139
00:12:15,074 --> 00:12:19,344
 We provide legal consulting.

140
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:22,624
 Legal Department

141
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:29,324
Gosh, what the heck is this?

142
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:34,644
This is a lawsuit I brought in.

143
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:36,554
Please sit down.

144
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:41,934
All right. What is your story?

145
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:46,324
I am suing Park here to get payment for the medicine. 
   Legal Department

146
00:12:46,324 --> 00:12:51,244
Park has been sick for more than a decade, but he got better recently, thanks to me.

147
00:12:51,244 --> 00:12:55,404
Therefore, isn't it only right for him to pay me for the treatment?

148
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:58,634
In fact, I have been suffering from an illness

149
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:05,034
that the physician also gave up on, saying eating beef is the only cure.

150
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:11,274
However, Sir Kim was eating beef a few days ago.

151
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:17,414
So I stood by the wall to at least get a smell.

152
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:22,434
I do not know what happened, but I got completely better the next day.

153
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:26,634
- I see... 
 - But if you did not even really eat beef,

154
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:29,714
there is no guarantee your illness got better because of beef.

155
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:33,334
- So you need to pay for the treatment. 
 - What?

156
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:39,544
I told you! Your reputation was not for nothing, huh?

157
00:13:39,544 --> 00:13:42,424
I spent 50 nyang for the beef back then.

158
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:44,704
Just pay me half of that.

159
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:49,534
It will cost you more than 25 nyang to go through a lawsuit, so just end it here.

160
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:51,144
Now, then.

161
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:53,234
Wait, Sir!

162
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,084
All right. There you go.

163
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:03,844
Was that enough?

164
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,804
Wait, what are you doing right now?

165
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,194
Park got better just from smelling the beef,

166
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:14,424
so would it not be fair for you only to hear the sound of the money?

167
00:14:15,614 --> 00:14:18,274
- There.
 - Thank you.

168
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,114
Thank you...

169
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:28,714
- There, there. One moment. 
 - What more do you want?

170
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:32,524
You got consulted, so you need to pay. It will be five nyang.

171
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:34,334
What did you say?

172
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:39,274
You would not be cheating the attorney of his money, would you?

173
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:59,764
How can you say this now? Are you not going to hire me as an assistant?

174
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:04,314
Now, now. I said I would pay five nyang per day for each stay in the inn, did I not?

175
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:07,364
If you are like this, I will give you the exact breakdown of costs then.

176
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,354
You and your friend are eating, sleeping, and pooping in the inn.

177
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:13,124
And your donkey is eating, sleeping, and pooping in the inn's stable.

178
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:15,984
With all of that combined, even ten nyang per day is not enough.

179
00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:18,964
So could I record the missing five nyang in the ledger and add the interest daily?

180
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:22,274
Wh-Whoa, easy, easy.

181
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:39,634
I give you a pass on your persistence.

182
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:43,604
You are good with numbers, so you would not get scammed somewhere.

183
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:46,854
Great. I will give you a chance.

184
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:50,114
I will test you to see if you qualify to become my assistant.

185
00:15:50,114 --> 00:15:52,224
What is the test?

186
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:55,954
Here.

187
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:59,184
This is the reason I became an attorney.

188
00:15:59,184 --> 00:16:01,434
Therefore, you make your own pouch, too.

189
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:05,614
You will also need to find out what you want to put in there.

190
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:09,664
This is the first test.

191
00:16:13,394 --> 00:16:15,624
I got it.

192
00:16:17,194 --> 00:16:18,374
A money pouch?

193
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:21,844
Yes! He said that is why he became an attorney.

194
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:26,834
At first, I thought it was for money, but it felt like there was a trap.

195
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:29,764
I think I must find out more about Kang Han Su.

196
00:16:29,764 --> 00:16:31,804
I will be able to convince him after that.

197
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:35,604
- I feel like this is his strategy. 
 - What?

198
00:16:35,604 --> 00:16:40,064
Acting like something is there when there is nothing and

199
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:43,594
- making you think there is something in there. 
 - What?

200
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:47,144
Princess, you got played by him.

201
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:49,294
- No, I didn't! 
 - You were played.

202
00:16:49,294 --> 00:16:51,084
I did?

203
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:57,584
Where is this tangerine from?

204
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,704
That's right.

205
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:01,744
We got a letter from him.

206
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:04,354
He even sent this precious thing this time.

207
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:07,064
- The elder? 
 - Yes.

208
00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:13,284
 By the time this letter arrives,

209
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:17,734
 I will probably also have arrived in Hanyang.

210
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:23,524
 I hope you find it useful

211
00:17:23,524 --> 00:17:26,834
 that instead of bringing the tangerines with me I have sent them.

212
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:28,874
He said he was coming to Hanyang.

213
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:32,254
Last month was Hameung, and the month before that was Buyeo.

214
00:17:32,254 --> 00:17:36,084
What does he do to be traveling all over the country?

215
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:40,514
I do not know what he does, but I think I know what kind of a person he is.

216
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:44,474
He must be a kind and righteous person.

217
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:47,654
I am getting such feelings from the letter already.

218
00:17:47,654 --> 00:17:49,634
I do not know about other things

219
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:54,824
but seeing how he always donates royal court quality regional specialties,

220
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:58,264
I can tell that he is a very wealthy person.

221
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:03,644
Tell him you feel bad for getting help all the time, so ask him to meet in person this time.

222
00:18:03,644 --> 00:18:07,284
If he wanted to show himself, he would have done so already.

223
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:10,914
Elder probably wants to continue helping anonymously like now.

224
00:18:10,914 --> 00:18:15,234
I do not want to burden him for no reason, and I am also quite busy at the moment.

225
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:20,754
Kang Han Su... what could it be?

226
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:24,954
Still, you need to send a reply.

227
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:27,824
Yes. I should.

228
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:31,934
Gosh, Kang Han Su...

229
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:35,254
How can I convince him?

230
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:39,454
Hello! Is anyone there?

231
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:42,074
It's the peddler!

232
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:55,074
He is not the type to live in hiding because of being demoted.

233
00:18:59,664 --> 00:19:01,564
Your Excellency!

234
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:07,554
Grand Merchant Jo here will help prepare the celebratory feast for your appointment.

235
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:09,884
Allow me to introduce myself officially.

236
00:19:09,884 --> 00:19:13,644
My name is Jo Cheol Ju, and I am the new grand merchant.

237
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:18,094
I like you a lot.

238
00:19:18,094 --> 00:19:25,864
I especially like that we have no memories or mutual connections between us the most.

239
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:32,054
Sharing the past with someone can be really tiring sometimes.

240
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:43,304
Give it a good try.

241
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:56,164
Do not forget this is where things become crucial for you and me.

242
00:19:56,164 --> 00:19:57,824
Yes.

243
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:20,014
Jipyeong Yu Ji Seon, formerly of the Office of the Inspector General, went undercover for years all over the country, 
  Jipyeong: Junior 5 Rank Position

244
00:20:20,014 --> 00:20:26,004
modifying public sentiment that could have gone wrong after corrupt investigations.

245
00:20:26,004 --> 00:20:31,314
For your great achievements, which are recognized, you will be promoted in rank, and

246
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:35,304
you will be rewarded a high government position.

247
00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:38,834
Yu Ji Sun, I install you as the mayor of Hanseongbu, second senior rank.

248
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:42,924
Dedicate your body and mind to serve His Majesty's will.

249
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,700
 Hanseongbu:  The Capital Bureau, in charge of administering Hanyang, Joseon's capital.

250
00:20:49,724 --> 00:20:53,854
Your grace is boundless, Your Majesty.

251
00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:14,634
Hurry up and go, all right?

252
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:17,854
Hurry up, now! Hurry!

253
00:21:17,854 --> 00:21:20,814
Carry two bottles at a time!

254
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:25,254
Hurry! Okay, good. Two bottles.

255
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:50,544
Jeong Yeong, hold your chin up.

256
00:21:51,884 --> 00:21:53,884
Stares.

257
00:21:53,884 --> 00:21:56,094
Smiles.

258
00:21:58,294 --> 00:22:01,954
Gosh, you are supposed to come here to have fun, not to work.

259
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,184
How great a person are they expecting that they're going to this much trouble?

260
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:07,884
Whoever it is, I will resent him.

261
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,320
  Wishes Inn

262
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,534
My Lady!

263
00:22:17,534 --> 00:22:20,554
Why did you come in person this year?

264
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:22,754
I did not come to donate today.

265
00:22:22,754 --> 00:22:27,454
I know. We still have a lot of the rice and textiles you sent last time.

266
00:22:27,454 --> 00:22:31,534
You seem to have come for fresh air, so please stay at our inn.

267
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,984
- Aigoo! 
 - Hey, look at him!

268
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:13,324
He is good.

269
00:23:29,344 --> 00:23:31,564
I don't want to do this!

270
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:36,134
You will be chasing away the good fortune that is coming.

271
00:23:36,134 --> 00:23:37,574
Exactly!

272
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:42,194
Making the pouch itself is harder than thinking about what to put in it!

273
00:23:42,194 --> 00:23:46,074
I hated sewing even when I was at the palace.

274
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:54,244
But you don't seem that much better, Nanny.

275
00:24:00,194 --> 00:24:02,624
Gosh, do you have to go this far?

276
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:06,694
I do not think Attorney Kang will actually be of any help...

277
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:09,794
aside from his pretty face.

278
00:24:09,794 --> 00:24:14,374
Do you not know how I grew an eye for people at the palace?

279
00:24:14,374 --> 00:24:16,144
He is sure to have dark motives.

280
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:19,044
I need to grow him more to see his leaves.

281
00:24:19,044 --> 00:24:21,624
If I cut him down early, I will never know.

282
00:24:21,624 --> 00:24:24,414
If the method is wrong, I can just fix that.

283
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:26,444
It just needs to be fixed!

284
00:24:33,364 --> 00:24:35,384
Will this work?

285
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:40,084
Should I throw it out?

286
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:46,554
Should we ask Madam Yeol of Gukhwabang?

287
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:51,434
Don't you think it would be possible to fix them with her sewing skills?

288
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:54,154
Yes! That's a great idea.

289
00:24:54,154 --> 00:24:55,934
Princess, be careful.

290
00:24:55,934 --> 00:24:58,234
Princess, be careful, please

291
00:25:01,574 --> 00:25:03,604
My Lady!

292
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:07,554
My Lady!

293
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:14,944
She must have gone outside.

294
00:25:14,944 --> 00:25:17,214
She was here just moments ago.

295
00:25:27,864 --> 00:25:31,314
Gosh, that felt great.

296
00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:51,254
All right.

297
00:25:52,504 --> 00:25:54,284
Did I not tell you?

298
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:56,994
Aigoo, she is good.

299
00:25:57,994 --> 00:26:00,094
She is great.

300
00:26:00,924 --> 00:26:03,064
Yes, that is good.

301
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:07,014
The views are great.

302
00:26:07,014 --> 00:26:09,134
Aigoo, yes, yes.

303
00:26:10,644 --> 00:26:12,674
Fill it up.

304
00:26:14,664 --> 00:26:16,994
Come over here.

305
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:18,584
More, more.

306
00:26:18,584 --> 00:26:20,714
Fill it up.

307
00:26:25,324 --> 00:26:27,874
I have not had this much fun in a while.

308
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,724
I need more drinks here!

309
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:51,504
Let me pour you one.

310
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:58,734
I almost lost Minister's trust because of Grand Merchant Jang.

311
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:03,234
How can I repay you for giving me a chance to make up for it like this?

312
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:05,894
If you are aware, that is fine.

313
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:07,854
Yes, Your Excellency.

314
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:48,834
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

315
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,534
Bring in a physician!

316
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,714
What are you doing?

317
00:28:21,974 --> 00:28:25,604
 All right. This is not right.

318
00:28:28,534 --> 00:28:31,884
 I must know the reason.

319
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:38,144
 Why did my parents have to be killed so brutally?

320
00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:40,254
 I need to know...

321
00:29:05,714 --> 00:29:07,644
My Lady!

322
00:29:13,204 --> 00:29:15,664
Are you okay?

323
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:17,514
You are So Won.

324
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:19,264
Yes.

325
00:29:35,804 --> 00:29:39,884
Your Excellency, Governor Song Nae Gyeong of Pyeongyang-bu's chronic illness got worse,

326
00:29:39,884 --> 00:29:43,724
so he submitted a petition asking to be released.

327
00:29:43,724 --> 00:29:46,604
Governor of Pyeongyang-bu?

328
00:29:46,604 --> 00:29:48,434
He is only forty years old, is he not?

329
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:52,574
Pyeongyang is where we, Hungu, have not yet settled properly.

330
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:59,034
One of our men must be the governor since Sarim Party has a big influence there.

331
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:04,934
I am sure his illness is only an excuse.

332
00:30:07,064 --> 00:30:10,474
Song Nae Gyeong agreed to leave his position because he was caught

333
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:13,224
having an affair with a powerful local's daughter.

334
00:30:13,224 --> 00:30:17,324
So if we withdraw this petition, that powerful local will not sit and watch.

335
00:30:17,324 --> 00:30:23,964
Give that powerful local a government position and send him to the central government.

336
00:30:23,964 --> 00:30:28,434
Hogun, fourth senior rank, the position sounds about right.

337
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:32,474
Would it not be too great of a position?

338
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:36,564
I am giving it to him because I see it to be adequate.

339
00:30:36,564 --> 00:30:43,184
He needs to realize we have that much power, so he will not think of fighting back in the future.

340
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:49,394
Also, tell him if he soils one of the Hungu Party's achievements again

341
00:30:49,394 --> 00:30:54,254
he will have to pay the price, including today's debt with his life.

342
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:56,234
Yes, Your Excellency.

343
00:30:57,724 --> 00:31:02,434
Replacing only Song Nae Gyeong is not enough.

344
00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:06,504
I want to appoint one more person from our side.

345
00:31:06,504 --> 00:31:12,460
Yes, we should similarly replace the assistant in Pyeongyang-bu with a new fourth-rank.   So...

346
00:31:39,894 --> 00:31:41,854
This is my first time seeing Minister.

347
00:31:41,854 --> 00:31:47,764
This place feels like a palace, not a feasting ground when he speaks.

348
00:31:47,764 --> 00:31:49,944
Yes, you are right.

349
00:31:49,944 --> 00:31:54,804
Since every stare and every word from the minister is part of politics...

350
00:31:54,804 --> 00:31:58,730
this place is the royal council hall and the palace.

351
00:32:00,424 --> 00:32:06,014
 We just did what we were told.

352
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,674
 It was an order from the highest...

353
00:32:09,674 --> 00:32:13,384
 It was an order we could not disobey.

354
00:32:13,384 --> 00:32:15,714
Right.

355
00:32:15,714 --> 00:32:18,934
So it might not have been the king?

356
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:22,554
- Sorry? 
 - Huh? Nothing.

357
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:25,824
- By the way, who planned this feast? 
 - Chief Advisor.

358
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:28,534
I heard he emptied his pockets.

359
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:31,394
He must have gone mad from getting demoted.

360
00:32:31,394 --> 00:32:33,944
All of this costs a fortune.

361
00:32:36,114 --> 00:32:39,214
Park Je Su.

362
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:42,954
He got a hold of the most expensive line in the afterlife.

363
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:48,284
 My Lady.

364
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:03,794
My Lady!

365
00:33:08,984 --> 00:33:11,014
My Lady.

366
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:45,984
 That day was the last day of the three-year-mourning for my father.

367
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,054
 You are what they call a heavenly maiden.

368
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:53,694
 Please draw me beautifully.

369
00:33:55,264 --> 00:33:59,854
 Honestly, I was aware as well

370
00:33:59,854 --> 00:34:03,114
 that he visited the brothel every day.

371
00:34:03,114 --> 00:34:08,774
 That he also gave his heart, as well as his body, to the same girl.

372
00:34:08,774 --> 00:34:12,584
 I knew everything, but I covered my ears, closed my eyes

373
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:17,244
 and endured, thinking that is the virtue of a wife.

374
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:21,284
- When will you give me a share of your fortune? 
 -However...

375
00:34:21,284 --> 00:34:25,024
Well, that depends on how you do.

376
00:34:25,024 --> 00:34:29,154
- I do not like this room, though.
 - Why not?

377
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:33,444
Did you not say your father-in-law passed away in this room?

378
00:34:33,444 --> 00:34:35,874
There is nothing to fear.

379
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:41,184
I am sure he already forgot everything and crossed the river.

380
00:34:41,184 --> 00:34:46,344
Right before he passed away, I granted him his wish.

381
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:51,564
I gave him a bunch of sweets that he so desperately wanted.

382
00:34:51,564 --> 00:34:54,344
But I heard that the elder suffered from diabetes.

383
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:56,794
That is not my problem.

384
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:09,034
Father!

385
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:11,174
Father!

386
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:14,154
Father...

387
00:35:17,644 --> 00:35:19,724
Father...

388
00:35:25,244 --> 00:35:29,534
Well... how come you came back this early?

389
00:35:29,534 --> 00:35:31,904
- Leave.
 - What?

390
00:35:31,904 --> 00:35:35,334
- No, no. It is fine.
 - Right now!

391
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:41,424
You will catch a cold.

392
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:54,574
It was you.

393
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:56,774
What do you mean?

394
00:35:56,774 --> 00:36:01,884
My father passed away suddenly due to his deteriorating health condition.

395
00:36:01,884 --> 00:36:04,754
Did you plan it?

396
00:36:04,754 --> 00:36:07,184
I did not do anything. Why are you treating me like this?

397
00:36:07,184 --> 00:36:11,594
- With my filial duty, my father-in-law...
 - I will file a lawsuit.

398
00:36:11,594 --> 00:36:13,584
What?

399
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:19,254
I will sue you in court and reveal everything you have done.

400
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:24,784
And I will make sure you receive a fair punishment.

401
00:36:24,784 --> 00:36:27,304
I will never...

402
00:36:27,304 --> 00:36:31,194
I will never overlook this.

403
00:36:35,114 --> 00:36:37,494
Are you crazy, you bitch?

404
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:41,374
I guess you do not know anything because you are dense, you bitch.

405
00:36:41,374 --> 00:36:47,914
But there is no such law in Joseon that allows a wife to sue her husband.

406
00:36:52,784 --> 00:36:57,654
If your mother were alive, she would have sued me in place of her daughter.

407
00:36:57,654 --> 00:36:59,344
But what should you do?

408
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:03,734
Your mother and father are already dead.

409
00:37:07,884 --> 00:37:12,184
If you want to eat a memorial meal after you die,

410
00:37:12,184 --> 00:37:18,424
just shut your mouth and live quietly as a mouse.

411
00:37:19,184 --> 00:37:21,474
Do you get it?

412
00:37:30,824 --> 00:37:33,504
 All I could do at that time was

413
00:37:38,234 --> 00:37:42,454
 just smash the jar of food that

414
00:37:43,624 --> 00:37:47,084
 I had made for my husband every day.

415
00:37:57,894 --> 00:38:01,274
 Shall we dance? Where are you going?

416
00:38:01,274 --> 00:38:04,184
Mayor Sir.

417
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:05,764
What is this?

418
00:38:05,764 --> 00:38:10,264
It's nothing special, but they say my wife has

419
00:38:10,264 --> 00:38:15,454
the best cooking skills in this entire capital city.

420
00:38:15,454 --> 00:38:21,384
This is a gift from me, so please, do not hesitate to take it.

421
00:38:22,294 --> 00:38:24,894
- No, thank you. 
 - Yes...

422
00:38:24,894 --> 00:38:26,394
Yes?

423
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:32,174
You did not even see what is inside.

424
00:38:32,174 --> 00:38:34,064
Here it is. /  (Ginseng roots: were scarce and highly revered for health benefits.)

425
00:38:35,184 --> 00:38:37,194
 This precious thing is...

426
00:38:37,194 --> 00:38:40,274
It is made with my wife's sincerity.

427
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:43,664
Please taste it.

428
00:38:50,054 --> 00:38:52,524
Please try it.

429
00:38:52,524 --> 00:38:55,294
How precious it is to be brought all the way here.

430
00:38:55,294 --> 00:39:01,024
Chief Advisor's wife's pickled ginseng is highly praised even by Ming dynasty envoys.

431
00:39:25,224 --> 00:39:28,434
- Take it. 
 - Pardon?

432
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:32,364
Share it with those who have worked hard to prepare for the banquet.

433
00:39:32,364 --> 00:39:35,824
They might need more nourishment than me.

434
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:38,354
Is it okay with you?

435
00:39:38,354 --> 00:39:42,874
Of course. This is a gift anyway, so feel free to do as you please.

436
00:39:44,054 --> 00:39:45,694
Then...

437
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:52,714
You. You!

438
00:40:20,174 --> 00:40:26,304
Is this not the precious blue and white porcelain that can only be used in the royal palace?

439
00:40:27,824 --> 00:40:33,274
Our devotion to Joseon is no less than that of the royal family.

440
00:40:33,274 --> 00:40:39,334
So we just need to demonstrate that we are qualified to use this from now on.

441
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:44,804
We sure will do that.

442
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:49,034
Let us have a drink.

443
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:52,474
Thank you, Your Excellency.

444
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:21,644
Yes.

445
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:24,044
Hurry it up.

446
00:41:24,044 --> 00:41:26,624
Oh, so good.

447
00:41:27,844 --> 00:41:29,754
You are here.

448
00:41:42,194 --> 00:41:44,854
Kang Han Su.

449
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:53,504
I cannot understand.

450
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:59,364
I feel like my lungs are torn apart, and I cannot even breathe.

451
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:03,584
The tears, like blood, do not stop as if I was stabbed with a sickle.

452
00:42:04,944 --> 00:42:07,674
Even if I pinch and hit the bruise and

453
00:42:07,674 --> 00:42:12,014
use physical pain to try to forget the pain of the heart,

454
00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:14,794
it is of no use.

455
00:42:17,974 --> 00:42:21,534
I am not sure whether it is right to live like this or

456
00:42:23,604 --> 00:42:26,164
just leave it to fate.

457
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:30,224
This is not up to time or fate.

458
00:42:32,394 --> 00:42:35,714
Your case requires people to take action directly, My Lady

459
00:42:35,714 --> 00:42:38,324
You should find an attorney.

460
00:42:38,324 --> 00:42:40,594
What do you think?

461
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:47,074
If one violates the principles of Gangsang*, it becomes a sin in itself, 
  (The code of conduct during the Joseon dynasty)

462
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:50,914
and they will be socially punished with disgrace.

463
00:42:50,914 --> 00:42:56,414
They would say I am not a principled woman, so it's no wonder the husband behaved so.

464
00:42:56,414 --> 00:42:59,014
They would rather take my husband's side.

465
00:42:59,014 --> 00:43:06,574
As you know, a divorced woman is treated worse than a butcher.

466
00:43:06,574 --> 00:43:09,414
Then do women always have to endure it?

467
00:43:09,414 --> 00:43:13,324
No, that does not make sense.

468
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:17,564
There must be another way that we do not know about.

469
00:43:30,784 --> 00:43:34,044
Did you get any clue from Dohwaseo*? 
  (Office in charge of paintings needed by the court)

470
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:38,704
No one had such a personal grudge as to want to sue the Chief Advisor.

471
00:43:38,704 --> 00:43:40,604
Is that so?

472
00:43:40,604 --> 00:43:45,294
But there was a rumor that Myeong Wol was going to become Chief Park's concubine.

473
00:43:48,174 --> 00:43:52,274
Did you find anything, Hyeongnim?

474
00:43:52,274 --> 00:43:57,064
I found it, but... I could not find it.

475
00:43:57,064 --> 00:43:59,034
What does that mean?

476
00:44:00,614 --> 00:44:04,774
It seems like the chief manages his connections better than expected.

477
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:08,254
The real leader of the Hungu Faction Chu Yeong Wu is watching his back.

478
00:44:08,254 --> 00:44:12,534
He even met Minister Yu's son today and was fawning over him.

479
00:44:12,534 --> 00:44:17,674
There was talk today that he is likely to secure the position of Vice-Governor of Pyeongyangbu at the 4th senior rank.

480
00:44:17,674 --> 00:44:21,674
Pyeongyang-bu is the next important region after Hanseongbu.

481
00:44:21,674 --> 00:44:25,624
Is that not a prestigious job that is as enviable as the 3rd senior or higher ranks?

482
00:44:25,624 --> 00:44:27,874
That is correct.

483
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:30,184
Let us accuse him of corruption in the government personnel administration.

484
00:44:30,184 --> 00:44:33,194
Say something that makes sense.

485
00:44:34,154 --> 00:44:37,524
There is no way he left any evidence, and they are all the same,

486
00:44:37,524 --> 00:44:42,254
so who will stand as a witness? Think about it.

487
00:44:42,254 --> 00:44:46,124
How did the new mayor of Hanseongbu seem?

488
00:44:46,124 --> 00:44:49,874
No matter what he does, he is still the minister's son.

489
00:44:49,874 --> 00:44:52,854
He is now acting like an uptight, innocent, compulsive,

490
00:44:52,854 --> 00:44:55,784
incorruptible government official.

491
00:44:55,784 --> 00:44:59,004
After all, the skin is nearer than the shirt (one needs to look after one's own interests first).

492
00:44:59,704 --> 00:45:05,114
That is why... I live like this.

493
00:45:07,924 --> 00:45:13,494
We need to find the muddy road. The muddy road.

494
00:45:15,334 --> 00:45:18,584
The road that he can never escape.

495
00:45:30,124 --> 00:45:33,774
You are here, Your Excellency and Young Master.

496
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,724
Ji Seon.

497
00:45:42,724 --> 00:45:44,284
Yes, Father.

498
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:46,274
Just enjoy it.

499
00:45:46,274 --> 00:45:49,904
You do not need to be so sharp already.

500
00:45:49,904 --> 00:45:54,264
Do not doubt if I am allowed to do this and enjoy it.

501
00:45:55,474 --> 00:45:58,944
That is why we are trying to have power.

502
00:46:00,044 --> 00:46:05,544
You are... my, the minister's, son.

503
00:46:05,544 --> 00:46:11,334
You are capable of doing whatever you want or achieving whatever you desire.

504
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:17,034
So consider those people who were bowing their heads in front of you earlier

505
00:46:17,034 --> 00:46:20,414
as your people,

506
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:23,844
and when they are in difficult situations,

507
00:46:23,844 --> 00:46:28,644
embrace them with a little more warmth than others.

508
00:46:29,614 --> 00:46:35,904
If you do, your domain will naturally thrive.

509
00:46:53,484 --> 00:46:56,134
Can I really expect it with confidence?

510
00:46:56,134 --> 00:46:59,454
The gaze of the minister lingered on you.

511
00:46:59,454 --> 00:47:02,854
That is the minister's answer.

512
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:08,074
The thing is how well you can establish roots there.

513
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:11,574
Is it not your foundation here in Hanyang?

514
00:47:11,574 --> 00:47:13,594
Your house and land are all here,

515
00:47:13,594 --> 00:47:19,064
and even the property is registered under your wife's name, is not it?

516
00:47:19,064 --> 00:47:21,914
You do not need to worry about it.

517
00:47:21,914 --> 00:47:26,274
If I were to make a new start in Pyeongyang, it would require a lot of assets.

518
00:47:26,274 --> 00:47:30,064
In any case, I would have to dispose of all my assets,

519
00:47:30,064 --> 00:47:32,674
whether they are real estate or personal property.

520
00:47:32,674 --> 00:47:36,864
And I must show proper respect to the minister and other ministers.

521
00:47:36,864 --> 00:47:39,114
What about your wife?

522
00:47:42,634 --> 00:47:47,644
Is the law not supposed to be used at times like this?

523
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:55,890
 Wishes Inn

524
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,464
It looks like you failed to make a pocket.

525
00:48:06,464 --> 00:48:10,414
Seeing you're trying to distract me with all this food.

526
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:16,434
The pocket is being made well.

527
00:48:16,434 --> 00:48:20,844
This is a bribe for something else.

528
00:48:20,844 --> 00:48:22,554
Bribe?

529
00:48:22,554 --> 00:48:26,484
Okay, then I will eat first.

530
00:48:26,484 --> 00:48:30,354
Please take your time and have a conversation together.

531
00:48:30,354 --> 00:48:32,264
Hurry up and say it.

532
00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:33,734
Maybe you have heard it before,

533
00:48:33,734 --> 00:48:38,634
but there are three very grateful supporters who secretly help us at our inn.

534
00:48:38,634 --> 00:48:42,174
It looks like it will take a while. Then I will eat it first.

535
00:48:42,174 --> 00:48:44,594
One is an anonymous supporter who is an elderly person.

536
00:48:44,594 --> 00:48:48,634
That person travels around the country and sends us local specialties in parcels.

537
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,434
So we sell them at a very high price and use them to cover the costs of the inn.

538
00:48:51,434 --> 00:48:53,644
Another is a member of the royal family.

539
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:56,624
Someone close to our innkeeper sends us rice every quarter.

540
00:48:56,624 --> 00:48:58,774
- Are you listening? 
 - What? Yes.

541
00:48:58,774 --> 00:49:01,734
The last person is the noble lady, who is currently staying in the

542
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:03,644
Chrysanthemum Room on the second floor.

543
00:49:03,644 --> 00:49:06,544
Did the lady in the Chrysanthemum Room file a lawsuit or something?

544
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:07,624
Yes!

545
00:49:07,624 --> 00:49:08,544
Why?

546
00:49:08,544 --> 00:49:11,834
Did she get scammed out of her money or did a slave run away?

547
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:15,284
Or is she arguing with her siblings over the use of her family gravesite?

548
00:49:15,284 --> 00:49:17,224
No, she did not.

549
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:22,354
She wants to... sue her husband.

550
00:49:22,354 --> 00:49:25,164
I see.

551
00:49:25,164 --> 00:49:27,034
What?

552
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:30,684
- "Wife sues husband"? 
 - Yes.

553
00:49:30,684 --> 00:49:34,874
If she does that, she is more likely to get punished.

554
00:49:34,874 --> 00:49:38,104
That is why I am saying. I thought you might have other options.

555
00:49:38,104 --> 00:49:40,914
Yes, there are, there are.

556
00:49:40,914 --> 00:49:45,544
But she should have gone to the Samshin grandmothers instead of me. 
  (Three gods of fertility)

557
00:49:45,544 --> 00:49:48,224
- Samshin grandmothers? 
 - Yes!

558
00:49:49,414 --> 00:49:54,244
The lady should be reborn as a man.

559
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:56,924
So it would be much quicker to ask the Samshin grandmothers than me.

560
00:49:56,924 --> 00:49:59,294
Okay, then—

561
00:50:00,634 --> 00:50:02,704
Give me the spoon.

562
00:50:02,704 --> 00:50:05,214
Shall we eat?

563
00:50:15,194 --> 00:50:19,284
Is it not a lawyer's job to help a person facing injustice?

564
00:50:19,284 --> 00:50:20,954
Sir!

565
00:50:20,954 --> 00:50:22,794
Sir!

566
00:50:23,964 --> 00:50:25,574
Fine.

567
00:50:26,344 --> 00:50:29,964
Could anyone testify that Her Ladyship is in an unfair situation?

568
00:50:29,964 --> 00:50:32,714
Well... There is!

569
00:50:32,714 --> 00:50:34,394
There is a servant of the house,

570
00:50:34,394 --> 00:50:38,444
and the courtesan her husband is playing around with.

571
00:50:38,444 --> 00:50:42,824
If a servant betrays his master, he will lose his head. Who is going to testify?

572
00:50:42,824 --> 00:50:47,004
And since the courtesan is directly involved also, she would not say anything against herself.

573
00:50:47,004 --> 00:50:49,594
But it is true.

574
00:50:49,594 --> 00:50:52,314
Who says it is true?

575
00:50:52,314 --> 00:50:56,444
Her Ladyship? Are you sure she does not have another man?

576
00:50:56,444 --> 00:50:58,944
She is not like that! What a terrible thing to say!

577
00:50:58,944 --> 00:51:04,254
How can you be so sure? Even a married couple of twenty years cannot trust each other.

578
00:51:04,254 --> 00:51:08,054
Trusting someone hastily is poison to attorneys.

579
00:51:12,024 --> 00:51:15,144
What do you want me to do then?

580
00:51:15,144 --> 00:51:17,904
I'm telling you to give up.

581
00:51:19,904 --> 00:51:21,944
Kang Han Su.

582
00:51:21,944 --> 00:51:23,524
Kang Han Su.

583
00:51:23,524 --> 00:51:27,034
Kang Han Su! Kang Han Su!

584
00:51:27,034 --> 00:51:28,664
Prin—

585
00:51:31,604 --> 00:51:33,774
So Won.

586
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:35,724
Ta-da!

587
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:38,804
How is this? Is this enough to pass?

588
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:42,514
It's old-fashioned...

589
00:51:42,514 --> 00:51:44,244
 I will give you the money!

590
00:51:44,244 --> 00:51:48,254
 I will pay you enough fees. How much do you want?

591
00:51:50,384 --> 00:51:52,754
 Wait...

592
00:51:52,754 --> 00:51:56,074
Innkeeper, I beg a favor of you.

593
00:51:57,204 --> 00:51:59,144
What is it?

594
00:52:00,054 --> 00:52:01,904
Find Kang Han Su's weakness for me.

595
00:52:01,904 --> 00:52:04,854
He refused a fortune that he was so fond of. Does this make sense?

596
00:52:04,854 --> 00:52:07,304
Did he refuse money?

597
00:52:08,424 --> 00:52:12,684
He did. He refused the money.

598
00:52:14,004 --> 00:52:17,074
It was not money that moved him.

599
00:52:17,074 --> 00:52:19,664
I got it wrong.

600
00:52:22,814 --> 00:52:26,344
Then what is this?

601
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:30,124
This is too old-fashioned. What is this?

602
00:52:32,914 --> 00:52:37,774
This is a game where a bottle is spun, and the person it stops in front of has to answer a question.

603
00:52:37,774 --> 00:52:41,164
If you cannot answer, you can empty the cup to pass on your turn.

604
00:52:44,364 --> 00:52:48,914
There are too many leftover drinks at the inn.

605
00:52:48,914 --> 00:52:51,434
Too many. Way too many.

606
00:52:54,594 --> 00:52:57,034
If it's a free drink...

607
00:52:58,034 --> 00:53:00,224
I would love to!

608
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,314
I will play it.

609
00:53:06,244 --> 00:53:08,264
Let me spin it.

610
00:53:27,524 --> 00:53:29,694
Where is his hometown?

611
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:34,284
Why do you ask that?

612
00:53:34,284 --> 00:53:38,694
Well, if I know his hometown,

613
00:53:38,694 --> 00:53:41,114
we can become closer, right?

614
00:53:42,684 --> 00:53:45,164
Is that so?

615
00:53:48,294 --> 00:53:51,614
Oops, I drank it.

616
00:53:51,614 --> 00:53:55,354
I will not answer, according to the rules, then.

617
00:53:55,354 --> 00:53:57,744
Silly, silly.

618
00:54:07,194 --> 00:54:09,994
Why did he refuse the lawsuit when he goes crazy for money?

619
00:54:09,994 --> 00:54:13,594
Hey, why did you ask him that...

620
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:21,354
Kang Ha Su is human, so he must have at least one secret he cannot tell.

621
00:54:21,354 --> 00:54:23,344
Hey, you!

622
00:54:24,244 --> 00:54:26,754
Fill up the cup first.

623
00:54:32,444 --> 00:54:34,444
Love it!

624
00:54:37,824 --> 00:54:40,904
Aigoo, why do you not answer even simple questions?

625
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:45,174
You said that I can only drink if I do not answer.

626
00:54:45,174 --> 00:54:48,684
I finished off the leftover alcohol.

627
00:54:48,684 --> 00:54:51,674
I will consider that I received your thanks

628
00:54:51,674 --> 00:54:54,494
with this alcohol instead.

629
00:55:01,764 --> 00:55:05,104
Get back safely.

630
00:55:06,764 --> 00:55:08,534
My goodness.

631
00:55:08,534 --> 00:55:12,294
 Outhouse

632
00:55:21,974 --> 00:55:25,434
Wh-Who are you?

633
00:56:13,234 --> 00:56:16,734
Hostess Hong, where is your hometown?

634
00:56:16,734 --> 00:56:19,114
What is the point of knowing my hometown?

635
00:56:19,114 --> 00:56:24,004
Did you not say that knowing each other's hometowns would make us closer?

636
00:56:31,894 --> 00:56:34,494
What happened? Did you find out anything?

637
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:39,884
I found out that... he is a heavy drinker.

638
00:56:46,434 --> 00:56:48,264
How is this?

639
00:56:55,634 --> 00:56:57,334
It is hilarious.

640
00:56:57,334 --> 00:57:01,370
The king should help those who are unfairly treated. Why is she asking me?

641
00:57:09,264 --> 00:57:13,074
 I guess you do not know anything because you are dense, you bitch.

642
00:57:13,074 --> 00:57:19,554
 But there is no such law in Joseon that allows a wife to sue her husband.

643
00:57:30,594 --> 00:57:32,684
What is wrong with you, girls?

644
00:57:32,684 --> 00:57:34,924
What is with you today, Eonni?

645
00:57:34,924 --> 00:57:38,904
Will you take that nap in my arms today?

646
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:46,704
Oh, my! What are all these, Sir?

647
00:57:46,704 --> 00:57:48,404
What else?

648
00:57:48,404 --> 00:57:56,624
These are my heart, tears, and bribe for Myeong Wol.

649
00:57:56,624 --> 00:58:00,264
Just give me one. I would like the heart.

650
00:58:00,264 --> 00:58:04,344
Tears are unpleasant, and bribes are uncomfortable.

651
00:58:04,344 --> 00:58:06,564
Then will you do only one?

652
00:58:06,564 --> 00:58:12,854
Or will you also take my heart, my tears,

653
00:58:12,854 --> 00:58:15,884
and even my bribe?

654
00:58:19,304 --> 00:58:21,134
Of course.

655
00:58:22,004 --> 00:58:24,794
Okay. What do you want, Sir?

656
00:58:24,794 --> 00:58:28,704
There is a rumor that my Myeong Wol is going to be Chief Park's concubine.

657
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:29,704
Is it true?

658
00:58:29,704 --> 00:58:32,344
Gosh. Do not even mention it.

659
00:58:32,344 --> 00:58:34,994
- I am doomed. 
 - Why?

660
00:58:34,994 --> 00:58:37,944
He looks good on the outside, but he actually has nothing.

661
00:58:37,944 --> 00:58:40,204
The house, the land, and the art room.

662
00:58:40,204 --> 00:58:43,804
Everything is the property of the in-laws' family.

663
00:58:43,804 --> 00:58:47,584
His mother-in-law died early, and his father-in-law died three years ago,

664
00:58:47,584 --> 00:58:51,864
so I thought the chief advisor would take the property.

665
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:56,944
Right! You are an attorney, right?

666
00:58:56,944 --> 00:58:59,424
Then you must know it well.

667
00:59:03,504 --> 00:59:09,904
Is there a way for the husband to take his wife's property?

668
00:59:09,904 --> 00:59:11,684
Well...

669
00:59:12,774 --> 00:59:19,164
He told me not to worry and that there was a way to solve the problem.

670
00:59:19,164 --> 00:59:22,894
But I cannot believe everything he says.

671
00:59:23,964 --> 00:59:26,464
Should he get a divorce?

672
00:59:27,294 --> 00:59:31,474
 That's right! What if he files for divorce?

673
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:38,734
Have you seen Dong Chi?

674
00:59:38,734 --> 00:59:42,654
I think he went out. Is there something urgent?

675
00:59:49,014 --> 00:59:51,074
You can join us. 
  Legal Department

676
00:59:51,074 --> 00:59:53,764
Where did you get this from?

677
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:56,564
This is a dish by the lady in the Chrysanthemum Room,

678
00:59:56,564 --> 00:59:58,554
one of the supporters we had mentioned.

679
00:59:58,554 --> 01:00:00,094
Chrysanthemum Room...

680
01:00:00,094 --> 01:00:01,984
 The noble lady, who is currently staying in the

681
01:00:01,984 --> 01:00:04,444
 Chrysanthemum Room on the second floor.

682
01:00:04,444 --> 01:00:09,484
 She wants to sue her husband.

683
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:15,784
Do you mean the noble lady that So Won asked me to represent?

684
01:00:15,784 --> 01:00:18,454
That is correct. Why?

685
01:00:18,454 --> 01:00:21,814
You said you did not want to. Did you change your mind?

686
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:28,524
They say the darkest place is under the lamp. It is really dark.

687
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:31,094
That is good. Where is So Won right now?

688
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:32,264
She is gone!

689
01:00:32,264 --> 01:00:36,000
She is not in the Chrysanthemum Room. I cannot see her anywhere.

690
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,610
 Legal Department

691
01:00:44,594 --> 01:00:46,054
She did not leave for good.

692
01:00:46,054 --> 01:00:49,624
She left her coat behind. She must have just stepped out.

693
01:00:52,614 --> 01:00:54,634
We need to find her!

694
01:01:00,234 --> 01:01:02,354
You should be careful!

695
01:01:03,944 --> 01:01:06,764
You scared me more, Sir.

696
01:01:06,764 --> 01:01:10,904
- Why are you yelling like that? 
 - Because I got scared, too.

697
01:01:10,904 --> 01:01:13,074
Why would you, Sir?

698
01:01:14,464 --> 01:01:17,284
You are right. Why would I?

699
01:01:17,284 --> 01:01:20,194
But why are you in such a rush? It is not like she left for good.

700
01:01:20,194 --> 01:01:22,514
She could have left for another world.

701
01:01:22,514 --> 01:01:25,064
When a lady who lives in Bukchon Village came all the way here, she must have felt...

702
01:01:25,064 --> 01:01:27,314
she must have felt...

703
01:01:27,314 --> 01:01:29,074
This place is...

704
01:01:29,074 --> 01:01:30,644
This place is?

705
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:35,744
The Han River is close by.

706
01:01:39,594 --> 01:01:43,184
- So I was thinking, Sir. 
 - If you will ask me to represent her...

707
01:01:43,184 --> 01:01:46,104
I finished the pouch.

708
01:01:50,804 --> 01:01:52,734
This?

709
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:56,514
It was made out of the torn sleeve of the lady's clothing.

710
01:01:56,514 --> 01:01:59,304
How many tears has she...

711
01:01:59,304 --> 01:02:02,934
secretly wiped away with this scrap of clothing?

712
01:02:04,484 --> 01:02:09,984
So I want to fill this pouch with people's tears.

713
01:02:10,704 --> 01:02:17,074
I want to collect tears in here, seal them, and return smiles instead.

714
01:02:17,074 --> 01:02:24,104
Is not the law ultimately like a handkerchief for innocent people?

715
01:02:25,394 --> 01:02:28,394
Please become the lady's handkerchief, sir.

716
01:02:28,394 --> 01:02:30,514
I ask of you.

717
01:02:33,824 --> 01:02:35,404
Hurry up and find her.

718
01:02:35,404 --> 01:02:37,484
You have to bring her back safely.

719
01:02:37,484 --> 01:02:39,624
Yes, ma'am.

720
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,464
- Have you seen Chief Advisor's wife? 
 - No, I have not seen her.

721
01:02:45,464 --> 01:02:48,434
- No, I have not seen her. 
 - You have not?

722
01:02:50,194 --> 01:02:52,334
Hurry, hurry!

723
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,274
Have you seen Chief Advisor's wife?

724
01:03:09,274 --> 01:03:11,404
No, I have not.

725
01:03:11,404 --> 01:03:14,034
Have you seen a lady who looks thin and elegant?

726
01:03:14,034 --> 01:03:15,654
No.

727
01:03:16,704 --> 01:03:19,404
Hyeongnim! So Won!

728
01:03:20,184 --> 01:03:22,804
Can you tell them again what you said earlier?

729
01:03:34,034 --> 01:03:37,204
 Jeonokseo (Bureau of Prisons)

730
01:03:41,144 --> 01:03:42,804
My Lady.

731
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,004
How did you come here?

732
01:03:46,004 --> 01:03:49,844
What happened? What do they mean by Seven Vices*?
 (Seven plausible causes for a man to divorce his wife)

733
01:03:49,844 --> 01:03:52,104
How could they say that about you?

734
01:03:52,104 --> 01:03:55,494
He wouldn't have had any other excuses.

735
01:03:55,494 --> 01:03:58,424
As I told him to get out of the house,

736
01:03:58,424 --> 01:04:01,624
he probably had no choice but to retaliate like this.

737
01:04:07,864 --> 01:04:13,174
I am sorry for the late introduction. This is an attorney, Kang Han Su.

738
01:04:13,174 --> 01:04:16,584
- And this is... 
 - The wife of Chief Advisor.

739
01:04:16,584 --> 01:04:19,144
How do you know about me?

740
01:04:19,144 --> 01:04:22,554
I have already heard your story and came to rescue you, Madam.

741
01:04:22,554 --> 01:04:23,904
Yes, My Lady.

742
01:04:23,904 --> 01:04:26,644
Despite his appearance, he is quite capable.

743
01:04:26,644 --> 01:04:30,724
Recently, he won a lawsuit against Merchant Jang.

744
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:36,720
It is a truly ironic relationship.

745
01:04:37,654 --> 01:04:41,934
My husband was extremely upset about that case.

746
01:04:41,934 --> 01:04:46,384
Merchant Jang and my husband had known each other for a long time.

747
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:51,104
So how do you plan on rescuing me then?

748
01:04:51,104 --> 01:04:54,084
File for divorce.

749
01:04:55,514 --> 01:04:57,824
A divorce lawsuit?

750
01:04:57,824 --> 01:05:01,964
Yes, I will file for your divorce with Hanseong-bu.

751
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:03,974
While arguing fiercely from our respective positions,

752
01:05:03,974 --> 01:05:08,284
your husband's intention to target your property and falsely accuse you will be exposed.

753
01:05:08,284 --> 01:05:11,334
That is the only way you can leave this place safely, My Lady.

754
01:05:11,334 --> 01:05:13,074
But...

755
01:05:14,074 --> 01:05:15,514
divorce is...

756
01:05:15,514 --> 01:05:20,584
As soon as I get a divorce, everyone in the world will point fingers at me.

757
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:23,574
People will assume that the woman committed a sin and got kicked out.

758
01:05:23,574 --> 01:05:26,134
Then are you going to just die?

759
01:05:28,704 --> 01:05:33,264
If you do not get a divorce, you will die anyway.

760
01:05:33,264 --> 01:05:37,464
You will even face the disgraceful accusation of having an affair with a male servant

761
01:05:37,464 --> 01:05:40,234
and will be publicly executed.

762
01:05:40,234 --> 01:05:42,224
However, if you get divorced,

763
01:05:42,224 --> 01:05:44,954
you can protect the property you inherited from your parents.

764
01:05:44,954 --> 01:05:48,864
Would it not be the ultimate revenge to prevent him from taking

765
01:05:48,864 --> 01:05:51,694
that property he desires so much?

766
01:05:51,694 --> 01:05:56,814
Then you have to endure the shame of being a divorced woman.

767
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:00,564
You are right.

768
01:06:00,564 --> 01:06:03,554
- My Lady. 
 - But...

769
01:06:03,554 --> 01:06:06,364
would a divorce be possible?

770
01:06:08,614 --> 01:06:10,654
There is something called "Divorce of Righteousness."

771
01:06:10,654 --> 01:06:14,654
Divorce can be forced when there is a reason to separate the couple.

772
01:06:14,654 --> 01:06:17,184
For example, a son-in-law committed adultery with his mother-in-law,

773
01:06:17,184 --> 01:06:20,874
or a husband used violence against his wife or her parents like this time.

774
01:06:20,874 --> 01:06:28,124
So I will focus on proving Chief Advisor's violent tendencies.

775
01:06:28,124 --> 01:06:30,324
So...

776
01:06:34,254 --> 01:06:38,284
can you break at least one leg?

777
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:45,034
- So you mean... 
 - Yes.

778
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:50,714
It means you have to give up at least one leg to achieve your goal.

779
01:06:50,714 --> 01:06:52,524
Oh, well...

780
01:06:52,524 --> 01:06:58,024
it would be great if you were serious enough to be near death.

781
01:06:58,984 --> 01:07:01,084
Do not be ridiculous!

782
01:07:01,084 --> 01:07:02,794
Absolutely not!

783
01:07:02,794 --> 01:07:06,154
She has endured so much pain already.

784
01:07:06,154 --> 01:07:08,344
How can you ask her to suffer more?

785
01:07:08,344 --> 01:07:11,424
Why use such risky tactics to pursue a lawsuit?

786
01:07:11,424 --> 01:07:15,434
You lack consideration for the lady and only care about winning.

787
01:07:15,434 --> 01:07:18,924
Of course. It's not revenge if she loses.

788
01:07:18,924 --> 01:07:22,414
What about the wounds that the lady receives?

789
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:25,174
Who is the revenge for?

790
01:07:28,564 --> 01:07:31,264
So what is your plan?

791
01:07:32,474 --> 01:07:34,834
I will go through the proper legal way.

792
01:07:34,834 --> 01:07:37,584
I will prove that Chief Advisor falsely accused Her Ladyship,

793
01:07:37,584 --> 01:07:40,214
make him pay for his crime, and get them divorced.

794
01:07:40,214 --> 01:07:44,944
In that way, I will find an attorney who will handle the divorce lawsuit

795
01:07:44,944 --> 01:07:49,400
in accordance with proper legal procedures and ethical standards.

796
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,100
What?

797
01:07:51,904 --> 01:07:53,384
What do you mean by that?

798
01:07:53,384 --> 01:07:57,844
It means I am retracting my decision to hire you as her attorney.

799
01:07:57,844 --> 01:07:59,824
What?

800
01:07:59,824 --> 01:08:04,324
Did you not hear that? I will clarify what I said, Kang Han Su.

801
01:08:05,434 --> 01:08:07,694
I am dismissing you.

802
01:08:07,694 --> 01:08:11,654
