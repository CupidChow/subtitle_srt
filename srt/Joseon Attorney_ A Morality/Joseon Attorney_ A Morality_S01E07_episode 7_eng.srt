1
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,740
Is it Eun Su?

2
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:45,140

3
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,080
Eun Su.

4
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,980
Eun Su!

5
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,930
On the day you set out on the journey to get married,

6
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,270
I promised you

7
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,020
that I would take good care of our mother and father.

8
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,690
But what should I do?

9
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,890
Both of our parents passed away.

10
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,280
Too unfairly.

11
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,870
Don't cry, Sir.

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,210
I could not even beg for forgiveness from them!

13
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,490
Me, neither.

14
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,190
I also could not say

15
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,060
that I was sorry to my father.

16
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,730
Never mind apologizing to him; I might have contributed to my father's death.

17
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,440
But I was still able to go on.

18
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,820
So I thought this.

19
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,330
Perhaps my father...

20
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,000
might've already forgiven me.

21
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,860
I'm sure your mother did the same.

22
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:15,980
I'm sure she forgave you already and is by your side, cheering you on.

23
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,750
If it were not for that,

24
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,770
you could not have turned out to be such a great man.

25
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,490
Then who is the one who took that letter from him?

26
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,620
Please tell me! Who was it!

27
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,240
It was Princess.

28
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,430
Princess.

29
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,940
Princess.

30
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,470
It was the Princess.

31
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,070
- Sir. 
 - Princess...

32
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,970
I shall meet her someday.

33
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,710
Princess?

34
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,430
Oh, my gosh! Aigoo, Sir!

35
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,970
This way! This way, please!

36
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,210
- Yun! 
 - He must be so heavy...

37
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,140
Princess...

38
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,600
Your nose! You moron!

39
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,850
He's fine now. Please take your leave.

40
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,400
Stay still.

41
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,610
Go on.

42
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,130
Princess.

43
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,910
Thank you for helping me tonight, not to mention the trial, as well.

44
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,460
However, my request to you for pretending not to know me

45
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,580
includes bumping into me like this and helping me as well.

46
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,950
Were you afraid that I would catch you?

47
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,020
What do you mean?

48
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,150
What you are trying to do, Princess.

49
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,740
I'm talking about revenge.

50
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,630
You must know Kang Han Su is Legal Officer Kang's son.

51
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,870
His father, Legal Officer Kang, suffered an unjust death while working with the late King.

52
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,700
And you are trying to repay the debt for that, Princess.

53
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,840
Had I not seen you two at Legal Officer Kang's house earlier,

54
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,780
I would not have known.

55
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,840
How did you know that was

56
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,880
Legal Officer Kang's house?

57
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,370
A few years ago, after the late King had passed away,

58
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,370
a royal physician who deserved to be exiled was promoted and came to greet my father.

59
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,530
I looked into what had happened and came to find out everything about Legal Officer Kang.

60
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,370
Please stop.

61
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,910
Going up against my father is like going up against all of Joseon.

62
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,200
How reckless this is—

63
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,810
You must be mistaken.

64
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,360
I only valued Attorney Kang Han Su's skills highly,

65
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,000
and I wanted to help the people alongside him.

66
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,560
All right then.

67
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,460
Princess!

68
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,370
 If there is a conflict between strengthening the throne and caring for the people,

69
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,460
 which aspect should take priority?

70
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,450
 If people's lives are stable, the throne is automatically strengthened.

71
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,960
 Even if you do not put extra effort into it, the people will consider the king as a parent

72
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,940
 and will trust, follow, and depend on you.

73
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,560
 It seems I asked you a foolish question.

74
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,640
 But there are so many laws that serve the purpose of benefitting the officials.

75
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,890
 How about you look for a solution to this?

76
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,720
 I will carry out your order, Your Majesty.

77
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,700
 Both of our parents passed away.

78
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,380
 Too unfairly.

79
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,680
 Too tragically.

80
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,170
It was all my fault. All my fault.

81
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,560
 Give it to me. I will deliver it today.

82
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,150
 Legal Officer Kang Eon Jik

83
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,960
 How could you say that?

84
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,360
 Father! Father! Father!

85
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,790
 Your Majesty, please come back!

86
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,640
 Your Majesty!

87
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,100
 Your Majesty!

88
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,800
 Han Su!

89
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,250
 Han Su! Han Su!

90
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,280
 Han Su!

91
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,600
 - Hyeongnim... 
 - Han Su...

92
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,190
- Hyeongnim, Hyeongnim... 
 - Han Su...

93
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm here, Han Su.

94
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,550
- Hyeongnim! 
 - Han Su.

95
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,320
- Hyeongnim! 
 - Han Su.

96
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,100
It's okay, it's okay.

97
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:53,520
 Episode 7: Secret Door

98
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,470
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

99
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,350
Aigoo, my head.

100
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,750
I managed to return to the inn— No, there is no way!

101
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,640
 Eun Su, why did you come here, you dummy!

102
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,540
 Yes, Orabeoni.

103
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,720
 Eun Su!

104
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,550
 Run! Run!

105
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,140
Oh, hey! Hey, Dong Chi! Dong Chi!

106
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,570
The fragments that are rapidly passing through my head. What is all that?

107
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,420
A dream, right?

108
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,190
There are too many. I don't know where to start.

109
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,100
I hugged you in front of my house,

110
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,780
and you know... you know... start with that.

111
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,500
How come whenever you drink,

112
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,890
you just can't tell them apart? I mean

113
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,160
you can't tell people apart

114
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,570
and just hug anyone and say, "Eun Su!"

115
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,770
"Dong Chi! Mother! Father!"

116
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,880
It was not you?

117
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,360
- Then? 
 - Who else could it be?

118
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,860
Who could it be?

119
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,880
 Eun Su.

120
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,950
 I'm sorry, Eun Su!

121
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,220
- What are you doing? 
 - Get dressed. We must go to Hanyang.

122
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,920
What? The sun is not up yet.

123
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,070
But the rooster crowed.

124
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,520
Right. You will meet them again when you get to Hanyang.

125
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,840
It will be less embarrassing at that time than now.

126
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,660
Time is medicine. Do you not know?

127
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,810
The mayor will be in Hanyang, though.

128
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,890
What about the Mayor?

129
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,060
Don't you remember?

130
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,210
Run!

131
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,210
 Let's go! Go to the Princess!

132
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,770
I guess you remember.

133
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,130
This is a disaster.

134
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,760
There is no way I, Kang Han Su, would have done that.

135
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,450
There is no way. Never.

136
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,560
 It's okay.

137
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,000
What?

138
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,460
What.

139
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,940
 They would not know.

140
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,570
What?

141
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,160
 Father...

142
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,830
 Mother...

143
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,660
 Eun Su...

144
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,680
 Dong Chi...

145
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,280
Whatever.

146
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,960
 Sir.

147
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,170
 It's me.

148
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,570
 Do not cry.

149
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,460
 I'm sure your mother did the same.

150
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,810
 I'm sure she forgave you already

151
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,740
 and is by your side, cheering you on.

152
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,000
 If it were not for that,

153
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,810
 you could not have turned out to be such a great man.

154
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,710
That's right.

155
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,530
I can do this.

156
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,820
I can do this. I can do this.

157
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,920
I can do this.

158
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,410
Good, good.

159
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,870
Good, good.

160
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,950
It looks like someone I know.

161
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,300
So shiny.

162
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,800
So cold.

163
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,850
So Won.

164
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,680
Hey, let us go.

165
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,880
Why are you departing so early in the morning?

166
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,320
Oh, we have to rush to Hanyang and meet someone.

167
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,640
Are you rushing to meet someone?

168
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,750
Who else could it be?

169
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,950
Our money line.

170
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,720
- Let us go! 
 - Let us.

171
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,620
 If you found out the truth,

172
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,060
 would you be able to forgive me?

173
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,730
Hey.

174
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,990
Let's say I am embarrassed.

175
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,400
Why is she avoiding me?

176
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,090
Because you are funny-looking?

177
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,320
Let's see here. Maybe...

178
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,910
Did she get in trouble with the mayor?

179
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,420
Well, thank you for everything last night.

180
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,030
I do not remember too much, but I feel as though I owe you quite a bit.

181
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,280
Thank you.

182
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,550
No. Well, not really.

183
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:50,500
Well, by chance, did you get in trouble with the mayor?

184
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,160
No, not really.

185
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,090
That is good.

186
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,470
So why were you two together at that hour?

187
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,430
Pardon?

188
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:06,060
By chance, you did not...

189
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,720
fall for that guy, did you?

190
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,350
They say women change their minds a lot.

191
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,900
That is nonsense. It was just a coincidence.

192
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,810
Right, that is what it should be! He has nothing to show for it.

193
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,200
His family may be pretty respectable.

194
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,150
I'm sure he is very wealthy!

195
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:34,600
Even his character is not so bad, I guess. That's right!

196
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,320
His face.

197
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,140
I'm still handsome as far as my face goes. No?

198
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,500
I guarantee it. I am sure he already had marriage talks with a woman of noble birth.

199
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,030
The rules for nobles and commoners are clear. Do not even look at a tree you cannot climb!

200
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,520
She did look up to me as an attorney at one point.

201
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,250
- Pardon? 
 - No, nothing.

202
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,410
Nothing.

203
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,420
Today must be a special day.

204
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,500
It looks to be.

205
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,580
It is my birthday.

206
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,060
Oh, right. Today is Baekjoong Day.

207
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,610
It is a birthday for all workers. 
  Baekjoong: day of rest for farmers after weeding.

208
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:51,140
The day the male servants dress in new clothes and eat and play all day?

209
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,720
No, it is my real birthday.

210
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,550
Okay. Well, would you like a birthday gift then?

211
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,860
Let's go look, too!

212
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,360
- Well...
 - No.

213
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,530
Just one day. I am just not ready yet.

214
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,350
- Wh— 
 - Ready for what?

215
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,850
Oh, I mean, well...

216
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,540
When we get to Hanyang, we have to work hard again.

217
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,430
- Oh, right.
 - So, please, instead of a birthday gift,

218
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,830
it will not even cost you money.

219
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,420
One day would not make a difference. The princess is not going anywhere.

220
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,350
At the moment, time is like gold to me.

221
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:04,120
But I will spend that gold on you.

222
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm so happy!

223
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,770
Hyeongnim, did you eat something funny?

224
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,430
Well, so what?

225
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,950
It's Baekjoong Day, and it is So Won's wish.

226
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,130
Let us just play today.

227
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,850
I would love that.

228
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,110
You cannot change your mind later. Okay?

229
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,570
I will not.

230
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,800
 Peaceful Time with Great Harvest

231
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,440
 It will not take long.

232
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,770
 Give me one more day to think.

233
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,790
 I will stay as So Won just one more day.

234
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,060
 I am sorry.

235
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,490
 I am sorry, Kang Han Su.

236
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,940
Why are you doing this!

237
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,070
What are you doing?

238
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:26,380
 Yuhyeon Village, Anseong City, Hand-to-hand Combat Competition

239
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,400
Whoa, great prizes today.

240
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,410
 First place, A cow

241
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,120
 Second place, One bag of rice

242
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,600
Does anyone else want to challenge?

243
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,840
Over here!

244
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,380
Aigoo! No, no!

245
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,040
Hyeongnim, you are no match!

246
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,320
- Gosh.
 - How good are you?

247
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,950
- I'm quite good. 
 - Are you going to do it?

248
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,100
Just wait and see.

249
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,090
Ready, go!

250
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,920
Aigoo, he got lucky.

251
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,190
Kang Han Su was good!

252
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,820
He will not beat him unless he cowardly sprays sand on him.

253
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,070
I'll put one nyang on his loss.

254
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,410
I will take one nyang and add five poon on top!

255
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,760
I will add five poon more and make it two nyang.

256
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,570
Ready, go!

257
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,880
Go, Kang Han Su! Go, go!

258
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,330
- Kang Han Su! 
 - Go, go!

259
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,660
Kang Han Su!

260
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,960
Han Su!

261
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,550
Aja! Aja!

262
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,060
Did you see that?

263
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,620
Did you see that?

264
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,960
A round of applause to today's winner!

265
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,170
 First place, A cow. Second place, a bag of rice. Third place, flower shoes

266
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,230
A cow!

267
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,680
A cow!

268
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,130
A cow!

269
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,840
What is with the flower shoes? Why shoes?

270
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,510
Wait, Sir. Did you lose your mind?

271
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,270
How could you? We can farm for a year with a cow.

272
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,890
With a bag of rice, the family of four will have plenty of food.

273
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,470
Thus, people who need those things more should have them.

274
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,180
Pardon?

275
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,850
Here. They are your birthday gift.

276
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,240
These shoes will take you wherever you want to go

277
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,660
and will lead you to climb over any walls.

278
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:45,930
They will lead you to better and more valuable places.

279
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,390
I mean, why did you fight to win if you were going to pick those?

280
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,590
We could have taken the cow.

281
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,890
Because defeat does not suit me.

282
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,470
"Because defeat does not suit me."

283
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:17,580
♫  Turning back time  ♫

284
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:22,900
♫  As I see you gettng further away  ♫

285
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:28,050
♫  I'll run and call your painful name  ♫

286
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:35,260
♫  Wiping away the tears that flow white  ♫

287
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,660
♫  Turning and turning around &nbsp;♫

288
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:43,900
♫  If another season comes again &nbsp;♫

289
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:49,100
♫  I missed you so much I&nbsp;want to embrace you &nbsp;♫

290
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:59,600
♫  And convey my heart with endlessly flowing tears &nbsp;♫

291
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,380
Are you sure that's all you know?

292
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,240
Yes.

293
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,510
It will be good for you to answer me when I ask you.

294
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,390
You never know what you will face when our grand merchant arrives.

295
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,810
Did you find out anything?

296
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,470
These wenches are so stubborn.

297
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,730
What is it you want to know?

298
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,560
We have to know what we should tell you!

299
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,600
Where is the ledger?

300
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:01,600
Here are the ledgers that Kang Han Su hid in the courtesan house.

301
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,710
A total of six volumes. That's correct.

302
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,820
How about what I asked you to find out?

303
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,800
They did not know much about Kang Han Su, either.

304
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,270
I guess he did not talk much about himself, and he just joked around.

305
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,810
After Kang Han Su's parents died, he traveled with this guy Dong Chi and went around markets all over the nation.

306
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,370
That's about it.

307
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:29,090
Oh, they said his hometown is Cheongsan.

308
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,540
Cheongsan?

309
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:34,760
Yes. Is that not why he went to Cheongsan this time?

310
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,690
Did you say Cheongsan?

311
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,220
Yes.

312
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,260
You used to be the village head in Cheongsan, right?

313
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,130
 Seven years ago, Cheongsan

314
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,350
 Your Excellency!

315
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:54,670
 What brings you to this remote place?

316
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,090
 There is one thing you need to do for me.

317
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:04,290
 If you do, in the next month's official personnel change edict,

318
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:08,900
 you will be promoted instead of dismissed.

319
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:20,280
 Aigoo! What in the world is this?

320
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:45,650
 I heard that's when you got pretty close to Chief Advisor Park and Merchang Jang.

321
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,410
 Pretty close? No. Our numbers just happened to add up.

322
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:54,180
 To escape the countryside like that, we needed all the help we could get.

323
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,020
No way...

324
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,110
Legal Officer Kang?

325
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,630
That's him!

326
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:31,860
I have never seen even the tavern owner go out to play on Baekjoong Day.

327
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,320
How could she just give us the rooms and ask us to cook our own dinner?

328
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,920
The tavern keeper needs to rest, too.

329
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,030
She also could take part in the ritual.

330
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,630
I will take care of this.

331
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,700
Hostess Hong, you must be tired.

332
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,120
Come on now.

333
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,570
Milgaetteok  (a type of rice cake)  is left up to you, Hyeongnim.

334
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,760
I guess we will have to starve.

335
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,250
- I'll do it.
 - Oh, no, no. I'll do it.

336
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,630
- I'll do it. 
 - No, no.

337
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,950
Gosh, how could this...

338
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,070
We are doomed.

339
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,790
Milgaetteok became a mess*.
  ("Mess" has the word "tteok" in it.)

340
00:35:55,330 --> 00:36:00,100
Hostess Hong, please teach So Won again.

341
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,250
So ticklish!

342
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,090
Why are you laughing?

343
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,290
I think I am funny.

344
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,960
I never put things off and just play.

345
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,540
Me, neither.

346
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,280
But I have changed ever since I met you.

347
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,660
Actually, I almost drowned when I was little.

348
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,880
Since then, I have been so scared of water, so I never went near it.

349
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,970
But last night, I even swam a creek.

350
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:51,580
 Probably from the moment you jumped into Han River to save me, I think I got better.

351
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,630
Just look at the recent new bride case.

352
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,070
I would have never taken such a case normally.

353
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:02,720
And today as well.

354
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,830
But that felt better than I anticipated.

355
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,100
It felt very good.

356
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,190
It made me want to live my entire life just like today.

357
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:19,500
Did you ever... not want to live?

358
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,120
At least, living was not my objective in life.

359
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,690
Lighten up.

360
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:35,400
I did not say that to get you all serious.

361
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,670
I wanted to respond sincerely to the comfort you provided me.

362
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,380
Comfort?

363
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,330
You comforted me last night

364
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,920
in place of my younger sister, Eun Su.

365
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,690
I will bring some water.

366
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,410
I will...

367
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,680
I will do it.

368
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:13,040
I will make my objective in life... to make you live a happy life, sir.

369
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,950
So that you can be happy, sir.

370
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,200
So that you can live a life where just living could be your objective.

371
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,440
I will put my effort and help you. Whatever that may be.

372
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,380
I will do it.

373
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,090
Down the road, by any chance...

374
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,440
if I disappoint you someday,

375
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,290
please remember what I said to you today.

376
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,960
Whatever I did in the past,

377
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,840
everything I do and choose will be for you

378
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,040
starting today, sir.

379
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,610
Why is she acting like that?

380
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,650
She's giving me the butterflies.

381
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,110
Is that true?

382
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,620
Yes.

383
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:23,730
In the beginning, he called me "hyeongnim" as a joke.

384
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,390
And one day...

385
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,070
One day?

386
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,630
Why are you so serious?

387
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:35,910
Han Su went to run an errand to an upper village in my place and caught an infectious fever.

388
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,110
He was near death for exactly ten days.

389
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,900
Even the physician had given up on him.

390
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,530
 Don't die! I'm sorry!

391
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:47,410
 I'll never make you run an errand for me!

392
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,220
 Don't die, Han Su!

393
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,450
 How can you come here?

394
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,110
 Orabeoni...

395
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:06,040
 Han Su. I'll be your younger brother.

396
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,720
 I'll treat you as my hyeongnim all my life!

397
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,060
 Please don't die, Han Su.

398
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,440
 - Do you mean it?
 - Yeah...

399
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,660
 I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

400
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,700
 Then call me "Hyeongnim."

401
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,720
 Hyeongnim.

402
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:33,710
 W-Were you alive?

403
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,690
" You"? I'm your hyeongnim!

404
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,840
 Orabeoni, blood.

405
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,480
 - You're bleeding. 
 - Blood?

406
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,880
No wonder.

407
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,790
I thought you either ate the wrong medicine as a child

408
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,900
or fell from a tall place.

409
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,690
What do you mean, you thought?

410
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,710
Wh-What... D-Do you think I look older than him?

411
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,090
What's with your facial expression?

412
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,630
Do not fret.

413
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,320
As for looks, you're better...

414
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,000
As expected!

415
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,950
Huh?

416
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,220
Yun, you tell us.

417
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,050
Yes!

418
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:42,620
Then are you saying that Kang Han Su will go after you, Your Excellency?

419
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,420
I believe so.

420
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,430
I'm sure he found nothing in Cheongsan, either.

421
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,500
Then you must prepare yourself.

422
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,960
If you suffer like Chief Advisor Park, too—

423
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,750
Do you think I'm just like those idiots?

424
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,620
M-My apologies.

425
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,070
We just must not give him any reasons.

426
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:08,580
No, before he does anything first, I can eliminate him first!

427
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,590
Your Excellency!

428
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,280
What is it?

429
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,950
They sent someone from your house in a rush.

430
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,610
Something urgent happened to Young Master.

431
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:22,120
I told him to sit tight and just study. So, why!

432
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,930
Let go of this! You are all dead!

433
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,610
How dare you! Do you know who I am?

434
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:30,790
Let go! You just wait.

435
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,610
I will get you for this.

436
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,350
- Hey!
 - Those scum!

437
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,260
The one who died after a few punches is the one at fault!

438
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,890
How dare they arrest my son!

439
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,830
This way, Sir.

440
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,940
Father.

441
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,180
You useless scum.

442
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,710
If you caused trouble, you should've resolved it.

443
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:06,010
Or if you cannot, do not get yourself in trouble!

444
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:09,200
What the hell do you know how to do right anyway?

445
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,290
If you could not do anything well, I begged you not to do anything at all!

446
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,490
In the end, you bring shame upon me?

447
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,190
Of all days, now?

448
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,430
Please calm down, Your Excellency!

449
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,540
 Hey.

450
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,090
 Hey!

451
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,580
 How dare you!

452
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,220
 How dare you not answer me when a noble addresses you?

453
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,480
 Are you crazy? You should answer!

454
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,300
 How dare you look down on me!

455
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,550
 In Mourning

456
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,950
 Lee Family Merchant Association

457
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,590
Hello.

458
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,900
It must have been tough to travel all this way.

459
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,530
Is everything okay at the inn?

460
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,580
Of course.

461
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,400
 Legal Officer Kang Eon Jik

462
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,550
Oh, my goodness! Who did this to you!

463
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:26,390
Aigoo, what happened?

464
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:33,750
Please get us some warm water. 
  Legal Officer Kang Eon Jik

465
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,170
All right.

466
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,630
I am sorry, Sir.

467
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:42,220
His Excellency Chu found out everything.

468
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,510
We had no choice.

469
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:48,780
If we had not, we would be dead.

470
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,150
I will get you a physician. Get some rest.

471
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:58,150
Hyeongnim! Seeing how that bastard brought them to our office,

472
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:01,730
he is definitely sending a warning to us.

473
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:03,440
Let us go out for now.

474
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,490
Geez, it is not something you should contemplate.

475
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,270
We should move to a safe spot first.

476
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:11,150
They took our ledgers.

477
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:16,120
To be blunt, we are out on the battlefield without any arrows or shields.

478
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,620
So we should look for another weapon. Let us meet the princess first.

479
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:23,280
Geez, we would not have any solution even if we did!

480
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,700
Really.

481
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,790
Did I get caught already?

482
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:39,160
Princess went down to some southern province to recuperate.

483
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,030
Which southern province?

484
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:44,260
- Please tell me where I can send a letter— 
 - I do not know.

485
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,360
Wait, wait, wait! I must meet the princess!

486
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,260
- Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim! 
  - What? What?

487
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,490
I got an amazing piece of information.

488
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:03,000
What is it? What, what?

489
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,360
- Come.
 - What?

490
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:16,960
It is quite something.

491
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,640
This is driving me nuts.

492
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,550
How could this be? What connection?

493
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,950
Are you all right?

494
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,030
So do not worry.

495
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:51,960
Even if I do not drive him out of my heart,

496
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,170
how could I dare...?

497
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,120
 It is me. I will enter.

498
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,230
Princess, it is as you expected.

499
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:15,530
Should I confess to him first, or will I get caught first?

500
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,670
Do not worry about anything.

501
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:19,980
This is not your fault, Your Highness.

502
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:25,970
If Attorney Kang blames you for what happened, I will not stand back then.

503
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:31,250
It would be better if he blamed mr rather than Kang Han Su getting hurt.

504
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:39,520
It seems Minister Chu tried to dig into Attorney Kang and tormented his friends.

505
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,540
Secure the areas around Wishes Inn and the ferry dock.

506
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,470
Yes, Ma'am.

507
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:50,300
I will carefully watch Dong Chi's movements.

508
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,970
Do we still have business left to resolve?

509
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:10,850
I heard that thanks to your amazing petition-writing skills, the Cheongsan case was being resolved. Or

510
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:15,840
are you here to apologize for the drunken fit you threw as if you were ready to die?

511
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:26,390
I heard you are Princess Yeon Ju's betrothed.

512
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,370
Is that true?

513
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,470
If I say yes?

514
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:36,460
I wondered if you knew a way to contact the princess,

515
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,880
so I came to see you despite being out of line.

516
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,210
I must meet the princess about something.

517
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,690
What you are saying is...

518
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,630
Yes. By chance,

519
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:49,620
do you know where she is?

520
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,630
So you do not know?

521
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,910
where Princess Yeon Ju is, or who she is?

522
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:56,200
No.

523
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:01,160
How could an attorney like me know where the princess may be or who she is?

524
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,030
 What you are trying to do, Princess.

525
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,980
 I'm talking about the revenge.

526
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,320
 What revenge?

527
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,690
 Is that not why you are with Kang Han Su?

528
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,900
You will have to take a case for me.

529
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,220
Yes. Yes?

530
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:27,500
To see if it is okay to tell you where the princess is, I must ask the princess first.

531
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,990
So it will take some time.

532
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:31,660
So...

533
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,170
Yes, well...

534
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:39,420
d-did you take on a case that is giving you a headache?

535
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,310
An inspector in Gyeonggi who took on a case

536
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,460
- asked for joint interrogation with Hanseongbu. 
 - Yes.

537
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,450
I am sure the Ministry of Justice will investigate more carefully in the second trial, but

538
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:51,060
I should do my best as an interrogator as well.

539
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:55,220
Please look over the Gyeonggi inspector's investigation and interrogation and see

540
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,020
- if his verdict was correct. 
 - Yes, however,

541
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,690
the reason you are trying to give me that case is

542
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,990
you are trying to distract me with it...

543
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:07,340
I am in a bind because the culprit who was arrested is keeping his mouth shut.

544
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:11,510
Would he not open up to an attorney like yourself?

545
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:15,420
Well, to an attorney like me, I suppose.

546
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,730
Yes. Well, I will have to pay that much of a cost to see the princess.

547
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:26,130
- Just leave.
 - Yes.

548
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,300
What is this?

549
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,540
How dare you glare at me!

550
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,230
Young Master, please go.

551
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,370
- It's him. 
 - Thank you.

552
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,300
Lee Bong Sam.

553
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:09,260
You are here for beating and killing your neighbor Kang Chil Gu.

554
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,230
Is that correct?

555
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,350
I am Attorney Kang Han Su.

556
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:20,590
If you are facing something unfair, I will assist you as best as I can.

557
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,160
Oh, yes.

558
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,860
I am that famous best attorney in Joseon.

559
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:34,880
By chance, are you refusing my help?

560
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,620
Look, I am Kang Han Su. Kang Han Su.

561
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:41,430
That case with plum wine and even that noble lady's case.

562
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,240
I even solved murder cases—

563
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,640
I cannot believe I am reciting all this with my own mouth.

564
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:54,540
Lee Bong Sam, if you confess in front of the interrogator, you will be executed on the spot.

565
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,660
I am sure you should keep your mouth shut, but

566
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:00,240
you do not need to do that with this attorney.

567
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,660
Should I put this away?

568
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,900
Aigoo! Scared me!

569
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,070
H-How long have you been standing here?

570
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:26,080
Who cares where I am in my own house?

571
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,560
You have a client.

572
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,420
By chance...

573
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,510
Is she jealous?

574
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,360
Oh, there he is.

575
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,610
He is Attorney Kang.

576
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:56,860
Why is everyone gathered?

577
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,830
Please save my father!

578
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:04,430
My father... is not a murderer!

579
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:11,750
Someone else hit him!

580
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:20,100
But that young master insists that he died because your father pushed him.

581
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,710
Yes.

582
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:24,360
My mom told me not to say this.

583
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,770
That we would all die.

584
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:30,690
That a servant cannot report his master!

585
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:34,130
I think he's talking about the Prohibition of Accusations Against Elders.

586
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,080
A slave cannot report his master.

587
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:41,500
No matter what injustice people face, you cannot report your boss!

588
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,180
Damn...

589
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:45,850
But if he is about to die now in his master's place,

590
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:48,700
who cares about such a law? He needs to live first!

591
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,990
Calm down.

592
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:54,190
Let us listen to this child more carefully.

593
00:55:54,190 --> 00:56:02,040
So the real culprit who killed your next-door neighbor is your father's master?

594
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,260
Yes.

595
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,190
And your father is a slave, correct?

596
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:09,550
Yes. From the time I was very young

597
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:13,110
due to grain shortage and infectious diseases on top of it,

598
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:20,480
Father agreed to be the master's slave for ten years and borrowed rice from him.

599
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,480
- And he has seven years to go. 
 - Aigoo.

600
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,240
The child's father must have sold his labor.

601
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,450
Many people come to our inn

602
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:32,820
showing us their slave agreements and making their appeal.

603
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:37,820
If they cannot borrow money from us, they have no choice but to become slaves.

604
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,010
Since they were not born slaves, to begin with,

605
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:44,530
the Prohibition of Accusations Against Elders, or whatever, does not apply to them, right?

606
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:47,040
It is obvious.

607
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,610
Since we appear ignorant of laws,

608
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:56,260
the master brainwashed his family by talking about national law and whatnot.

609
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,650
I mean, who in the world is that brazen and evil man?

610
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,970
I am talking about your master!

611
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:10,110
It is Minister Chu.

612
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:16,510
Did you... just say, Minister Chu?

613
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:19,900
Associate Right Minister of Chief Administrative Agency Chu Yeong Wu.

614
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:26,330
Yes! Minister Chu's son Young Master Chu beat Ahjussi Chil Gu!

615
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,110
Is that so?

616
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:50,090
- Just talk here! 
 - Quiet, quiet!

617
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,780
Of all people. What is this?

618
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,930
H-How are things going with this?

619
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,190
What do you mean how?

620
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:01,210
We just got a secret weapon.

621
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:04,590
Thanks to that, we do not have to run anymore.

622
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:08,610
B-By chance, will you take this case?

623
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,470
Minister Chu used his brain and

624
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:13,430
used the Prohibition of Accusations Against Elders, or whatever, to threaten

625
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:16,890
and falsely accuse Lee Bong Sam.

626
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:21,900
This time around,

627
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:27,100
I shall properly teach him whose side the law is on.

628
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:35,900
Yong will report Young Master Chu for framing his father for the murder.

629
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,380
Then Lee Bong Sam's interrogation will be delayed.

630
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:43,720
In the meantime, we just have to prove that Young Master Chu is the culprit.

631
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,780
And what if we do?

632
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:49,020
They switched the criminal overnight.

633
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,010
I am sure he got rid of all evidence relating to it.

634
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:55,290
And I am sure he bought off all the witnesses.

635
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,540
Probably so, right?

636
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,620
Of course! On top of that,

637
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,810
there is a rumor circulating saying that

638
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:06,620
he will become in-laws with Minister of Justice Won Dae Han.

639
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:10,310
Whether it is personal connections or in other ways, we are at a huge disadvantage!

640
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,870
- Really? 
 - Yes!

641
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:17,480
Why is he smiling?

642
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,160
It is exciting! I feel competitive!

643
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,000
Hey, I am getting goosebumps!

644
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,400
Press hard with your fingertips.

645
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,710
Straighten your back.

646
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:38,250
Write out one letter at a time with all your care.

647
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,420
 ...my father was depressed...

648
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:50,190
 I am extremely afraid to speak to you about this, Sir ,

649
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:52,870
 but great indignation has reached the heavens.

650
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:55,550
 I write this to you despite my fear.

651
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,480
 My father is innocent.

652
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:26,920
 You will not ever get away with this!

653
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,130
 I will go to the Cheongsan governor, and I will also go to the King in Hanyang!

654
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:35,510
 I will report to them everything you did!

655
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,010
 Do you think the law is that lax?

656
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:41,460
 Why not try it?

657
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:47,000
 You will learn what happens when a commoner reports a head of a village.

658
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,660
 Geez, how foolish you are.

659
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:52,640
 No wonder you do not know who the law stands with.

660
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,930
 It is me.

661
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,490
- Please do not go! 
 - Wh-Why...

662
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:55,890
There is no proof or witness.

663
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:59,150
Must you go up against Minister Chu?

664
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:01,230
It is also a case that Mayor asked me to work on.

665
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:04,010
Since it is a difficult case, rather than asking someone else,

666
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:05,640
he asked Kang Han Su.

667
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,210
I cannot disappoint him.

668
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:11,520
That is just an excuse! You are trying to take revenge against Minister Chu!

669
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,490
How... did you know?

670
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:19,390
How could I not know?

671
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:23,870
From the beginning to now, I only saw you, thought of you, and studied you.

672
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:27,330
Everything about you was suspicious.

673
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,060
Yes, you are right.

674
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:37,260
The revenge was the start.

675
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,240
However, that is not all at the moment.

676
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:46,490
I want to start living like a human, and I want to become a true attorney.

677
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,980
So how could I run away?

678
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,720
Someone is suffering injustice, and I have the solution.

679
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,820
And now is the only chance I have to save that person.

680
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:57,980
That chance is only good as long as you are alive, Sir!

681
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:00,700
Why would I die

682
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:03,020
when you are here?

683
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:06,990
You said you would live for me.

684
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:10,790
You said you would do anything for my happiness.

685
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:14,980
I do not do something so stupid as to leave someone who loves

686
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:17,790
and cherishes me behind.

687
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:20,730
I learned from my parents

688
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,170
that you can never do that.

689
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:26,260
Otherwise, you would regret it even in death.

690
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,330
I did not care when and how I died.

691
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:36,040
I did not dream of such a thing as happiness.

692
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:40,620
But for the first time, I want to live,

693
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:45,640
and on top of that, I decided to live properly.

694
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:50,700
Having such a heart in itself is miraculous to me.

695
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:53,210
So...

696
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:57,090
do not worry.

697
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:02,120
One who has encountered a miracle does not die easily.

698
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:11,390
Hey, So Won.

699
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:13,350
Just for a moment.

700
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,190
I will stay like this just for a moment.

701
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,630
Sir!

702
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,620
Go ahead. Hurry!

703
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,060
You wretched fool!

704
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,880
Do you really want to die?

705
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,770
But you could not kill me.

706
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:38,460
Can you not tell?

707
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:43,740
I am here to respond to your warning.

708
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,110
Kang Han Su!

709
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:49,030
Yes. I am Kang Han Su.

710
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:51,510
One who has never lost a case.

711
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:54,280
The best attorney in Joseon, Kang Han Su.

712
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,700
And...

713
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,550
the son of Legal Officer Kang, whom you killed seven years ago.

714
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:00,740
Kang Han Su.

715
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:16,880
So look forward to it.

716
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:23,220
This is the declaration I am making to you all.

717
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:26,220
I am saying I am declaring war.

718
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:55,750

719
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:03,120
 We worked with animal experts for scenes involving animals for their safety.

720
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,880
♫  Run away  ♫

721
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,450
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

722
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:12,020
 How dare he!

723
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:14,680
 Minister Chu will not sit back.

724
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,020
 Do you have a plan?

725
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,310
 Are you not curious, Princess?

726
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:24,320
 Whether it is a coincidence or everything is part of his revenge.

727
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,790
 I am considering living an ordinary life like others.

728
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:33,060
 This is a proposal to you.

729
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:39,060
 I have... a confession as well.

730
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:44,330
♫  Trapped in the darkness  ♫
