1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,971
(All people, incidents, and periods in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,780
Did you hear that?

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,919
What? Did you have a nightmare?

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,221
No! Do you not hear that?

5
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:23,491
It is crazy out there.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,261
Gosh, seriously.

7
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:30,871
Over there.

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,780
I was wondering who was chattering away.

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,040
- My lord. - Yes?

10
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:44,521
Lord Chu has passed away.

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,551
He was murdered.

12
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:55,861
All rise for His Majesty!

13
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,281
How did this happen?

14
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,480
Improper solicitation?

15
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,090
(Accepting requests for a special favour for a position)

16
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:27,290
Improper solicitation is against the national law.

17
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:29,960
As soon as a position was open,

18
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,260
people swarmed to Executive Minister's house?

19
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,471
- What? - Arrest them!

20
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,771
Stop!

21
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,910
They have arrested 20 suspects only in a day.

22
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:45,310
I did nothing wrong!

23
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:47,210
The way we appoint them has become corrupt,

24
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:49,110
and we have both Right Assistant State Councillor...

25
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:50,479
and Left Assistant State Councillor...

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,281
both being dismissed due to irregularities.

27
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:55,090
So, I...

28
00:01:56,391 --> 00:01:58,960
officially request that the executive minister be dismissed.

29
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,399
Your Majesty, we also advise...

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
You should do that, Your Majesty.

31
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:19,680
Grand Queen Dowager...

32
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,210
had already declared...

33
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:26,421
to stop her regency due to old age.

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,390
I also believe that it is fair...

35
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:32,361
that I resign.

36
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,190
Your Majesty.

37
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:40,261
Please accept my resignation.

38
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:51,741
No, Your Majesty!

39
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,210
Please revoke your royal command!

40
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,250
- Please revoke your decision. - Please revoke your decision.

41
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,421
As...

42
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,291
Left State Councillor...

43
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,960
and a supporter of Executive Minister,

44
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,629
I feel responsible...

45
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,201
for Left Assistant State Councillor’s demotion...

46
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,400
and Right Assistant State Councillor’s dismissal.

47
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:19,541
However, I believe that dismissing him...

48
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:23,910
and disbanding his committee must not be discussed rashly.

49
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,580
The Anti-improper Solicitation Act was introduced...

50
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,150
to prevent the officials' private exchange.

51
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:32,451
That is why it was difficult to know about other officials' irregularity.

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,689
Also, the incident of the son of Right Assistant State Councillor...

53
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,960
has progressed behind the minister's back.

54
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,620
It is true, Your Majesty.

55
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,960
In such a bad situation,

56
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,030
Executive Minister was not able to take action.

57
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:48,830
That would prove that there was no close connection...

58
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:50,500
between the two.

59
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:54,771
I believe that it is an excessive punishment...

60
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,141
to dismiss him and disband his committee.

61
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:58,879
There is no justification...

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,741
for his dismissal!

63
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:03,750
We beg for your forgiveness!

64
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:07,651
- We beg for your forgiveness! - We beg for your forgiveness!

65
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,861
But they were practically twins.

66
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,961
Now they claim that there was no connection?

67
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,250
His Majesty...

68
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,950
was impatient this time.

69
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:41,820
He only ended up declaring war against them.

70
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,861
How about you support His Majesty?

71
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:49,230
My father...

72
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:51,760
respects you as well.

73
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,700
That is...

74
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,671
because I have not yet disobeyed the executive minister.

75
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,860
I stepped away from regency...

76
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:25,861
pretending to be ill, and it was all for nothing.

77
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,971
The King must have been disappointed.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,800
No one can overcome...

79
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:34,241
a crisis at one go.

80
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:38,911
That would not be a crisis. It would be a minor glitch.

81
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,760
He certainly is clever.

82
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,461
It had been weighing on me,

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,531
and he fixed it in months.

84
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:04,630
Do you mean the attorney that the princess has brought?

85
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:06,440
His name is Kang Han Soo.

86
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,140
Remember his name.

87
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:10,671
He is one of mine now.

88
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

89
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,450
By the way...

90
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,481
Are you worried that I am upset due to what happened today?

91
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,921
I did not expect to remove the minister in a day.

92
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,689
I was simply...

93
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,190
initiating the plan.

94
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,031
No one has ever...

95
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,031
imagined dismissing him before,

96
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,370
and it was officially mentioned.

97
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,711
Now,

98
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,781
everyone is aware that his power does not last forever.

99
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,351
So,

100
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:59,260
what I need is a justifiable reason to kick him out.

101
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,930
If he comes to make me the reason,

102
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:05,930
that would be even better.

103
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:34,991
My lady.

104
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:37,791
The officials from Saheonbu are here.

105
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,680
Goodness.

106
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,010
Are you all right?

107
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,450
I apologize, my lord.

108
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,060
I meant to quietly leave the table and go.

109
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,830
That is all right.

110
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,031
Here.

111
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,770
I had heard about the beauty of the owner of this place,

112
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:18,031
- and it was true. - Stop.

113
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:19,770
She is injured right now.

114
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,140
Have a seat.

115
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,081
Will you meet him?

116
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:36,351
Or will you do your job as we first promised?

117
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:38,961
My answer...

118
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:41,290
will always be the same.

119
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,091
How dare you?

120
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:45,000
You will not ruin my family.

121
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,930
Mother.

122
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:49,899
You have been hiding the fact that your family went down...

123
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,300
after your parents had committed a sin.

124
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,101
How spiteful of you.

125
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,741
Get out of here!

126
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,111
Close the gate!

127
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,220
What are you doing?

128
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:48,361
Let go of me!

129
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,389
Put a gag on her.

130
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,691
She might try to kill herself.

131
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,941
I do not need it.

132
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,140
I will not die.

133
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,311
Your eyes are full of spite for a young girl.

134
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:45,481
It is sorrow, not spite.

135
00:10:46,851 --> 00:10:48,650
One can always neutralize spite,

136
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,890
but this deep sorrow engraved in my heart...

137
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:54,260
cannot be soothed.

138
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:56,760
What is your story?

139
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:07,741
I know I am being shameless, but please take me to Hanyang.

140
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,741
I will meet the most powerful man there...

141
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:15,111
and appeal my resentment.

142
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:17,150
This is the executive minister.

143
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,650
He has the highest rank in Joseon.

144
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:34,000
Lord.

145
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,941
Please help me...

146
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,540
take revenge for my parents.

147
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:45,741
Please help me.

148
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,851
Please...

149
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:09,030
Are you sure you can do anything to take revenge?

150
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,981
You should bear something shameful as a woman.

151
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,221
Only my body will get dirty,

152
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:34,061
not my soul.

153
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:41,461
Now, my heart...

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,800
is as hard as a stone.

155
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:51,471
I will engrave your kindness...

156
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,681
deeply into this stone.

It seems he was attacked last night.

00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:30,910
Ministry of Law Enforcement is investigating the case.

- Han Soo. - Go ahead.

164
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,400
Where were you last night?

165
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:57,071
Are you suspecting me now?

166
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,980
You are the one...

167

who has had the most conflicts with Lord Chu recently.

168
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,481
If this is about Young Master Chu, I should be lying there.

169
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,119
You should suspect someone...

170
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,620
who is closer to you and has a higher rank than me.

171

Who are you talking about?

172

I am not exactly referring to someone.

I just think someone who is capable of killing Lord Chu...

174
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,230
is someone with power,

175
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,129
and that kind of person...

176
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,540
must be closer to you than me.

177
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:37,250
The body had a stab wound.

178
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:38,951
- A stab wound? - Yes.

179
00:14:39,181 --> 00:14:41,920
But the weapon is gone.

180
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,821
I think the suspect took it away.

181
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,691
Why would the suspect bother to do that?

182
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,130
It is not like his name is on the weapon.

183
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,630
I know.

184
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:53,660
Why is that?

185
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,169
I was hasty.

186
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,640
What? Who?

187
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:04,170
I was.

188
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,780
What do you mean?

189
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,681
Let me know if you need anything.

190
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:25,300
What are you going to do with a dagger?

191
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:31,331
Are you going to investigate Lord Chu's case yourself?

192
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,201
No.

193
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,071
I want to be prepared.

194
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,811
Pay for it.

195
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,321
- It is you again. - Yes.

196
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,851
Are you here to find out the kind of dagger that killed Lord Chu?

197
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,950
There is something that I have wanted to ask you.

198
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,160
Please go ahead.

199
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,390
It seems that the boat is almost repaired.

200
00:15:55,691 --> 00:15:58,160
How long are you going to stay in Sowongak?

201
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,711
Accidents and cases happen all the time around you.

202
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,311
So I am worried that people in Sowongak might suffer damage...

203
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,380
when they did nothing wrong.

204
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,250
Are you talking about So Won?

205
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,050
How are you related...

206
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,721
to So Won?

207
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,331
Did So Won not tell you?

208
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,730
I guess you are not that close to her.

209
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:35,831
She must have judged that it is not serious enough to tell me.

210
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,211
Why is he meddling?

211
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:51,550
Darn it.

212
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,520
It is not my fault!

213
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,270
(Sowongak)

214
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:34,090
Accidents and cases happen all the time around you.

215
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:35,731
So I am worried.

216
00:17:38,461 --> 00:17:39,560
So Won.

217
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:52,641
(Emergency Loans)

218
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,391
- Mother? - So Won!

219
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:22,971
My lord?

220
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,510
What a relief.

221
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:34,280
I thought...

222
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,171
Well,

223
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,370
so, what is going on?

224
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:53,800
Where is everyone? Why is no one here?

225
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,809
The army is patrolling around,

226
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,641
and things are unsettled in the city.

227
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,711
So we decided to take a day off. I guess everyone went home.

228
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:03,711
Home?

229
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,481
They all have their own places to live in and families.

230
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,320
- What about you? - I...

231
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:12,020
- I... - Yes.

232
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,421
have you.

233
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:24,201
Where is Dong Chi?

234
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:27,270
Well...

235
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,540
He went to examine the boat.

236
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,181
We need to get ready to go back.

237
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,211
Why... Is it uncomfortable to stay in the merchant house?

238
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,881
If I stay here, I will just keep having dreams...

239
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:44,391
when it is not over yet.

240
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,260
What do you mean...

241
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:52,600
Do you mean revenge?

242
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Take this.

243
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,671
This is for what I have owed you so far.

244
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,451
This is a dagger.

245
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:16,320
Quit your job as my assistant.

246
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:18,820
You are fired.

247
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,990
If you are doing this because you are worried about me...

248
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:22,530
It is because you get in the way.

249
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:27,530
Then why are you giving me this dagger?

250
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,530
You should protect yourself.

251
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:34,201
I cannot protect you.

252
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Gosh.

253
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,181
Goodness.

254
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,190
What is it? Were you blocking me from getting in?

255
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:25,760
Yes. I thought it was So Won.

256
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:28,020
What if it is So Won?

257
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:29,931
Have you not seen her?

258
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,991
No, I have not.

259
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,931
This is strange.

260
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,830
She is not someone who can take it gently when I fire her.

261
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:41,641
Did you really fire her?

262
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:46,280
- Yes. - Goodness.

263
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:03,590
Is that why she did not beg you to take her back?

264
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,600
Are you leaving?

265
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:11,500
Are you not going to talk to So Won?

266
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:14,500
It is fine. She will come to me if she feels it is wrong.

267
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:16,340
We have a lot of work to do, so never mind. Let us go now.

268
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,580
Kang Soo. Are you truly going to move out?

269
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:22,380
Of the paradise where we are given food...

270
00:22:22,381 --> 00:22:23,810
and a place to sleep?

271
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,151
Yes.

272
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,921
Then...

273
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,421
could I possibly just stay behind?

274
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:32,520
Why not? Yes, please do.

275
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,960
Go ahead and stay behind.

276
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:35,320
If you want to become a dead body.

277
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,181
Did you finally realize?

278
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:55,981
Are you finally aware of whom you are fighting against?

279
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:59,249
Why are you being so sensitive?

280
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,721
What about you? Why are you so indifferent about it?

281
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:06,860
The one who had to die simply died.

282
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,161
That means you will see the end of it.

283
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:16,701
Then you must make a decision.

284
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:24,810
This is what I promised Kang Han Soo.

285
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:26,609
After this case,

286
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,381
I am to write a letter to you and arrange a meeting for you two.

287
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:31,151
Write a reply.

288
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,681
Your wound has healed a lot.

289
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,981
It is all thanks to you, Lady Hong.

290
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,181
You cannot forever live as a courtesan.

291
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,621
Unless you plan to become an old man's concubine,

292
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:46,721
should you not find a way...

293
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,820
to make a living yourself?

294
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,829
I heard Myung Wol's cosmetic store...

295
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,461
was doing really well.

296
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:54,360
If you wish,

297
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,530
I can have you work at this merchant house.

298
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,799
You could cook...

299
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,441
or even study about running a business.

300
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,569
In the palace, I...

301
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,741
"The palace?"

302
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:07,780
Near...

303
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:09,850
the palace,

304
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:14,280
I ran a small bar for middle-class women and widows.

305
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,121
We could not even get close to such a place.

306
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,731
Are Lord Han Soo and Lord Dong Chi not leaving by boat?

307
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:27,431
I am not sure if we can continue to stay here.

308
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,330
Are you returning by boat?

309
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,270
It is like...

310
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:38,871
putting a distance.

311
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:45,151
What is it?

312
00:25:45,451 --> 00:25:46,681
Does that upset you?

313
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,349
Then...

314
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,820
why not stop me?

315
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:52,391
There is a possibility...

316
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,661
I might not go.

317
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,560
This is for the better.

318
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,530
I should have cut off these feelings sooner.

319
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,971
Wait. Why would you cut them off?

320
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:07,270
It is a relationship the world does not approve of.

321
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,710
And there is the gap.

322
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:10,970
Age is not important.

323
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,539
It is not as if the heart ages.

324
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,211
I will approve of it.

325
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,451
What are you talking about?

326
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,049
Is it not obvious?

327
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,181
To you, Lady Hong, I...

328
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,991
Anyway...

329
00:26:26,691 --> 00:26:28,319
My body may follow Han Soo,

330
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,231
but I will leave my heart here.

331
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:33,131
Keep that in mind.

332
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,131
What is he going on about?

333
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,641
Why would he leave his...

334
00:26:48,711 --> 00:26:49,850
Get back to work.

335
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:52,550
- Yes, my lady. - Understood.

336
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,799
Your Majesty.

337
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,970
Kim Young Jae, the fourth inspector of Saheonbu,

338
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:13,500
greets Your Majesty.

339
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:18,110
What brings you here from Saheonbu?

340
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,241
I have something to report, Your Majesty.

341
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:27,121
- Hey. It is that side, right? - Yes.

342
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:30,391
- It is not leaking. - Great.

343
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:32,221
Take a seat.

344
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,019
Starting now, we will find...

345
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,830
the opponent who can fight against the executive minister.

346
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:39,499
Good grief.

347
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,631
Who on earth could go against him?

348
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,871
There is one.

349
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:45,171
But only one.

350
00:27:45,971 --> 00:27:47,270
Come on.

351
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,840
Are you crazy?

352
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:51,410
How can we meet the King?

353
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:53,941
We will not make it, even to the palace gate.

354
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,609
There is only one way a mere subject like us...

355
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,850
can meet the King.

356
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,921
Do not tell me...

357
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:04,790
Complaining to the King?

358
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:10,491
Your Majesty!

359
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:13,401
I feel wronged, Your Majesty!

360
00:28:13,461 --> 00:28:15,200
Please relieve me...

361
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:16,570
of my resentments!

362
00:28:29,211 --> 00:28:31,050
Did you imagine something weird again?

363
00:28:33,651 --> 00:28:34,951
Either way, listen carefully.

364
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:36,819
Out of my clients,

365
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,620
there will be at least one who will bring...

366
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:41,960
a crucial case that not even I can solve...

367
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:43,231
with my power.

368
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:45,391
And then?

369
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:47,231
Once I get such a case,

370
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,231
I will complain to the King at once.

371
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,570
After I land myself a private meeting with the King...

372
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,600
After that?

373
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,871
After that...

374
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,211
After that?

375
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,080
I will skip further explanation.

376
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:03,211
All right.

377
00:29:03,212 --> 00:29:04,550
- Let us begin. - What?

378
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,951
Begin what?

379
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,721
It is one nyang.

380
00:29:08,951 --> 00:29:10,121
Here is five nyang.

381
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,860
"Five nyang?" You can enter right away.

382
00:29:13,221 --> 00:29:15,961
Everyone, receiving legal advice is one nyang.

383
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,390
But if it is an urgent case,

384
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:21,231
pay five nyang, and you can enter right away.

385
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,029
Nothing in this world is for free.

386
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,670
- Just one piece of advice. - No.

387
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:26,171
Bring the money, okay?

388
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,241
- Now, then. Please wait in line. - Here is one nyang.

389
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:29,840
All right.

390
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:31,371
- Let me in. - Bring the money.

391
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,710
Next client.

392
00:29:32,711 --> 00:29:34,609
- Welcome! - When did you get here?

393
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,211
Why is Lady So Won not going in?

394
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,951
One nyang. Please get in line.

395
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,421
What is it?

396
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,381
I was fired.

397
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:49,320
Read the mood, will you?

398
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,600
Gosh, why am I so slow-witted?

399
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,800
- Lady Hong, thank you for the meal. - Sure.

400
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,951
(We welcome advance payments.)

401
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:21,121
In other words,

402
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:23,759
you gave your deed to the land and all your wealth...

403
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,391
to this shaman?

404
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,360
Our baby deity...

405
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,069
blessed you with a son,

406
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,070
so did you not thank me?

407
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:34,999
They do say danger past, and the deity is forgotten.

408
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,310
Who knew this would happen back then?

409
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,641
After dedicating even the land deed to the baby deity,

410
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,340
our family went bankrupt.

411
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,580
Not only that, my wife and daughters died one after another.

412
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:46,981
Who would have imagined this?

413
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,090
The shaman is right.

414
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,049
You gave it to her, and that is the end.

415
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,120
You cannot take it back.

416
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:55,161
- Are you trying to annoy her? - That is right.

417
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,360
However...

418
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,799
This man gave you the land deed...

419
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,830
to be blessed with luck.

420
00:31:02,971 --> 00:31:04,170
But his wife and daughters passed away,

421
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:05,500
and even he is sick.

422
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,670
And his only son is in this state,

423
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:09,339
begging for food.

424
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,840
So it is proof the baby deity has no power.

425
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,180
If not, show us the baby deity's spiritual power...

426
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:17,610
by blessing this man's family with luck right here, right now.

427
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,280
Or else...

428
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,881
return the land to him.

429
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,250
Next!

430
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:28,220
Did you not leave to live with another woman?

431
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:30,391
How could you, a wife, ask for a divorce?

432
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:31,860
Then...

433
00:31:32,631 --> 00:31:34,359
how about you live with me...

434
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,231
for a month, my lady?

435
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,800
Next!

436
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,711
During the last barley hump, he had borrowed rice.

437
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:45,570
So he was sold to me as a slave.

438
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,310
I will pay you back, all right?

439
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,579
You will get severely punished...

440
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,221
if you get caught for putting a farmer's name on the slave list.

441
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,090
Next.

442
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,621
Next.

443
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,191
Next.

444
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,090
Next.

445
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,461
Take a seat.

446
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,731
It is me.

447
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,000
I am exhausted.

448
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,410
Were you not looking for a case to complain to the King?

449
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:17,840
So what are you doing right now?

450
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:20,510
I am about to lose it too.

451
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:24,049
The moment I hear their story, a star lights up in my head,

452
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,250
and a solution is before my eyes.

453
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,881
I am too good.

454
00:32:28,151 --> 00:32:29,181
What now?

455
00:32:30,691 --> 00:32:32,549
What now, my foot.

456
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,721
Look further.

457
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:36,530
Meeting the King is not easy at all.

458
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,391
You are right. It is only natural.

459
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,500
We can take this chance to earn money.

460
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,201
What?

461
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,370
What?

462
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:47,401
No?

463
00:32:47,971 --> 00:32:49,070
Well...

464
00:32:49,471 --> 00:32:50,810
My lord!

465
00:32:51,941 --> 00:32:53,040
My lord.

466
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:55,641
- It is ten nyang. - What is?

467
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:57,280
The price of the clients' gukbap.

468
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,180
How come?

469
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:01,121
Were we not treating them to food?

470
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:06,290
It is for free.

471
00:33:07,391 --> 00:33:08,621
Please dig in.

472
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,191
I even returned all the consultation fees.

473
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,260
- You what? - Oh, gosh.

474
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,530
Dong Chi! You little...

475
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,701
Do only what I ask you to do!

476
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,310
Did you not tell me we had to get...

477
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:27,580
as many clients as possible?

478
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,711
Still!

479
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,661
Goodness.

480
00:33:43,961 --> 00:33:44,961
Gosh.

481
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
What?

482
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,710
Are you Attorney Kang Han Soo?

483
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:06,820
Yes. I am.

484
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:09,420
It is good to see you, Kang Han Soo.

485
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:12,491
I heard you wanted to meet me.

486
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:15,121
Meet you?

487
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,140
Your Majesty, I did not recognize you. Please...

488
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:37,951
No. Please forgive me.

489
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,480
Do not worry about it.

490
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:44,991
It is my fault that I came unannounced.

491
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:50,791
Why do we not become friends who can forget about...

492
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:52,491
the decorum and formality?

493
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,141
Be my friend, Kang Han Soo.

494
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:15,121
You are older than me, but my status is higher.

495
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,251
That makes us even, does it not?

496
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,279
"We welcome advance payments."

497
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,280
(We welcome advance payments.)

498
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:51,920
Here.

499
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,891
My friend, have a seat.

500
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,090
Okay.

501
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,630
You are indeed intelligent. You saw it right away.

502
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,930
See what?

503
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:09,201
That I am a man of talent who will come in very handy.

504
00:36:11,241 --> 00:36:12,271
Come in handy?

505
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,310
Right. You already scratched...

506
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:16,951
many of my itchy spots.

507
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:21,820
Will you be able to do it again?

508
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,590
Is there something troubling you?

509
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:34,260
It is all going according to plan.

510
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,971
We must hire a good attorney...

511
00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:39,230
and get to the bottom of the case.

512
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,771
Your elder brother will probably be hired for the job.

513
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,911
Kang Han Soo is...

514
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,280
the most popular attorney in Hanyang at the moment.

515
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,110
I am sure my brother will manage to pull it off.

516
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:56,380
But that makes me feel even worse.

517
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,351
Not knowing what the royal family...

518
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,891
has done to our family,

519
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:03,831
my brother will side with them...

520
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,431
and diligently carry out the duties they commission to him.

521
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,201
Bear it for just a little longer.

522
00:37:11,201 --> 00:37:13,030
One day, you will be able to...

523
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,971
tell your brother all the truths.

524
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:19,541
Okay.

525
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,550
Actually,

526
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,150
an official from Saheonbu came to me.

527
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,520
He asked me to defer the appointment...

528
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:35,420
of the new commissioner, Kwon Myung Woo.

529
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,931
He said something terrible has happened to his family.

530
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:42,230
Something terrible?

531
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,530
His elder brother got murdered.

532
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:51,371
Kwon Myung Woo, the younger brother, is one of the prime suspects.

533
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:55,410
If that is true, the fact you personally appointed...

534
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:58,550
a man of such conduct must harm your dignity.

535
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,780
It is not simply a matter of my dignity.

536
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:05,991
Kwon Myung Woo is a talented man from Sarim.

537
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,960
I am finally trying to establish the balance...

538
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:10,831
between Hungu and Sarim in the Royal Court.

539
00:38:11,661 --> 00:38:13,190
And this happened.

540
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,859
Is it possible...

541
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,400
that someone committed this crime with an intent to get in the way?

542
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:23,811
The late Mr. Kwon was a scholar who taught kids at a school...

543
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:26,780
with no intention to rise in rank.

544
00:38:27,811 --> 00:38:30,811
He did not communicate with any outsiders or go anywhere.

545
00:38:31,581 --> 00:38:32,910
His family is the only people he came in contact with...

546
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,251
on the day of his death.

547
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,451
So it is a bit of a stretch to associate his death...

548
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:37,149
with a political agenda or to suspect...

549
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,650
that there was someone behind it.

550
00:38:40,161 --> 00:38:42,721
So they are all just coincidences?

551
00:38:48,831 --> 00:38:51,670
Right. I get it.

552
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,040
Anyhow, Kwon Myung Woo must never be...

553
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:57,510
the culprit of this murder.

554
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:00,880
That must be the truth and reality.

555
00:39:01,681 --> 00:39:03,610
I sincerely hope for it, and I will wait for it.

556
00:39:04,851 --> 00:39:06,479
It sounds like you want me...

557
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,351
to be a secret investigator rather than an attorney.

558
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,621
I mean, you should get things done freely on your own terms.

559
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:14,021
As usual.

560
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:17,460
Right. As usual.

561
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:23,701
This is the pass to enter the palace.

562
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,670
(A pass issued by the Ministry of War)

563
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:28,670
I will make sure...

564
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:33,141
to come to you with the answer you want, Your Majesty.

565
00:39:38,451 --> 00:39:42,121
I felt more relieved when I met Kang Han Soo in person.

566
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,760
I do not want you to rely on him, Your Majesty.

567
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,291
I want you to protect him.

568
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,701
Protect him?

569
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,230
Yes.

570
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:59,230
He is your subject who is having a difficult fight on your behalf.

571
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,871
Right.

572
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:09,380
I am indebted to him.

573
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,180
So you must use this chance to destroy the influence...

574
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:15,251
of the executive minister.

575
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,021
Only then can you become the king who protects His subjects.

576
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,931
Of course you are right.

577
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:45,480
Goodness. I nearly fainted.

578
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:49,480
That pale youngster...

579
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:50,750
is our King himself?

580
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:53,290
We will have to wait and see...

581
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:54,661
if he is our King or their King.

582
00:40:55,491 --> 00:40:56,561
You are so cynical.

583
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,760
How did he find out, though?

584
00:41:01,161 --> 00:41:03,331
That you wanted to see him?

585
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,800
So Won would not have told the King.

586
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:13,371
Is Magistrate Yoo close to the King?

587
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,081
Is that why he heard it from So Won and...

588
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,780
So Won and Magistrate Yoo...

589
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:22,980
are that close?

590
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,791
It hurts!

591
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:42,339
(On the day of the next full moon...)

592
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,641
On the day of the next full moon, I will see you at Wongak Temple.

593
00:41:47,411 --> 00:41:50,780
You said you would not have the courage to see him...

594
00:41:51,311 --> 00:41:53,280
if you told him everything.

595
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,390
I used to act childish like that...

596
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:58,791
when I should not have.

597
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,491
You know,

598
00:42:01,621 --> 00:42:04,630
I am going to become a person who protects people,

599
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:06,590
not a person who gets protected.

600
00:42:10,601 --> 00:42:11,871
Are you done writing?

601
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,771
Yes.

602
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,541
(On the day of the next full moon, I will see you at Wongak Temple.)

603
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,870
(I dearly want to meet you,)

604
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:20,710
(Princess Yeon Joo.)

605
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,950
We got a letter from him.

606
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:27,021
The elder?

607
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:31,620
(It is a shame that I cannot contain the sound of waves.)

608
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:33,720
(I dearly want to meet you,)

609
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:35,690
(On the day of the next full moon, I will see you at Wongak Temple.)

610
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:40,501
What is it?

611
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,529
(It is a shame that I cannot contain the sound of waves.)

612
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,070
The handwriting is different.

613
00:42:51,811 --> 00:42:54,910
(By the time this letter arrives,)

614
00:42:54,911 --> 00:42:57,681
(I would have arrived in Hanyang too.)

615
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:00,951
Magistrate Yoo...

616
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,351
was the elder.

617
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,291
(So Won)

618
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,331
Do what I tell you.

619
00:43:51,871 --> 00:43:53,570
Yes, my lord.

620
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:20,460
This must be the house.

621
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
Right.

622
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:28,271
Are you Attorney Kang Han Soo?

623
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,641
You must be the commissioner.

624
00:44:31,311 --> 00:44:32,371
I am.

625
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:34,840
But I am not yet officially appointed yet,

626
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,811
so please refrain from calling me that.

627
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,521
- Then... - Just call me lord.

628
00:44:41,951 --> 00:44:43,081
Follow me.

629
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:46,050
Yes, my lord.

630
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,729
He is a man of principle and tenacity.

631
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,230
He must be extremely stubborn.

632
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,101
So, he is a prime suspect, right?

633
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:01,270
He should never be the culprit...

634
00:45:01,271 --> 00:45:02,541
for our sake.

635
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,640
So, you should go...

636
00:45:04,641 --> 00:45:06,509
and find other suspects.

637
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,181
All right.

638
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:09,541
- Here we go. - All right.

639
00:45:24,891 --> 00:45:26,230
Come on.

640
00:45:50,491 --> 00:45:51,819
Gosh.

641
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,359
You only look tough on the outside.

642
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,221
Pat my back.

643
00:45:58,161 --> 00:46:01,130
Master, this is out of the ordinary.

644
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,670
You cannot bring a stranger into the house in this situation.

645
00:46:05,201 --> 00:46:06,931
I must do something.

646
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,971
Look what happened to my brother.

647
00:46:09,971 --> 00:46:12,210
I cannot even hold a proper funeral for him.

648
00:46:13,911 --> 00:46:16,041
But what can a mere attorney do?

649
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,779
You will...

650
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,480
see about that.

651
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,550
If you wish to solve this case quietly and quickly,

652
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,161
I need your cooperation.

653
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:29,460
Sure.

654
00:46:29,891 --> 00:46:31,930
Eunuch Ko, who serves His Majesty by his side,

655
00:46:31,931 --> 00:46:33,900
recommended him.

656
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:36,331
You must treat him with respect.

657
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:42,141
Thank you in advance.

658
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,141
(Suspect One: Lord Kwon's wife)

659
00:46:52,311 --> 00:46:53,480
My lady.

660
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,521
How do you stay so calm?

661
00:46:58,291 --> 00:46:59,291
What?

662
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:01,290
His wife must be...

663
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:04,859
the saddest among all others, yet you are peaceful.

664
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,359
I wonder what the secret is.

665
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,530
Shut your mouth!

666
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,260
How dare an attorney run his mouth?

667
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:13,271
Then, do you remember...

668
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,771
when your husband finished drinking the night that he died?

669
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,811
Ask his favourite servant.

670
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,780
She was with him the day he died.

671
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,780
My lady!

672
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,911
(Suspect Two: Chung Soon, Lord Kwon's favourite servant)

673
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:28,120
That would mean...

674
00:47:28,121 --> 00:47:31,751
That he adored you.

675
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,760
I merely served at the table that night.

676
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:47,871
You have seen it as well, my lady.

677
00:48:02,121 --> 00:48:03,320
She is right.

678
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,021
I saw my lady outside for a minute that night.

679
00:48:09,991 --> 00:48:12,491
I was going to the restroom.

680
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,200
Who knows she went back in...

681
00:48:15,201 --> 00:48:16,530
after I was done?

682
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,169
No.

683
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:21,400
Chung Soon went straight to her room to go to bed.

684
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,311
I promised to let you marry her,

685
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,641
and you are already taking her side?

686
00:48:29,311 --> 00:48:30,581
You are to be wed?

687
00:48:31,081 --> 00:48:33,751
Is that why you were outside so late at night?

688
00:48:33,851 --> 00:48:35,050
No.

689
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,680
I am a servant,

690
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:38,320
so it is my job to look after my master...

691
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,420
until he falls asleep.

692
00:48:41,491 --> 00:48:42,819
And...

693
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,729
you had to watch your fiancée...

694
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:48,130
pour drinks for the master until late at night.

695
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,900
It must have been upsetting.

696
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:52,101
What?

697
00:48:54,771 --> 00:48:56,241
(Suspect Three: Jang Dol, servant)

698
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:02,780
Go back to bed already.

699
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,650
The sunset was hours ago!

700
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:06,549
How ridiculous.

701
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,021
Does the sunset make me a nobleman?

702
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:14,561
Well, you can tell the master to leave me alone!

703
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,121
Gosh.

704
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,501
Goodness.

705
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,931
I had never imagined doing such a thing.

706
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,411
Then, who is preparing for the funeral?

707
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,250
My lady,

708
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:40,580
this is Cho.

709
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:41,780
Come in.

710
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,161
The funeral preparation...

711
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:53,291
as well as all the chores of this house...

712
00:49:53,661 --> 00:49:55,061
are done by the housekeeper.

713
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,899
(A person who takes care of chores at a nobleman's house)

714
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,300
A housekeeper?

715
00:49:59,271 --> 00:50:00,900
A housekeeper. I see.

716
00:50:02,271 --> 00:50:05,070
My lady, I have secured 20 rolls of hemp cloth.

717
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,811
I have just hired the ladies to cook the food.

718
00:50:08,181 --> 00:50:09,311
Well done.

719
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:10,681
Yes, my lady.

720
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,780
Wait. Not so fast.

721
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:18,150
I am investigating a murder. Have a seat.

722
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,920
Oh, well.

723
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:23,221
I have nothing to do with the murder.

724
00:50:24,061 --> 00:50:25,230
How so?

725
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:27,899
On the day of the murder, I was uptown...

726
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,161
running the master's errands.

727
00:50:29,331 --> 00:50:30,460
That is true.

728
00:50:30,601 --> 00:50:33,471
He sent a set of ink stones to his friend...

729
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:35,271
who lived uptown.

730
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,811
(Suspect Four: Cho, housekeeper)

731
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,521
I see.

732
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:53,550
He had drinks that night to celebrate...

733
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,920
acquiring valuable ink stones.

734
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,800
I will pour you one.

735
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:10,170
So, the one who drank with him that night was...

736
00:51:15,311 --> 00:51:18,451
(Suspect Five: Kwon Myung Woo, Lord Kwon's younger brother)

737
00:51:25,891 --> 00:51:27,420
I say it was the housekeeper.

738
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,390
Earlier,

739
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:32,061
he was going somewhere as soon as we ended the session.

740
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:34,601
He is definitely hiding something.

741
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,860
What an ignorant guess.

742
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,230
What? Why?

743
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,041
He was not there on the day of the murder, stupid.

744
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,581
That cannot be right.

745
00:51:51,181 --> 00:51:55,020
I had this perfect hunch.

746
00:51:55,021 --> 00:51:56,280
What hunch?

747
00:51:56,351 --> 00:51:57,750
- I mean, - Yes?

748
00:51:57,751 --> 00:51:59,549
every time I went near him,

749
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,120
- he reeked of cigarettes. - And?

750
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:04,760
- But he said that he did not smoke. - So?

751
00:52:05,061 --> 00:52:09,129
And there is only one place where you can get your clothes...

752
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,460
stank up by cigarettes.

753
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,271
A gambling place.

754
00:52:14,701 --> 00:52:16,400
(Tavern)

755
00:52:17,911 --> 00:52:19,771
Imagine a gambler...

756
00:52:20,141 --> 00:52:24,311
running the house of Lord Kwon, who was known to be wealthy.

757
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,581
Go ahead.

758
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:34,721
I will stop here.

759
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:41,701
You said so yourself.

760
00:52:42,101 --> 00:52:44,771
The most definite murder motive...

761
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,030
is money.

762
00:53:09,121 --> 00:53:10,960
It had to be for money.

763
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,190
But he was not on the scene that day.

764
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:24,740
You are doing it again.

765
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:27,440
That will ruin your brush and your teeth.

766
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,420
Should I have brought her?

767
00:53:44,561 --> 00:53:45,630
I also...

768
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:49,161
have a confession to make.

769
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:04,110
(Sowongak)

770
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,650
Oh, gosh.

771
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:16,690
Princess, you must close the window before you go to bed.

772
00:54:21,331 --> 00:54:22,400
Princess Yeon Joo?

773
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:25,871
Princess...

774
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:30,900
Princess!

775
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:32,710
Princess!

776
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:35,210
Oh, no.

777
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,641
Princess!

778
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,291
Have you been waiting long?

779
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,860
No.

780
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:23,890
Is that...

781
00:55:23,891 --> 00:55:25,491
I have finally realized it.

782
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,030
I was incredibly confused.

783
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,101
"What was he thinking?"

784
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,471
"For so long,"

785
00:55:35,501 --> 00:55:38,070
"was he trying to expiate his father's sins?"

786
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,081
- Princess. - Then, I came to a conclusion.

787
00:55:42,241 --> 00:55:44,141
Whatever your true intention is,

788
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,181
I do not want to agonize over it.

789
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,721
That was my conclusion.

790
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,320
Whether it is you or Magistrate Yoo,

791
00:55:53,621 --> 00:55:57,190
I no longer can afford to get distracted.

792
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,590
You do not have to do it any longer.

793
00:56:02,201 --> 00:56:03,460
Do not try too hard.

794
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:00,690
My lord.

795
00:57:07,931 --> 00:57:08,960
Who are you?

796
00:57:15,871 --> 00:57:17,871
I am the owner of this bar.

797
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:20,010
Also,

798
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,041
I am your woman.

799
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:30,650
Do you remember me?

800
00:57:44,331 --> 00:57:45,371
Are you all right?

801
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:49,570
Yes, my lord.

802
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:53,811
My lord, I will...

803
00:57:54,811 --> 00:57:55,840
It is okay.

804
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:52,630
My lord.

805
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,940
Here.

806
00:58:58,670 --> 00:58:59,710
Thank you.

807
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:21,530
My lord!

808
00:59:38,351 --> 00:59:39,411
Let us go.

809
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:02,800
We met again, and you had to see something you should not have.

810
01:00:03,501 --> 01:00:05,110
If we met another time,

811
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:08,010
I would have been happier to see you.

812
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:18,150
I like this better.

813
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,920
I get to do something for you.

814
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:28,061
I get to comfort your wounded heart.

815
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:04,161
And I get to pour you a drink.

816
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:10,670
I have been waiting for the day I get to see you again.

817
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,980
You are just like me.

818
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:27,920
I must be...

819
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:30,960
just like you.

820
01:01:45,241 --> 01:01:46,271
Yes.

821
01:01:47,811 --> 01:01:49,980
Mr. Kim!

822
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,150
Did you have good sales today?

823
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,210
I barely managed to sell some makgeolli.

824
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:57,350
Two glasses of makgeolli and one plate of cabbage pancake.

825
01:01:57,351 --> 01:01:58,950
One plate, you say?

826
01:01:58,951 --> 01:02:01,460
I am sure you sold at least ten plates of it.

827
01:02:02,661 --> 01:02:03,760
You are so sharp.

828
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:06,590
By the way, where is So Won?

829
01:02:07,161 --> 01:02:09,130
I am on my way to meet her.

830
01:02:10,331 --> 01:02:11,771
- Bye. - See you.

831
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,420
Did you say you do not want to get distracted anymore?

832
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:35,360
And you do not have any intention of loving me.

833
01:02:36,891 --> 01:02:38,161
Then do not.

834
01:02:39,391 --> 01:02:41,800
And forget the fact that I am the elder.

835
01:02:42,561 --> 01:02:44,100
- My lord. - Just keep treating me...

836
01:02:44,101 --> 01:02:45,630
as the son of the executive minister.

837
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,371
You can use my power and ability as the magistrate of Hanseongbu...

838
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,710
to shake up my father.

839
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:57,081
Use me as your shield to save your life and earn time.

840
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:58,851
Let me do something for you.

841
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,681
Let me stay by your side for a good reason.

842
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:07,090
Please...

843
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:10,161
use me.

844
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:14,831
Why would you...

845
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:18,530
go to such an extent for me?

846
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,501
You smiled at me.

847
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:34,451
Your smile made me feel like I had the whole world.

848
01:03:36,081 --> 01:03:38,491
If I can see that smile just one more time,

849
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:42,561
I will be happy to be a nameless wild flower.

850
01:03:45,061 --> 01:03:46,891
If you will pick it,

851
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,360
I will be over the moon.

852
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:05,411
You are hurt.

853
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:14,891
Finally,

854
01:04:17,561 --> 01:04:18,960
you are looking at me.

855
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:25,860
I also...

856
01:05:27,661 --> 01:05:29,201
have a confession to make.

857
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:18,110
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

858
01:06:24,721 --> 01:06:26,420
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

859
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:28,820
Magistrate Yoo and you.

860
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,061
There is nothing I should be worried about, right?

861
01:06:34,331 --> 01:06:36,130
Have you still not heard anything from Attorney Kang?

862
01:06:38,101 --> 01:06:39,800
Everything that happens in Joseon...

863
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,141
is in my hands.

864
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:47,010
I want to...

865
01:06:48,411 --> 01:06:49,911
live as So Won forever.

866
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:54,510
Pay her respect.

867
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:59,190
She is Princess Yeon Joo, the daughter of the late King.
