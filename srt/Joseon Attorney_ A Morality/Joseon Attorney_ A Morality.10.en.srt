(All people, incidents, and periods in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,019
What are you doing over there?

3
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:47,788
Attorney Kang.

4
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,858
- My lord. - It is you.

5
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,599
You two are now going around together.

6
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:04,339
I was asking him for a favor...

7
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:08,138
because I heard he was going out to investigate Lord Kwon's case.

8
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:10,107
I wanted to go with him.

9
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:12,547
You can come to me and ask yourself.

10
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:14,179
Would she have come to me if she could do that?

11
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:18,488
Well, it is...

12
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:20,488
That is why I am telling her...

13
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,157
there is no need to do this.

14
00:01:22,158 --> 00:01:24,418
And I am saying that I do not mind.

15
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:31,728
You should just work for me.

16
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:32,869
Pardon?

17
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:34,768
Would it not be better to be an assistant...

18
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:37,968
to the magistrate of Hanseongbu than a mere attorney?

19
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:40,209
Only if you wish to die soon.

20
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:41,878
- Sorry? - Sorry?

21
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:44,138
A woman of So Won's social status...

22
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:47,449
working officially for the magistrate of Hanseongbu?

23
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,077
Once the Royal Court finds out,

24
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:51,818
my lord, you will not suffer as you have many connections.

25
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,248
But what about So Won?

26
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:55,059
Yes, she will die.

27
00:01:57,018 --> 00:02:00,128
Hence, if she must take this rough and tough journey,

28
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:03,728
it will be much easier...

29
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:06,198
for her to take the journey with me.

30
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,169
Is that not the case?

31
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,049
I cannot bring any harm to you,

32
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:22,919
Magistrate Yoo.

33
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,747
No.

34
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:26,448
You cannot bring any harm to him.

35
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,588
In that case, I will take...

36
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:30,059
this nuisance with me.

37
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,258
Have you been waiting for me?

38
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,468
I was worried because you suddenly left.

39
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:15,198
I wondered if something happened to you.

40
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:30,478
Please wait.

41
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:45,859
(Episode 10: A Secret Exposed)

42
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,859
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

43
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:54,497
Was Chung Soon the last one to walk out...

44
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:55,838
of the outhouse that night?

45
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,638
Did you see anything else that seemed suspicious?

46
00:04:58,768 --> 00:04:59,768
No.

47
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:01,707
Was the housekeeper truly away from home that day?

48
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,479
I believe he was sent on an errand.

49
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:08,479
Must I know everything about that man's day?

50
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:13,919
He said he must travel a long way, so I made him some rice balls.

51
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,618
He is not the one you serve.

52
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:18,929
How come you made food for a housekeeper?

53
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,529
- I do as I am told as a servant. - Come on.

54
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:24,098
But you were adored by Lord Kwon...

55
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:25,498
as his favorite.

56
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:29,898
Getting adored does not change my social status.

57
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:36,208
Chung Soon often makes such a slip of the tongue.

58
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,247
Did she do that often to your lord?

59
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:40,508
No, she could not do that to him,

60
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:43,279
but she often did that to the housekeeper.

61
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,349
They often bickered.

62
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:48,888
Bickering with the housekeeper.

63
00:05:51,688 --> 00:05:52,888
She never learned any better.

64
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,828
I only spoke with her to teach her proper manners.

65
00:05:56,998 --> 00:05:58,998
Have you always known her?

66
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,429
By always,

67
00:06:00,498 --> 00:06:02,739
do you mean the day she began to work here?

68
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:06,138
So she has not always worked here.

69
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,109
It does not matter.

70
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:11,438
She is just a servant girl who has nothing to do with me.

71
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,948
About three months ago, he brought Chung Soon...

72
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:18,849
from his friend's place.

73
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:21,488
Do you mean that family uptown...

74
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:22,989
where the housekeeper went to run an errand?

75
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:27,489
Have you found the suspects?

76
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,599
At this point in time,

77
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:35,138
I am the most suspicious of you.

78
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:37,239
How can you say that?

79
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:40,608
You were the last one who was in the outhouse with him.

80
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,637
And nobody else saw you...

81
00:06:42,638 --> 00:06:43,938
come out of his room.

82
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,078
I did not kill my brother.

83
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:51,248
Please do not worry.

84
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,289
I will prove your innocence.

85
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:59,258
Now, please confirm if my interrogation report is true,

86
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,988
then sign it.

87
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,029
(A report made after questioning is over)

88
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:15,479
Someone is here from the government office.

89
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:17,479
This way, please.

90
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:26,818
He is Magistrate Yoo of Hanseongbu.

91
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:28,148
Sorry?

92
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:31,559
Greetings, Magistrate Yoo.

93
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,258
Greetings, my lord.

94
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,358
Let us begin with the second exam.

95
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,728
(The second postmortem exam)

96
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:40,998
Attorney Kang and his team are here, so we will not need more help.

97
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,598
If we get more people involved, only rumors will spread further.

98
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,409
Yes, if you would do that.

99
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:49,039
I will assist with my utmost diligence.

100
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:52,008
Where is the deceased?

101
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,708
This way, please.

102
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:16,538
The depth and shape of the scar on Lord Kwon's neck show...

103
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,238
he was not stabbed several times.

104
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,908
Rather, the attacker cut the artery deep inside at once...

105
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:21,568
and took his life immediately.

106
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,708
It looks like the knife was...

107
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:26,749
about this long.

108
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:31,019
Any traces of resistance?

109
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:33,448
Almost none.

110
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,889
He could have been unable to fight because he was completely drunk.

111
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:38,687
In that case,

112
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:41,698
the one who was last seen with him would be the key suspect.

113
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:45,169
Have you received his family's testimonies?

114
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:46,198
Yes.

115
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:50,338
Let us go out and continue to talk.

116
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:52,438
And find the weapon first.

117
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:55,639
Bring me every knife in this house that is about half a foot long.

118
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,039
Yes, my lord.

119
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:14,889
Let us go.

120
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:23,238
There it is.

121
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:06,778
The murderer overpowered Lord Kwon...

122
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,278
and cut his carotid artery.

123
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,649
So, it is likely to be a man.

124
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:15,558
That leaves us with Kwon Myung Woo, the servant, and the housekeeper.

125
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,789
Three suspects.

126
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:19,488
If he was drunk and asleep,

127
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:21,429
a woman could have done it as well.

128
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:24,727
People who could have gotten close to his bed were...

129
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,398
Chung Soon or his wife.

130
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,598
No. These two have weak motives.

131
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:32,207
Lord Kwon's wife was only envious,

132
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,438
so it would be more natural for her to kill Chung Soon, not Lord Kwon.

133
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,809
Plus, a widow in Joseon is...

134
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,779
lower than a servant.

135
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:43,618
And of Chung Soon?

136
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:54,628
If she no longer wanted to be a servant,

137
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,528
she should have run away instead.

138
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:59,828
If she gets caught after a murder, she will be punished by death.

139
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:02,698
- It is too risky. - That is right.

140
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:04,937
Also, why would she...

141
00:11:04,938 --> 00:11:07,568
do something so foolish right before her wedding?

142
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:09,838
The same goes for Jang Dol.

143
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,607
Lord Kwon Myung Woo did not have...

144
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:14,179
a reason to disgrace his family before his appointment.

145
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:15,348
Then...

146
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:17,348
Yes.

147
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:20,088
For now,

148
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:23,118
the housekeeper is the prime suspect.

149
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:25,259
What is the reason?

150
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,029
Yes, I looked into it,

151
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:32,567
and he had gambling problems...

152
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,368
and fell into a huge debt.

153
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:37,039
How are we missing three sacks of rice again?

154
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,538
Do you think I am letting you manage my storeroom...

155
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:41,269
to support your gambles?

156
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:43,477
A few days before the murder,

157
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:46,009
people have seen him getting scolded by Lord Kwon.

158
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:52,289
The scenario could not be more obvious.

159
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:53,549
Obvious.

160
00:11:54,618 --> 00:11:57,588
Did the housekeeper get caught embezzling the money?

161
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,828
So, he held a grudge to...

162
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,029
But he was not in the house on the day of the murder.

163
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,598
Right.

164
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:06,827
(From Lord Kwon)

165
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:09,598
He went uptown to run an errand.

166
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:14,139
Yes. That is the issue.

167
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,478
The issue.

168
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,538
Did you confirm it...

169
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:19,808
with Lord Kwon's friend uptown?

170
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:22,948
Maybe he remembered it wrong or gave a false testimony.

171
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:25,749
Then, the housekeeper will be the prime suspect again.

172
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:28,958
That is it. It is exactly what I was thinking.

173
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:32,529
But why would Lord Kwon's friend help the housekeeper?

174
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,059
That is also what I was thinking.

175
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,379
Never...

176
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:00,988
let them know what happened to him.

177
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:03,718
"Him?"

178
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:07,159
A few days before the accident, he came by.

179
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:09,228
And...

180
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:13,629
Oh, that.

181
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:16,039
Yes, my lord.

182
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,438
Yes. We will keep our mouths shut.

183
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:26,578
Magistrate Yoo, we have found the weapon.

184
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:28,379
Come in.

185
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:37,088
It is Chung Soon's knife.

186
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:40,088
Chung Soon?

187
00:13:49,438 --> 00:13:50,568
May I?

188
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,389
What?

189
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:20,269
What is it?

190
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:23,698
Oh, it is nothing.

191
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,549
What are you doing? It was not me. You got the wrong person!

192
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,077
Why would I kill my own master?

193
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:37,617
I am not insane!

194
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:39,618
- Let me go! - Tie her up.

195
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:42,559
We will move her to Hanseongbu first thing tomorrow.

196
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:48,129
My lord. I did not do it.

197
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:52,128
Please release me, my lord.

198
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:53,999
This is not fair.

199
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:56,338
I did not do it!

200
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,868
Please...

201
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,237
Please let me go.

202
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:04,509
It was not me. I feel wrongly accused.

203
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:01,698
Chung Soon is not the murderer.

204
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:06,038
If she was, she would not have given me this so easily.

205
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,607
She would have hidden it or thrown it away.

206
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:09,938
Just like in Lord Chu's case.

207
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,149
Or she thought she might get caught for cleaning the knife.

208
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,318
She might have wanted to keep it as it was valuable.

209
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:18,049
Not as valuable as her life.

210
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,259
What if you are wrong?

211
00:16:22,488 --> 00:16:23,687
I will take responsibility.

212
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:26,159
- How? - How would you like me to?

213
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,198
Never bring So Won into your mess again.

214
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,168
It is unpleasant to see her with you.

215
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:42,238
And I am sure you know why.

216
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:26,789
You were really focused there.

217
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:28,519
How did it go?

218
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,128
I barely got one more day.

219
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:37,059
I will catch the true culprit tomorrow.

220
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:39,568
You surely like catching criminals.

221
00:17:40,328 --> 00:17:41,628
No, I like you.

222
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:54,908
You know,

223
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,719
I am only asking because we have time.

224
00:17:58,219 --> 00:18:01,449
It is not that important, though.

225
00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:07,858
You and Magistrate Yoo seemed pretty close.

226
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:10,628
Did something grand happen between the two of you...

227
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:12,928
that I am not aware of?

228
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:14,269
What?

229
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:18,598
Oh, not really. It is just...

230
00:18:22,678 --> 00:18:24,739
I told you last time...

231
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,778
that there were people who were funding our merchant house.

232
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:28,809
Yes.

233
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:31,878
Magistrate Yoo is one of them.

234
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:35,318
Oh, he is one of the three major patrons?

235
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:37,289
Yes.

236
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:41,158
For how long? No, never mind.

237
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:44,158
How does one become a patron?

238
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:45,828
Every month? Every year?

239
00:18:45,928 --> 00:18:48,229
Or rice and food in each season?

240
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:51,138
Why? Would you like to be one?

241
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:54,108
Even Magistrate Yoo can do it. Why not me?

242
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:55,338
I may not look it...

243
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,177
Well, in the middle class,

244
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:02,848
I am one of the people who made it.

245
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:07,048
Solve this case,

246
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:10,019
and you will be the most successful among the middle class.

247
00:19:10,118 --> 00:19:11,788
Then, you can start funding us.

248
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:12,789
Sure.

249
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,928
I also need you to promise me.

250
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,828
What is it?

251
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:20,269
That if I give a lot of financial support,

252
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,868
you will not receive help from Magistrate Yoo.

253
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:29,279
I do not want you to get hurt.

254
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:35,049
Whether you are with me...

255
00:19:35,648 --> 00:19:37,178
or with Magistrate Yoo,

256
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:40,348
the executive minister will not like you.

257
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:42,918
So promise me...

258
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:45,588
that you will stay...

259
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:50,529
with whoever will keep you safe.

260
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:58,398
You have become a scaredy-cat.

261
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:00,338
What?

262
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,338
At first, you were reckless and careless...

263
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:06,979
as if there was no tomorrow.

264
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:11,019
Still, I am glad.

265
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:13,449
You have become timid...

266
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:16,259
because you got something that precious.

267
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:19,729
And it means you now have tomorrow.

268
00:20:21,828 --> 00:20:23,198
Do not worry.

269
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,858
Everything will be fine.

270
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:29,439
What you just said.

271
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:32,508
Does it mean that I do not have to misunderstand...

272
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:33,908
your relationship with Magistrate Yoo?

273
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:35,539
I do not have to get the wrong idea, right?

274
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:36,739
Right.

275
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:41,949
It is good, then.

276
00:20:56,158 --> 00:20:58,999
Were you concerned over that little thing?

277
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,338
That is...

278
00:21:07,138 --> 00:21:08,769
merely anything.

279
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:26,189
- Chung Soon is the culprit? - Yes.

280
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,699
Bloodstain was found on her silver knife.

281
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:32,098
And she confessed.

282
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:33,999
How could...

283
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:35,568
It cannot be.

284
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:38,199
Chung Soon committed murder? No way.

285
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,808
That vixen.

286
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:41,268
How dare she kill her master?

287
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:42,439
However,

288
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:46,577
it is said there is...

289
00:21:46,578 --> 00:21:47,848
an accomplice.

290
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:50,979
An accomplice?

291
00:21:51,648 --> 00:21:54,817
She is being interrogated in confinement.

292
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:56,688
But she would not come clean.

293
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:59,688
Magistrate Yoo is interrogating her more intensely...

294
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:01,658
to arrest the accomplice as well.

295
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,358
I doubt she will last long.

296
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:07,828
She will...

297
00:22:08,668 --> 00:22:11,868
probably give in tonight.

298
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:28,418
Watch them closely.

299
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:32,158
Just do your job without making mistakes.

300
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:16,469
What are you looking at?

301
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:18,638
Be quiet.

302
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:21,608
Where did he go?

303
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:23,739
Goodness.

304
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,309
Darn you, Jang Dol.

305
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:27,249
Chung Soon, I mean!

306
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:31,719
How could you send someone like her to our family?

307
00:23:32,348 --> 00:23:35,019
Meanwhile, I made sure my family kept their mouths shut...

308
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:38,019
so there would not be any rumors about you.

309
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:43,628
Calm down.

310
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:46,968
What about Chung Soon?

311
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:49,499
Chung Soon murdered my brother!

312
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:51,939
What?

313
00:23:52,168 --> 00:23:54,608
Bloodstain was found on her silver knife.

314
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:57,608
She cannot deny it now that the weapon was found.

315
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,178
There is even an accomplice.

316
00:24:02,918 --> 00:24:04,078
An accomplice?

317
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:06,019
Yes.

318
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:09,989
It cannot be.

319
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,989
Where is she?

320
00:25:37,878 --> 00:25:38,979
What?

321
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:40,348
Who are you?

322
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,519
Who are you?

323
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:50,418
It was...

324
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:51,689
not the housekeeper.

325
00:25:58,128 --> 00:25:59,327
My lord.

326
00:25:59,328 --> 00:26:00,999
What brings you here at night?

327
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:04,299
I heard the culprit was caught and came straight over.

328
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:06,039
But...

329
00:26:07,668 --> 00:26:09,539
who is this weirdo?

330
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:13,309
Who is he to be this rude to me?

331
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:16,418
And who are you?

332
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:19,218
Who are you...

333
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:21,188
that you came straight to the shed as soon as you arrived?

334
00:26:21,189 --> 00:26:22,647
I need your explanation.

335
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:23,959
How dare you?

336
00:26:24,358 --> 00:26:25,888
Watch how you speak to him.

337
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:28,128
My lord,

338
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:30,898
he is the attorney in charge of this case.

339
00:26:31,158 --> 00:26:32,658
His name is Kang Han Soo.

340
00:26:33,128 --> 00:26:34,368
He is an attorney?

341
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:36,998
This is Lord Choongwon,

342
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:38,368
His Majesty's uncle.

343
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:39,638
Pardon?

344
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:41,439
His Majesty...

345
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:49,178
Greetings, my lord.

346
00:26:49,348 --> 00:26:51,218
I am Attorney Kang Han Soo.

347
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:52,618
I am Dong Chi.

348
00:26:57,489 --> 00:26:58,719
Lord Choongwon?

349
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:04,529
Yes, my uncle is...

350
00:27:04,828 --> 00:27:08,529
known for being possessive and speculative.

351
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:12,908
He even engraves a symbol on his items like that.

352
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:16,979
Once in drink,

353
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:19,979
he said my father took the throne away from him...

354
00:27:20,408 --> 00:27:22,107
and that if he had become King,

355
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:24,549
Joseon would have been...

356
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,648
a much better nation.

357
00:27:28,318 --> 00:27:29,888
If Lord Choongwon is...

358
00:27:30,388 --> 00:27:32,118
involved in this case...

359
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,799
We must stop it.

360
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,469
Of all cases,

361
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:49,608
why did you have to take one with a huge figure involved in it?

362
00:27:50,408 --> 00:27:52,338
What rotten luck.

363
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:59,178
Then why would Lord Kwon's friend help the housekeeper?

364
00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:01,848
About three months ago, I brought Chung Soon...

365
00:28:02,318 --> 00:28:03,618
from his house.

366
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:06,289
It was not about luck.

367
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:12,459
It was planned.

368
00:28:14,328 --> 00:28:16,239
Who planned what?

369
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:18,138
Executive Minister...

370
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:20,209
Yoo Je Se.

371
00:28:22,608 --> 00:28:25,309
He is trying to use this to suppress the royal house.

372
00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:49,699
Then are you saying we got fooled around...

373
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:54,868
in a plan that he set up to mess with His Majesty?

374
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:58,378
Look.

375
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:00,377
Let us quit right away.

376
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:02,647
Even if we keep digging up,

377
00:29:02,648 --> 00:29:05,249
it will only play in favor of the executive minister.

378
00:29:14,928 --> 00:29:17,828
Big Brother. Hey, Han Soo!

379
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:40,449
Have you still not heard anything from Kang Han Soo?

380
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:42,418
No, Your Majesty.

381
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:51,098
Will you continue to investigate?

382
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,799
Investigate what?

383
00:29:55,068 --> 00:29:56,898
The culprit has already been caught, no?

384
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,568
The real culprit...

385
00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:02,668
is still out there.

386
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:05,809
What was that?

387
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:07,848
However, reveal the real culprit,

388
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:11,219
and you will get dismissed from your hard-earned position...

389
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:13,588
and might experience...

390
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:16,019
much worse situations than that.

391
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:21,358
Do not tell me...

392
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:23,928
the one who killed my brother...

393
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:26,828
Is it...

394
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:30,269
Yes.

395
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:37,608
Are you going to bury it like this?

396
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:42,049
Or will you reveal the truth?

397
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:47,148
That nobleman thinks highly of honor.

398
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:50,618
He will do anything to catch his old brother's killer...

399
00:30:51,189 --> 00:30:53,229
and discover the truth.

400
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:57,828
That feeling of his will provoke Han Soo's ambition.

401
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:02,397
Yet again, my son and Princess Yeon Joo...

402
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:04,898
will try to cover up that incident.

403
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,892
Seeing them fight against each other...

404
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:12,338
is going to be very entertaining.

405
00:31:17,648 --> 00:31:18,719
The culprit...

406
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:22,148
is the servant Chung Soon.

407
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,118
I will report so to the superior office.

408
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:31,529
You cannot do that.

409
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:46,709
Did you not promise to give me time until the real culprit is caught?

410
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:49,949
The servant already confessed.

411
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:51,749
Excuse me?

412
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,689
Why did she run away if she were not the culprit?

413
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:57,019
Wait. The servant ran away?

414
00:32:06,229 --> 00:32:08,298
- Tie her. - Hold on.

415
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:11,499
No. Why are you doing this to me?

416
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:16,168
I confirmed it.

417
00:32:16,378 --> 00:32:18,638
She disappeared with all her belongings in her place.

418
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:23,817
Running away is regarded the same as a confession. So...

419
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:27,417
No. Even if the suspect of a murder case runs away,

420
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:29,958
you cannot end the investigation unless you question and hear...

421
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:33,059
a clear confession from the culprit. You know that, do you not?

422
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:42,469
What is with you two?

423
00:32:44,469 --> 00:32:47,269
Answer me. What is it?

424
00:32:48,138 --> 00:32:50,108
I heard Lord Choongwon was involved.

425
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:53,677
It was that? So what?

426
00:32:53,678 --> 00:32:55,548
You are trying to end the case...

427
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:57,177
before Lord Choongwon gets dragged in?

428
00:32:57,178 --> 00:32:58,877
Regardless of what happens to the servant...

429
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:01,018
and who cares about the truth, yes?

430
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:03,117
Even she is liable for running away.

431
00:33:03,118 --> 00:33:05,958
What is more, the one who requested the case was the King.

432
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,029
So...

433
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,098
The servant must have run away for a good reason.

434
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:14,628
She could not trust anyone.

435
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:18,739
She knew what you, the judge, were like.

436
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:21,269
And you.

437
00:33:23,338 --> 00:33:24,408
Come with me.

438
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:26,608
That little...

439
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,417
I get that you want to do anything...

440
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:40,627
for my sake and to protect me.

441
00:33:40,628 --> 00:33:43,158
But that is enough. Why go overboard?

442
00:33:43,628 --> 00:33:45,128
I came to see Magistrate Yoo because...

443
00:33:46,699 --> 00:33:48,969
I am telling you not to lose your belief.

444
00:33:49,598 --> 00:33:51,238
What you think is right...

445
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:54,239
and the values you want to protect. Do not give up on them.

446
00:33:56,979 --> 00:34:00,178
All right, fine. So what if the King requested the case?

447
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:02,609
Turn a blind eye to the innocent?

448
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:04,618
Cover up the truth?

449
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:08,249
Even if I do those, you should not.

450
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:11,218
If the King falters, the executive minister will gain more power.

451
00:34:11,488 --> 00:34:13,427
All the hard work will become useless.

452
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:14,559
But why?

453
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:21,868
Why are you the one worrying about such a bloody situation?

454
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:25,039
It makes me upset.

455
00:34:45,118 --> 00:34:47,158
Revenge or whatnot, I will do it.

456
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,669
It will only be my hands that will do the bloody and evil jobs.

457
00:34:57,499 --> 00:34:59,468
Live like you always have, So Won.

458
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:02,609
Do not become a mess.

459
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:17,459
It seems Kang Han Soo has changed a lot.

460
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:19,758
But it is the Princess...

461
00:35:20,328 --> 00:35:22,289
who has changed more politically.

462
00:35:26,028 --> 00:35:30,439
(In Mourning)

463
00:35:57,698 --> 00:36:00,399
Are you going to bury it like this?

464
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:04,839
Or will you reveal the truth?

465
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:13,749
Enjoy the drinks.

466
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:15,778
- Gosh, thank you. - Here.

467
00:36:16,578 --> 00:36:17,649
Right.

468
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:26,058
Born as the son of a judicial officer,

469
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,229
you were familiar with the Book of the Law.

470
00:36:28,928 --> 00:36:31,959
- And so, you became an attorney? - Yes.

471
00:36:32,198 --> 00:36:33,598
That is strange.

472
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:36,298
Why did you not become a judicial officer?

473
00:36:36,598 --> 00:36:38,768
Goodness. I could not dare dream...

474
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:40,769
of a public post with my lowly skills.

475
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:42,209
Come on.

476
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:45,878
You proved your utmost skills...

477
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:47,678
by settling the recent case.

478
00:36:48,548 --> 00:36:50,019
You praise me too much.

479
00:36:50,778 --> 00:36:51,778
Here.

480
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:55,988
Let me pour you a glass.

481
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:03,928
By the way,

482
00:37:04,899 --> 00:37:06,968
why did you think the servant was the culprit?

483
00:37:07,669 --> 00:37:09,499
Because of that silver knife?

484
00:37:11,238 --> 00:37:13,439
Your eyes are filled with doubts, my lord.

485
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,408
There was no motive, was there?

486
00:37:16,738 --> 00:37:19,907
I heard the motive was most important in a murder case.

487
00:37:19,908 --> 00:37:21,548
That is true. So...

488
00:37:22,278 --> 00:37:25,018
honestly, I suspected the housekeeper.

489
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:27,488
And I do still feel a bit restless.

490
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:31,319
Since we are on the topic,

491
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:34,229
did the housekeeper...

492
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:37,798
truly sleep at your house that night?

493
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:55,178
Why are you suspecting the housekeeper?

494
00:37:57,178 --> 00:37:59,918
The housekeeper has a good reputation...

495
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:01,617
as he spends money liberally on others.

496
00:38:01,618 --> 00:38:05,089
However, he was a huge fan of gambling.

497
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,859
And such a man was in charge of Lord Kwon's housework.

498
00:38:09,189 --> 00:38:10,328
I see!

499
00:38:10,828 --> 00:38:13,499
So he took Lord Kwon's property in secret.

500
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:15,528
Also,

501
00:38:16,939 --> 00:38:18,569
he had his pride.

502
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:19,939
"Pride?"

503
00:38:20,638 --> 00:38:23,108
He was put to shame by Lord Kwon...

504
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:24,908
in front of his juniors.

505
00:38:25,278 --> 00:38:27,948
Furious, I doubt he had a good night's sleep.

506
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:31,378
He would have gotten personal revenge,

507
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:33,388
and his debt would have vanished.

508
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,088
In short, Lord Kwon's death...

509
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:36,718
was killing two birds with one stone to him.

510
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,559
That is it.

511
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:41,827
This is truly interesting.

512
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:43,229
- Here. - Thank you.

513
00:38:45,729 --> 00:38:47,698
- Here. - Thank you.

514
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:56,839
Now, in that case,

515
00:38:57,439 --> 00:39:01,249
how will you explain Chung Soon's silver knife?

516
00:39:03,048 --> 00:39:04,149
Well,

517
00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:06,988
I have this strong feeling that it was the housekeeper,

518
00:39:07,689 --> 00:39:09,749
but the evidence leads me to Chung Soon.

519
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:11,589
Here is my answer.

520
00:39:13,258 --> 00:39:14,589
This.

521
00:39:15,158 --> 00:39:16,428
What is that?

522
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:17,658
I mean that...

523
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:20,629
they were in a relationship.

524
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,138
What is your reason?

525
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:29,367
Chung Soon handed that knife to me without an inch of suspicion.

526
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:33,039
It means she had no idea it was the weapon of his murder.

527
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:37,649
Also, that silver knife was ornamented in fancy jewels.

528
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:40,888
The housekeeper must have bought it because he is quite generous.

529
00:39:42,189 --> 00:39:44,558
If the silver knife was used as a weapon...

530
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:46,088
without her knowledge,

531
00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:48,758
then made its way back without her knowledge,

532
00:39:49,028 --> 00:39:50,999
it means they were quite close...

533
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:52,698
No.

534
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:57,638
They had an absolutely intimate relationship.

535
00:40:02,908 --> 00:40:04,408
I knew it.

536
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:07,008
You are an interesting fellow.

537
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:09,209
- Now. - Yes?

538
00:40:09,578 --> 00:40:11,848
- Have another drink. - Sure.

539
00:40:16,388 --> 00:40:20,118
I am forever grateful for your consideration...

540
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:22,129
of a petty man like me.

541
00:40:28,169 --> 00:40:29,669
Although I am grateful,

542
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:32,939
there is...

543
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:37,939
one problem that had been bothering me from the start.

544
00:40:39,578 --> 00:40:40,809
What is it?

545
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:45,448
That Chung Soon began to work for this family...

546
00:40:46,348 --> 00:40:48,249
only a few months ago,

547
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,919
but she was already known by everyone as the most adored.

548
00:40:53,689 --> 00:40:57,198
Which means she could not have been adored by the late Lord Kwon.

549
00:40:57,698 --> 00:40:58,758
In that case,

550
00:41:00,629 --> 00:41:01,798
by whom...

551
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:05,298
was she...

552
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:08,109
adored by?

553
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:31,729
Like this.

554
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:48,709
Chung Soon.

555
00:41:48,778 --> 00:41:50,919
Come and sit with me for a drink.

556
00:41:51,548 --> 00:41:52,778
The most adored?

557
00:41:57,959 --> 00:42:00,118
How was she the most adored by you?

558
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:09,798
How dare you do this to my Chung Soon?

559
00:42:12,598 --> 00:42:14,737
Do you think I left you in charge of my finances...

560
00:42:14,738 --> 00:42:16,468
for you to use it to gamble?

561
00:42:37,428 --> 00:42:41,428
He is putting you through so much trouble to send an inkstone.

562
00:42:41,499 --> 00:42:43,839
Lord Kwon can be quite cruel.

563
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:45,039
It is all right.

564
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,209
He sent this with me because this is quite precious.

565
00:42:48,408 --> 00:42:49,539
No.

566
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:51,979
I have good discernment of people's character.

567
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:54,777
He may seem like a good man who cares about his neighbors,

568
00:42:54,778 --> 00:42:58,078
but deep inside, he can be very petty.

569
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:00,789
Do you think that is why I left you in charge?

570
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:06,689
He does have that side.

571
00:43:08,689 --> 00:43:10,158
Let me see.

572
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:13,928
I would like to run over and surprise him.

573
00:43:14,198 --> 00:43:17,468
Do you know how I can get inside without anybody noticing?

574
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:18,737
Of course.

575
00:43:18,738 --> 00:43:20,669
I know every way in or out of that house.

576
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:21,908
I see.

577
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:27,778
This is not good.

578
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:31,648
Even if we left now, by the time I arrived,

579
00:43:31,649 --> 00:43:34,848
he would be completely wasted.

580
00:43:36,118 --> 00:43:38,218
He would not even notice if someone abducted him.

581
00:43:40,089 --> 00:43:41,559
Is that not so?

582
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:44,698
Pardon?

583
00:43:45,928 --> 00:43:47,598
I mean that...

584
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:52,798
everyone will think you were at my place tonight.

585
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:55,808
Do you...

586
00:43:55,809 --> 00:43:57,209
understand what I mean?

587
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:19,499
I understand.

588
00:44:55,468 --> 00:44:58,269
I thought she now belonged to Lord Kwon.

589
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:03,039
You darned jerk.

590
00:45:04,778 --> 00:45:06,979
How dare you?

591
00:45:09,048 --> 00:45:12,519
How dare a man like you steal what is mine?

592
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:16,388
How dare you?

593
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:24,528
How dare you?

594
00:45:36,439 --> 00:45:37,678
What are you doing?

595
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:40,209
He is the man who killed Lord Kwon.

596
00:45:40,548 --> 00:45:41,709
Arrest him!

597
00:45:43,848 --> 00:45:45,819
I did it because he told me to!

598
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:48,718
You were the one who told me...

599
00:45:48,819 --> 00:45:50,488
to kill Lord Kwon!

600
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:52,789
What did you say? You!

601
00:45:55,988 --> 00:45:57,129
That is enough.

602
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:20,319
Father.

603
00:46:24,218 --> 00:46:25,589
He is one of the royal family.

604
00:46:26,218 --> 00:46:27,629
I will escort him.

605
00:46:30,658 --> 00:46:32,198
What are you doing? Escort him now.

606
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:39,138
Good work.

607
00:46:40,138 --> 00:46:41,339
Let us go.

608
00:47:09,598 --> 00:47:12,598
Do you wish to let Lord Choongwon live?

609
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:15,638
Is that...

610
00:47:17,408 --> 00:47:19,379
a matter of choice?

611
00:47:19,908 --> 00:47:23,249
It is a matter of choice for me.

612
00:47:24,379 --> 00:47:28,617
Lord Choongwon has committed a grave crime...

613
00:47:28,618 --> 00:47:30,088
of instigating another man's murder.

614
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:33,319
But the funny thing is, the law of Joseon...

615
00:47:33,888 --> 00:47:36,788
does not name a crime of such nature...

616
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:38,698
or its punishment.

617
00:47:43,468 --> 00:47:45,097
When a crime is not named...

618
00:47:45,098 --> 00:47:47,809
in the law to punish a criminal,

619
00:47:47,939 --> 00:47:49,938
a new precedent is to be made...

620
00:47:49,939 --> 00:47:52,539
under the King's judgment.

621
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:55,008
Of course, the public sentiment...

622
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,979
plays a significant part in that decision.

623
00:47:59,678 --> 00:48:04,419
Just as how Your Majesty was helped by the Sarim and scholars...

624
00:48:04,658 --> 00:48:08,028
when you decided to execute Chu Young Woo's son, Dae Sung.

625
00:48:09,629 --> 00:48:12,559
The moment this case becomes publicized,

626
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:15,528
I will have the Hungu...

627
00:48:16,468 --> 00:48:19,669
intercede to punish Lord Choongwon severely.

628
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:22,769
I will make it happen.

629
00:48:23,008 --> 00:48:24,408
So his innocence or conviction is...

630
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:26,738
in your hands?

631
00:48:27,548 --> 00:48:29,309
Everything that happens in Joseon is...

632
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,019
in my hands.

633
00:48:42,459 --> 00:48:43,928
What would you have me do?

634
00:48:46,399 --> 00:48:48,729
Cancel Kwon Myung Woo's appointment...

635
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,999
and never bring up...

636
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:53,839
abolishing the Minister Committee again.

637
00:48:54,408 --> 00:48:56,709
How can I blame him for the death...

638
00:48:57,109 --> 00:48:58,678
of his family?

639
00:48:58,908 --> 00:49:01,809
Kwon Myung Woo is exactly the one to blame.

640
00:49:02,508 --> 00:49:06,448
He's been the one to blame since the moment...

641
00:49:07,218 --> 00:49:09,118
Lord Choongwon decided to murder Lord Kwon.

642
00:49:10,089 --> 00:49:13,589
Lord Choongwon initially went to Lord Kwon's house...

643
00:49:14,258 --> 00:49:16,288
because he was furious to hear...

644
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:18,028
that his favorite servant was getting married.

645
00:49:19,658 --> 00:49:21,928
As soon as Kwon Myung Woo won the position,

646
00:49:22,328 --> 00:49:24,839
he started hanging out with the Sarim scholars...

647
00:49:25,069 --> 00:49:26,899
and talked about his family matters.

648
00:49:27,508 --> 00:49:29,408
And that news...

649
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:32,109
reached Lord Choongwon.

650
00:49:36,649 --> 00:49:37,649
Do you believe...

651
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,019
that it is wise to appoint such a careless person...

652
00:49:41,948 --> 00:49:43,488
to a post with important duties?

653
00:49:55,999 --> 00:49:58,039
Also...

654
00:50:00,968 --> 00:50:02,468
You have more to tell us?

655
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:05,178
Grand Queen Dowager,

656
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:07,678
as the elder of the royal family,

657
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:10,209
you must fulfill your duty and responsibility to the fullest.

658
00:50:10,848 --> 00:50:12,318
Disciplining...

659
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,418
your rude and impolite grandchildren...

660
00:50:14,419 --> 00:50:16,089
who fear no one...

661
00:50:16,919 --> 00:50:19,258
is also your responsibility.

662
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,698
Who do you mean?

663
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:28,269
I mean your favorite princess,

664
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:30,528
Princess Yeon Joo.

665
00:50:32,138 --> 00:50:33,298
Why her?

666
00:50:34,968 --> 00:50:37,038
Are you aware...

667
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,109
of who Princess Yeon Joo spends time with...

668
00:50:41,048 --> 00:50:42,979
and what she does with them?

669
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:53,589
Do as he asks, Your Majesty.

670
00:50:54,488 --> 00:50:55,559
Grandmother.

671
00:50:56,528 --> 00:50:59,729
Not for Lord Choongwon. It is for your own good.

672
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,999
Lord Choongwon's downfall will be our humiliation.

673
00:51:03,368 --> 00:51:06,669
It will also affect your authority.

674
00:51:10,138 --> 00:51:12,638
Do not provoke him any further.

675
00:51:15,149 --> 00:51:18,278
It is not time yet.

676
00:52:12,198 --> 00:52:14,039
(Hanseongbu)

677
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:22,778
Chung Soon did not run away?

678
00:52:24,618 --> 00:52:25,649
No.

679
00:52:26,749 --> 00:52:29,249
Are you lying to me after hiding her away?

680
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:32,589
To blame it all on her and close the case?

681
00:52:33,718 --> 00:52:35,859
I did not want to let Minister Yoo manipulate us.

682
00:52:37,899 --> 00:52:40,657
You would think that he was your arch-enemy,

683
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,428
not mine.

684
00:52:43,028 --> 00:52:45,569
You asked me to be there for the victimized people.

685
00:52:45,798 --> 00:52:47,838
You wanted to exonerate them. So, why...

686
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:48,839
That was...

687
00:52:49,868 --> 00:52:51,709
before I fell in love with you.

688
00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:55,908
Now,

689
00:52:56,609 --> 00:52:59,218
my priority is to protect you from Executive Minister Yoo.

690
00:53:00,718 --> 00:53:01,848
I do not regret it.

691
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:12,158
The murderer of Lord Kwon,

692
00:53:13,028 --> 00:53:15,269
Housekeeper Cho, has been executed today.

693
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:22,169
(High Treason)

694
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:37,718
Lord Choongwon has been sent away...

695
00:53:38,459 --> 00:53:39,658
as a punishment.

696
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:47,669
And I have realized...

697
00:53:48,098 --> 00:53:49,467
that one could kill a person...

698
00:53:49,468 --> 00:53:51,669
without getting blood on his hands if you were powerful enough.

699
00:53:53,098 --> 00:53:54,169
The housekeeper was...

700
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:57,677
also able to commit such a bold crime...

701
00:53:57,678 --> 00:53:59,879
as someone like Lord Choongwon had his back.

702
00:54:00,879 --> 00:54:04,008
Yes, that is power.

703
00:54:04,209 --> 00:54:05,848
Now, I also want...

704
00:54:06,548 --> 00:54:07,888
to make use of that power.

705
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,118
I will marry Princess Yeon Joo.

706
00:54:30,939 --> 00:54:32,339
When the preceding king...

707
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:35,649
wanted to have you marry Princess Yeon Joo,

708
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:39,319
his purpose was to keep me in check.

709
00:54:39,718 --> 00:54:40,819
So,

710
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,348
as soon as he passed away,

711
00:54:43,548 --> 00:54:45,859
I broke the engagement between you two.

712
00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:50,089
And you would be willing to marry her?

713
00:54:54,828 --> 00:54:56,269
You would abandon...

714
00:54:57,328 --> 00:55:00,538
wealth, glory, and your duties for this state...

715
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:02,609
to be the husband of a mere princess?

716
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:06,939
You said that I could do anything I wanted.

717
00:55:07,578 --> 00:55:10,507
If I cannot have the woman that I want,

718
00:55:10,508 --> 00:55:12,319
what is the point of your power?

719
00:55:21,828 --> 00:55:22,859
Sure.

720
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:25,798
If you really want, do it.

721
00:55:27,899 --> 00:55:29,629
I would rather revise the laws...

722
00:55:30,629 --> 00:55:32,539
to allow the king's son-in-law to be a government official.

723
00:55:33,439 --> 00:55:34,839
It seems that will be faster.

724
00:56:11,638 --> 00:56:14,008
You two seem different yet similar.

725
00:56:14,778 --> 00:56:17,678
You have embraced Joseon in your heart,

726
00:56:18,778 --> 00:56:21,749
and Ji Sun decided to embrace a woman.

727
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:24,959
He is a fool.

728
00:56:26,218 --> 00:56:29,729
How about you consider it a scholar's fidelity?

729
00:56:30,928 --> 00:56:32,899
He has been keeping in mind...

730
00:56:33,198 --> 00:56:35,098
the love and promise he had since he was little.

731
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:39,697
All scholars end up exploited by politicians...

732
00:56:39,698 --> 00:56:40,999
just like your father.

733
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:45,538
That is why I want him to be a politician...

734
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:47,709
rather than a scholar.

735
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:51,919
I will help you...

736
00:56:53,048 --> 00:56:54,348
with whatever it may be...

737
00:56:55,118 --> 00:56:57,419
if it is for you and Ji Sun.

738
00:57:07,999 --> 00:57:10,499
I have dealt with it as you ordered, my lord.

739
00:57:12,069 --> 00:57:14,238
Please notify me when it is time.

740
00:57:25,848 --> 00:57:27,248
It is the palace supply rights.

741
00:57:27,249 --> 00:57:29,249
(Palace Supply Rights)

742
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,718
Thank you for your boundless generosity!

743
00:58:03,649 --> 00:58:05,258
I have the princess's reply.

744
00:58:05,988 --> 00:58:07,257
On the day of the next full moon,

745
00:58:07,258 --> 00:58:08,859
she would like to see you at Wongak Temple.

746
00:59:00,238 --> 00:59:03,908
I will be your damo.

747
00:59:09,488 --> 00:59:11,618
Now do you believe that I mean it?

748
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,658
My So Won is so cool.

749
00:59:17,028 --> 00:59:20,129
These shoes will take you anywhere you want...

750
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:22,467
and help you go over any kinds of humps.

751
00:59:22,468 --> 00:59:25,499
They will take you...

752
00:59:25,999 --> 00:59:27,467
to a better and a more precious place.

753
00:59:27,468 --> 00:59:28,968
I have changed after I met you.

754
00:59:33,408 --> 00:59:34,749
So we promised...

755
00:59:35,048 --> 00:59:37,048
to be each other's cheongsimhwan...

756
00:59:37,649 --> 00:59:38,979
and to be together at all times.

757
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:46,488
All right.

758
00:59:47,218 --> 00:59:48,589
I, you.

759
00:59:48,729 --> 00:59:49,888
You, me.

760
00:59:51,499 --> 00:59:53,798
We will wait for each other.

761
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:09,048
Your Highness.

762
01:00:09,848 --> 01:00:11,178
Do not call me that.

763
01:00:15,888 --> 01:00:17,118
I am So Won.

764
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:20,019
A girl who works at a merchant house by Mapo Riverport.

765
01:00:26,158 --> 01:00:27,359
I want to stick...

766
01:00:29,269 --> 01:00:30,868
to being So Won for the rest of my life.

767
01:00:44,848 --> 01:00:46,778
Whatever it is, do as you want.

768
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:50,089
I will be assisting you.

769
01:02:31,249 --> 01:02:32,718
What are you doing here?

770
01:02:33,118 --> 01:02:35,158
His Majesty sent an urgent message.

771
01:02:56,875 --> 01:02:58,048
What the...

772
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:10,658
Do it.

773
01:03:11,698 --> 01:03:12,798
Darn it.

774
01:03:20,468 --> 01:03:21,569
Gosh!

775
01:03:23,669 --> 01:03:24,669
It worked.

776
01:03:27,008 --> 01:03:29,149
Goodness.

777
01:03:31,078 --> 01:03:33,278
Where am I?

778
01:03:34,078 --> 01:03:35,289
Where...

779
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:55,338
What?

780
01:03:55,339 --> 01:03:57,069
That man over there is Kang Han Soo.

781
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:00,539
- Arrest him. - Yes, my lord.

782
01:04:02,809 --> 01:04:03,908
What...

783
01:04:05,649 --> 01:04:06,879
Kang Han Soo.

784
01:04:07,319 --> 01:04:10,819
You are under arrest for murdering Lord Chu Young Woo.

785
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:13,757
What are you talking about?

786
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:15,527
Who killed whom?

787
01:04:15,528 --> 01:04:17,689
The witness said he saw a man...

788
01:04:17,789 --> 01:04:19,898
in a sky blue robe...

789
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:23,298
and a black hat roaming around near the scene.

790
01:04:23,899 --> 01:04:26,769
Even this weapon was found in your boat.

791
01:04:27,669 --> 01:04:29,169
Do not play innocent.

792
01:04:33,138 --> 01:04:34,778
He is not the culprit.

793
01:04:36,548 --> 01:04:37,709
So Won.

794
01:04:38,348 --> 01:04:41,218
He was with me the day Lord Chu died.

795
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:42,689
Move.

796
01:04:43,488 --> 01:04:45,359
How dare you step in, woman?

797
01:04:51,959 --> 01:04:53,959
Do not defend the murderer,

798
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,269
or your throat will be cut off.

799
01:05:01,368 --> 01:05:02,468
Let go!

800
01:05:04,209 --> 01:05:05,379
Back off.

801
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:07,678
Magistrate Yoo?

802
01:05:25,028 --> 01:05:26,198
Your Highness.

803
01:05:30,698 --> 01:05:31,839
Show your respect.

804
01:05:32,339 --> 01:05:35,069
This is Princess Yeon Joo, the daughter of the former King.

805
01:05:56,859 --> 01:05:58,359
Greetings, Your Highness.

806
01:05:58,999 --> 01:06:00,859
- Greetings, Your Highness. - Greetings, Your Highness.

807
01:06:24,118 --> 01:06:25,488
A princess?

808
01:06:58,218 --> 01:07:01,828
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

809
01:07:10,999 --> 01:07:12,738
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

810
01:07:13,098 --> 01:07:14,738
Just what does he mean to you...

811
01:07:15,339 --> 01:07:17,238
that you are taking this far?

812
01:07:17,738 --> 01:07:18,879
I...

813
01:07:20,738 --> 01:07:23,149
have promised to protect him.

814
01:07:27,178 --> 01:07:28,888
I will marry Her Highness.

815
01:07:31,689 --> 01:07:33,758
You once told me to make use of you.

816
01:07:34,118 --> 01:07:35,589
May I do that?

817
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:40,059
I have something to tell you.

818
01:07:40,698 --> 01:07:43,028
Are you going to keep making a fool of me?

819
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,999
You are not a miracle, but a curse to me.

820
01:07:50,468 --> 01:07:51,809
We are ill-fated.
