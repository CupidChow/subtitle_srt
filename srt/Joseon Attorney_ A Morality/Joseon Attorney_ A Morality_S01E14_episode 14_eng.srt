1
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,590

2
00:00:56,194 --> 00:00:57,964
You...

3
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:01,694
 Hold it in, Kang Eun Su.

4
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,474
 Do not let him catch you

5
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:07,834
 so that he will think I only look like his sister.

6
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,624
 Endure it.

7
00:01:09,624 --> 00:01:11,444
Why are you...

8
00:01:11,444 --> 00:01:15,704
Why are you in here...

9
00:01:25,644 --> 00:01:27,604
 But...

10
00:01:29,304 --> 00:01:31,494
Eun Su.

11
00:01:38,294 --> 00:01:41,194
Eun Su!

12
00:01:41,194 --> 00:01:43,594
Orabeoni.

13
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:47,754
I am sorry.

14
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,224
- I am sorry, Orabeoni. I am sorry.

15
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:54,204
Eun Su!

16
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:56,974
I am sorry, Orabeoni.

17
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:07,464
What did you say to Eun Su?

18
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:13,634
What did you tell her to entice her and use her... and use her like that?

19
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:19,334
Just the facts.

20
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:23,784
"That the late king did not order the death of Legal Officer Kang."

21
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:28,914
"It was the Grand Queen Dowager's decision to appease the ministers."

22
00:02:29,844 --> 00:02:31,884
"In place of the late king, whose illness was getting worse,

23
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:37,014
Grand Queen Dowager also made the decision to put the current king on the throne."

24
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:43,324
"Thus, to be strictly honest, the royal family of Joseon is your enemy."

25
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:48,604
"Would you like to take revenge against the royal family?"

26
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:05,694
I wanted to forgive you, Father.

27
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:15,424
Do you truly not see that I am waiting for a chance to understand you and forgive you?

28
00:03:32,394 --> 00:03:34,304
Do not cry.

29
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:36,304
And do not worry, either.

30
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:39,804
I will get you out of here.

31
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:41,284
Orabeoni.

32
00:03:41,284 --> 00:03:44,024
I will never let another...

33
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:49,134
die unjustly like our father, so...

34
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:51,294
I do not feel it is an injustice.

35
00:03:52,614 --> 00:03:56,994
I was not framed. I indeed did all that.

36
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:03,734
So, I will pay for my crime.

37
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:12,294
No! No! No.

38
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,184
Who decides what that punishment is?

39
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:17,454
Do you think anyone involved in this is just?

40
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:22,614
Everyone in all of Joseon is rotten to the core!

41
00:04:23,414 --> 00:04:26,344
On top of that, the king wants to kill you. So...

42
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:30,214
So, I will stop him. So...

43
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:32,164
Orabeoni.

44
00:04:32,164 --> 00:04:34,264
So...

45
00:04:35,064 --> 00:04:36,794
Eun Su..

46
00:04:45,364 --> 00:04:49,684
Let us live first. Okay?

47
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:54,644
Okay?

48
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:21,694
Yu Je Se!

49
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:26,984
No!

50
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:31,584
I will kill you! You!

51
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,544
Hyeongnim!

52
00:05:38,074 --> 00:05:40,104
No, no, no.

53
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:42,114
Eun Su.

54
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:46,784
You should not have messed with my sister!

55
00:05:46,784 --> 00:05:49,544
You! I will kill you!

56
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:53,254
I will kill you!

57
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:57,174
Let go! Let go of me! Let go!

58
00:05:57,964 --> 00:05:59,854
Let us go.

59
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:07,734
I will... I will kill you.

60
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,424
I will kill you.

61
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:23,864
Hyeong.

62
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:33,164
Eun Su... Hyeong, what do I do?

63
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:45,314
Hyeong.

64
00:06:53,784 --> 00:07:00,744
 Episode 14: Nakhwa Vol. 2 - A Flower Falls

65
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:05,054
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

66
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:09,594
What? Kang Han Su's?

67
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:11,094
Yes.

68
00:07:11,094 --> 00:07:15,744
She was also used by Minister Yu.

69
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:18,754
And now, she has been tossed aside.

70
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:23,104
I see.

71
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:26,144
Is that so?

72
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:31,254
Thus, there should not be any more innocent victims.

73
00:07:31,254 --> 00:07:34,454
- Pleaseâ€” 
- Innocent?

74
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,034
Who are you referring to?

75
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:38,214
Pardon?

76
00:07:38,214 --> 00:07:42,844
In order to prevent court officials of all ranks from being played by one woman,

77
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:45,314
I will make an example out of her and warn everyone.

78
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:51,384
However, Your Majesty, it is said that for a king to punish and award is to follow Heaven's will,

79
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:55,554
and there should not be personal feelings involved at all.

80
00:07:57,474 --> 00:07:59,334
Well, I am not sure.

81
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:07,084
To punish her in order to keep Minister Yu in check. Is that considered personal?

82
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:10,984
Or is it personal to give her mercy because she is my friend's sister?

83
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:23,554
For you to desperately convince me also... is it not because of your personal feelings?

84
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:38,444
Kang, who used to run a saloon in Namchon,

85
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:43,244
is a daughter of Kang Eon Jik, who used to serve in criminal jurisprudence in the Royal Court.

86
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:47,684
She is the daughter-in-law of Nam Gyun Moon, who served as a village magistrate in Jiwoong.

87
00:08:54,254 --> 00:09:01,704
Kang Eon Jik was a criminal who died amid interrogation for bribery charges, was he not?

88
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:04,814
Yes, that is correct.

89
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:10,094
The daughter must have inherited the father's immoral character.

90
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,664
 You are a woman of an aristocratic family...

91
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:22,554
Confess your crimes!

92
00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:26,024
 yet you have not behaved in modest ways and had many relations with many men.

93
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:30,614
 Please interrogate her fully and punish her harshly.

94
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:35,084
 Royal Investigation Bureau requests permission for them to interrogate

95
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:39,874
 Jang Myeong Gi, Jang Yoon, Kim Yong Jae, Seo Byeong Ho, Choi Heung Sun, and Lee Gun Wu.

96
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:43,254
Men, take off their clothes!

97
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:45,024
 Yes, sir!

98
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:51,614
 Big Heart

99
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:58,664
So, when will you announce my name?

100
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:06,154
Are you afraid?

101
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:09,914
That night...

102
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:15,634
did you approach me to win me over to your side for a day like today?

103
00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:31,224
I overheard the conversation that the Office of Inspector General officials were having today.

104
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:35,714
That the king personally gave them a secret order

105
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:39,564
to crack down on the black-market dealings happening at the border.

106
00:10:39,564 --> 00:10:46,284
And if this issue crops up, who will Minister Yu frame for the crime?

107
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:53,854
Once again... who would be abandoned this time?

108
00:10:59,964 --> 00:11:06,454
What is your intention behind telling me this?

109
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:15,234
Are you not on Minister Yu's side?

110
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:18,954
You have it wrong.

111
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:23,424
No, if you were to ask me whose side I am on,

112
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:27,244
I will tell you that I am my parent's daughter.

113
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:30,014
Your parents?

114
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:34,834
Who are your parents?

115
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:42,094
My father's name was Kang Eon Jik.

116
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:44,744
By chance...

117
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,004
 Legal Officer Kang Eon Jik

118
00:11:57,004 --> 00:11:58,654
 are you...

119
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:05,684
 Are you... Legal Officer Kang's daughter?

120
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:15,564
 Yes. Thus, I am giving you a chance to ask forgiveness from my father.

121
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:20,644
 Please tell me a secret plan to bring down Minister Yu.

122
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:36,294
There was no ledger.

123
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:41,154
Are you not the one who lied to me in order to push me into a corner?

124
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:43,214
If that is the case,

125
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:53,224
why do you think I did a foolish thing like this to prove my faithfulness to you?

126
00:13:04,814 --> 00:13:07,604
How pitiful you are.

127
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:15,754
You have all the power and wealth in the world, yet how come you are so anxious?

128
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:19,174
What will you do now?

129
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:24,874
You shortened your own life just now, Your Excellency.

130
00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:43,904
How dare you come here?

131
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:47,024
I came to calm you down.

132
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:48,314
Calm me down.

133
00:13:48,314 --> 00:13:51,444
You must control yourself even more at times like this.

134
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:56,694
Cut the bullshit! Who could control oneself at times like this?

135
00:13:58,374 --> 00:14:03,014
So, what is it you want to say?

136
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:08,584
What happened to your father has had a terrible effect on even Eun Su.

137
00:14:08,584 --> 00:14:13,244
They are attacking her, saying she inherited immoral character from him, insulting your family's ways.

138
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:15,834
Damn it. Insulting the family's ways?

139
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:21,044
Then is messing around with an innocent person's life this nation's way?

140
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:25,034
Geez. Let go of me!

141
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,794
In the midst of all this, if you step forward saying you are Eun Su's older brother,

142
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:38,764
Eun Su will be in an even direr situation.

143
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:43,654
As you know, who in the Royal Court looks upon you kindly?

144
00:14:44,494 --> 00:14:46,354
On top of that, you are an attorney.

145
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:51,334
They are even discussing making it unlawful for attorneys to work.

146
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:54,664
Whether you are Eun Su's older brother or an attorney or whatnot,

147
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:57,804
it will bring about adverse reactions if you step up to rescue Eun Su.

148
00:14:57,804 --> 00:15:01,234
Then! What do you want me to do?

149
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:08,174
Whatever you want to do... do it through me.

150
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:19,494
What do I need to do to rescue Eun Su?

151
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:56,624
Dong Chi orabeoni?

152
00:15:58,364 --> 00:16:00,434
Eun Su...

153
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:05,084
What is going on?

154
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:09,334
Princess and Mayor Yu helped us out.

155
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:13,624
I will protect you in here for the time being.

156
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:17,014
Just in case, to prepare for the worst.

157
00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:21,344
You think I might kill myself?

158
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:25,714
No. Just in case someone harms you.

159
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:29,414
Han Su is extremely worried.

160
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:38,824
I am sorry.

161
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:41,544
Why would you be sorry?

162
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:48,214
When you said you would get married, I should have stopped you.

163
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:53,904
I should have said I liked you, and I should have run away with you.

164
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:55,964
If I had done that, then...

165
00:16:58,074 --> 00:17:01,354
you would not have had to live this way.

166
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:07,154
Why are you laughing at me?

167
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:11,604
I really mean it! I am so upset!

168
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:15,484
I was not laughing at you.

169
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:18,244
I laughed because I liked it.

170
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:21,414
I think it would have been nice if that had happened.

171
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:28,704
If we had done that, I would be much happier than now.

172
00:17:29,854 --> 00:17:35,874
Because you always make me laugh, Dong Chi Orabeoni.

173
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:59,194
According to the Book of Law, in the case of adultery,

174
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:03,094
80 floggings should be administered if it is consensual.

175
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:06,184
If the woman is married, then 90 floggings.

176
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:11,004
If one was deceived, then 100 floggings.

177
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:31,204
 What do I need to do to rescue Eun Su?

178
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:36,264
I am sure everyone knows this case is about the fight between the king and Minister Yu.

179
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:38,244
Most people would be walking on eggshells.

180
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:42,504
However, a few of the ministers who want to be favored by the King

181
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:45,794
will strongly suggest a death sentence.

182
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:51,364
Kang's lewd behavior is that of lowly courtesans who sell their bodies.

183
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,674
Of course, she should receive the death sentence.

184
00:18:55,854 --> 00:19:00,764
First, emphasize the law about adultery.

185
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,194
However, in order to put Kang to death,

186
00:19:03,194 --> 00:19:07,994
we must punish all the men who had relations with Kang with the same punishment.

187
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:10,024
Why is that the case?

188
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,304
In the case of adultery with consent and adultery with deception,

189
00:19:12,304 --> 00:19:16,454
in the case of adultery by agreement and by enticement,

190
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:19,624
the men and women both receive the same punishment.

191
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:25,674
Thus if Kang receives the death sentence, the men should also be put to death.

192
00:19:25,674 --> 00:19:31,904
However, one woman enticed several men and committed adultery.

193
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:37,924
How can you say it carries the same weight for the men she deceived?

194
00:19:43,924 --> 00:19:47,754
Of course, the arrested men will insist that they fell for Eun Su's enticement.

195
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:52,084
The court officials of all ranks are all men. So they will believe the men more than Eun Su.

196
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:55,134
Even so, the crime does not deserve death.

197
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:57,054
Yes.

198
00:19:57,054 --> 00:20:07,534
Therefore, the best defense we can use is... go by the book.

199
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:16,024
However, the law that was already decided once cannot be argued.

200
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:20,240
If we do not put to death a criminal who disturbed the morals of society,

201
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,660
how can we correct such lewd behavior?

202
00:20:23,664 --> 00:20:26,854
Will such behavior change overnight just because you administer harsh punishment?

203
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:31,534
The reason for punishment is to teach a lesson to the people.

204
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:36,304
If we cannot change behavior, why would we rule by the law?

205
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:58,684
However, Your Majesty, to sentence someone outside of the book of law due to a moment of anger

206
00:20:58,684 --> 00:21:01,774
will set negative precedence.

207
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:06,984
Please listen to my plea.

208
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:21,724
How did it go?

209
00:21:24,124 --> 00:21:26,884
He still insists on a death sentence.

210
00:21:30,704 --> 00:21:35,934
However, even if he is the king, he cannot administer punishment that is outside of the law.

211
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:42,654
There is a way.

212
00:21:47,744 --> 00:21:50,494
If we looked at the case from a different perspective.

213
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:04,314
Ever since we distributed the Book of Law,

214
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:08,354
the death sentence was never given to a woman for adultery.

215
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:12,524
That is so, Your Majesty.

216
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:18,054
Thus, it is wrong to punish the criminal without following the law now.

217
00:22:18,054 --> 00:22:23,664
I am sorry to mention this, but it will do harm to the overall policy.

218
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:29,094
Thus, I must resolve this within the code of law.

219
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:35,634
 Your Majesty, I, Right State Minister Im Sang Ho, request an audience.

220
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:38,304
Please come in.

221
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:53,124
What brings you here, Right State Minister?

222
00:22:53,124 --> 00:22:58,194
I brought you a secret plan to lift your worries, Your Majesty.

223
00:23:13,504 --> 00:23:16,724
What is he trying to plot in the middle again?

224
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:18,444
Again?

225
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:21,714
The Right State Minister is the one who stole Legal Officer Kang's letter.

226
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:30,264
If you think about it, all the tragedy started with Right State Minister.

227
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:35,204
I will find out what he is plotting.

228
00:23:49,534 --> 00:23:54,384
 You shortened your own life just now, Your Excellency.

229
00:23:55,774 --> 00:23:57,744
Your Excellency!

230
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:03,534
Your Excellency! Are you all right?

231
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:07,044
- Hurry! Hurry up and help him!
 - Yes!

232
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:16,294
What happened?

233
00:24:16,294 --> 00:24:19,364
He seems to be poisoned.

234
00:24:19,364 --> 00:24:21,774
- Poison? 
- Yes.

235
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:25,754
I believe the burn on his arm is the cause.

236
00:24:26,914 --> 00:24:32,204
Sometimes, the poison spreads to the rest of the body if you apply heat.

237
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:37,024
Then, how can you treat it?

238
00:24:37,024 --> 00:24:41,554
I do not believe there is a way to save him.

239
00:24:43,234 --> 00:24:45,474
Physician, please step outside for a moment.

240
00:24:45,474 --> 00:24:47,064
Yes.

241
00:24:55,984 --> 00:24:58,384
Should I notify the princess?

242
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:01,664
Yes.

243
00:25:01,664 --> 00:25:03,314
No!

244
00:25:03,314 --> 00:25:07,154
Bring in Attorney Kang first.

245
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:08,774
Yes.

246
00:25:28,914 --> 00:25:33,274
In the end, this is how he pays for his sins.

247
00:25:34,774 --> 00:25:36,534
However...

248
00:25:37,914 --> 00:25:42,474
Im Sang Ho met His Majesty right before he died.

249
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,964
And I believe he gave the answer that His Majesty was looking for.

250
00:26:12,474 --> 00:26:16,884
I brought you a secret plan to lift your worries, Your Majesty.

251
00:26:16,884 --> 00:26:19,944
A secret plan to lift my worries?

252
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:25,514
Instead of a criminal penal code, you can rule according to the marriage code.

253
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:27,254
Marriage code? 
  Punishment

254
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:30,054
Yes, Your Majesty.

255
00:26:30,054 --> 00:26:33,114
If you punish her adultery based on the criminal penal code,

256
00:26:33,114 --> 00:26:36,904
the maximum sentence is 100 floggings and exile away to 2000 li.

257
00:26:36,904 --> 00:26:39,054
But in the marriage code,

258
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:45,890
you can punish a woman for remarrying right after leaving one's husband and execute hanging.

259
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,400
 Hanging

260
00:27:03,044 --> 00:27:05,794
 Criminal law code: Live | Marriage law code: Death

261
00:27:05,794 --> 00:27:08,844
 Is this the only way? 
 Criminal law code: Live | Marriage law code: Death

262
00:27:29,804 --> 00:27:37,174
 Your Majesty, will you indeed use that method?

263
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:48,694
You apply a similar code when the law does not specify the crime,

264
00:27:48,694 --> 00:27:53,264
but there is an apparent crime of adultery. So why do you apply another code?

265
00:27:53,264 --> 00:27:59,464
To you, is the law that flexible? Like it becomes whatever you want it to be?

266
00:27:59,464 --> 00:28:01,314
Then...

267
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:07,804
do you want me to remain a young king who is constantly used by Minister Yu?

268
00:28:09,594 --> 00:28:12,884
If I let that girl live now, I...

269
00:28:12,884 --> 00:28:17,584
I only become an incompetent king who cannot punish Minister Yu's spy

270
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:20,684
and only loses cherished vassals.

271
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:24,694
Then what kind of king is the one who

272
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:28,264
only speaks of exercising the law, yet applies the punishment as he sees fit?

273
00:28:28,264 --> 00:28:30,514
- Is he a foolish king?
 - Sister!

274
00:28:30,514 --> 00:28:34,374
It will remain in the history of chronicles for all the years to come.

275
00:28:34,374 --> 00:28:39,704
Will you ruin a thousand years of great work over the immediate benefit in front of you?

276
00:28:44,194 --> 00:28:46,094
This is for that thousand years of great work.

277
00:28:46,094 --> 00:28:47,224
Your Majesty!

278
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:51,004
If I can defeat a treacherous subject and restore the king's authority,

279
00:28:51,004 --> 00:28:55,294
there will be many more things I can accomplish, then...

280
00:28:55,294 --> 00:28:58,344
I can achieve many more great works.

281
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:01,694
The future generations' evaluation of me is bound to change.

282
00:29:01,694 --> 00:29:06,544
So, as for now,  seizing the opportunity comes first.

283
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,884
Please spare her life, Your Excellency.

284
00:29:24,884 --> 00:29:27,764
I will give up everything.

285
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:33,414
Whatever that may be, I will let go of everything and go far away with Eun Su.

286
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:38,254
So, please only spare her life.

287
00:29:39,234 --> 00:29:41,784
I was arrogant.

288
00:29:41,784 --> 00:29:46,494
I had a pointless dream of taking revenge using the law.

289
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:49,384
But now that this terrible thing has happened to my sister,

290
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:54,624
I know very well now that it is must faster to depend on power rather than the law.

291
00:29:58,224 --> 00:30:06,234
You are the only person... who can save Eun Su, Minister Yu.

292
00:30:11,284 --> 00:30:18,124
Do you wish to negotiate with me using your useless bent knees?

293
00:30:21,464 --> 00:30:28,424
If I spare Eun Su's life, what is it that I may gain?

294
00:30:28,424 --> 00:30:30,924
 He wants something from me.

295
00:30:30,924 --> 00:30:32,874
 What could it be?

296
00:30:37,164 --> 00:30:40,014
I will bring you what you want.

297
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:50,104
What did you just say?

298
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:52,704
I said where is the ledger?

299
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:55,774
I was sure you had offered it to Minister Yu, but you had not.

300
00:30:55,774 --> 00:30:59,334
Then, it is clear as day.

301
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:03,984
There is no way Minister Chu would have taken those heavy books on his way to the afterlife.

302
00:31:06,844 --> 00:31:09,234
I will bring them to you.

303
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:15,784
How dare you.

304
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:26,124
If I hand this over to you now, what happens to me, then?

305
00:31:26,124 --> 00:31:28,604
You seize the opportunity

306
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:31,034
to fulfill a duty as a human being.

307
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:33,544
To behave according to conscience rather than money.

308
00:31:33,544 --> 00:31:39,094
And... a chance to ask me for forgiveness.

309
00:31:42,104 --> 00:31:45,174
I saw you that day

310
00:31:45,174 --> 00:31:47,674
in the back alley.

311
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:20,794
- Get ready to go to the palace.
 - Yes, Your Excellency.

312
00:32:20,794 --> 00:32:22,624
Your Excellency.

313
00:32:23,794 --> 00:32:26,514
What are you going to do?

314
00:32:27,624 --> 00:32:31,214
What was the reason you came to me?

315
00:32:32,274 --> 00:32:38,644
It is because you believed that I could take care of what you could not. Is that not so?

316
00:32:42,914 --> 00:32:46,024
 Minister Yu went to Royal Investigation Bureau?

317
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:47,724
Yes.

318
00:32:51,314 --> 00:32:53,264
By chance...

319
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:56,674
Princess!

320
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:05,604
According to the law, you should live.

321
00:33:05,604 --> 00:33:13,854
However, the one who set the law and is to execute it wants you to die.

322
00:33:13,854 --> 00:33:15,964
You mean the king.

323
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:17,844
That is right.

324
00:33:17,844 --> 00:33:20,604
Thus, in order to save you,

325
00:33:20,604 --> 00:33:25,024
we need to devise a scheme, not the law.

326
00:33:25,024 --> 00:33:31,734
That is why your brother came to me instead of the king.

327
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:39,504
I intend to save you once again.

328
00:33:42,664 --> 00:33:50,814
I will move you to a safe place and execute another life in your place.

329
00:33:57,054 --> 00:33:59,744
The national law says that a prison escapee,

330
00:33:59,744 --> 00:34:05,124
as well as anyone who does not report such an act, will all be executed.

331
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:09,584
Thus, of course, the chief of the Royal Investigation Bureau, prison ward, executioners...

332
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:15,624
Roughly ten people will lose their precious life because of me.

333
00:34:17,624 --> 00:34:21,934
I am sure Orabeoni also will not go along with such a plan.

334
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:26,714
Will you truly not regret this decision?

335
00:34:26,714 --> 00:34:33,344
I am sure you came here already knowing what my answer would be.

336
00:34:49,384 --> 00:34:55,194
Eun Su, what did Minister Yu say to you?

337
00:35:00,564 --> 00:35:02,794
It is nothing.

338
00:35:15,784 --> 00:35:17,844
Your Majesty.

339
00:35:24,134 --> 00:35:30,664
Did you come because you were curious about what happened to the one you tossed aside?

340
00:35:33,544 --> 00:35:37,234
Kang Han Su paid me a visit.

341
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:40,094
Asking me to save Eun Su.

342
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:48,354
He must have thought I was the only one who could save her in all of Joseon.

343
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,934
Rather than the king.

344
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:19,844
Your Majesty.

345
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:30,254
It seems you went to Minister Yu and begged him.

346
00:36:36,184 --> 00:36:39,384
If you were going to beg, you should have pleaded with me!

347
00:36:39,384 --> 00:36:41,754
Pleading and persuading...

348
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:45,674
You should have done so with me.

349
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:50,904
Was not the answer already set to begin with?

350
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:55,784
The verdict could flip at any given point.

351
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:04,294
And you are the one who taught me that very fact.

352
00:37:06,634 --> 00:37:11,544
However... it is too late now.

353
00:37:30,744 --> 00:37:33,234
Come and watch it tomorrow.

354
00:37:59,774 --> 00:38:02,444
I made a mistake.

355
00:38:04,684 --> 00:38:10,104
Although I was his friend, I could not trust the king.

356
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:16,774
I was blinded by the sheer thought of wanting to save Eun Su.

357
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:23,994
Rather than the law, I pleaded with the power.

358
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,374
I cannot believe I made such a terrible move.

359
00:38:42,244 --> 00:38:44,214
It is my fault.

360
00:39:23,824 --> 00:39:25,814
The criminal penal code says

361
00:39:25,814 --> 00:39:32,704
the crime of adultery is charged if the involved parties are caught on the spot.

362
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:36,484
However, as for

363
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:39,914
Kim Yong Jae, Choi Heung Sun, and Lee Gun Woo,

364
00:39:39,914 --> 00:39:43,314
they were not captured on the spot, and there are no witnesses.

365
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:48,604
Their names were mentioned only by Heo Joong Sik, who was arrested for the murder in the beginning.

366
00:39:48,604 --> 00:39:54,004
It is highly possible they were falsely charged, so Heo could minimize his crime.

367
00:39:54,004 --> 00:39:56,154
As a result,

368
00:39:56,154 --> 00:40:02,094
Kim Yong Jae, Choi Heung Sun, Lee Gun Woo cannot be  criminally charged.

369
00:40:02,094 --> 00:40:04,254
Release these men.

370
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:08,104
 Your Majesty's grace is boundless!

371
00:40:11,594 --> 00:40:16,404
In spite of it all, adultery is committed in secret.

372
00:40:16,404 --> 00:40:21,054
There is a precedent where you are punished with evidence even if you were not caught on the spot.

373
00:40:21,054 --> 00:40:24,484
To the men whose crimes are clear as day due to the same tattoos they share with the girl,

374
00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:30,214
Jang Myeong Gi, Jang Yoon, Seo Byeong Ho, I order 100 floggings and exile them 2000 li away.

375
00:40:42,914 --> 00:40:47,674
Lastly, Kang, listen carefully.

376
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:54,374
The bond between a man and his wife is one of the three fundamental principles in human relations.

377
00:40:54,374 --> 00:40:58,674
It is no different than a relationship between king and subject, parents and children.

378
00:40:58,674 --> 00:41:02,934
However, you have behaved in a manner that damages the code of morality.

379
00:41:02,934 --> 00:41:09,524
Thus, you must be punished for that and will be sentenced to death.

380
00:41:22,144 --> 00:41:25,844
If you step forward here, everyone will die like a dog.

381
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,650
Read aloud the judgment.

382
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:04,754
Kang...

383
00:43:05,664 --> 00:43:11,604
committing the crime of adultery with many men

384
00:43:13,734 --> 00:43:15,644
is similar to...

385
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:20,854
betraying her husband

386
00:43:21,654 --> 00:43:23,564
and running away...

387
00:43:25,204 --> 00:43:29,054
to remarry right away.

388
00:43:39,424 --> 00:43:41,584
She will be...

389
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,734
executed by hanging.

390
00:44:49,444 --> 00:44:52,264
Help me rescue Eun Su.

391
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:56,854
I will give you tens and thousands in gold if I have to.

392
00:45:29,874 --> 00:45:32,694
You are Princess.

393
00:45:32,694 --> 00:45:34,754
Do you know me?

394
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:43,594
Since you were Minister Yu's person, I guess you must know me as your political enemy.

395
00:45:45,054 --> 00:45:50,704
I know you as someone who is cherished by the people I love.

396
00:45:51,714 --> 00:45:57,744
I was very curious to find out what kind of person you were.

397
00:45:57,744 --> 00:46:00,374
What do you think after meeting me?

398
00:46:02,954 --> 00:46:06,334
I want to become a princess.

399
00:46:06,334 --> 00:46:14,654
Then I can continue to live by the people I love.

400
00:46:14,654 --> 00:46:18,144
It sounds like you want to live.

401
00:46:18,974 --> 00:46:20,774
Is that right?

402
00:46:36,604 --> 00:46:38,334
I must meet His Majesty.

403
00:46:38,334 --> 00:46:40,804
It is a wrong verdict!

404
00:46:41,884 --> 00:46:47,274
How terrible His Majesty must feel for making such a bad move, knowing what the law says.

405
00:46:47,274 --> 00:46:49,874
What a loyal subject you are!

406
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:54,394
Princess Yeon Ju will save Eun Su.

407
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:03,584
I will try convincing Eun Su once again.

408
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:08,584
I will switch her with a dead body.

409
00:47:08,584 --> 00:47:12,364
But there is a risk of getting found out.

410
00:47:12,364 --> 00:47:14,354
That is why I am doing so.

411
00:47:14,354 --> 00:47:17,304
I only need to make time for Eun Su to run away.

412
00:47:17,304 --> 00:47:21,054
And I will be responsible for all of it.

413
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:32,504
Do you even know what you are talking about, Princess?

414
00:47:32,504 --> 00:47:34,064
Of course.

415
00:47:34,064 --> 00:47:37,934
I will be punished severely for aiding the escape of a death-row convict.

416
00:47:37,934 --> 00:47:41,204
I can even be deposed.

417
00:47:41,204 --> 00:47:46,184
At least, it has to come to that so that His Majesty will realize his error.

418
00:47:46,184 --> 00:47:48,204
More than anything,

419
00:47:49,154 --> 00:47:54,744
I cannot tolerate you repaying the debt you owe that family

420
00:47:54,744 --> 00:47:58,144
over something like this, Your Excellency.

421
00:47:59,274 --> 00:48:05,684
I am sure there is a more severe punishment suitable for what you have done.

422
00:48:24,544 --> 00:48:27,744
Change into this and follow Dong Chi.

423
00:48:27,744 --> 00:48:31,214
No one will stop the princess.

424
00:48:39,644 --> 00:48:42,934
In order to save my life,

425
00:48:42,934 --> 00:48:47,094
I cannot let Orabeoni live the rest of his life as a fugitive.

426
00:48:48,364 --> 00:48:52,304
Because Father passed away after being falsely accused,

427
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:55,004
Orabeoni's life was destroyed.

428
00:48:55,004 --> 00:48:58,604
How can I make him live in hiding with me?

429
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:04,884
I will confidently receive the punishment for my crime.

430
00:49:04,884 --> 00:49:08,024
The king also promised me.

431
00:49:08,024 --> 00:49:11,654
A promise? From the king?

432
00:49:13,554 --> 00:49:18,324
Your Majesty, they say the spirit of the one who died unfairly cannot go to the afterlife

433
00:49:18,324 --> 00:49:23,054
but must wander the world beyond the grave and hurt people

434
00:49:23,054 --> 00:49:25,614
or cause natural disasters.

435
00:49:25,614 --> 00:49:31,784
Thus, the kings of the old listened to the bitterness of the people.

436
00:49:31,784 --> 00:49:34,284
Are you threatening me right now?

437
00:49:34,284 --> 00:49:37,264
I am saying that it is up to you

438
00:49:37,264 --> 00:49:45,774
whether this immoral girl dies with resentments or not, Your Majesty.

439
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:52,864
So, Your Majesty, please become a strong and benevolent king

440
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:56,524
and drive out treacherous subjects like Minister Yu

441
00:49:56,524 --> 00:50:02,274
and relieve the resentment of the people who suffered in pain because of him.

442
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:06,884
If you would promise me that,

443
00:50:09,204 --> 00:50:16,274
I will... gladly step over the threshold into the afterlife.

444
00:50:46,984 --> 00:50:49,004
I understand you full well.

445
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:52,344
However, I cannot give into this as far as this is concerned.

446
00:50:54,144 --> 00:50:58,164
Your parents suffered unjust death like that.

447
00:50:58,164 --> 00:51:04,764
And if you die this way, too... how about Kang Han Su?

448
00:51:06,134 --> 00:51:09,284
How would he go on living?

449
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:15,084
I will protect you and your brother somehow.

450
00:51:16,154 --> 00:51:18,614
Even if I have to kill Minister Yu.

451
00:51:22,864 --> 00:51:29,984
You must truly love... my brother, Princess.

452
00:51:32,154 --> 00:51:34,054
I understand.

453
00:51:34,054 --> 00:51:38,264
Except I have one request.

454
00:51:38,264 --> 00:51:39,664
What is it?

455
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:43,344
Please get me one thing from my house.

456
00:51:43,344 --> 00:51:46,324
It is something I must give to my brother.

457
00:51:46,324 --> 00:51:50,414
Will you go there yourself, Princess?

458
00:51:50,414 --> 00:51:52,944
I will be right back.

459
00:52:11,584 --> 00:52:14,824
My guys will start fires at the execution site and various spots in the market

460
00:52:14,824 --> 00:52:17,764
and disperse the troops and create chaos.

461
00:52:17,764 --> 00:52:20,724
At that moment, if Dong Chi and Chu Sal take down the executioner,

462
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:23,224
I will rescue Eun Su.

463
00:52:24,024 --> 00:52:25,804
 Kang Han Su!

464
00:52:33,314 --> 00:52:37,604
E-Eun Su! E-E-Eun Su!

465
00:52:37,604 --> 00:52:39,504
E-Eun Su...

466
00:52:58,254 --> 00:53:02,624
C-Call... Call the p-physician! Hurry!

467
00:53:07,524 --> 00:53:09,114
No!

468
00:53:09,114 --> 00:53:11,524
- Orabeoni.
- Yes.

469
00:53:11,524 --> 00:53:13,834
It was...

470
00:53:16,414 --> 00:53:18,474
so nice to see you again.

471
00:53:18,474 --> 00:53:21,604
No, do not speak. Do not speak.

472
00:53:21,604 --> 00:53:25,044
Do not speak. Do not...

473
00:53:25,814 --> 00:53:27,924
I am so...

474
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:32,864
proud of you, Orabeoni.

475
00:53:32,864 --> 00:53:35,864
No, Eun Su! Do not speak! No.

476
00:53:35,864 --> 00:53:39,214
What are you doing! Hurry up!

477
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,464
Young Master.

478
00:53:51,864 --> 00:53:54,434
Thank you for everything.

479
00:53:56,584 --> 00:53:58,904
Throughout those difficult years...

480
00:53:59,614 --> 00:54:02,544
because I was able to be with you...

481
00:54:04,434 --> 00:54:09,024
I was able to breathe.

482
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:18,724
Do not. Do not speak. No...

483
00:54:21,144 --> 00:54:25,104
No. hold on a little longer. A little longer.

484
00:54:32,624 --> 00:54:36,784
 I am leaving you this letter for only one reason.

485
00:54:38,364 --> 00:54:46,114
 Because I do not want my death to become another grudge for you, Orabeoni.

486
00:54:48,634 --> 00:54:50,484
 Orabeoni,

487
00:54:51,284 --> 00:54:58,224
 do you remember the last conversation we had before I went off to get married?

488
00:55:07,344 --> 00:55:10,214
Orabeoni, what is your dream?

489
00:55:11,014 --> 00:55:14,124
You know it already. To become rich.

490
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:15,774
How about you?

491
00:55:16,764 --> 00:55:19,414
To live like a human being.

492
00:55:20,524 --> 00:55:23,004
What is living like a human being?

493
00:55:23,004 --> 00:55:28,194
Respect your parents, get along with your siblings, and be loyal to the king.

494
00:55:28,194 --> 00:55:30,544
The three fundamental principles in human relations. That?

495
00:55:30,544 --> 00:55:34,564
It would be good to keep all of those.

496
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:39,394
But I will keep two letters in my heart.

497
00:55:39,394 --> 00:55:41,234
Two letters?

498
00:55:41,234 --> 00:55:43,274
Bo Eun.(repay kindness).

499
00:55:44,544 --> 00:55:48,094
I will live as someone who knows how to repay good grace.

500
00:55:48,704 --> 00:55:53,954
That is why I mustered up the courage to marry someone I have not even met.

501
00:55:55,754 --> 00:56:02,234
Because the kindness I need to repay first is to my parents.

502
00:56:03,674 --> 00:56:06,714
 It was the same for Minister Yu.

503
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:14,584
 He provided kindness to me and that is why I wanted to repay him.

504
00:56:14,584 --> 00:56:17,024
 So, I trusted him.

505
00:56:17,754 --> 00:56:20,214
 I know how foolish I was.

506
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:22,654
 But Orabeoni...

507
00:56:26,284 --> 00:56:28,454
 I do not regret it.

508
00:56:29,604 --> 00:56:32,564
 I just feel bad for you, Orabeoni.

509
00:57:43,204 --> 00:57:45,334
 Orabeoni.

510
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:51,664
 Do you remember the magnolia tree in our backyard?

511
00:57:53,174 --> 00:57:58,994
 We said it resembled the stars in the night sky when it was in full bloom.

512
00:58:00,214 --> 00:58:05,194
 When a person dies, they supposedly become a star.

513
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,614
 But I will become a magnolia.

514
00:58:08,614 --> 00:58:15,464
 I will bloom every year like a star and come see you, Orabeoni.

515
00:58:17,174 --> 00:58:19,564
 So, Orabeoni...

516
00:58:21,234 --> 00:58:23,654
 do not cry because of me.

517
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:31,834
 We will meet every spring.

518
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,100

519
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,004
 Orabeoni!

520
00:58:39,004 --> 00:58:41,544
 You came! What took you so long?

521
00:58:41,544 --> 00:58:43,284
 Everyone is waiting for you.

522
00:58:43,284 --> 00:58:45,274
 What are you doing? Hurry up and come.

523
00:58:45,274 --> 00:58:48,054
 Mom made your favorite anchovy noodles.

524
00:58:48,054 --> 00:58:49,754
 Hurry in!

525
00:59:00,394 --> 00:59:02,124
 Are you hungry?

526
00:59:02,124 --> 00:59:04,334
 You came.

527
00:59:05,604 --> 00:59:07,644
 Mother.

528
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:12,224
 Why do only Orabeoni's noodles have egg strips? Why?

529
00:59:12,224 --> 00:59:16,114
 He has not even gotten married yet. I feel sorry for him.

530
00:59:16,114 --> 00:59:19,714
 What in the world? It is because of his bad temper.

531
00:59:19,714 --> 00:59:21,584
 No! Let us switch it! Let us switch!

532
00:59:21,584 --> 00:59:24,354
 Now, now, here. Here you go.

533
00:59:24,354 --> 00:59:26,594
 There. Happy now?

534
00:59:26,594 --> 00:59:29,064
 Of course, you are the best, Father.

535
00:59:29,064 --> 00:59:31,054
 Look at you.

536
00:59:31,054 --> 00:59:33,604
 Orabeoni, why do you not join us?

537
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:35,724
 Let us hurry up and eat. I am starving.

538
00:59:35,724 --> 00:59:38,304
 Hurry up and come.

539
01:02:30,744 --> 01:02:34,934
You must have been very fond of her.

540
01:02:34,934 --> 01:02:40,264
Yes. She was very intelligent and beautiful.

541
01:02:40,264 --> 01:02:42,934
She was very submissive as well.

542
01:02:46,364 --> 01:02:52,734
 I am sure you came here already knowing what my answer would be.

543
01:02:52,734 --> 01:02:58,714
Then, before your brother behaves hastily,

544
01:02:58,714 --> 01:03:02,354
you will have to make a decision first.

545
01:03:05,964 --> 01:03:08,924
You had left it behind in my house.

546
01:03:15,884 --> 01:03:23,184
Please take good care of her, so she will have an easy passage into eternity.

547
01:03:48,414 --> 01:03:52,384
Kim Yong Jae, Choi Heung Sun, Lee Gun Woo.

548
01:03:52,384 --> 01:03:57,464
They all confessed to committing adultery with the same woman.

549
01:03:57,464 --> 01:04:00,814
But since there was no evidence to support their claim,

550
01:04:00,814 --> 01:04:03,374
Kim Yong Jae will be reinstated as a deputy in the Office of Inspector General,

551
01:04:03,374 --> 01:04:06,254
Choi Heung Sun will be reinstated as an official at the Ministry of Finance,

552
01:04:06,254 --> 01:04:09,964
Lee Gun Woo will be reinstated as a deputy minister of the Ministry of Commerce.

553
01:04:09,964 --> 01:04:12,514
Thus, dedicate your mind and body to your work.

554
01:04:14,274 --> 01:04:18,684
Appointing a person to a position should not be taken lightly,

555
01:04:18,684 --> 01:04:25,104
and if a person renews himself by changing his erroneous ways, that person could be reinstated.

556
01:04:25,104 --> 01:04:29,544
If a person is not utilized for life due to a small error in his past,

557
01:04:29,544 --> 01:04:32,174
how could he not have a heart of complaint?

558
01:04:32,174 --> 01:04:34,214
A small error?

559
01:04:34,214 --> 01:04:36,604
The woman who was connected to them lost her life.

560
01:04:36,604 --> 01:04:41,954
But those men not only retain their lives but are reinstated.

561
01:04:41,954 --> 01:04:44,464
It is utterly unreasonable!

562
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:47,134
Please reconsider this matter.

563
01:04:48,804 --> 01:04:50,774
I disapprove of your request.

564
01:05:56,634 --> 01:06:01,484
 Throughout those difficult years, because I was able to be with you...

565
01:06:02,204 --> 01:06:06,724
 I was able to breathe.

566
01:06:14,094 --> 01:06:20,004
How could she suffer from anxiety for so long and so seriously?

567
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:24,074
It is understandable.

568
01:06:25,494 --> 01:06:27,584
It is all my fault.

569
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:34,224
It is because I did not serve the princess well.

570
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:40,794
Please... get well soon.

571
01:06:40,794 --> 01:06:46,034
Please... hurry and get well.

572
01:06:49,684 --> 01:06:52,154
All right.

573
01:06:52,154 --> 01:06:55,854
Han Su, let us eat.

574
01:07:23,224 --> 01:07:25,694
 Orabeoni.

575
01:08:07,634 --> 01:08:12,404
Princess, you still have a fever. Please rest a bit longer.

576
01:08:12,404 --> 01:08:16,224
I am okay. I should get up now.

577
01:08:56,944 --> 01:08:59,094
Princess.

578
01:09:01,734 --> 01:09:04,244
We have the date.

579
01:09:05,984 --> 01:09:11,654
Will you... please marry me?

580
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:32,730

581
01:09:39,764 --> 01:09:43,754
 We worked with animal experts for scenes involving animals for their safety.

582
01:09:47,314 --> 01:09:49,984
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

583
01:09:51,394 --> 01:09:56,314
 I am elated to deliver such good news to you all.

584
01:09:56,314 --> 01:09:59,384
 Congratulations, Your Highness!

585
01:10:00,474 --> 01:10:02,884
 I am aware it is not what you want.

586
01:10:02,884 --> 01:10:07,204
 But I truly love Princess.

587
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:11,454
 There is nothing wrong with having feelings of love for her.

588
01:10:11,454 --> 01:10:15,734
 Princess Yeon Ju found out about Legal Officer Kang.

589
01:10:16,594 --> 01:10:22,354
 I believe everyone will... work together once again.

590
01:10:22,354 --> 01:10:24,174
 Princess!

591
01:10:24,174 --> 01:10:25,164
 Princess!

592
01:10:25,164 --> 01:10:27,184
 This is a good thing.

593
01:10:27,184 --> 01:10:29,154
 Just use me

594
01:10:29,154 --> 01:10:31,554
 however you would like.
