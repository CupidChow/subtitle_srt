Jeong Wol.

3
00:00:06,263 --> 00:00:07,733
Come here.

4
00:00:08,803 --> 00:00:10,402
Come over here.

5
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:14,032
Gosh, that startled me.

6
00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:15,872
Darn it.

7
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:18,113
Darn it.

8
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:21,113
Goodness, my lord!

9
00:00:21,343 --> 00:00:22,543
My lord!

10
00:00:23,012 --> 00:00:24,342
There is trouble.

11
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:26,213
- What? - There is trouble.

12
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:27,652
Outside.

13
00:00:27,713 --> 00:00:29,052
There is trouble outside.

14
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:31,652
- Good grief. - Goodness.

15
00:00:31,793 --> 00:00:32,923
Fine.

16
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:38,762
You have killed someone?

17
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:40,293
Hence,

18
00:00:40,293 --> 00:00:42,003
you came to be punished?

19
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:44,972
Yes, but before I am punished,

20
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:47,372
I have one request to make.

21
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:50,472
You are a murderer, yet you dare to make a request?

22
00:00:52,213 --> 00:00:53,512
Please let her speak.

23
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:56,083
Goodness.

24
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,952
Court Lady Hong, what brings you this far?

25
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:00,982
I believe you wish to say you are happy to see me.

26
00:01:00,982 --> 00:01:03,482
Yes, of course, I am.

27
00:01:03,723 --> 00:01:06,323
You were once the court lady who served the late King.

28
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:08,092
It is the honour of my family...

29
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:09,862
to have you here today!

30
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:11,493
In that case,

31
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:12,862
for my sake,

32
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:16,663
please take a listen to this woman's request.

33
00:01:17,262 --> 00:01:18,333
Pardon?

34
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:20,803
That is...

35
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:23,103
You should hear out her story.

36
00:01:23,103 --> 00:01:24,372
Goodness.

37
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,043
Who do you think you are?

38
00:01:26,642 --> 00:01:29,383
I am the assistant of the attorney who took on her case,

39
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:30,782
So Won.

40
00:01:31,312 --> 00:01:32,952
An attorney?

41
00:01:32,952 --> 00:01:34,312
She is with me,

42
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:36,752
a girl who is...

43
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:38,853
deeply adored by the Princess.

44
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:41,693
Goodness, I see.

45
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,862
If you still want to know,

46
00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:53,532
leave quietly.

47
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:58,142
Were you aware of everything?

48
00:01:58,213 --> 00:01:59,343
Then,

49
00:02:00,212 --> 00:02:02,242
I will tell you everything.

50
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:18,593
Han Soo.

51
00:02:19,163 --> 00:02:20,633
Did that old man notice?

52
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:23,633
- Let us go for now. - My lord!

53
00:02:23,663 --> 00:02:25,702
Dong Chi! We are here!

54
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:29,943
She confessed her crime, then came to the site immediately.

55
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:31,242
They will check the old woman's body...

56
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:33,172
and begin the investigation as soon as the day breaks.

57
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:37,612
I do not wish to run away!

58
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:43,383
I cannot let my child live in hiding because of me.

59
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:55,403
Please help me, Attorney Kang!

60
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:58,073
Please help my child and me.

61
00:02:58,732 --> 00:03:00,432
I plead you.

62
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:52,123
Do not kneel down like this again.

63
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:54,093
You are not a criminal.

64
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:56,593
Put your trust only in me from now on.

65
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,633
I will make sure you live.

66
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:21,953
Will you really begin this journey?

67
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,492
I do not want to be someone just like you.

68
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:39,132
(Episode 6: The Brutal History of Cheongsan 2)

69
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:44,172
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

70
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,112
Gosh, my back.

71
00:04:58,353 --> 00:05:00,223
You are insane.

72
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:03,422
Do you not want to know what the village head knows?

73
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:05,732
To be frank, we do not even know...

74
00:05:05,732 --> 00:05:07,932
if you can save that woman!

75
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,163
You are right.

76
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:11,432
I must be insane.

77
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:13,403
I mean, unless I was insane,

78
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:14,942
I would not be here doing this...

79
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,942
because we could get beheaded if we got caught doing this.

80
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,913
Beheaded?

81
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,312
Do not dream of stopping.

82
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:23,742
If I am caught, I will blame you for this.

83
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:25,612
What?

84
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:26,653
Look.

85
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:28,122
You dug up much more than I did.

86
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:33,922
Kang Han Soo!

87
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:36,763
I will bury you.

88
00:05:37,723 --> 00:05:39,093
Wait!

89
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:40,333
Stop that!

90
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:42,002
- Darn you! - Wait, I am serious.

91
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:43,263
Wait, look.

92
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:52,413
Start digging.

93
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:55,013
The cause of Seo Chang Soo's death was battery.

94
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:56,882
The impact was made on his chest, the pressure point.

95
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:58,812
(Pressure point: Areas of the body vital to a person's life)

96
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:03,182
His left shin and the top of his left foot are sunken.

97
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:06,953
His knee and ankle bones on the left are hurt and sunken,

98
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,192
but these are not fatal to his life.

99
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:18,703
There is a 10cm dark red wound on the pit of his stomach.

100
00:06:20,932 --> 00:06:22,742
This must have been the fatal blow.

101
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:29,083
It is just as his wife said.

102
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:32,812
Why would she lie about this?

103
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:36,422
If she had, I would have had a reason to turn down this lawsuit.

104
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,192
I knew it. You acted all heroic and mighty,

105
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:44,122
but you could not pass the village head's offer.

106
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:48,163
Were you going to turn down her case if the result...

107
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:50,132
of the postmortem was different from her words?

108
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:52,732
Half and half.

109
00:06:54,002 --> 00:06:55,703
Anyhow, write it down and keep it with you.

110
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:57,742
That is the most crucial evidence to find the real culprit.

111
00:06:57,973 --> 00:07:01,242
This will not count as evidence because we dug up his body.

112
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:02,713
Where are you going?

113
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,312
You have to bury him!

114
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:07,013
Do I have to do this alone?

115
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:09,723
Han Soo!

116
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:15,562
Goodness, how smelly.

117
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:18,963
All right.

118
00:07:20,893 --> 00:07:23,232
Who is going to Hanyang?

119
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,632
I would like to hire the fastest one.

120
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:31,172
Me.

121
00:07:39,953 --> 00:07:41,083
No!

122
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,682
- Wait! - Come.

123
00:07:42,682 --> 00:07:45,153
What is going on? My lord!

124
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:46,853
Stop right there!

125
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:49,293
- Stop right there! - Get him!

126
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:50,992
Stop right there!

127
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:01,572
- What is going on? - Step aside.

128
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:06,143
Come with us.

129
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:12,913
How can you accept this case?

130
00:08:12,953 --> 00:08:14,382
I had no choice!

131
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:16,882
I suddenly had guests from Hanyang,

132
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:18,322
so there are people watching.

133
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:21,663
I must conduct an investigation even if it is just a formality,

134
00:08:21,663 --> 00:08:23,462
so you must think of a way...

135
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,533
before the provincial governor arrives.

136
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:28,192
Either kill her...

137
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:30,863
or let her live.

138
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:47,812
So tell me what we must do now.

139
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:49,153
One.

140
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,192
In Joseon, it is tolerated for a child and a husband...

141
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:54,962
to get personal retaliation for one's parents or wife.

142
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:56,163
Two.

143
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:58,993
The decision of a murder case is solely made by His Majesty.

144
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,263
So we must convince His Majesty...

145
00:09:02,263 --> 00:09:05,503
that she murdered the old woman to get her husband's revenge?

146
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:08,602
However, it does come with a few particular terms.

147
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:10,373
They had to have witnessed the crime in action,

148
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:11,942
and the retaliation must be made within the day.

149
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:13,972
The decision usually reflects the precedents.

150
00:09:14,143 --> 00:09:15,483
I did not know...

151
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:18,383
personal retaliation was allowed by the law.

152
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:21,653
If I saw my family dying right before my eyes,

153
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:23,682
I'd go and murder him right away.

154
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:25,253
Well,

155
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:29,893
we'll have to deal with it for compassion, at least.

156
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,962
But strictly speaking,

157
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:36,033
the new groom was beaten to death by the men.

158
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:37,903
Not because of the old woman.

159
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:41,273
There wouldn't have been a fight if it weren't for the old lady.

160
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:45,043
Can you prove that her false rumours started the fight?

161
00:09:45,273 --> 00:09:46,643
The involved people would know.

162
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:49,743
But they would never testify for the new bride.

163
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:51,952
They could be arrested for murder if they did.

164
00:09:55,222 --> 00:09:59,052
And we have to pull off such an impossible mission.

165
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:05,293
Bring it in.

166
00:10:08,263 --> 00:10:10,133
- Gosh. - First, Dong Chi.

167
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:13,373
- What? - I brought drinks.

168
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:16,243
You can concentrate on making one of them betray them.

169
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:24,783
Come on. They were born and raised here...

170
00:10:24,783 --> 00:10:26,712
and have been friends their whole lives.

171
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:27,952
They would never betray each other.

172
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:29,023
Loyalty?

173
00:10:29,783 --> 00:10:32,092
That's because they've never been tested.

174
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:33,253
Things are different now.

175
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:35,592
A person has died.

176
00:10:36,263 --> 00:10:37,623
Another one might die.

177
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:40,293
What makes you think that you are not next?

178
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:43,733
We have to give them that anxiety...

179
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,102
and stimulate it.

180
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,202
We have to go now!

181
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:48,672
Stop.

182
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:51,743
If we do not talk first,

183
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:53,743
we'll take all the blame!

184
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:55,143
So, you are saying...

185
00:10:55,712 --> 00:10:58,983
that I must betray them first...

186
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:02,822
before they betray me?

187
00:11:03,952 --> 00:11:05,822
- Goodness. - Oh, my.

188
00:11:08,962 --> 00:11:10,922
All the other guys confessed.

189
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:12,393
They all came clean.

190
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:15,302
You will take all the blame if you do nothing.

191
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:17,003
See?

192
00:11:17,003 --> 00:11:19,233
Did I not tell you?

193
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:20,702
Liar.

194
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:22,743
You are lying.

195
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:25,072
He and Chun Sam would never do that.

196
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:31,212
The new groom's fatal blow...

197
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:34,253
The fatal blow to the pit of his stomach led him to his death.

198
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:36,722
How would I know this if I were lying?

199
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:39,793
- How did you... - See?

200
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:42,422
I know because they told me.

201
00:12:12,322 --> 00:12:13,322
Gosh.

202
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:24,663
Goodness.

203
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,212
Like this...

204
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:42,123
Whatever.

205
00:12:53,263 --> 00:12:54,363
Have you stayed up?

206
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:56,202
The noise woke me up.

207
00:12:58,332 --> 00:12:59,903
You can be honest with me.

208
00:13:00,302 --> 00:13:01,773
Say that you were worried about me.

209
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:04,102
No, you can be honest with me.

210
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:05,513
Say that it hurts when it hurts.

211
00:13:10,483 --> 00:13:11,743
That hurts.

212
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:13,312
What a crybaby.

213
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:14,913
Well, you told me to say it.

214
00:13:33,672 --> 00:13:34,802
Here.

215
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:37,472
What is this?

216
00:13:37,702 --> 00:13:38,842
It is cheongsimhwan, the calming pill.

217
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:41,243
I am sure you were startled.

218
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:44,582
All these things must be new to you.

219
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:48,352
Are you giving me the pain and the pill?

220
00:13:48,352 --> 00:13:50,523
You might run away if I only give you the pain.

221
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:53,952
"Now, I need you."

222
00:13:53,952 --> 00:13:56,293
"I want you to officially work with me." Is that what you mean?

223
00:13:57,623 --> 00:13:58,692
Well...

224
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:02,202
How about we share it? As a sign of promise.

225
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:05,432
"Promise?"

226
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:11,373
If we share it...

227
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:36,003
No! This is wrong.

228
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:38,263
This is not a date shared at a wedding.

229
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:42,543
I believe that two different people coming together...

230
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:44,102
to work for one common goal is...

231
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:46,572
as important as a wedding.

232
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:53,013
If this is your way of forcing yourself in...

233
00:14:53,013 --> 00:14:55,422
to take my bride's position...

234
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,623
We just made a promise...

235
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:04,393
to be each other's cheongsimhwan...

236
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:06,533
and to be always there for each other.

237
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:19,712
Sure.

238
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:26,052
It is a promise.

239
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:53,712
Congratulations on passing first in the state exam.

240
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:11,623
Hence, I plan to carry on without getting caught.

241
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:14,462
Therefore, treat me as a stranger from now on.

242
00:16:15,163 --> 00:16:18,663
Princess Yeon Joo, what are you up to?

243
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:23,702
What is your relationship with that attorney?

244
00:16:29,283 --> 00:16:30,312
Magistrate Yoo.

245
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:33,182
They have caught the true murderer of Park Jae Soo.

246
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,483
What?

247
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:41,592
Get the soldiers ready.

248
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:42,822
Yes, Magistrate.

249
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:00,773
Bring it on, scum.

250
00:18:44,243 --> 00:18:45,812
Today, they will send a messenger...

251
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:48,213
to report to the provincial governor.

252
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:21,652
Go keep watch on the road.

253
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:23,983
Do whatever it takes...

254
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:26,023
to stop the messenger.

255
00:20:15,332 --> 00:20:18,273
The messenger was attacked on the way to the provincial governor.

256
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:22,243
Those villagers are so fearless.

257
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:23,683
They even stopped the messenger?

258
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:26,683
- What about the report? - It was on the ground in pieces.

259
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:33,892
It will take forever to have the county governor write it again.

260
00:20:34,723 --> 00:20:37,392
It might be better if someone meets the provincial governor in person...

261
00:20:37,392 --> 00:20:40,092
and lets him know about the situation.

262
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:41,793
Yoon, you are up.

263
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:43,463
Yes, my lady.

264
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:46,832
We are doomed for real.

265
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:49,743
What will you do now?

266
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:08,223
Is everyone gathered?

267
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:09,622
Yes, Father.

268
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:11,993
Good. Let us go.

269
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:17,362
I guess they want to bury this case...

270
00:21:17,362 --> 00:21:19,332
before the provincial governor comes.

271
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:27,473
- Let us go. - Go where?

272
00:21:27,473 --> 00:21:29,412
Where in the middle of having dinner?

273
00:21:29,683 --> 00:21:30,943
Young Sil is in danger.

274
00:21:57,203 --> 00:21:59,173
Drag that wench out!

275
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:01,213
- Drag her out! - Drag her out!

276
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:07,352
- Drag her out! - Drag her out!

277
00:22:09,283 --> 00:22:11,023
Stay somewhere safe, my lord.

278
00:22:11,783 --> 00:22:13,923
Gosh, those bumpkins.

279
00:22:13,993 --> 00:22:16,023
- Drag her out! - Drag her out!

280
00:22:16,223 --> 00:22:19,392
- Drag her out! - Drag her out!

281
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:00,233
- Oh, dear. - Drag her out!

282
00:23:34,703 --> 00:23:35,943
Go. Quickly now.

283
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:39,142
- Gosh. - Goodness.

284
00:23:41,572 --> 00:23:42,943
- What is going on? - Well...

285
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:45,142
Dong Chi, go to the tavern.

286
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,582
You know what to do there.

287
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:48,183
Tell us what this is about.

288
00:23:48,183 --> 00:23:49,382
Just follow me.

289
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,263
It is time to discipline her.

290
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:06,973
Drag her here.

291
00:24:07,173 --> 00:24:08,473
Please do not kill me!

292
00:24:09,372 --> 00:24:10,973
Please do not kill me, Village Head!

293
00:24:11,673 --> 00:24:12,872
Please...

294
00:24:15,013 --> 00:24:16,342
So,

295
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:19,142
you should have left when I let you.

296
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:22,852
I will not show another mercy.

297
00:24:24,152 --> 00:24:25,322
Hang her.

298
00:24:25,683 --> 00:24:27,392
I am pregnant.

299
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:30,023
- Please do not kill me. - She is with child?

300
00:24:30,023 --> 00:24:31,162
She is pregnant?

301
00:24:31,162 --> 00:24:32,662
- What? - Unbelievable.

302
00:24:36,263 --> 00:24:41,733
- Hang her! - Hang her!

303
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:49,582
- Hang her! - Hang her!

304
00:24:49,582 --> 00:24:51,342
Hang her!

305
00:24:51,543 --> 00:24:53,412
Hang her.

306
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:55,513
Hang her.

307
00:24:55,923 --> 00:24:57,582
Hang her.

308
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,753
Hang her.

309
00:25:00,193 --> 00:25:01,753
Hang her.

310
00:25:02,193 --> 00:25:04,892
She should be hung.

311
00:25:09,602 --> 00:25:12,332
What are you doing here again? You're an outsider.

312
00:25:13,402 --> 00:25:14,933
Do not disturb us, and get lost.

313
00:25:15,203 --> 00:25:16,703
- Come on. - Who is he to tell us...

314
00:25:16,703 --> 00:25:18,243
what to do with our own village?

315
00:25:18,572 --> 00:25:20,543
- Tell me about it. - Unbelievable.

316
00:25:20,543 --> 00:25:23,312
Do not call me an outsider. It hurts my feelings.

317
00:25:23,543 --> 00:25:25,683
Call me an attorney,

318
00:25:25,783 --> 00:25:27,382
not an outsider.

319
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:30,453
And my client is this woman right here.

320
00:25:31,652 --> 00:25:35,023
So I need to know why you are punishing her only.

321
00:25:37,392 --> 00:25:39,693
According to our village's rules,

322
00:25:40,193 --> 00:25:41,993
whoever causes disorder...

323
00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:44,802
must be punished by being hung on a tree.

324
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:50,703
Then what was the punishment for that matchmaker granny?

325
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:52,943
What?

326
00:25:53,513 --> 00:25:55,243
What nonsense are you saying?

327
00:25:55,773 --> 00:25:57,582
A victim does not deserve any kind of punishment.

328
00:25:57,943 --> 00:26:00,912
You should not turn a blind eye like that, sir.

329
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:05,852
What are they doing?

330
00:26:06,753 --> 00:26:08,923
- What are they doing? - What?

331
00:26:10,122 --> 00:26:11,723
Every villager here...

332
00:26:11,723 --> 00:26:14,332
knows the story behind Young Sil.

333
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:18,062
No matter how wronged she was,

334
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:21,902
we must not neglect the fact that she killed a person...

335
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:24,043
with a hoe in broad daylight.

336
00:26:38,183 --> 00:26:41,693
So you also knew she was wronged.

337
00:26:42,822 --> 00:26:44,463
What?

338
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:48,332
Everyone probably knew...

339
00:26:48,632 --> 00:26:50,733
that the rumour came...

340
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:52,703
from the untrustworthy matchmaker granny.

341
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:56,072
At first, you must have felt bad for her,

342
00:26:56,072 --> 00:27:00,243
thinking she was unlucky to be involved with that spiteful granny.

343
00:27:00,612 --> 00:27:02,513
But eventually, as time passed,

344
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:04,642
you must've put the sympathy aside...

345
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:06,213
and enjoyed badmouthing her...

346
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:09,052
even when you knew it was not true.

347
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:11,622
Why?

348
00:27:12,953 --> 00:27:15,253
Why? Tell me.

349
00:27:15,253 --> 00:27:17,162
Why did you do that?

350
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:20,862
Guys, tell me why!

351
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,362
Why did you do it?

352
00:27:27,802 --> 00:27:29,003
Because it was...

353
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:31,342
not your business.

354
00:27:34,273 --> 00:27:35,973
I bet it was fun.

355
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:40,152
This village is located in a barren land...

356
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:42,552
where you must constantly work to put food on the table.

357
00:27:44,582 --> 00:27:47,352
So rumours about other people...

358
00:27:47,352 --> 00:27:51,193
definitely give a thrill to your boring routine.

359
00:27:52,592 --> 00:27:54,132
Is it true?

360
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:56,562
- The rumour about the newlywed wife. - The newlywed wife?

361
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:59,362
This wench is crazy.

362
00:27:59,632 --> 00:28:01,933
She is crazy about men.

363
00:28:07,243 --> 00:28:08,473
That was...

364
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:11,642
when elders like the village head...

365
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:15,082
were truly needed.

366
00:28:20,723 --> 00:28:22,753
But how did you know, Village Head?

367
00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:27,463
Village Head. Please, I beg you.

368
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:30,302
I am scared my husband...

369
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:32,632
might come to know of it at this rate.

370
00:28:32,872 --> 00:28:34,773
Good grief.

371
00:28:35,802 --> 00:28:37,872
Did the rumour grow that big?

372
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:43,812
But are you sure that rumour is groundless?

373
00:28:48,382 --> 00:28:49,382
Excuse me?

374
00:28:50,183 --> 00:28:53,092
Where there is smoke, there is fire.

375
00:28:54,253 --> 00:28:56,122
And it has always been proven right.

376
00:29:00,362 --> 00:29:03,033
- What is going on? - Oh, my goodness.

377
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,003
- I knew the rumour was true. - Good grief.

378
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:07,503
- Did I not tell you? - Unbelievable.

379
00:29:07,503 --> 00:29:09,233
- How could they? - Goodness.

380
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:16,072
Back then...

381
00:29:19,513 --> 00:29:22,882
Good grief. What a filthy family.

382
00:29:28,223 --> 00:29:30,723
Had you not turned a blind eye...

383
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:34,293
Had you taken our side and fought together...

384
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,203
Had you done those,

385
00:29:39,973 --> 00:29:41,933
we would not have run away,

386
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,243
taken our own lives,

387
00:29:46,372 --> 00:29:48,743
or terribly killed a person.

388
00:29:50,543 --> 00:29:53,253
We would have found a different way.

389
00:29:53,713 --> 00:29:56,183
How dare you run your mouth?

390
00:29:56,953 --> 00:30:01,052
Are you saying that the cause of the incidents is me?

391
00:30:02,152 --> 00:30:03,862
Do you not have too much authority...

392
00:30:03,862 --> 00:30:06,862
compared to your qualifications and abilities?

393
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,802
For the village head to control a human being's life and death.

394
00:30:12,402 --> 00:30:14,503
You are challenging the deity's realm.

395
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,142
Oh, or...

396
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:20,642
at the very least, coveting the King's role.

397
00:30:23,412 --> 00:30:24,783
And that is...

398
00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:29,483
what we call a traitorous mind.

399
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:34,822
Kang Han Soo!

400
00:30:34,822 --> 00:30:36,923
- What was that? - "Kang Han Soo?"

401
00:30:37,223 --> 00:30:39,832
- Is he that Kang Han Soo? - It seems like it.

402
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:42,062
- "Kang Han Soo?" - He is that boy?

403
00:30:42,062 --> 00:30:43,933
- Did I hear him right? - Goodness.

404
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:46,273
- Oh, my gosh. - Why did he come here?

405
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:49,173
Look at what that traitorous mind has done.

406
00:30:49,743 --> 00:30:51,673
An old woman was murdered in broad daylight,

407
00:30:51,673 --> 00:30:54,213
and there is a murderer among the villagers now.

408
00:30:55,773 --> 00:30:57,382
Oh, right.

409
00:30:57,382 --> 00:30:59,953
Why are you not judging the murderer who beat the newlywed's groom,

410
00:30:59,953 --> 00:31:02,253
Chang Soo, to death here in this place of discipline?

411
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:22,632
Choi Jae Sik!

412
00:31:24,302 --> 00:31:26,173
Come forth and receive punishment!

413
00:31:26,943 --> 00:31:28,743
Why are you pinning it only on my husband?

414
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:30,443
Three men beat him together.

415
00:31:31,513 --> 00:31:34,112
But the main culprit is your husband, Choi Jae Sik.

416
00:31:36,152 --> 00:31:38,723
Who in the world spouted such nonsense?

417
00:31:40,592 --> 00:31:41,652
Who do you think it was?

418
00:31:44,592 --> 00:31:45,892
Chang Soo.

419
00:31:46,223 --> 00:31:49,062
The fatal blow to the pit of his stomach led him to his death.

420
00:31:50,003 --> 00:31:51,963
How would I know this if I were lying?

421
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:57,443
- How did you know? - Good grief.

422
00:31:57,443 --> 00:32:00,072
Obviously, those who were directly involved told me.

423
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,912
It was not me but Jae Sik.

424
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:05,112
Those bunch of betrayers!

425
00:32:10,352 --> 00:32:12,852
You darn betrayers!

426
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:17,392
You stabbed me in the back first!

427
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:20,592
You two ratted on me first, no? So why blame me?

428
00:32:20,592 --> 00:32:22,433
I am not crazy to have spoken about it.

429
00:32:23,763 --> 00:32:25,362
- Do you think... - Enough!

430
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,033
- I had any other choice? - Enough!

431
00:32:27,302 --> 00:32:28,902
I knew about it all but kept quiet.

432
00:32:28,902 --> 00:32:30,473
It is an absolute mess, Village Head.

433
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:32,302
- You scumbag! - What will you do now?

434
00:32:32,302 --> 00:32:35,142
You should hang those three on the tree, should you not?

435
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,043
Or what?

436
00:32:37,543 --> 00:32:39,443
You cannot hang your son-in-law?

437
00:32:45,152 --> 00:32:46,753
Now then, what do you think?

438
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:49,223
You heard everything, did you not?

439
00:32:50,662 --> 00:32:52,892
Move it. Come on. Make way.

440
00:33:05,043 --> 00:33:06,243
Magistrate Yoo,

441
00:33:07,773 --> 00:33:08,842
I welcome you.

442
00:33:10,713 --> 00:33:12,612
- "Magistrate Yoo?" - A magistrate?

443
00:33:13,552 --> 00:33:16,953
Good grief. Where are all your manners?

444
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,852
How can you not know Magistrate Yoo,

445
00:33:20,852 --> 00:33:23,362
the second senior rank ruling Hanseongbu?

446
00:33:25,162 --> 00:33:27,293
If that does not ring a bell... Let us see.

447
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:29,162
Oh, yes! I have it.

448
00:33:29,662 --> 00:33:32,632
He is the son of the executive minister.

449
00:33:34,632 --> 00:33:36,802
- Oh, my goodness. - The legitimate son to boot!

450
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,402
- "The legitimate son?" - Good gracious.

451
00:33:39,402 --> 00:33:42,572
- Magistrate Yoo! - My dear.

452
00:33:42,572 --> 00:33:45,582
- Oh, my. - We welcome you.

453
00:33:45,683 --> 00:33:47,753
- What a surprise. - Oh, goodness.

454
00:33:50,483 --> 00:33:53,253
Magistrate Yoo, I welcome you.

455
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:05,303
Magistrate Yoo.

456
00:34:05,863 --> 00:34:07,273
As you have seen and heard,

457
00:34:07,273 --> 00:34:10,673
this murder case was not entirely the newlywed bride's fault.

458
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:12,602
Please take the circumstances into account...

459
00:34:12,602 --> 00:34:14,872
Your suit was indeed impressive.

460
00:34:15,673 --> 00:34:17,113
The newlywed bride's situation...

461
00:34:17,113 --> 00:34:20,082
and the crimes committed by the villagers, I understood them.

462
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:22,082
But...

463
00:34:22,452 --> 00:34:25,222
that cannot justify the newlywed bride's murder itself.

464
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:27,992
The national law states...

465
00:34:27,992 --> 00:34:30,122
one who personally kills another must die.

466
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:33,193
No matter how dangerous false words are, the national law...

467
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:35,093
does not sentence the death penalty.

468
00:34:36,093 --> 00:34:38,303
Even if she had retaliated due to great resentment,

469
00:34:38,303 --> 00:34:39,872
she ended up murdering a person.

470
00:34:40,173 --> 00:34:43,972
So I cannot dare take the circumstances into account...

471
00:34:43,972 --> 00:34:45,403
and forgive her.

472
00:34:45,642 --> 00:34:48,273
But the groom died due to that false rumour.

473
00:34:48,273 --> 00:34:50,343
The wife took revenge for her husband.

474
00:34:50,343 --> 00:34:51,483
She should have left it to the government office.

475
00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:53,412
She surely would have, no?

476
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:55,682
Hey! Quiet down.

477
00:34:57,282 --> 00:34:58,323
So Won.

478
00:35:02,793 --> 00:35:04,093
My apologies.

479
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:08,863
My apologies.

480
00:35:08,863 --> 00:35:10,503
I will separately investigate the details.

481
00:35:10,863 --> 00:35:13,803
All the villagers are suspects, accomplices, or at least witnesses,

482
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,602
so arrest and drag them to the government office.

483
00:35:15,903 --> 00:35:16,972
- Understood. - Understood.

484
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:18,602
Arrest them!

485
00:35:18,602 --> 00:35:19,602
- Understood. - Understood.

486
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:22,512
- Please show us mercy. - No, my lord.

487
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,512
- My lord. - Oh, my goodness.

488
00:35:25,512 --> 00:35:28,753
- We are sorry. - Oh, no. Please.

489
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:44,963
Do you truly not understand?

490
00:35:47,202 --> 00:35:48,972
Should you not apologize to me first?

491
00:35:55,142 --> 00:35:57,012
They have caught the true murderer of Park Jae Soo.

492
00:35:57,412 --> 00:35:58,412
What?

493
00:36:02,713 --> 00:36:04,883
If you want to meet the real culprit who killed Commissioner Park,

494
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:06,952
come to Malmeori Tavern in Dabok-Ri,

495
00:36:06,952 --> 00:36:08,392
Pyeongan-myeon, Cheongsan.

496
00:36:10,923 --> 00:36:13,832
Would you have come if I had told you the truth?

497
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:17,003
Only the King can make a verdict...

498
00:36:17,003 --> 00:36:18,932
on a murderer in Joseon.

499
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:23,003
Of course, the King will judge based on the case report.

500
00:36:23,003 --> 00:36:25,903
So who and how to deliver this case was more important...

501
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:27,142
than anything else.

502
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:29,273
You, Magistrate Yoo, were the only one...

503
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:30,682
I could trust and entrust the job.

504
00:36:31,543 --> 00:36:32,682
What do you trust me for?

505
00:36:32,843 --> 00:36:35,412
You let me win in the last lawsuit.

506
00:36:38,383 --> 00:36:39,722
Well, of course,

507
00:36:39,722 --> 00:36:41,593
I read all the lawsuits and rulings you carried out...

508
00:36:41,593 --> 00:36:43,023
when you were a secret investigator...

509
00:36:43,023 --> 00:36:44,892
travelling all over the country.

510
00:36:45,262 --> 00:36:48,162
Despite my prejudice against you...

511
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:50,762
as the son of the executive minister,

512
00:36:50,932 --> 00:36:52,262
you were such a fair...

513
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:55,773
and honourable person to the point I felt ashamed of myself.

514
00:36:57,343 --> 00:37:00,012
You deceived me, and yet, you are flattering me now.

515
00:37:00,573 --> 00:37:02,173
Is that how you get along in the world?

516
00:37:02,173 --> 00:37:04,443
Though it will not be right this instant,

517
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:06,952
if I find out who killed Commissioner Park...

518
00:37:06,952 --> 00:37:08,452
and report it to you...

519
00:37:09,613 --> 00:37:10,622
In other words,

520
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:13,722
you want me to help save this newlywed bride?

521
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:17,823
It will become your duty anyway.

522
00:37:20,593 --> 00:37:22,932
I did not expect you to come here yourself.

523
00:37:23,832 --> 00:37:26,602
To think there would come a day I could have tea with you.

524
00:37:26,602 --> 00:37:30,443
I am extremely honoured to the point I cannot put it into words.

525
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:33,912
I also did not know I would meet you like this, Governor Son.

526
00:37:34,812 --> 00:37:37,883
Now then. How does the tea taste?

527
00:37:38,082 --> 00:37:39,113
Oh, right.

528
00:37:44,082 --> 00:37:45,452
It is very nice.

529
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:49,392
You brought this from Hanyang yourself,

530
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,023
so it must be very precious.

531
00:37:51,122 --> 00:37:54,992
I like the unique smell and taste. Quite strong and nice.

532
00:37:57,963 --> 00:38:00,202
This was made with maple mushrooms.

533
00:38:00,972 --> 00:38:03,903
I see. It is maple mushroom.

534
00:38:04,142 --> 00:38:05,673
That is a unique name for...

535
00:38:09,012 --> 00:38:10,543
- Sorry? - Yes.

536
00:38:11,012 --> 00:38:12,242
It is a poisonous mushroom.

537
00:38:12,883 --> 00:38:15,213
You will break out in laughter, then end up dying.

538
00:38:16,483 --> 00:38:18,282
Is that not a happy death?

539
00:38:19,182 --> 00:38:21,392
Perhaps this gift is too good for you, Governor Son.

540
00:38:29,832 --> 00:38:32,162
Why are you doing this to me?

541
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:36,573
You should give him the answer.

542
00:38:38,642 --> 00:38:39,903
Why did you do that?

543
00:38:40,972 --> 00:38:42,912
Why did you ignore the wife's report...

544
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:46,412
and fail to investigate her husband's death?

545
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:47,653
Well...

546
00:38:47,653 --> 00:38:50,423
That village always took care...

547
00:38:50,423 --> 00:38:53,253
of their own matters, okay?

548
00:38:54,323 --> 00:38:56,963
It is in the deepest area of Cheongsan,

549
00:38:56,963 --> 00:38:59,293
so even bandits avoid travelling through that village.

550
00:39:00,892 --> 00:39:02,733
You still have not come to your senses.

551
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:03,733
Darn it.

552
00:39:04,062 --> 00:39:06,332
In that case, you can die like this. Let us go.

553
00:39:07,773 --> 00:39:10,242
No! Please spare my life.

554
00:39:10,343 --> 00:39:11,803
Wait!

555
00:39:11,803 --> 00:39:14,773
The antidote. Please give me the antidote.

556
00:39:16,113 --> 00:39:17,312
Granny.

557
00:39:17,383 --> 00:39:19,113
That old woman came to visit.

558
00:39:20,883 --> 00:39:24,582
It looks like a few men got into a fight.

559
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,352
Please turn a blind eye to this.

560
00:39:28,392 --> 00:39:32,323
The village head and I will take care of this matter very soon.

561
00:39:32,762 --> 00:39:33,932
Goodness.

562
00:39:35,093 --> 00:39:37,432
I needed a present for Lord Yoo.

563
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:45,602
Something that can stand out.

564
00:39:46,273 --> 00:39:48,713
All I wanted was the best for Executive Minister Yoo.

565
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:55,352
I wanted him to know how hard I was working for Hungu.

566
00:39:58,782 --> 00:40:00,053
Please spare my life!

567
00:40:00,753 --> 00:40:02,053
The antidote!

568
00:40:02,053 --> 00:40:03,253
Out there!

569
00:40:03,392 --> 00:40:05,762
Have County Governor Son Jong Seok of Cheongsan arrested now!

570
00:40:05,992 --> 00:40:07,262
Please spare my life!

571
00:40:07,793 --> 00:40:10,162
The antidote! Please!

572
00:40:20,872 --> 00:40:22,472
Excrement water...

573
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:24,012
is the immediate cure for maple mushroom.

574
00:40:30,113 --> 00:40:31,352
You must finish it.

575
00:40:35,553 --> 00:40:37,122
Darn it!

576
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:52,073
Should the young wife have stabbed her own neck with the hoe?

577
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:53,713
No.

578
00:40:54,173 --> 00:40:56,912
If she had, her soul would have wandered around the world...

579
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,642
deep in resentment to hurt the living...

580
00:40:59,642 --> 00:41:02,153
or to bring disaster to this world.

581
00:41:04,053 --> 00:41:05,782
Therefore, I plead you.

582
00:41:06,582 --> 00:41:08,793
Please consider the tragedy and guilt she felt...

583
00:41:08,793 --> 00:41:12,023
when she found out her husband was killed...

584
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:14,832
because of her.

585
00:41:23,503 --> 00:41:27,073
Goodness, that touches the heart so deeply.

586
00:41:27,512 --> 00:41:28,742
I knew it.

587
00:41:28,742 --> 00:41:32,282
The hundreds of petitions you wrote paid off in the end.

588
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:35,113
What good is that for? All we have to do now is wait.

589
00:41:38,182 --> 00:41:40,293
- Where is So Won? - Oh, her?

590
00:41:40,593 --> 00:41:43,963
She went out early in the morning to the hot springs with Lady Hong.

591
00:41:48,463 --> 00:41:49,662
Therefore,

592
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:52,562
how should we handle the case...

593
00:41:52,932 --> 00:41:56,032
brought by Magistrate Yoo Ji Sun of Hanseongbu...

594
00:41:56,403 --> 00:41:58,642
and Governor Park Tae Young of Chungcheong Province?

595
00:41:59,043 --> 00:42:00,943
What is the opinion of the Ministry of Justice?

596
00:42:01,912 --> 00:42:06,312
It is true that she has committed a brutal murder.

597
00:42:06,713 --> 00:42:10,253
But this was done to get her husband's revenge.

598
00:42:10,553 --> 00:42:12,653
How could we punish her for this?

599
00:42:15,693 --> 00:42:17,722
What about the Ministry of Law Enforcement?

600
00:42:18,162 --> 00:42:20,733
Yes, if a chaste woman...

601
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:22,762
was slandered as obscene,

602
00:42:23,463 --> 00:42:25,562
nothing can feel more unjust than that.

603
00:42:26,332 --> 00:42:29,073
She did not have any other way of proving her innocence.

604
00:42:29,273 --> 00:42:33,602
We must consider her reluctance in making this choice.

605
00:42:35,912 --> 00:42:37,812
There is no reason for anybody to oppose this...

606
00:42:38,142 --> 00:42:40,113
because the case was brought by Executive Minister Yoo's son.

607
00:42:41,713 --> 00:42:43,213
Even so,

608
00:42:43,582 --> 00:42:47,222
do you suggest that we let go of a woman who murdered another?

609
00:42:48,352 --> 00:42:50,153
What if this becomes a precedent...

610
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:54,733
and more people begin to kill to get their family's revenge?

611
00:42:55,432 --> 00:42:57,633
How will you be responsible for that?

612
00:42:57,863 --> 00:42:59,463
Your Highness.

613
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:02,273
The kingdom's law says...

614
00:43:02,303 --> 00:43:05,443
the King shall make the decision for murder cases.

615
00:43:07,242 --> 00:43:10,242
His Majesty's decision is what is important now.

616
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,102
I plead you.

617
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:37,003
Please use this chance to display that our law...

618
00:43:37,843 --> 00:43:42,372
does not only exist to suffocate and punish the people,

619
00:43:42,812 --> 00:43:44,983
but to save the people as well.

620
00:43:49,952 --> 00:43:51,983
Did you write this petition yourself?

621
00:43:52,383 --> 00:43:53,582
I have...

622
00:43:54,693 --> 00:43:55,992
copied it myself,

623
00:43:55,992 --> 00:43:57,392
after peeking at the petition Attorney Kang wrote.

624
00:43:57,793 --> 00:43:59,523
His petition is quite convincing.

625
00:43:59,892 --> 00:44:02,363
Kang Han Soo does sound like a talented man.

626
00:44:03,363 --> 00:44:05,702
He even captured your heart.

627
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:08,972
Did his petition move your heart too?

628
00:44:12,803 --> 00:44:16,312
I understand the earnestness of you and Attorney Kang.

629
00:44:16,872 --> 00:44:19,043
However, this is a murder case.

630
00:44:19,642 --> 00:44:21,613
There is nothing else that can replace one's life...

631
00:44:21,983 --> 00:44:23,352
other than another life.

632
00:44:23,753 --> 00:44:26,653
Yes, I knew you would be torn.

633
00:44:26,722 --> 00:44:27,952
Thankfully,

634
00:44:28,653 --> 00:44:30,193
I have two more lines left.

635
00:44:31,593 --> 00:44:32,693
I have...

636
00:44:33,622 --> 00:44:35,262
already brought my answer.

637
00:44:37,733 --> 00:44:39,003
I will make the decision.

638
00:44:54,582 --> 00:44:57,883
The crime of murder is unforgivable under no circumstances.

639
00:44:59,523 --> 00:45:03,452
Her crime must be discussed strictly under the nation's law.

640
00:45:06,222 --> 00:45:07,432
However,

641
00:45:07,832 --> 00:45:09,593
the law says one life must be taken...

642
00:45:09,593 --> 00:45:11,003
for one death.

643
00:45:13,403 --> 00:45:14,602
This means...

644
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:19,472
two or more shall not be sacrificed for one person's death.

645
00:45:22,213 --> 00:45:25,082
The suspect, Choi Young Sil, is currently pregnant.

646
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:29,053
If she is killed now, two lives will be lost.

647
00:45:30,012 --> 00:45:31,222
Let her have the child...

648
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:33,582
and wait until the child is of age.

649
00:45:33,582 --> 00:45:35,093
Then she will be held responsible once again.

650
00:45:42,293 --> 00:45:44,233
I am sorry I came alone.

651
00:45:48,602 --> 00:45:50,972
I will raise our child well,

652
00:45:51,943 --> 00:45:53,273
then follow your suit.

653
00:45:57,242 --> 00:45:58,742
I miss you.

654
00:46:02,113 --> 00:46:04,023
She may be alive, but we cannot call that living.

655
00:46:06,082 --> 00:46:07,793
When an ordinary woman like her...

656
00:46:08,823 --> 00:46:11,722
hurts another out of her deep resentment,

657
00:46:13,492 --> 00:46:16,133
it means she has hurt her own soul too.

658
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:19,503
After that moment,

659
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:22,972
she will live in torment forever.

660
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:26,602
Just saving your life is not the end of everything.

661
00:46:27,213 --> 00:46:28,412
No.

662
00:46:28,543 --> 00:46:30,512
- Anyway. - Yes?

663
00:46:31,483 --> 00:46:33,242
When will you ask her for money?

664
00:46:33,812 --> 00:46:35,113
Are we not here for money?

665
00:46:35,483 --> 00:46:37,153
- You have not asked her? - I have to do it?

666
00:46:37,153 --> 00:46:38,253
Then should I?

667
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,323
Now?

668
00:46:39,323 --> 00:46:40,653
A little later.

669
00:46:44,423 --> 00:46:47,662
(Sowongak)

670
00:46:47,932 --> 00:46:49,162
Is this the place?

671
00:46:49,233 --> 00:46:50,803
I told you. This place is good.

672
00:46:51,602 --> 00:46:52,803
Welcome.

673
00:46:52,863 --> 00:46:54,803
Please give us a hearty meal.

674
00:46:56,403 --> 00:46:58,503
- Put it down and get ready to eat. - Okay.

675
00:47:07,412 --> 00:47:08,553
My lord!

676
00:47:10,622 --> 00:47:11,653
My lord!

677
00:47:16,222 --> 00:47:17,492
Did we miss him?

678
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,823
We should have waited in Hanyang.

679
00:47:20,492 --> 00:47:22,492
No. Their stuff is still here.

680
00:47:26,602 --> 00:47:28,832
You will be sentenced to death...

681
00:47:28,832 --> 00:47:30,432
for raiding the government office.

682
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:32,443
Are you aware?

683
00:47:33,843 --> 00:47:35,673
Have you come to mock me?

684
00:47:36,213 --> 00:47:38,142
I mean that you will need an attorney.

685
00:47:39,082 --> 00:47:41,153
A very capable attorney, at that.

686
00:47:44,023 --> 00:47:46,452
I am not sure about you, but I promise to relieve...

687
00:47:46,782 --> 00:47:48,622
your family, your daughter, and the villagers.

688
00:47:50,622 --> 00:47:52,162
What do you want?

689
00:47:52,923 --> 00:47:55,432
Why do you ask? You already know what I want.

690
00:48:07,543 --> 00:48:08,573
Do you remember...

691
00:48:09,713 --> 00:48:11,512
my son, Kwang Sik?

692
00:48:12,582 --> 00:48:15,682
Yes, I do. He used to work with my father.

693
00:48:17,082 --> 00:48:20,952
He was also the secretary of your father, Officer Kang.

694
00:48:20,952 --> 00:48:23,222
(Secretary: The judicial officer's assistant)

695
00:48:23,222 --> 00:48:25,293
He mostly...

696
00:48:26,162 --> 00:48:28,733
delivered letters...

697
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:30,662
to the palace.

698
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:32,262
Letters?

699
00:48:34,073 --> 00:48:36,472
It was for the king.

700
00:48:39,343 --> 00:48:40,503
And one day,

701
00:48:41,642 --> 00:48:42,843
someone...

702
00:48:43,972 --> 00:48:46,242
took the letter.

703
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,653
But that day,

704
00:48:50,312 --> 00:48:53,222
he heard that his son had been born,

705
00:48:54,093 --> 00:48:55,452
so he was in a rush.

706
00:48:57,023 --> 00:48:58,593
Not long after that,

707
00:48:59,863 --> 00:49:03,392
Officer Kang was suspected of accepting bribes...

708
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:05,403
and got arrested.

709
00:49:08,932 --> 00:49:10,133
I was scared.

710
00:49:11,372 --> 00:49:13,242
Why did you pretend ignorance?

711
00:49:19,983 --> 00:49:23,713
Instead, I set fire to your house.

712
00:49:25,682 --> 00:49:26,923
I wanted to...

713
00:49:27,753 --> 00:49:29,222
let you flee, at least.

714
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:33,463
(In Mourning)

715
00:49:33,463 --> 00:49:36,332
I also told people that you were dead.

716
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:39,202
That is...

717
00:49:40,463 --> 00:49:42,532
why you are still alive.

718
00:49:47,543 --> 00:49:49,843
Are you saying that there are people after me?

719
00:49:52,343 --> 00:49:54,753
I merely guess so.

720
00:49:56,582 --> 00:49:57,923
But I do not know...

721
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:00,523
who they are.

722
00:50:02,153 --> 00:50:03,293
Then, who was the one...

723
00:50:03,693 --> 00:50:05,693
that took the letter at the time?

724
00:50:13,963 --> 00:50:15,932
Tell me! Who was it?

725
00:50:29,182 --> 00:50:32,852
There were two appeals that day.

726
00:50:35,523 --> 00:50:37,293
One of them was to appoint...

727
00:50:37,863 --> 00:50:38,992
a replacement for the head of Royal Academy of Painting,

728
00:50:38,992 --> 00:50:40,093
which passed the executive minister's meeting.

729
00:50:41,193 --> 00:50:43,032
The other one was about that murder.

730
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:48,702
The replacement recommended by you was...

731
00:50:49,673 --> 00:50:51,543
the one in charge of the murder,

732
00:50:51,702 --> 00:50:53,343
Son Jong Seok from Cheongsan.

733
00:50:54,812 --> 00:50:56,812
If I had brought him up,

734
00:50:57,312 --> 00:51:00,543
I was worried that the other lieges might have mistaken you...

735
00:51:00,543 --> 00:51:01,912
for recommending an unqualified person.

736
00:51:03,012 --> 00:51:04,622
So, I remained silent.

737
00:51:06,153 --> 00:51:08,153
I am deeply grateful...

738
00:51:08,153 --> 00:51:10,293
for your consideration, Your Majesty.

739
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:13,863
Then,

740
00:51:17,093 --> 00:51:18,233
might I say...

741
00:51:19,062 --> 00:51:21,202
that you owed me today?

742
00:51:30,512 --> 00:51:31,983
I did not know I could live the day to see this.

743
00:51:33,012 --> 00:51:34,912
I managed to fluster you.

744
00:51:37,883 --> 00:51:41,923
You do not need anyone owing you, Your Majesty.

745
00:51:42,622 --> 00:51:44,222
Whatever you need,

746
00:51:44,363 --> 00:51:47,423
you are free to give me the orders.

747
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,932
Yes, I am aware.

748
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,303
Thank you for saying that.

749
00:51:54,803 --> 00:51:57,332
Now that we are on the subject,

750
00:52:00,503 --> 00:52:01,673
may I recommend...

751
00:52:02,713 --> 00:52:04,443
the commissioner's replacement?

752
00:52:17,352 --> 00:52:20,593
Young people these days always step over the line.

753
00:52:21,693 --> 00:52:23,532
Not only my son,

754
00:52:24,303 --> 00:52:27,602
but also the young king is coming at me as if they know everything.

755
00:52:29,133 --> 00:52:32,343
Magistrate Yoo was the one who submitted the report,

756
00:52:32,702 --> 00:52:34,173
and it threw off everyone.

757
00:52:35,073 --> 00:52:38,383
We simply took his side as it was what he wanted, but...

758
00:52:39,713 --> 00:52:41,213
Who knew Son Jong Seok,

759
00:52:41,613 --> 00:52:44,113
a member of Hungu, would be demoted?

760
00:52:49,653 --> 00:52:51,222
Did you say his name was Kang Han Soo?

761
00:52:52,062 --> 00:52:53,093
Pardon?

762
00:52:53,562 --> 00:52:55,762
The attorney that solved the murder case in Cheongsan...

763
00:52:55,762 --> 00:52:57,363
by helping the princess.

764
00:52:57,832 --> 00:52:59,003
Yes, that is him.

765
00:52:59,702 --> 00:53:01,733
I have been keeping an eye on him...

766
00:53:01,972 --> 00:53:03,332
as he seemed quite capable.

767
00:53:04,673 --> 00:53:05,773
I looked into it,

768
00:53:06,472 --> 00:53:09,472
and he was the one that got Master Jang imprisoned...

769
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:11,142
by connecting him to the lawsuit.

770
00:53:11,713 --> 00:53:15,053
And the attorney for Commissioner Park's lawsuit...

771
00:53:15,812 --> 00:53:16,983
was also him.

772
00:53:18,053 --> 00:53:20,222
Why did you wait so long to tell me that?

773
00:53:21,923 --> 00:53:24,693
I was not sure whether to report to you...

774
00:53:24,693 --> 00:53:26,662
about a mere attorney.

775
00:53:28,162 --> 00:53:29,863
Hold on.

776
00:53:31,032 --> 00:53:32,432
Were they not coincidences?

777
00:53:53,753 --> 00:53:55,423
Attorney Kang is running late.

778
00:53:56,122 --> 00:53:57,693
He has always been late.

779
00:53:57,923 --> 00:53:59,622
He goes off somewhere every night.

780
00:53:59,863 --> 00:54:01,262
And he would never tell me.

781
00:54:01,262 --> 00:54:03,032
And Dong Chi even told me to keep my silence.

782
00:54:07,233 --> 00:54:08,573
Are you disappointed?

783
00:54:10,332 --> 00:54:13,343
No. I just realized...

784
00:54:13,343 --> 00:54:15,512
that I knew nothing about him.

785
00:54:17,073 --> 00:54:19,383
Especially, he seems different from usual...

786
00:54:19,383 --> 00:54:21,383
while he is in Cheongsan.

787
00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:26,983
Well, he is still as competent an attorney as he was.

788
00:54:28,193 --> 00:54:29,753
I was totally convinced!

789
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:34,062
Are you sure...

790
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,432
that you want to dress up so much?

791
00:54:40,202 --> 00:54:43,432
I will just tell him that I simply took a bath.

792
00:54:50,673 --> 00:54:53,483
Tell him that you gave me the clothes and ribbon.

793
00:54:53,742 --> 00:54:55,182
To a maid?

794
00:54:56,912 --> 00:54:58,352
You can say it is my birthday.

795
00:55:00,622 --> 00:55:01,923
How long has it been?

796
00:55:02,153 --> 00:55:04,392
What do you mean? Since this morning...

797
00:55:04,392 --> 00:55:05,423
No.

798
00:55:06,463 --> 00:55:08,193
How long have you had feelings for Attorney Kang?

799
00:55:13,562 --> 00:55:15,233
If it has not been that long,

800
00:55:16,202 --> 00:55:17,532
shake them off...

801
00:55:18,872 --> 00:55:20,142
before they settle for good.

802
00:56:28,242 --> 00:56:29,273
Han Soo.

803
00:56:30,713 --> 00:56:31,742
Dad!

804
00:56:33,943 --> 00:56:35,082
Your mom has gone to bed.

805
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,452
Let us see.

806
00:56:51,702 --> 00:56:53,003
What are you doing?

807
00:56:53,003 --> 00:56:54,573
This well is dried up. It cannot be used anymore.

808
00:56:54,573 --> 00:56:56,202
What are you talking about?

809
00:56:56,602 --> 00:56:59,472
Everything can be used depending on how you use it.

810
00:56:59,943 --> 00:57:01,173
All right.

811
00:57:06,182 --> 00:57:07,383
Here.

812
00:57:29,503 --> 00:57:30,602
Here.

813
00:57:31,003 --> 00:57:32,142
Take it.

814
00:57:35,713 --> 00:57:36,843
Try a sip.

815
00:57:46,383 --> 00:57:47,553
This is...

816
00:57:48,023 --> 00:57:51,622
My first drink was with your mother at the wedding.

817
00:57:52,823 --> 00:57:54,832
I wondered why you wanted to drink when you never do.

818
00:57:54,963 --> 00:57:57,293
This must be the habit you developed after sending Eun Soo away.

819
00:57:59,832 --> 00:58:01,003
Han Soo.

820
00:58:01,133 --> 00:58:02,633
In your next life,

821
00:58:02,803 --> 00:58:04,903
make sure you are born from a noble family...

822
00:58:05,642 --> 00:58:07,943
instead of having an incapable father like me.

823
00:58:09,173 --> 00:58:11,242
Then be a nobleman in your next life.

824
00:58:11,713 --> 00:58:14,012
Oh, that will work.

825
00:58:15,713 --> 00:58:18,122
You know what? Be a nobleman,

826
00:58:18,122 --> 00:58:19,622
and I will be your son.

827
00:58:20,023 --> 00:58:22,553
So I can get back at you by doing exactly what you did.

828
00:58:41,043 --> 00:58:42,213
Han Soo.

829
00:58:43,372 --> 00:58:45,242
What is it? Did you forget to take something?

830
00:58:45,282 --> 00:58:47,812
I hid dried persimmons in the attic.

831
00:58:48,352 --> 00:58:51,153
Have them when you are really starving.

832
00:58:52,253 --> 00:58:54,182
Gosh, you startled me.

833
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:56,423
You came back to tell me this?

834
00:58:57,523 --> 00:58:58,693
You will...

835
00:58:59,262 --> 00:59:00,622
visit me, right?

836
00:59:02,562 --> 00:59:03,762
Of course.

837
00:59:03,932 --> 00:59:05,932
Promise me. You must come.

838
00:59:08,432 --> 00:59:10,803
Actually, I am scared.

839
00:59:11,972 --> 00:59:14,073
I will visit you for sure.

840
00:59:17,273 --> 00:59:19,082
Do not tell our parents...

841
00:59:19,983 --> 00:59:21,883
that I cried.

842
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,053
I promise.

843
00:59:27,153 --> 00:59:28,593
Do not worry about Mother and Father.

844
00:59:29,423 --> 00:59:31,193
I will take good care of them.

845
00:59:34,693 --> 00:59:36,992
Dong Chi, take care.

846
00:59:38,963 --> 00:59:40,202
Bye.

847
01:00:00,153 --> 01:00:01,753
Where are you going, Han Soo?

848
01:00:01,823 --> 01:00:03,523
You must fan for me.

849
01:00:03,793 --> 01:00:05,892
- Goodness, you brats. - Darn you!

850
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:08,762
Be careful.

851
01:00:09,293 --> 01:00:11,262
You should welcome your father home first.

852
01:00:28,412 --> 01:00:29,782
Where did he go?

853
01:01:05,182 --> 01:01:06,622
What is that?

854
01:01:16,762 --> 01:01:17,963
Who are you?

855
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:19,363
It is me.

856
01:01:34,282 --> 01:01:35,582
Eun Soo?

857
01:01:41,622 --> 01:01:42,923
Eun Soo.

858
01:01:47,122 --> 01:01:48,363
Eun Soo.

859
01:01:52,363 --> 01:01:54,102
I missed you.

860
01:01:54,202 --> 01:01:55,903
I missed you.

861
01:01:58,073 --> 01:01:59,273
I am sorry.

862
01:02:01,472 --> 01:02:03,372
I am sorry, Eun Soo.

863
01:02:04,912 --> 01:02:06,113
My lord...

864
01:02:15,492 --> 01:02:17,793
My dear sister.

865
01:02:19,762 --> 01:02:21,532
I promised...

866
01:02:22,662 --> 01:02:25,403
on the day of your wedding...

867
01:02:28,372 --> 01:02:29,872
that I would...

868
01:02:32,443 --> 01:02:33,843
take good care...

869
01:02:34,742 --> 01:02:37,343
of our parents for you.

870
01:02:39,483 --> 01:02:41,113
But what do I do?

871
01:02:42,153 --> 01:02:44,352
They both passed away.

872
01:02:46,423 --> 01:02:49,193
So wrongfully...

873
01:02:51,662 --> 01:02:53,492
and miserably.

874
01:03:01,363 --> 01:03:03,372
I wished you would not know.

875
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:09,273
You got married at a young age for our family.

876
01:03:09,742 --> 01:03:12,713
I thought you would want to follow them if you knew.

877
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:15,282
So I could not tell you.

878
01:03:18,222 --> 01:03:19,523
You should just...

879
01:03:20,753 --> 01:03:23,093
live happily with your husband.

880
01:03:24,653 --> 01:03:28,463
Why did you come here, silly?

881
01:03:44,043 --> 01:03:45,312
It is okay.

882
01:03:47,412 --> 01:03:48,782
She would not know.

883
01:03:50,553 --> 01:03:52,122
She would be clueless.

884
01:03:53,182 --> 01:03:55,492
She would be living happily.

885
01:03:58,863 --> 01:04:00,222
So do not cry.

886
01:04:04,832 --> 01:04:06,332
Do not cry, my lord.

887
01:04:24,753 --> 01:04:26,023
A princess?

888
01:04:30,553 --> 01:04:31,863
You were...

889
01:04:33,863 --> 01:04:35,233
a princess.

890
01:04:57,912 --> 01:04:59,423
You were a princess...

891
01:05:19,003 --> 01:05:22,412
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

892
01:05:23,273 --> 01:05:26,713

893
01:05:28,412 --> 01:05:30,082
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

894
01:05:31,213 --> 01:05:32,852
If you find out the truth,

895
01:05:34,483 --> 01:05:36,523
will you be able to forgive me?

896
01:05:38,963 --> 01:05:40,863
It cannot be. Officer Kang?

897
01:05:42,332 --> 01:05:46,432
Are you saying Kang Han Soo will be after you?

898
01:05:48,633 --> 01:05:50,532
Here. It is my birthday gift for you.

899
01:05:51,602 --> 01:05:54,003
These shoes will take you...

900
01:05:54,642 --> 01:05:57,912
to a better and a more precious place.

901
01:06:00,443 --> 01:06:01,613
Do not go.

902
01:06:03,153 --> 01:06:04,282
Do not worry.

903
01:06:04,812 --> 01:06:06,323
If you have experienced a miracle,

904
01:06:06,782 --> 01:06:07,983
you do not die easily.
