1
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:44,134
You should have used better judgment about the person before the appointment

2
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:51,794
instead of blindly selecting someone from the Sarim Party in order to keep me in check.

3
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:56,954
This is why I cannot afford to step back.

4
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:03,274
It is because you do not trust me.

5
00:01:04,654 --> 00:01:10,134
I have served three kings thus far.

6
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:17,684
Your grandfather was a courageous general and an intelligent king.

7
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:22,864
But his sons were crown princes, yet they did not accomplish a thing

8
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:26,154
and died precipitously.

9
00:01:27,074 --> 00:01:31,204
And Your Majesty, it's only because you are of his bloodline

10
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:34,024
that you are sitting on that throne.

11
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:41,594
Your subjects take the state examinations and go through promotional reviews,

12
00:01:41,594 --> 00:01:45,124
and they make themselves who they are for the positions.

13
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:48,714
They do not gain anything for free.

14
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:53,074
On the other hand, you have not accomplished anything on your own.

15
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:57,324
And what is worse, you are a king who is under the regency of the queen mother.

16
00:01:57,324 --> 00:02:01,504
Who will trust and follow a king like that?

17
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:10,774
You are telling me I got this position for free, are you not?

18
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:17,874
So you are telling me to prove that I deserve the throne, are you not?

19
00:02:17,874 --> 00:02:23,184
If so, I will concede.

20
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:25,844
Yes.

21
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:28,914
You are not wrong in anything you say.

22
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:30,860
You are right, Minister.

23
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:38,360

24
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,974
From now on,

25
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:46,304
I will become a king who accomplishes things for this nation, Joseon, and its people.

26
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,044
And the biggest thing to accomplish among them

27
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:59,284
is to bring down a powerful vassal Yu Je Se who challenges the king's authority

28
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:02,374
and regain sovereign power.

29
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:06,754
Will you please watch me do it?

30
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:18,524
Yes, Sire.

31
00:03:18,524 --> 00:03:25,654
If that happens, it would be a great honor for me.

32
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:30,054
If you can oust me,

33
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:33,454
out of all the achievements you will accomplish in the future,

34
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:36,664
it will be the greatest one of them all.

35
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:44,864
However, what should we do about this?

36
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:53,534
The sword you have been sharpening to point at me

37
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:57,124
will no longer be available for you.

38
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:04,424
 My sister and Kang Han Su are in danger.

39
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:07,954
 Ask Mayor Yu for his help.

40
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:26,654
Your Excellency, what brings you here?

41
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:29,784
His Majesty sent me an urgent message.

42
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:45,454
 Royal Grandmother, this is Yeon Ju.

43
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:50,494
What brings you here at this late hour?

44
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:52,434
I'm sorry, Royal Grandmother.

45
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:56,684
What did you do with that man, Kang Han Su?

46
00:04:57,634 --> 00:05:00,724
You do not need to concern yourself about it.

47
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:14,054
If you wish to shut Kang Han Su up to cover up Uncle's secret,

48
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:17,884
you will have to shut me up as well.

49
00:05:23,684 --> 00:05:26,664
So the rumor was true.

50
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:27,754
What...

51
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:32,514
An ugly rumor about you hanging around a mere attorney!

52
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:38,524
How do you behave out there that such a dirty rumor is going around?

53
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:43,244
How could you bring shame upon the royal family's honor?

54
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:45,214
Royal Grandmother.

55
00:05:55,384 --> 00:05:57,944
I am doing this for you

56
00:05:57,944 --> 00:06:02,804
and also for the royal family and this nation, Joseon!

57
00:06:03,924 --> 00:06:09,194
If you are trying to harm that man because of me, please change your mind.

58
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:11,954
I will not meet that man again.

59
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:17,004
I will never get mixed up with him again.

60
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:19,704
So Royal Grandmother...

61
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:37,104
Who in the world is he that you are behaving this way?

62
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:44,904
I promised him... that I would protect him.

63
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,344
What?

64
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:49,824
I made that promise to myself.

65
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:55,654
I am a princess of the nation.

66
00:06:56,514 --> 00:07:00,254
Please let me live as a person who keeps her promise.

67
00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:20,454
I will let him live.

68
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:26,084
However, you cannot have him near you.

69
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,094
Do you understand?

70
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:47,904
Where am I?

71
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:49,814
Where am I?

72
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,590
 Attorney for Hire

73
00:08:16,264 --> 00:08:18,464
Let go!

74
00:08:23,774 --> 00:08:25,634
Wait.

75
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:30,664
What are you saying?

76
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:35,464
It isn't true, So Won.

77
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,644
It is true.

78
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,754
What a mess. This is a mess!

79
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:59,054
Come on now! How imprudent!

80
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:01,424
Wh-What? Impudent?

81
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:03,594
Impudent?

82
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:37,664
So... you knew about all this, Your Excellency.

83
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:48,534
Where are you going?

84
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:52,184
You said you came to arrest me.

85
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:54,054
You should take me with you.

86
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:56,824
Oh, well, as for that...

87
00:09:56,824 --> 00:10:00,064
Since Princess is your witness...

88
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:01,944
Wait a minute.

89
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:07,984
Over one word from the princess, you will no longer arrest me?

90
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:13,074
How can you guarantee Princess is not lying?

91
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:15,754
Princess is also human.

92
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:18,194
Kang Han Su.

93
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:23,524
On top of that, out of all the people I know,

94
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:28,874
she is the worst liar of them all.

95
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,274
Are you out of your mind?

96
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:34,454
Whether you are guilty or not, if you are imprisoned for a murder charge,

97
00:10:34,454 --> 00:10:36,094
you cannot avoid the torturous interrogation.

98
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,384
You might die even before you clear your name.

99
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:40,314
Do you think...

100
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:44,084
I do not know that as an attorney?

101
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:45,404
Then?

102
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:47,074
Yes.

103
00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:52,724
It means I would rather die than receive help from the princess.

104
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:57,924
All right. Let us go.

105
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,274
I will go!

106
00:11:00,274 --> 00:11:03,154
I did not even kill him!

107
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:09,284
So please clearly reveal the reason why this bloody dagger was found on this ship!

108
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:49,774
 Episode 11: Farewell

109
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:53,544
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

110
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:56,394
 Ministry of Justice

111
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,410
 Court House

112
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:06,584
I am glad to meet you.

113
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:09,024
I see this is where we meet as enemies.

114
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:12,794
Wow, you are back in your office already.

115
00:12:12,794 --> 00:12:15,814
Congratulations, Your Excellency.

116
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:19,954
Again! Here you go again with your wicked tongue of yours!

117
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,874
How audacious of you to murder Minister Chu!

118
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:27,114
How dare you! Why?

119
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,414
I did not kill him.

120
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:32,424
And you even lie now?

121
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:35,504
Do you not even fear heaven?

122
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,314
- I did not kill him. 
 - Then

123
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:44,824
how about this bloody dagger that was found on your ship?

124
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:48,904
I do not know anything about it.

125
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:52,214
Is that so?

126
00:12:54,274 --> 00:13:00,884
Let us see how long you can insist that you do not know.

127
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,034
Excuse me.

128
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:32,464
I came in to pack, and I found this.

129
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:42,524
♫  Always be with you  ♫

 I am sorry for getting angry at you.

132

 Looking back on things, I realize it was my fault.

133
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:03,844
♫  The moment I first saw you  ♫

136

 I made you scared for no reason.

137

144

 Do not worry.

145
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:03,164

♫  This endless road  ♫

 My apologies.

155
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:39,944
 So you do not know

156
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:45,940
 where Princess Yeon Ju is, or who she is?

157
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,114
 In So Won's status, and as a woman,

158
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,584
 how could she accompany Hanseongbu's official?

159
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:55,574
 If the royal court finds out, it would be okay for you since you have firm connections,

160
00:15:55,574 --> 00:15:58,080
 but what would happen to So Won?

161
00:15:59,954 --> 00:16:03,324
♫  Come back to me  ♫

162
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:06,834
♫  Embrace me tightly  ♫

163
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:18,064
No, you cannot!

164
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:21,164
I am sure I can help somehow.

165
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:23,054
That is why I came back to the palace.

166
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:27,384
I know. I know that, but not here and not now.

167
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:29,374
Kang Han Su knows best around here.

168
00:16:29,374 --> 00:16:32,284
He will save himself.

169
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:38,324
You do what only you can do, Princess.

170
00:16:38,324 --> 00:16:43,644
You should not recklessly give a reason to my father or to the royal family.

171
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:51,264
You know well what kind of man my father is.

172
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:02,864
Just for a moment, please.

173
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:14,474
 Please let me be whatever you need by your side.

174
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:21,274
 Please... use me.

175
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,374
 I will let him live.

176
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,674
 However, you cannot have him near you.

177
00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:45,364
You said I could use you in the past, Your Excellency.

178
00:17:47,114 --> 00:17:49,704
Will it be okay if I do so?

179
00:17:58,974 --> 00:18:01,784
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no, no.

180
00:18:01,784 --> 00:18:04,924
Huh? Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim!

181
00:18:04,924 --> 00:18:08,644
Oh, my gosh! Dong Chi! Dong Chi!

182
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:11,204
- It hurts, right?
 - Of course, it hurts! I almost cried.

183
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:14,644
Look at your face. You look so haggard.

184
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,044
Geez! Seriously!

185
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:21,404
You should gain strength by eating at times like this!

186
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:23,164
Why do you skip your meal?

187
00:18:23,164 --> 00:18:26,004
I cannot trust it.

188
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,414
Wh-What do you mean...?

189
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:43,074
That's why! You should have taken Princess's help! Why be so stubborn?

190
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:46,224
You! Darn it, you are dead when I get out.

191
00:18:49,414 --> 00:18:52,304
So did you find out anything?

192
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:54,074
Y-Yes.

193
00:18:54,074 --> 00:18:57,634
I think it was the Grand Merchant Jo.

194
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:59,494
- Wait a minute.
 - Grand Merchant Jo?

195
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:01,444
Wait.

196
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:04,244
- This! 
 - What is this?

197
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:09,514
This is Merchant Jo's guys' favorite snack.

198
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:32,834
They chew on these all the time, as they spit them out when picking fights.

199
00:19:56,624 --> 00:20:01,634
After Minister Chu died, did Grand Merchant Jo side with Minister Yu?

200
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:06,384
First of all, should we look for the guy who put the dagger on our ship?

201
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:09,894
- Merchants in the area could have seen him. 
 - No, no, no.

202
00:20:09,894 --> 00:20:13,234
They were determined to frame me.

203
00:20:13,234 --> 00:20:16,474
I am sure they moved without anyone spotting them.

204
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:26,514
It will be tough to find the killer who killed Minister Chu.

205
00:20:26,514 --> 00:20:28,554
Change your focus.

206
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:30,124
H-How?

207
00:20:30,124 --> 00:20:35,944
Try to prove that I could not possibly have

208
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:38,764
killed Minister Chu that night.

209
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:49,294
My Lady, Sir Han Su was arrested for murder.

210
00:20:49,294 --> 00:20:51,474
Orabeoni was?

211
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,774
Orabeoni!

212
00:20:58,774 --> 00:20:59,884
What did he say?

213
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:03,264
Is there a way to beat the crap out of Merchant Jo's guys?

214
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:07,254
He says it would be difficult at this rate.

215
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:09,364
What? Then...

216
00:21:09,364 --> 00:21:14,074
Gosh, then, is he saying he will just die like that?

217
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:17,554
Gosh! Please answer me instead of sighing, Dong Chi Orabeoni!

218
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:19,694
W-Wait.

219
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:22,444
What is that?

220
00:21:27,664 --> 00:21:32,814
To find an eyewitness or a witness, you will need money.

221
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:51,174
How much is all this worth?

222
00:21:51,174 --> 00:21:54,074
Dong Chi Orabeoni, look at this!

223
00:21:55,474 --> 00:21:56,754
Wait.

224
00:21:56,754 --> 00:21:58,704
Wait a minute.

225
00:22:02,484 --> 00:22:05,304
So pretty, isn't it?

226
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:41,730
 Wishes Inn

227
00:22:44,914 --> 00:22:49,144
 I heard my brother was arrested for murder.

228
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:51,304
 Is it true?

229
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:04,114
 It seems the Grand Queen Dowager made her move.

230
00:23:04,114 --> 00:23:05,364
 Grand Queen Dowager?

231
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:10,604
 How much longer do you think the princess will live in an inn as a broker?

232
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:15,654
 No matter how lowly she is dressed and behaves, she is still the princess.

233
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:20,644
 The royal family will never sit back and let her live meddling in

234
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:23,814
 other people's lawsuits, along with a mere attorney.

235
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,440
 Wishes Inn

236
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:39,064
You will marry the Mayor?

237
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:44,754
In the closest proximity to Minister Yu, I will find a way to turn against him.

238
00:23:44,754 --> 00:23:49,044
It will be advantageous to protect Kang Han Su as well.

239
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:55,464
I do not think Minister Yu will agree to that, but even if the marriage does happen...

240
00:23:59,424 --> 00:24:05,554
Princess, a marriage shall not be used as part of your scheme.

241
00:24:05,554 --> 00:24:08,214
How about your life as a woman, Princess?

242
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:11,514
Where will you find happiness?

243
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:16,504
My happiness as a woman...

244
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,394
is So Won's.

245
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:28,034
This is enough for me.

246
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:58,234
It will be your loss if you continue this way.

247
00:24:58,934 --> 00:25:01,054
What do you care?

248
00:25:01,054 --> 00:25:03,284
Well, fine.

249
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:05,934
I do not care what happens to you.

250
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:07,454
We are nothing to each other.

251
00:25:07,454 --> 00:25:09,894
Yes. Of course.

252
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:14,824
It is even absurd to say "we" to describe our relationship.

253
00:25:14,824 --> 00:25:16,944
But I came to give you my greetings.

254
00:25:16,944 --> 00:25:19,744
So do not be too grateful to me.

255
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:21,784
No way.

256
00:25:21,784 --> 00:25:24,494
Though, I have no idea what kind of greeting you have for me.

257
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:27,404
What else? It would be farewell.

258
00:25:33,304 --> 00:25:38,094
I think this will be the last time we will see each other alive on this side of life.

259
00:25:40,464 --> 00:25:44,614
"I had enough fun deceiving you all this time,

260
00:25:44,614 --> 00:25:48,074
so depart from this world."

261
00:25:48,074 --> 00:25:52,034
Are you trying to pray for that wish now?

262
00:25:54,934 --> 00:26:00,724
Actually, to be honest, you were extremely lucky all this time.

263
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:05,564
Luck? It was my ability.

264
00:26:06,374 --> 00:26:11,414
I will walk out of here alive using my ability this time as well.

265
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:16,044
Is that so? Then I will have to invite you to my wedding, too.

266
00:26:16,044 --> 00:26:18,854
What a nice life you have. Getting married and all.

267
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:21,764
I will marry the princess.

268
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:31,794
Make sure you come out alive and congratulate us.

269
00:26:47,924 --> 00:26:51,494
Did you not provoke Kang Han Su too much?

270
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:57,434
That way, he will try his darndest to come out alive out of spite.

271
00:26:57,434 --> 00:27:00,034
Are you worried about him?

272
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:05,634
I am only worried about how worried Princess will be for him.

273
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:26,844
♫  Always be with you  ♫

274
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:32,034
 For two different people to meet and work together for a common goal

275
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:35,734
 is just as important as getting married.

276
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:42,104
 I will make my objective in life to make you live a happy life, Sir.

277
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:45,414
 So that you can be happy, Sir.

278
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,694
 So that you can live a life where just living could be your objective.

279
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:53,454
 I will put in my effort to help you. Whatever that may be,

280
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:54,660
 I will do it.

281
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,880
♫  Even if I'm crazy in pain  ♫

282
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,184
 I am proposing to you.

283
00:28:01,184 --> 00:28:04,924
 So... will you wait for me?

284
00:28:04,924 --> 00:28:10,374
♫  Even if the cold wind blows  ♫

285
00:28:10,374 --> 00:28:12,424
 Mind proper manners.

286
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:16,280
 This is Princess Yeon Ju, the late king's daughter.

287
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:25,434
♫  Can't you take one step closer to me?  ♫

288
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:33,264
♫  I'm waiting for you here  ♫

289
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:36,384
♫  Hold my hand  ♫

290

♫  Embrace me tightly  ♫

291
00:28:49,764 --> 00:28:51,784
Have you seen Attorney Kang Han Su?

292
00:28:51,784 --> 00:28:52,814
No, I have not.

293
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,014
- He says no.
 - He has not?

294
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,734
Lady, in our office...

295
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:03,504
Have you seen the Merchant Jo's ruffians go in there while we were out?

296
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:05,294
- No, I have not. 
 - You have not?

297
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:08,034
- Attorney Kang Han Su.
 - I'm not sure...

298
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:11,534
I do not know. No.

299
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:17,904
Please. Just once.

300
00:29:17,904 --> 00:29:19,994
Hey, Choi!

301
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:24,234
By chance, have you seen Attorney Kang and So Won here?

302
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:33,224
Okay, take this, and I beg you just once...

303
00:30:10,014 --> 00:30:12,214
I will ask you again.

304
00:30:12,214 --> 00:30:14,444
Why did you kill him?

305
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:20,934
According to the Book of Law, when you torture while interrogating...

306
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:21,984
What did you say?

307
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:29,244
you may hit below the knees with the tip of a stick for flogging but not hit the shin.

308
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,424
What are you mumbling?

309
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:35,194
And you may not hit thirty beatings at one time.

310
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:38,154
You are still mumbling nonsense and not coming to your senses!

311
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:40,254
What are you doing?

312
00:30:42,854 --> 00:30:46,604
I do not think we should torture him more.

313
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:55,244
What law? They do not even abide by it.

314
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:58,824
Th-That... Has he gone insane?

315
00:31:01,184 --> 00:31:02,764
Please stop!

316
00:31:02,764 --> 00:31:06,314
Please stop! Your Excellency!

317
00:31:07,024 --> 00:31:09,974
Your Excellency! Please stop the torture!

318
00:31:09,974 --> 00:31:15,704
I brought witnesses to clear Kang Han Su's name!

319
00:31:16,904 --> 00:31:18,944
Witnesses?

320
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,084
What witnesses?

321
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:25,104
Come in!

322
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,140
 Court House

323
00:31:43,144 --> 00:31:48,494
These are witnesses who can prove that he could not have murdered Minister Chu!

324
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,744
 Change your focus.

325
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:55,324
 H-How?

326
00:31:55,324 --> 00:32:01,074
 Try to prove that I could not possibly have

327
00:32:01,074 --> 00:32:03,964
 killed Minister Chu that night.

328
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:11,064
Your Excellency, please hear us out just once!

329
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:12,714
 I do not need money.

330
00:32:12,714 --> 00:32:14,574
 It is not like you are asking me to lie.

331
00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:18,124
 Why would you pay me to help out Attorney Kang?

332
00:32:18,124 --> 00:32:21,434
Sir Kang Han Su is not the killer!

333
00:32:21,434 --> 00:32:23,044
 Of course, I should go.

334
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:24,954
 If I do not go, who will?

335
00:32:24,954 --> 00:32:28,804
He is not someone who would commit murder!

336
00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:33,564
 Is there something I can do to help?

337
00:32:33,564 --> 00:32:35,684
 Please listen to our plea.

338
00:32:35,684 --> 00:32:38,514
Please listen to our plea.

339
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:42,534
You brought so many with you.

340
00:32:42,534 --> 00:32:43,994
If you want to testify,

341
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:48,674
you will first have to be punished for bursting into the interrogation site!

342
00:32:48,674 --> 00:32:50,614
Ten floggings!

343
00:32:50,614 --> 00:32:53,114
Will you still testify?

344
00:32:56,234 --> 00:32:59,584
Yes! I will!

345
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:06,854
- I will testify!
 - I will!

346
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:10,114
- I will testify!
 - I will testify!

347
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:11,614
I will testify!

348
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,404
Please listen to our plea!

349
00:33:13,404 --> 00:33:15,654
 Please listen to our plea!

350
00:33:15,654 --> 00:33:18,604
 - Please listen to our plea!
 - I will testify!

351
00:33:18,604 --> 00:33:21,134
 - Please save him!
 - I will testify!

352
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:23,784
 I will testify!

353
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:26,104
 I will testify!

354
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:29,504
 Please save him!

355
00:33:29,504 --> 00:33:31,244
What exactly do you want to say?

356
00:33:31,244 --> 00:33:34,774
One person! Just one person should speak on everyone's behalf!

357
00:33:34,774 --> 00:33:36,484
Yes!

358
00:33:40,784 --> 00:33:45,134
At the hour of Minister Chu's death, Kang Han Su

359
00:33:45,134 --> 00:33:51,454
was not at the site of Minister Chu's death in Choansan but at the Mapo ferry dock.

360
00:33:53,434 --> 00:33:54,834
It's so good!

361
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:56,584
Please give me more.

362
00:33:56,584 --> 00:34:03,314
 Yes, my family had dinner with Attorney Kang that evening.

363
00:34:05,164 --> 00:34:08,084
Guess, guess which one.

364
00:34:08,854 --> 00:34:12,304
 That night, my hyeongnim...

365
00:34:12,304 --> 00:34:15,044
 Guess. Take a guess!

366
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:22,854
 Guessed everything.

367
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:27,024
 So the trickster lost a lot of money.

368
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,914
-  Attorney...
 - That night...

369
00:34:28,914 --> 00:34:34,934
 Attorney Kang and his assistant So Won came to our tavern and drank plum wine.

370
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:46,214
Attorney Kang did not murder a man!

371
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:49,014
Please let him live, Your Excellency!

372
00:34:49,014 --> 00:34:51,414
 Please spare his life!

373
00:34:51,414 --> 00:34:54,304
 Please spare his life!

374
00:34:54,304 --> 00:34:57,204
 Please spare his life!

375
00:35:00,874 --> 00:35:04,464
I have heard sufficiently from the witnesses.

376
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:08,164
However, from what I have heard,

377
00:35:08,164 --> 00:35:10,944
all of you have close ties with Kang Han Su

378
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:14,364
or received assistance from Kang Han Su!

379
00:35:16,124 --> 00:35:19,834
Th-That does not mean we faked our testimonies!

380
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:23,454
How dare you interrupt me!

381
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,014
- Officers!
 - Yes!

382
00:35:30,514 --> 00:35:32,844
I am here!

383
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,924
I have no close ties with Kang Han Su.

384
00:35:53,924 --> 00:35:56,774
Rather, my merchant organization got into a legal dispute with him in the past,

385
00:35:56,774 --> 00:36:00,284
so I am actually not on good terms with Kang Han Su.

386
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:03,804
So?

387
00:36:03,804 --> 00:36:06,664
So what is it you want to say?

388
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:11,204
I guarantee that all of their testimonies are true.

389
00:36:11,204 --> 00:36:14,084
I secretly followed Kang Han Su around all day that day,

390
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:18,084
so I know this for sure better than anyone.

391
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:33,984
 I followed him around, thinking I should teach him a lesson.

392
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:37,214
 I had given up because he was constantly around others,

393
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:39,594
even until it became dark.

394
00:36:39,594 --> 00:36:45,024
Thus, Kang Han Su never had the time to murder Minister Chu.

395
00:36:47,984 --> 00:36:52,954
If anything I say is false, I will put my neck on the line!

396
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:02,014
I just got reinstated to my position.

397
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:07,374
Yes.

398
00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:10,034
I should not make a bigger deal out of this.

399
00:37:11,074 --> 00:37:12,484
What?

400
00:37:17,964 --> 00:37:20,194
Let Kang Han Su...

401
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:28,304
be released!

402
00:37:36,784 --> 00:37:38,564
Sir, Sir!

403
00:37:38,564 --> 00:37:40,534
Sir, Sir!

404
00:37:40,534 --> 00:37:43,774
Sir, wake up!

405
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:46,774
- Sir.
 - Be careful!

406
00:38:19,504 --> 00:38:21,544
 Father...

407
00:38:22,414 --> 00:38:28,054
 I've finally... figured out the answer.

408
00:38:39,244 --> 00:38:42,034
-  Father. 
- Yes?

409
00:38:42,034 --> 00:38:44,704
 Why are we poor?

410
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:49,294
 People say that you are the most successful person in the middle class,

411
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:53,734
 and they all revere you saying that not anyone can become a teacher of the law.

412
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:57,884
 But you cannot become wealthy, despite being revered by so many?

413
00:39:00,764 --> 00:39:04,504
 If you want to become wealthy, you must become selfish.

414
00:39:04,504 --> 00:39:08,504
 You would use all that you have seen, heard, and learned to obtain wealth,

415
00:39:08,504 --> 00:39:10,274
 closing one eye,

416
00:39:10,274 --> 00:39:13,784
 and only focusing on one's own greed.

417
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:17,684
 However, the law is for everyone,

418
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:20,784
 and must be fair to everyone.

419
00:39:21,414 --> 00:39:25,484
 Thus, it would be difficult for your father, who deals with the law

420
00:39:25,484 --> 00:39:27,424
 to become rich.

421
00:39:27,424 --> 00:39:32,984
 Then I want to give up studying law immediately

422
00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:34,674
 and will not become a legal officer.

423
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:37,224
 I want to become rich.

424
00:39:40,854 --> 00:39:46,804
 I have... achieved my dream.

425
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:51,244
 I have become rich.

426
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,094
What you have said was right, Your Excellency.

427
00:40:05,094 --> 00:40:08,724
Yes. It is truly a relief.

428
00:40:10,814 --> 00:40:15,724
There is one final thing for me to take care of.

429
00:40:15,724 --> 00:40:18,154
I will wait for you.

430
00:40:58,784 --> 00:41:04,124
By chance, are you the one who left a bundle of

431
00:41:04,124 --> 00:41:08,144
money and a note at our office the other day?

432
00:41:09,194 --> 00:41:13,684
If so, then listen carefully to what I say.

433
00:41:20,054 --> 00:41:22,304
Thank you.

434
00:41:24,474 --> 00:41:26,824
With the money you gave us,

435
00:41:26,824 --> 00:41:29,054
we bought a medicinal tonic with

436
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:33,994
many expensive medicinal ingredients, such as deer antlers.

437
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:37,134
Once my Hyeongnim Han Su finishes taking this tonic,

438
00:41:37,134 --> 00:41:40,434
he will be back on his feet really soon.

439
00:41:41,234 --> 00:41:44,774
Whenever you have any difficulties, please come visit us.

440
00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:49,624
Hyeongnim and I will make sure to repay you.

441
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:53,774
Thank you!

442
00:42:04,774 --> 00:42:07,844
Gosh, she has only increased our workload!

443
00:42:07,844 --> 00:42:09,964
Once the princess is married, she will leave the palace anyway!

444
00:42:09,964 --> 00:42:11,634
Why come back and trouble us like this?

445
00:42:11,634 --> 00:42:13,834
Court Lady Hong is also so fussy!

446
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:16,004
Why is she making a big deal saying that she will cook herself?

447
00:42:16,004 --> 00:42:18,374
I know.

448
00:42:23,044 --> 00:42:25,214
Even if the princess leaves the palace soon,

449
00:42:25,214 --> 00:42:28,374
she is still the daughter of the late king, His Majesty.

450
00:42:28,374 --> 00:42:30,634
If you dare speak recklessly again,

451
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:33,394
you will not be able to retain your lives.

452
00:42:33,394 --> 00:42:35,364
 Yes, Court Lady Hong.

453
00:42:35,364 --> 00:42:37,924
Go and draw some more water.

454
00:42:37,924 --> 00:42:39,714
 Yes.

455
00:42:56,844 --> 00:42:58,374
 Mind your proper manners.

456
00:42:58,374 --> 00:43:01,194
 This is Princess Yeon Ju, the daughter of the late king.

457
00:43:01,194 --> 00:43:03,134
Gosh, I am speechless.

458
00:43:03,134 --> 00:43:05,944
 How dare you! How rude!

459
00:43:05,944 --> 00:43:08,874
 R-Rude?

460
00:43:10,794 --> 00:43:16,144
I feel this way, so how worse would it be for the princess?

461
00:43:17,734 --> 00:43:20,234
I feel this way,

462
00:43:21,424 --> 00:43:24,494
so how worse would it be for Hyeongnim?

463
00:44:24,154 --> 00:44:28,634
♫  Always be with you  ♫

464
00:44:31,224 --> 00:44:35,684
♫  On the day we held hands  ♫

465
00:44:38,274 --> 00:44:42,774
♫  I always remember  ♫

466
00:44:45,154 --> 00:44:50,104
♫  The moment I first saw you  ♫

467
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:57,910
♫  I knew  ♫
 ♫  That our time exists in the same space  ♫

468
00:44:59,294 --> 00:45:02,654
 This is a lawsuit I brought in.

469
00:45:02,654 --> 00:45:07,270
 Sir, is it not a lawyer's job to help a person facing injustice?

470
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:12,250
 Attorney for Hire

471
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:15,714
 How pretty you are. You're the prettiest in the world.

472
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:17,274
 We will win for sure.

473
00:45:17,274 --> 00:45:20,384
♫  I will stay by your side  ♫

474
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,834
♫  Even if the cold wind blows  ♫

475
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:26,714
 In the end, was this place

476
00:45:26,714 --> 00:45:30,440
 a mere playground of sorts?

477
00:45:33,944 --> 00:45:41,434
♫  Can't you come one step closer to me?  ♫

478
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:49,224
♫  I'm waiting for you here  ♫

479
00:45:49,224 --> 00:45:52,344
♫  Hold my hand  ♫

480
00:45:52,344 --> 00:45:55,814
♫  Embrace me tightly  ♫

481
00:46:00,214 --> 00:46:02,654
I have something to say to you.

482
00:46:09,674 --> 00:46:12,204
Please lower your voice.

483
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:16,814
I am afraid someone might hear you.

484
00:46:16,814 --> 00:46:20,234
- We are the only ones here. 
- So...

485
00:46:21,304 --> 00:46:24,954
are you saying you will keep toying with me?

486
00:46:24,954 --> 00:46:26,774
Or what?

487
00:46:26,774 --> 00:46:30,674
Since we are the only ones here, are you tempting me to spend

488
00:46:30,674 --> 00:46:33,734
some intimate time with you?

489
00:46:38,634 --> 00:46:41,094
How long are you planning to be sarcastic?

490
00:46:41,094 --> 00:46:47,204
Did you come to visit me without expecting this much ridicule from me?

491
00:46:48,534 --> 00:46:53,034
Since you had your fun deceiving me all this time, you should pay the cost.

492
00:46:53,034 --> 00:46:55,514
I did not expect this, either.

493
00:46:55,514 --> 00:46:58,894
Meeting you while living as So Won,

494
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:05,024
and becoming closer than we needed to.

495
00:47:05,024 --> 00:47:09,214
Then you should have told me before we got closer than necessary

496
00:47:09,214 --> 00:47:13,734
or distanced yourself from me in advance.

497
00:47:14,564 --> 00:47:17,314
I needed you.

498
00:47:37,534 --> 00:47:40,324
It is what you were curious about.

499
00:47:41,534 --> 00:47:46,230
The truth about what happened seven years ago.

500
00:47:48,674 --> 00:47:51,074
Only the envelope is left.

501
00:47:54,244 --> 00:47:57,584
Minister Yu came running as soon as he saw this letter

502
00:47:57,584 --> 00:48:04,644
and protested to my father, and they had a long heated discussion over it.

503
00:48:06,534 --> 00:48:10,824
My father, who collapsed from being overcome by his great fury,

504
00:48:11,554 --> 00:48:13,824
soon passed away.

505
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:19,824
The tragedy that befell your family around that time,

506
00:48:19,824 --> 00:48:22,864
and the death of my father was all the Minister's fault!

507
00:48:22,864 --> 00:48:25,564
He is our common enemy!

508
00:48:27,624 --> 00:48:29,664
So...

509
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:34,364
all of this...

510
00:48:36,194 --> 00:48:38,844
was to get revenge, I see.

511
00:48:41,444 --> 00:48:44,464
The reason you approached me,

512
00:48:45,614 --> 00:48:48,264
and why you deceived me.

513
00:48:48,264 --> 00:48:50,294
All of it.

514
00:48:51,124 --> 00:48:53,954
I thought we would be able to help each other.

515
00:48:53,954 --> 00:48:55,954
And I feel the same right now.

516
00:48:55,954 --> 00:48:59,614
- If we join forces— 
- No, no.

517
00:49:05,644 --> 00:49:08,544
Are you sure that the late king

518
00:49:10,104 --> 00:49:15,684
was not responsible at all for my father's death?

519
00:49:16,484 --> 00:49:18,044
What?

520
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:23,994
It is possible that the king was the one who abandoned him.

521
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:29,924
No... the king could have placed all the blame on my father!

522
00:49:29,924 --> 00:49:35,714
No, no. Even if I make hundreds and thousands of concessions,

523
00:49:35,714 --> 00:49:43,564
he could have at least saved my father's life before he passed.

524
00:49:49,324 --> 00:49:55,774
You said that our relationship was not one of debt but of fate.

525
00:49:58,814 --> 00:50:02,524
And I said you were like a miracle to me.

526
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,674
We were both wrong.

527
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:15,114
You were a curse to me, not a miracle.

528
00:50:16,644 --> 00:50:19,024
And we have an ill-fated relationship.

529
00:50:22,104 --> 00:50:25,784
So from now on, we will never

530
00:50:27,344 --> 00:50:30,094
do anything together ever again.

531
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,890
 Wishes Inn

532
00:51:13,134 --> 00:51:17,384
 Finally, the assignment I had carried as a burden

533
00:51:18,954 --> 00:51:22,594
 for so long was complete.

534
00:51:52,434 --> 00:51:56,744
Your Majesty, these are the issues the Ministers' Committee is bringing before you.

535
00:51:56,744 --> 00:51:59,610
Please take a look.

536
00:52:02,454 --> 00:52:04,954
 Your Majesty!

537
00:52:07,894 --> 00:52:12,350
 I ask for an audience, Your Majesty!

538
00:52:13,124 --> 00:52:18,364
 Your Majesty, I have come!

539
00:52:18,364 --> 00:52:20,654
Your Majesty!

540
00:52:32,034 --> 00:52:34,034
Your Majesty.

541
00:52:41,094 --> 00:52:45,324
I have brought a gift for you, Your Majesty.

542
00:52:47,894 --> 00:52:50,144
Who are you?

543
00:52:50,144 --> 00:52:53,104
Where do you think this is that you would cause such a commotion?

544
00:52:53,104 --> 00:52:56,154
If you do not want to die, leave immediately!

545
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:03,114
Why did you come all the way here?

546
00:53:09,024 --> 00:53:11,804
 Busin: A pass issued by the Ministry of Defense

547
00:53:13,074 --> 00:53:16,214
Did you not give me this to use in moments like this?

548
00:53:17,004 --> 00:53:19,094
You are going to end up in big trouble like this!

549
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:21,864
Stop causing any more trouble and leave!

550
00:53:21,864 --> 00:53:28,884
I am Kang Han Su, who makes a living as an attorney on the outskirts of the city.

551
00:53:28,884 --> 00:53:37,314
Also, I happen to be a friend of His Majesty, the king of this nation.

552
00:53:42,164 --> 00:53:48,654
Your Majesty, I came that I may share with you some good alcohol.

553
00:53:48,654 --> 00:53:50,454
What kind of nonsense are you spewing!

554
00:53:50,454 --> 00:53:54,014
How dare you say someone like you are His Majesty's friend!

555
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,454
It is true.

556
00:54:17,534 --> 00:54:21,934
He is my friend, so put away your swords and clear the way.

557
00:54:29,324 --> 00:54:33,250
Your Majesty's grace knows no bounds.

558
00:54:46,764 --> 00:54:50,614
Wow, it is quite a beautiful view.

559
00:54:50,614 --> 00:54:52,814
The palace is truly a palace.

560
00:54:52,814 --> 00:54:57,894
These pavilions are all built large and strong with class.

561
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:03,294
Even the trees, flowers, and stones look like they are gilded with gold.

562
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:08,014
Gosh, and this breeze is something.

563
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:12,694
Even the smell differs from the strong winds blowing over the Mapo ferry dock.

564
00:55:12,694 --> 00:55:17,084
No, I should call it a fragrance rather than a smell.

565
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:20,914
Was it Park of the plum wine?

566
00:55:20,914 --> 00:55:24,274
Is he running his business without any problems now?

567
00:55:25,694 --> 00:55:31,564
Are you only curious about that now?

568
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:40,494
Now, you are finally starting to take an interest in the people.

569
00:55:41,904 --> 00:55:46,994
I mean, I suppose you must be so preoccupied thinking about

570
00:55:46,994 --> 00:55:50,554
how you can retake your royal power from Minister Yu.

571
00:55:50,554 --> 00:55:53,854
How could you come all the way to the palace with no shame

572
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:57,504
after handling the Late Kwon case like that?

573
00:55:57,504 --> 00:56:00,124
Do you not care for your life?

574
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,854
Why would I die?

575
00:56:02,854 --> 00:56:07,154
You would protect me to the end with everything you have, Your Majesty.

576
00:56:07,154 --> 00:56:09,554
Would I do that for you?

577
00:56:09,554 --> 00:56:11,244
Why is that?

578
00:56:11,944 --> 00:56:15,094
Have you not yet heard from the princess?

579
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:18,674
About who I am.

580
00:56:27,514 --> 00:56:29,464
All right.

581
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:33,904
Do not tell the princess.

582
00:56:33,904 --> 00:56:36,534
- Yes. 
- About what?

583
00:56:37,324 --> 00:56:38,854
Oh...

584
00:56:52,254 --> 00:56:54,284
Wait, Princess!

585
00:56:54,284 --> 00:56:55,974
 What are you trying to do...

586
00:56:55,974 --> 00:56:58,444
 Why did you come to the palace?

587
00:56:59,174 --> 00:57:05,224
So did you come to tell me to repay the debt the late king owed your father

588
00:57:05,224 --> 00:57:07,844
and to nag me about repaying the debt?

589
00:57:07,844 --> 00:57:11,724
Even if I added all the annual interest

590
00:57:11,724 --> 00:57:15,324
and receive tens of thousands in gold,

591
00:57:16,024 --> 00:57:20,194
I would not be able to get back my parents' life.

592
00:57:25,834 --> 00:57:29,704
I just wanted to be able to see for myself

593
00:57:29,704 --> 00:57:32,744
what kind of amazing place that you all live in

594
00:57:32,744 --> 00:57:36,284
and what amazing things you all enjoyed

595
00:57:36,284 --> 00:57:40,854
that you would think of people's lives as trivial and easily end them.

596
00:57:42,154 --> 00:57:45,124
Well, it sure is quite luxurious and dazzling.

597
00:57:46,294 --> 00:57:48,434
Thus, as your friend

598
00:57:50,124 --> 00:57:55,474
I dare make a sincere request to you, Your Majesty.

599
00:57:57,164 --> 00:57:59,354
Your Majesty,

600
00:58:00,154 --> 00:58:06,254
please prove that you can protect your people.

601
00:58:24,744 --> 00:58:28,344
I am being asked to prove things from all over.

602
00:58:28,344 --> 00:58:30,634
- Pardon? 
- Your Majesty,

603
00:58:30,634 --> 00:58:33,984
Mayor Yu has arrived.

604
00:58:35,084 --> 00:58:39,624
The Mayor of Hanseongbu, Yu Ji Seon, greets you, Your Majesty.

605
00:58:39,624 --> 00:58:42,134
Welcome, Mayor Yu.

606
00:59:06,344 --> 00:59:07,734
What brings you here?

607
00:59:07,734 --> 00:59:11,234
Are you asking me why I came here or why I am still alive?

608
00:59:11,234 --> 00:59:12,684
How about both?

609
00:59:12,684 --> 00:59:14,894
Then it means you are unhappy about both.

610
00:59:14,894 --> 00:59:17,374
It just seems that you are extremely lucky.

611
00:59:17,374 --> 00:59:19,764
I told you it is not luck but ability.

612
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:23,064
And when it comes to luck, I heard nobody can top you.

613
00:59:23,064 --> 00:59:26,284
I heard your umbilical cord was gilded in gold from birth.

614
00:59:26,284 --> 00:59:28,054
What did you say?

615
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:34,004
Mayor Yu was invited by my grandmother,

616
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:37,614
and I will say I invited you.

617
00:59:38,744 --> 00:59:40,794
Is today a special day?

618
00:59:40,794 --> 00:59:43,834
Today is Princess Yeon Ju's birthday.

619
00:59:44,504 --> 00:59:48,414
Thus, please celebrate with us since you are here anyway.

620
00:59:50,714 --> 00:59:52,954
I am sorry, Your Majesty,

621
00:59:52,954 --> 00:59:55,314
but I do not think it is an occasion I should participate in,

622
00:59:55,314 --> 00:59:58,104
so I will leave now.

623
01:00:12,254 --> 01:00:15,724
When did he ever care where he should participate or not?

624
01:00:26,584 --> 01:00:28,194
Birthday?

625
01:00:28,194 --> 01:00:29,674
 It is my birthday.

626
01:00:29,674 --> 01:00:32,554
 Today is Baekjoong Day. It is a birthday for all workers.

627
01:00:32,554 --> 01:00:35,604
 No, it is my real birthday.

628
01:00:35,604 --> 01:00:37,774
 They are your birthday gift.

629
01:00:42,224 --> 01:00:44,584
Liar.

630
01:00:47,094 --> 01:00:49,524
Princess!

631
01:00:49,524 --> 01:00:50,984
Princess!

632
01:00:50,984 --> 01:00:52,254
Oh, Princess!

633
01:00:52,254 --> 01:00:53,794
Let go of me!

634
01:00:53,794 --> 01:00:56,464
Are you okay?

635
01:00:56,464 --> 01:00:58,654
What are you doing?

636
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:07,154
These are not what I usually wear.

637
01:01:09,454 --> 01:01:10,984
I threw them away.

638
01:01:10,984 --> 01:01:15,144
- What? 
- Since they are not yours, Princess.

639
01:01:15,144 --> 01:01:17,684
They were So Won's.

640
01:01:19,424 --> 01:01:22,604
Whatever you decide, Princess, I will follow your decision.

641
01:01:22,604 --> 01:01:29,264
However, I cannot watch you going back and forth.

642
01:01:37,144 --> 01:01:38,844
Princess—

643
01:02:46,184 --> 01:02:48,224
Mayor Yu.

644
01:02:49,024 --> 01:02:51,464
Eat up.

645
01:02:52,614 --> 01:02:56,054
Thank you for your grace, Grand Queen Dowager.

♫  Wiping away the tears that flow white  ♫

652
01:03:46,834 --> 01:03:50,434
♫  Traversing memories  ♫

653
01:03:50,434 --> 01:03:54,584
♫  Affectionately calling your name  ♫

654
01:03:54,584 --> 01:04:01,030
I once prayed while putting flower shoes on you, Princess,

655
01:04:03,284 --> 01:04:06,554
that they will take you to wherever you want to go,

656
01:04:06,554 --> 01:04:12,520
lead you to climb over any walls, and help you go to better places.

657
01:04:14,664 --> 01:04:19,984
But I suppose I overstepped my place making that wish.

658
01:04:19,984 --> 01:04:24,260
♫  As fallen leaves flutter  ♫

659
01:04:25,344 --> 01:04:27,934
Thus,

660
01:04:27,934 --> 01:04:32,164
once again, I sincerely wish

661
01:04:32,164 --> 01:04:38,134
that you will just not walk to where I am.

662
01:04:38,134 --> 01:04:43,384
♫  When familiar memories wake me  ♫

663
01:04:43,384 --> 01:04:51,134
♫  The starlight that embroiders the black night  ♫ 
♫  Speaks to me here  ♫♫

664
01:04:52,364 --> 01:04:55,204
Happy birthday...

665
01:04:56,594 --> 01:04:57,954
Princess.

666
01:04:57,954 --> 01:05:01,534
♫  Turning back time  ♫

667
01:05:01,534 --> 01:05:06,814
♫  As I see you going further away  ♫

668
01:05:06,814 --> 01:05:11,904
♫  I will run and call out your painful name  ♫

669
01:05:11,904 --> 01:05:19,154
♫  Wiping away the tears that flow white  ♫

♫  Affectionately calling your name  ♫

672
01:05:27,974 --> 01:05:33,254
♫  Saying I love you for no reason  ♫

673
01:05:33,254 --> 01:05:39,074
♫  I want to go back to that time and meet you once more ♫

674
01:05:39,074 --> 01:05:43,390
 I have gained another assignment.

675
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:53,934
Are you all right?

676
01:05:53,934 --> 01:05:57,654
 I cannot go to you,

677
01:05:57,654 --> 01:06:04,110
 but I will find a way for us to fight together.

678
01:06:06,724 --> 01:06:10,334
♫  As time passes  ♫

679

♫  We have already become a past moment  ♫

680
01:06:15,584 --> 01:06:20,844
♫  I missed so much I want to embrace you  ♫

681
01:06:20,844 --> 01:06:26,174
♫  And convey my heart with endlessly flowing tears  ♫

682
01:06:26,174 --> 01:06:31,264
♫  And convey my heart with endlessly flowing tears  ♫

683
01:06:33,404 --> 01:06:35,394
What? He came by and bought plum wine?

684
01:06:35,394 --> 01:06:38,194
Yes! Ajeossi Park told me that

685
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:41,954
he was on the way to see a friend who lives in a really, really huge house

686
01:06:41,954 --> 01:06:43,774
and he could not go empty-handed,

687
01:06:43,774 --> 01:06:48,284
so he bought the plum wine that was fermented the longest.

688
01:06:52,554 --> 01:06:55,744
- It is the palace? 
 - Pardon?

689
01:06:56,614 --> 01:06:59,584
This crazy hyeongnim has gone to the palace!

690
01:06:59,584 --> 01:07:02,434
He went to go visit the King!

691
01:07:03,334 --> 01:07:05,234
No way.

692
01:07:05,234 --> 01:07:08,424
What kind of place is the palace that he would go there?

693
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:12,714
Just to cross an ordinary government office, you needed to risk your butt.

694
01:07:12,714 --> 01:07:14,664
So how much more for the palace!

695
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:17,264
To cross the threshold of the palace, you would have to at least—

696
01:07:17,264 --> 01:07:19,314
Risk your life.

697
01:07:19,314 --> 01:07:21,774
 That is what we mean!

698
01:07:23,754 --> 01:07:25,894
W-Wait.

699
01:07:27,584 --> 01:07:29,244
Pardon?

700
01:07:31,974 --> 01:07:35,524
D-Do you not hear a sound?

701
01:07:35,524 --> 01:07:37,434
A sound?

702
01:07:37,434 --> 01:07:39,244
I do.

703
01:08:00,374 --> 01:08:03,114
- Hyeongnim? 
- Sir!

704
01:08:03,114 --> 01:08:05,684
Oh, are you guys here?

705
01:08:07,264 --> 01:08:09,384
Surprise. Say hello.

706
01:08:09,384 --> 01:08:12,994
This is our office's newest client.

707
01:08:12,994 --> 01:08:15,094
Client?

708
01:08:16,294 --> 01:08:23,204
I will make this baby the true owner of this nation, Joseon.

709
01:08:28,054 --> 01:08:30,674
Oh, is that right?

710
01:08:32,814 --> 01:08:35,964
Do not worry about a thing, baby client.

711
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:46,730

712
01:08:48,534 --> 01:08:51,204
♫  Light you up, I'm on fire  ♫

713
01:08:51,204 --> 01:08:53,744
♫  Got you right down to the hell  ♫

714
01:08:53,744 --> 01:08:57,534
♫  Yeah we singing, oh  ♫

715
01:08:57,534 --> 01:09:00,844
♫  Everybody gotta stand up  ♫
 ♫  Light you up, burn me down  ♫

716
01:09:00,844 --> 01:09:03,944
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

717
01:09:03,944 --> 01:09:05,714
 A land property lawsuit?

718
01:09:05,714 --> 01:09:09,114
 Is there anything we can do to help?

719
01:09:09,114 --> 01:09:10,914
 Just choose one.

720
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:15,984
 Whether it is hypocrisy or jumping to conclusions.

721
01:09:17,524 --> 01:09:21,134
 Does this lawsuit pertain only to me?

722
01:09:21,134 --> 01:09:26,284
 More importantly, the opposing side's attorney is Kang Han Su.

723
01:09:27,834 --> 01:09:33,344
 So are you that famous attorney, Kang Han Su?

724
01:09:34,534 --> 01:09:37,024
 I am glad you came.
