1
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,677
You have lost, Father.

2
00:00:42,907 --> 00:00:48,737
When I have not played any meaningful cards, can we really discuss who has lost or won?

3
00:00:48,737 --> 00:00:52,357
At the least, there could be internal strife in the Hungu Party because of this matter.

4
00:00:52,357 --> 00:00:54,697
There will be complaints about you, too.

5
00:00:54,697 --> 00:00:58,497
Those who turned disloyal will be cleaned out.

6
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:01,387
Empty seats just need to be filled again.

7
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:03,357
Father.

8
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:07,257
Do not be surprised, and mark my words.

9
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:13,837
No relationship lasts forever in this world besides that of parents and children.

10
00:01:13,837 --> 00:01:16,237
Do you understand?

11
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:31,120
 Faithfulness and Filial Piety Throughout the Home

12
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:41,690

13
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:48,747
Young Master!

14
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:01,287
I just did not want to go home.

15
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,727
And I cannot go to Hanseongbu like this.

16
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:08,257
You are welcome here.

17
00:02:08,257 --> 00:02:12,657
This place is your home, so please be at rest.

18
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,627
Do you know what?

19
00:02:21,627 --> 00:02:26,757
That you are the only one who welcomes me when you see me.

20
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:52,857
You are also the only one... who greets me warmly, Young Master.

21
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:17,357
What is the matter?

22
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:22,687
Mayor Yu?

23
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:34,987
It is nothing.

24
00:03:34,987 --> 00:03:37,677
Please go back inside, Young Master.

25
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:04,267
What brings you here, and for what business?

26
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:12,007
 His Majesty told me that the new chief advisor incident stemmed from a saloon in Namchon.

27
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:15,497
The princess is the one who told me...

28
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:21,287
that the food in this place is really great.

29
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:23,237
But I guess she was speaking the truth.

30
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:27,987
Mayor Yu, who has a small appetite, is playing in the skirts of this place's hostess.

31
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:30,807
It is not what you think–

32
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:36,767
I do not know why I have to explain myself to you.

33
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:41,897
Because you are about to marry the princess.

34
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:53,257
I am sorry for what happened earlier.

35
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,107
What?

36
00:04:57,367 --> 00:05:00,077
Your face is different from the one I saw earlier.

37
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:09,107
That was me.

38
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:10,877
Get out of here.

39
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,047
She is the one you saw.

40
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:22,647
Now, then. Please continue with your conversation.

41
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:31,147
I heard Father had saved that child's life.

42
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:35,347
Therefore, I am only looking after her, considering her as my younger sister.

43
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:38,167
Your younger sister? I see.

44
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:41,837
I knew you would not believe me, whatever I say.

45
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:44,037
Do you have anything else to say?

46
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:54,877
Why on Earth are you trying to marry her?

47
00:05:54,877 --> 00:05:56,687
I mean...

48
00:05:57,647 --> 00:06:00,497
whose side are you on, Mayor Yu?

49
00:06:00,497 --> 00:06:02,697
Is it Minister Yu's or the princess'?

50
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:08,237
Will you reconcile the relationship between the princess and the minister with this marriage, or

51
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:12,297
are you going to take down the minister with the princess?

52
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:23,647
Before you marry her, you should first find the answer to that.

53
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:54,047
For now, I played along with your scheme.

54
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,737
But why did you hide earlier?

55
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:03,457
I will ask Kang Han Su directly.

56
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:11,057
I had put him in trouble before... as ordered by Minister Yu.

57
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:13,557
Therefore, I did so without realizing it.

58
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:18,247
Are you telling me you worked as Father's spy or something?

59
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:22,327
I only wanted to repay Minister Yu for his grace.

60
00:07:22,327 --> 00:07:25,757
Is it not a human's moral duty to repay the grace you receive?

61
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:29,157
My father is Kang Han Su's enemy and caused his parents' death.

62
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:34,527
On top of that, he was also deeply involved in the late king's death.

63
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:39,757
Not at all. You must be mistaken, Young Master.

64
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:45,177
I would be happy if that was the case.

65
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,867
 My son is helping your brother.

66
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:08,707
 Endure just a little longer.

67
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:14,897
 There will come a day you will be able to reveal the truth to your brother as well.

68
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:26,417
 A scholar is only used and abandoned by politicians, just like your father!

69
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:30,307
 I will also help you.

70
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:35,637
 Whatever that may be, if it helps you and Young Master.

71
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:27,437
 Episode 13: Nakhwa Vol. 1 - A Flower Falls

72
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:31,797
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

73
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:37,627
Gosh, a guy who is about to be married first thing in the morning...

74
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:40,867
Hey, even you think it is too much, right?

75
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:43,467
You agree it is too much, right?

76
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:47,007
Anyway, men...

77
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:02,037
What is the meaning of this? Be gone at once!

78
00:10:16,337 --> 00:10:20,417
Please calm your anger, Grand Queen Dowager.

79
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:29,087
It is to take the heart of the princess that remains here.

80
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:35,797
This place needs to be gone for her to visit no longer.

81
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:46,117
Please think of the subjects who are making a living by working at the ferry dock.

82
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:53,047
Since she abandoned her status and even her name in this filthy and loud place

83
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:55,987
where everyone gathers,

84
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:59,947
no wonder she gets involved in such grotesque rumors!

85
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:03,167
An attorney?

86
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:06,357
How dare she go around with a mere middle-class attorney?

87
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:10,027
However, Grand Queen Dowager, that matter has already been—

88
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:25,237
I know.

89
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:32,847
I promised the princess to let that man live.

90
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:40,107
However, if the same issue comes to the surface again,

91
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:43,267
there will not be any mercy the second time around.

92
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,447
Please do not worry.

93
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:49,327
I come to this place because I must transfer the business,

94
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:54,727
but Princess has not stepped a foot here since she went back to the palace.

95
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:41,257
 I promised the princess to let that man live.

96
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:28,767
Did you see a ghost or something? Why...

97
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:37,227
Are you marrying Mayor Yu... because of me?

98
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:43,817
Did Grand Queen Dowager make a hostage of me to blackmail you?

99
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,097
You should have told me.

100
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:53,577
How could I tell you?

101
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:56,627
You would have felt angered and betrayed already.

102
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,457
You know that, and yet you still do this?

103
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:06,477
If I have to marry anyway,

104
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:12,297
I wanted to marry so I could be helpful to the Royal Court, the Royal Family, and the nation.

105
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:15,027
I told you...

106
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:21,167
that is the royal family's method and the duty of a princess.

107
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:33,587
Do you know what I really hate?

108
00:14:34,577 --> 00:14:38,597
Saying you will exact revenge on Minister Yu by whatever means.

109
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:43,087
Those reckless eyes telling me you can do anything and saying you will help!

110
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:49,277
Your unnecessarily tough resolve and your dangerous determination...

111
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:58,677
Do not go through with that marriage.

112
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:02,377
I will not allow it.

113
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:07,047
♫  Always be with you  ♫

114

I did not know...

117
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:27,890
but I guess I wanted to hear that.

118
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:33,257
It is fine now since I heard it.

119

 You promised me, then.

 That we would become each other's cheongshimhwan.

130

You seem to be in a good mood.

142
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:52,737
R-Royal Grandmother.

143
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:55,447
Where are you coming from?

144
00:17:55,447 --> 00:17:57,817
Well,

145
00:17:57,817 --> 00:18:00,697
it was suffocating to stay in the palace, so...

146
00:18:00,697 --> 00:18:02,547
So?

147
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:07,957
- I went to the city. 
 - The city?

148
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:10,017
To where and with whom?

149
00:18:10,017 --> 00:18:11,697
It was...

150
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:16,287
with Mayor Yu.

151
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:18,867
Mayor Yu?

152
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:20,197
Yes.

153
00:18:20,197 --> 00:18:24,837
 Princess, Mayor Yu asks to see you.

154
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:28,677
Tell him to come in.

155
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:38,057
Grand Queen Dowager.

156
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:40,697
Princess.

157
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,117
You came at the perfect time.

158
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:46,647
Princess Yeon Ju said she was with—

159
00:18:57,857 --> 00:19:00,427
You forgot to take this.

160
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:04,767
Thank you.

161
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:10,317
You will marry soon, so building your relationship by meeting often will be good.

162
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:21,107
Since you are already here, go to the garden and have a talk while gazing at the moon.

163
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:24,217
Thank you for your grace, Grand Queen Dowager.

164
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:36,417
You really helped me out just now. Thank you.

165
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:38,117
I made the right decision to come.

166
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:42,847
Yes. By the way, where did you get this?

167
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:45,787
I saw you by pure chance, Princess.

168
00:19:56,577 --> 00:20:02,397
I see. I must have been running away from Royal Grandmother then, too.

169
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:08,677
Yes, that is better than her finding you with Attorney Kang.

170
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:15,807
Shall we go outside for now?

171
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:17,167
Sorry?

172
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:21,047
Our elder gave an order, so we need to pretend, at least.

173
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:47,737
It looks like Grand Queen Dowager ordered a special mission for us.

174
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:52,387
Well, it cannot be helped.

175
00:20:52,387 --> 00:20:56,327
Since we are already here, let us stargaze.

176
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:14,817
Right. Did Kang Han Su tell you he met me at the saloon?

177
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:16,507
Sorry?

178
00:21:18,517 --> 00:21:20,387
As I thought, he did not tell you.

179
00:21:20,387 --> 00:21:23,527
He must have misunderstood the relationship between that child and me

180
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:26,947
if he did not even tell you about it.

181
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:29,087
What is your relationship with her?

182
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:35,887
I am not sure. She makes me feel as if I have a younger sister.

183
00:21:37,857 --> 00:21:42,637
And that woman is in love with you, right?

184
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:51,357
How could she not love you when you treat a woman,

185
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:54,327
who was kicked out and had nowhere to go,

186
00:21:54,327 --> 00:22:01,347
like a friend and a younger sister instead of saying she is lowly or unfortunate?

187
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:05,217
Is that so?

188
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:12,617
Was Kang Han Su such a being to you, Princess?

189
00:22:15,387 --> 00:22:18,087
When you were So Won,

190
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:23,967
did he treat you, a broker at an inn, like a friend or a younger sister

191
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:28,247
instead of saying you are lowly or unfortunate?

192
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:31,157
I am sorry. I was only—

193
00:22:31,157 --> 00:22:33,537
I know.

194
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:38,067
Love is not something one can always be returned.

195
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:41,297
I learned it thanks to that child.

196
00:22:43,307 --> 00:22:46,017
It felt strange.

197
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:52,077
I have clearly lived more days, have a higher position, and own more things.

198
00:22:52,077 --> 00:22:56,067
But she was always the one to console and enlighten me.

199
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:59,447
And I have always been on the receiving end.

200
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:09,517
In that case, am I mistaken to think that woman might be Minister Yu's spy?

201
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:15,087
I found out only today as well.

202
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:20,277
Looks like she told you, honestly.

203
00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:23,327
It must have been hard to confess.

204
00:23:29,437 --> 00:23:34,557
And I am sure she did not want me to find out that secret.

205
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:37,747
But if she was able to confess so easily...

206
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:45,287
In some way, there must be another connection between Kang Han Su and that child.

207
00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:47,547
Pardon?

208
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:49,617
But she is not even a courtesan.

209
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:53,037
A woman who is connected to Kang Han Su.

210
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:56,397
I did hear he has a younger sister.

211
00:23:56,397 --> 00:23:58,237
A younger sister?

212
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:04,237
Forget it. Never mind.

213
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:24,397
Look into Kang Han Su's younger sister as quickly as possible.

214
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:26,097
Yes.

215
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:37,687
Gosh, you startled me.

216
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:39,367
What now? Huh?

217
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:41,857
Where the heck did you go with the princess, huh?

218
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:43,937
Just what happened? Huh?

219
00:24:43,937 --> 00:24:45,527
How did you know?

220
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:47,617
Because Hostess Hong was looking everywhere!

221
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:50,007
What is happening?

222
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:57,587
Well, we cleared up our misunderstandings, and while we were at it...

223
00:24:57,587 --> 00:25:00,107
Oh, my! It is so hot. Shall we open some windows?

224
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:03,117
- It is winter right now. 
 - Oh, I forgot.

225
00:25:03,117 --> 00:25:05,917
Huh? What is that? I have never seen it before.

226
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:08,737
- Gosh, stop changing the subject!
 - Aigoo.

227
00:25:08,737 --> 00:25:12,777
- O-Oh, this?
 - Yes.

228
00:25:16,157 --> 00:25:19,667
When you were locked up behind bars, a lady left it here.

229
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:24,247
I used all the money for your medicine, and this is what is left.

230
00:25:24,247 --> 00:25:28,267
Tell me honestly. How much did you stash away?

231
00:25:28,267 --> 00:25:30,707
I really spent all of it.

232
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:38,167
So Won— I mean, they are not from the princess?

233
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,917
No, they are definitely not.

234
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:44,657
I have never heard her voice before. It was a different woman.

235
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:46,917
Who could it be?

236
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:51,127
Well, I thought it was one of the many women who chase you.

237
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:53,507
I do have many women who like me.

238
00:25:53,507 --> 00:25:58,127
There are a lot, but none of them has a lot of money.

239
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,627
That is true.

240
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:05,417
Is it one of my ladies then?

241
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:08,187
Sure.

242
00:26:08,187 --> 00:26:11,117
- Shrimp paste Choi! 
- Right.

243
00:26:11,117 --> 00:26:13,727
No, no, no. She is married.

244
00:26:24,607 --> 00:26:28,187
 My father is Kang Han Su's enemy and caused his parents' death.

245
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:01,147
Cause internal conflict?

246
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:05,877
Yes, I heard that quite a few complaints against Minister Yu have piled up within the Hungu Party.

247
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:10,497
You must shake them up properly at times like this so that they will implode.

248
00:28:10,497 --> 00:28:12,087
In order to do that,

249
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:16,917
it must be someone who has enough influence to cause significant damage to Minister Yu.

250
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:21,137
And we have a person you have been working on so far, do we not?

251
00:28:21,137 --> 00:28:26,037
 Your Majesty, Left State Minister Choi has arrived.

252
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,907
Allow him to enter.

253
00:29:07,317 --> 00:29:11,337
Lately, His Majesty has sought Left State Minister's audience often.

254
00:29:11,337 --> 00:29:16,977
Yes, he will pass the duties of Hall of Worthies* to the Office of Special Advisors.  (Royal Research Institute)

255
00:29:16,977 --> 00:29:23,107
Therefore, he asked Left State Minister to be in charge of the Office of Special Advisors.

256
00:29:23,107 --> 00:29:26,107
The Office of Special Advisors, you say?

257
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:28,877
From the lowest position to the highest position in that office,

258
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:31,787
they are all filled by Sarim Party's people.

259
00:29:34,597 --> 00:29:38,317
Hence, a lot of people in the Hungu Party are also

260
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:42,517
worried Left State Minister might be allying with His Majesty and Sarim Party.

261
00:29:49,297 --> 00:29:52,337
Inspector Jo Chang Wu from the Office of Inspector General

262
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:56,117
will also serve as Head of Human Resources starting today.

263
00:29:56,117 --> 00:30:01,747
Dedicate your body and mind to ending the corruption regarding appointing officials.

264
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:08,797
However, Your Majesty...

265
00:30:11,637 --> 00:30:14,957
for an official from the Office of Inspector General to oversee the appointment of officials

266
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:18,197
is an act of violating the exclusive rights of Human Resources.

267
00:30:18,197 --> 00:30:19,987
That is true, Your Majesty.

268
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:25,297
If that happens, only those the King favors will get appointed.

269
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:34,197
There seem to exist errors in what Minister Yu and Right State Minister said.

270
00:30:41,737 --> 00:30:47,957
Officials from the Office of Inspector General only audit and impeach other officials.

271
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:52,027
They are not chamberlains who are the King's ears and mouth

272
00:30:52,027 --> 00:30:55,047
or messengers who deliver the King's order.

273
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:59,237
They are officials who must be the fairest and the most righteous.

274
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:03,827
For what reason are you making them out to be puppets of the King?

275
00:31:10,997 --> 00:31:15,220
Could you have already forgotten the recent bribed appointment incident?

276
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,090
 Personnel requests for border appointments

277
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,847
Although it was not Minister Yu's intention,

278
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:25,967
I discovered there are a lot of people who consider

279
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:31,157
bribery to be a shortcut to success, without an inch of shame in committing the act.

280
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:35,787
Therefore, I want to crack down on the corruption in Human Resources in regard to appointments.

281
00:31:35,787 --> 00:31:39,757
I am not attempting to influence the appointments myself.

282
00:31:39,757 --> 00:31:42,147
However, Your Majesty...

283
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:55,517
- However– 
- I will dedicate my body and mind!

284
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,457
 We will uphold your order!

285
00:32:20,127 --> 00:32:24,917
I cannot believe Left State Minister clearly supported the King's order like that!

286
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:28,887
Is this not a display of his will to be standing on the King's side from now on?

287
00:32:28,887 --> 00:32:34,517
I am not sure if we should just believe in Minister Yu like this.

288
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:37,277
What are you saying right now?

289
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:42,147
Frankly, we were the only ones to lose because of the land dispute.

290
00:32:42,147 --> 00:32:44,107
I did feel mistreated.

291
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:49,557
It would not have been this bad if Minister Yu had been more actively engaged.

292
00:32:49,557 --> 00:32:54,307
On top of that, widespread rumors say Mayor Yu is marrying Princess Yeon Ju.

293
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:57,697
If he marries into the royal family, he cannot hold a public office, either.

294
00:32:57,697 --> 00:33:04,887
So Minister Yu's status is also at peril because his clever son has been his only hope.

295
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:08,897
I mean, it has been in peril for a while now.

296
00:33:08,897 --> 00:33:12,377
Since Chief Advisor Park, who was his loyal servant, killed himself

297
00:33:12,377 --> 00:33:17,477
and Lord Chu also passed away, we can say his limbs have been cut off.

298
00:33:18,377 --> 00:33:21,547
Minister Yu's age must be coming to an end now, too.

299
00:33:21,547 --> 00:33:23,987
Watch your mouth.

300
00:33:31,557 --> 00:33:36,027
Have you decided to stand on the King's side?

301
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:38,557
Side, you say?

302
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:41,227
I am the King's subject, for sure.

303
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:45,047
Whose subject would I be, then?

304
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:51,097
Were we not working for Joseon in our own ways?

305
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:56,797
Therefore, I thought we had been respecting each other's will and method.

306
00:33:56,797 --> 00:34:01,857
by not interfering with each other's work.

307
00:34:01,857 --> 00:34:04,117
Yes, we did.

308
00:34:05,027 --> 00:34:09,257
It is only right to do so.

309
00:34:30,187 --> 00:34:33,427
I left something at the workshop.

310
00:34:54,997 --> 00:34:58,247
There is a ledger.

311
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:07,067
It is the foundation of Minister Yu's authority and power.

312
00:35:39,517 --> 00:35:41,937
 Did you finish cleaning up His Excellency's room?

313
00:35:41,937 --> 00:35:43,697
 Yes.

314
00:37:02,897 --> 00:37:08,307
 Petition to the emperor: Chu Young Wu, Park Je Su received bribery...

315
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:24,607
 From Legal Officer, Kang Eon Jik

316
00:37:31,157 --> 00:37:33,667
 Welcome home, Your Excellency.

317
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,967
Kang Eun Su.

318
00:37:54,187 --> 00:37:55,917
Young Master.

319
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:57,817
It is you.

320
00:37:58,747 --> 00:38:00,967
You were Eun Su.

321
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:39,437
Where are we going?

322
00:38:39,437 --> 00:38:41,707
To Kang Han Su.

323
00:38:42,647 --> 00:38:44,677
No, I cannot.

324
00:38:45,427 --> 00:38:51,367
I will not ask what you were doing in Father's room and why you were carrying a dagger.

325
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:52,857
But in return, let us go to Kang Han Su.

326
00:38:52,857 --> 00:38:57,177
When we get there, I will tell him to take you and leave the city

327
00:38:57,177 --> 00:38:59,707
as far away and quickly as possible.

328
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:06,047
My orabeoni knows nothing.

329
00:39:06,737 --> 00:39:10,707
I wish for him to continue that way.

330
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:15,467
I do not want to show myself to him in this manner.

331
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:17,777
Of course, you feel that way.

332
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:23,277
How could you, as Kang Han Su's sister...

333
00:39:45,507 --> 00:39:47,477
I am sorry.

334
00:39:49,057 --> 00:39:54,817
Please, just leave as you are.

335
00:39:57,747 --> 00:40:03,867
So that my father cannot sin against you and your family anymore,

336
00:40:04,617 --> 00:40:06,267
please...

337
00:40:08,747 --> 00:40:11,127
please go somewhere far away.

338
00:40:24,197 --> 00:40:26,697
It is not your fault, Young Master.

339
00:40:26,697 --> 00:40:29,557
It was my fault for being foolish.

340
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:36,247
Young Master, you are different from Minister Yu.

341
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:41,507
Your goals and your path...

342
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:51,287
Thus, please do not try to bear his punishments as well, just because you are his son.

343
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:34,967
 You have lost, Father.

344
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:39,147
 Side, you say? I am the King's subject, for sure.

345
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:42,407
 Whose subject would I be, then?

346
00:41:43,527 --> 00:41:47,757
 Minister Yu's age must be coming to an end now, too.

347
00:42:09,257 --> 00:42:12,607
Bring someone who can die by tomorrow.

348
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,267
It is Minister Yu's order.

349
00:42:39,387 --> 00:42:41,687
Grand Merchant, sir.

350
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:43,677
By chance...

351
00:42:43,677 --> 00:42:44,707
You would not, would you?

352
00:42:44,707 --> 00:42:47,657
What will a merchant not do for a profit?

353
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:50,827
Still, will you sell someone's life for profit?

354
00:42:50,827 --> 00:42:52,867
There is no one in this world who deserves to die.

355
00:42:52,867 --> 00:42:55,667
There are people whose deaths would be helpful.

356
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:59,307
Whether it is to their family or to the world.

357
00:42:59,307 --> 00:43:01,737
Among the slaves who have committed gambling crimes,

358
00:43:01,737 --> 00:43:05,757
bring one who has a debt greater than his life's worth.

359
00:43:07,427 --> 00:43:11,047
And tell him I will pay him generously for his life.

360
00:43:17,507 --> 00:43:23,447
I heard my name being called for the first time in over ten years.

361
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:30,787
I am so happy that person was you, Young Master.

362
00:43:32,037 --> 00:43:38,847
I can see why the princess felt so much affection for Kang Han Su.

363
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:45,467
It is because she knew there was no way to repay him for how she felt.

364
00:43:49,297 --> 00:43:54,387
I am like a criminal to you,

365
00:43:54,387 --> 00:44:00,967
and yet, you have been so generous and kind to me.

366
00:44:00,967 --> 00:44:04,667
I have received such love that I cannot repay, even with my life.

367
00:44:05,637 --> 00:44:09,057
- Young Master... 
 - I will protect you.

368
00:44:10,227 --> 00:44:16,197
I will make sure you can live an ordinary and happy life like others,

369
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:21,037
in a safe place where people call you by your name.

370
00:44:21,037 --> 00:44:23,307
I will do that for you.

371
00:44:27,177 --> 00:44:30,457
If that will make you feel at ease,

372
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:35,997
yes, I will do so, Young Master.

373
00:44:35,997 --> 00:44:39,517
- Do you mean that? 
- Yes.

374
00:44:39,517 --> 00:44:42,737
However, give me some time.

375
00:44:44,487 --> 00:44:49,567
I should at least say goodbye to my orabeoni.

376
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:54,247
Okay. In the meantime, I will prepare what is necessary.

377
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:10,890
 Attorney for Hire

378
00:45:19,087 --> 00:45:21,887
Have you come to see the attorney?

379
00:45:23,127 --> 00:45:25,557
Oh, the thing is...

380
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,467
We do not know when he might come.

381
00:45:27,467 --> 00:45:32,047
You should wait inside. It is cold outside.

382
00:45:33,887 --> 00:45:36,327
You should come inside.

383
00:45:36,327 --> 00:45:38,967
- You should come, it's okay! 
- It is so cold outside.

384
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:41,717
You should wait inside.

385
00:45:43,257 --> 00:45:44,937
Why are we stopping here?

386
00:45:44,937 --> 00:45:46,717
Were we not on our way to a strategy meeting?

387
00:45:46,717 --> 00:45:50,377
We were, but the weather got so cold.

388
00:45:50,377 --> 00:45:53,537
If you want to go to war, you should prepare your equipment first.

389
00:45:53,537 --> 00:45:56,287
What is the point of having wealth? I should use it for times like these.

390
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:59,077
- This one and this one. 
 - Okay.

391
00:46:07,497 --> 00:46:10,027
It is silk!

392
00:46:10,927 --> 00:46:15,237
- So pretty. 
- What would look good on Eun Su...

393
00:46:15,237 --> 00:46:17,177
Come here.

394
00:46:19,787 --> 00:46:22,697
How is it? Do you like it?

395
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,627
If you put stripes on a pumpkin, does it turn into a watermelon?

396
00:46:31,427 --> 00:46:34,877
Well, how about this?

397
00:46:39,207 --> 00:46:42,137
Since your skin is fair, Eun Su,

398
00:46:42,137 --> 00:46:43,857
this will look pretty on you, too.

399
00:46:43,857 --> 00:46:46,067
- Do you like it? 
- Yeah.

400
00:46:47,177 --> 00:46:50,577
Mother, give it to me.

401
00:46:50,577 --> 00:46:56,457
You should... wrap it around like this,

402
00:46:56,457 --> 00:46:59,237
and if you do this a bit,

403
00:46:59,237 --> 00:47:01,317
it is way prettier!

404
00:47:01,317 --> 00:47:03,547
Stop it!

405
00:47:06,877 --> 00:47:08,857
This is better.

406
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,087
What are you thinking about?

407
00:47:13,087 --> 00:47:15,907
Oh, nothing.

408
00:47:17,057 --> 00:47:18,867
Here you go.

409
00:47:21,187 --> 00:47:23,147
What do you think of this?

410
00:47:43,017 --> 00:47:45,627
I like it. It is nice.

411
00:47:45,627 --> 00:47:48,407
- You like it?
 - Yeah.

412
00:47:49,937 --> 00:47:53,827
Excuse me, shall I show you baby clothes, too?

413
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:55,027
Sorry?

414
00:47:55,027 --> 00:47:57,957
Prepare early so you do not worry later.

415
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:01,937
We are not like that!

416
00:48:01,937 --> 00:48:05,707
We will come back next time to see that.

417
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,577
Well...

418
00:48:08,577 --> 00:48:11,037
Says who?

419
00:48:11,037 --> 00:48:13,757
Who says? I say so!

420
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,487
I mean, how is that up to you?

421
00:48:16,487 --> 00:48:20,267
Is that something you can decide on your own?

422
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:23,007
Why not?

423
00:48:23,007 --> 00:48:25,117
I mean, we would first have to...

424
00:48:25,117 --> 00:48:27,987
- We would have to?
 - M—

425
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:30,627
- M– 
- M?

426
00:48:30,627 --> 00:48:31,927
- M– 
 - M?

427
00:48:31,927 --> 00:48:34,297
Are you asking because you do not know?

428
00:48:35,137 --> 00:48:39,757
Well, is there a reason we would need to come together?

429
00:48:39,757 --> 00:48:41,327
Pardon?

430
00:48:42,317 --> 00:48:45,597
I was going to buy clothes to gift to Chu Sal's baby.

431
00:48:45,597 --> 00:48:47,077
Pardon?

432
00:49:01,357 --> 00:49:04,307
You brought your consultation fee, right?

433
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:08,707
Our attorney only works if he is paid.

434
00:49:08,707 --> 00:49:11,867
Gosh, Eonni...

435
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:14,137
Feel free to look around.

436
00:49:14,137 --> 00:49:15,517
Eonni!

437
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:19,207
How could you start talking about money when we just met her?

438
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:20,897
She should at least expect that much!

439
00:49:20,897 --> 00:49:23,947
I mean, we heard from Han Su Orabeoni. 
  Law of Ming Dynasty

440
00:49:23,947 --> 00:49:27,087
If someone comes for the first time, we serve them a warm cup of tea  /  Great Collection of Laws

441
00:49:27,087 --> 00:49:29,467
and then proceed with the consultation!

442
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:30,817
Eonni, what are you doing right now?

443
00:49:30,817 --> 00:49:32,827
I am not doing anything! 
 Petitions

444
00:49:32,827 --> 00:49:33,957
Please just be quiet.

445
00:49:33,957 --> 00:49:35,497
I am being quiet!

446
00:49:35,497 --> 00:49:38,687
- Be even quieter. 
- I mean, who does that?

447
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,307
We should give her some tea.

448
00:49:40,307 --> 00:49:42,087
We need to be paid to serve her tea!

449
00:49:42,087 --> 00:49:44,177
- Be quiet. 
- I am being quiet.

450
00:49:44,177 --> 00:49:46,287
Be even quieter.

451
00:50:02,237 --> 00:50:04,407
- Eonni, this again! 
- What is it!

452
00:50:04,407 --> 00:50:06,307
- Be quiet. 
- I am being quiet!

453
00:50:06,307 --> 00:50:09,527
- Be quieter! 
- Seriously...

454
00:50:11,377 --> 00:50:14,657
You see! She left!

455
00:50:14,657 --> 00:50:17,657
Gosh, why did she come if she did not even have money?

456
00:50:58,077 --> 00:51:00,727
What! What is it?

457
00:51:09,497 --> 00:51:11,757
How is this?

458
00:51:11,757 --> 00:51:14,477
Well, I guess it is warm.

459
00:51:14,477 --> 00:51:17,207
I did not do it so you would feel warm.

460
00:51:18,957 --> 00:51:21,417
I am doing it to make you feel fluttery.

461
00:51:29,647 --> 00:51:31,267
How about now?

462
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:33,357
You think this will make someone's heart flutter?

463
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:35,407
I did not do it to make your heart flutter.

464
00:51:35,407 --> 00:51:37,397
I did it to make you feel warm.

465
00:51:37,397 --> 00:51:39,707
Gosh, seriously!

466
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:48,597
I will personally make our baby's clothes myself.

467
00:51:50,537 --> 00:51:55,597
I will change its diapers and carry it on my back.

468
00:51:57,947 --> 00:52:01,697
Having tried it, it is not so bad.

469
00:52:06,027 --> 00:52:08,107
So

470
00:52:10,987 --> 00:52:13,397
just come to me.

471
00:52:15,407 --> 00:52:19,057
It does not matter how long it takes.

472
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:23,267
If we can just be together,

473
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:28,047
it is okay even if it is not here,

474
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:37,077
and even if it is not in this lifetime.

00:53:02,377 --> 00:53:05,997
It does not matter if it takes a long time,

482
00:53:05,997 --> 00:53:10,797
and even if it is not in this lifetime.

483
00:53:10,797 --> 00:53:14,037
I would be happy, even if it were in my dreams.

484
00:53:14,037 --> 00:53:20,767
♫  I missed so much I want to embrace you  ♫

485
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,867
I want to be with you.

486
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:26,380
♫  And convey my heart with endlessly flowing tears ♫

487
00:53:48,277 --> 00:53:49,807
 What is going on?

488
00:53:49,807 --> 00:53:53,077
 Hurry, hurry!

489
00:54:29,137 --> 00:54:31,487
Move aside!

490
00:54:31,487 --> 00:54:33,447
Move aside!

491
00:54:38,547 --> 00:54:40,107
What do you mean, a murder case?

492
00:54:40,107 --> 00:54:41,637
His name is Hwang Bo Geun.

493
00:54:41,637 --> 00:54:45,887
He is a young official appointed as a deputy at the Office of Special Advisors.

494
00:54:45,887 --> 00:54:51,707
He was found dead in the alley behind Gahaebang.

495
00:54:54,217 --> 00:54:56,347
The culprit tried to cover it up as a robbery,

496
00:54:56,347 --> 00:54:59,057
but after catching and interrogating him,

497
00:54:59,957 --> 00:55:03,917
it was found to be a murder due to a love conflict.

498
00:55:03,917 --> 00:55:05,687
Love conflict?

499
00:55:08,547 --> 00:55:10,327
My apologies for having to tell you this,

500
00:55:10,327 --> 00:55:15,267
but the one who died and the murderer both had relations with the same girl.

501
00:55:15,267 --> 00:55:19,797
They fought over who would get the girl, and the murderer killed the other out of anger.

502
00:55:19,797 --> 00:55:24,507
Not only that, but the girl was married to a nobleman.

503
00:55:24,507 --> 00:55:27,297
How could such a horrible crime be committed...

504
00:55:28,047 --> 00:55:32,657
But could not the Ministry of Justice take care of something like this?

505
00:55:39,487 --> 00:55:44,477
The murderer who was captured says more men had relations with that girl

506
00:55:44,477 --> 00:55:49,577
and is naming multiple officials who are in government positions.

507
00:55:49,577 --> 00:55:51,657
Who are they?

508
00:55:52,617 --> 00:55:56,147
Deputy Chief Scholar Jang Myeong Gi of the Office of Special Advisors. Deputy Jang Yoon.

509
00:55:56,147 --> 00:55:59,767
Kim Yong Jae of the Office of Inspector General.

510
00:56:05,247 --> 00:56:10,847
Who is this woman who had adulterous relations with these men?

511
00:56:10,847 --> 00:56:16,827
We do not know her real name, but she runs a saloon in Namchon.

512
00:56:16,827 --> 00:56:19,197
If it is a saloon in Namchon...

513
00:56:19,197 --> 00:56:21,487
Is it that woman we know?

514
00:56:34,837 --> 00:56:38,757
 Minister Yu, what are you plotting?

515
00:56:58,907 --> 00:57:01,697
Close the city gates!

516
00:57:09,107 --> 00:57:12,047
Did something happen?

517
00:57:15,887 --> 00:57:17,827
I must go to the government office to find out.

518
00:57:17,827 --> 00:57:22,267
Then, I will go back and wait.

519
00:57:37,127 --> 00:57:40,257
Your Excellency, will you just watch as this happens?

520
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:41,927
That child, Eun Su!

521
00:57:41,927 --> 00:57:44,927
She is Legal Officer Kang's daughter.

522
00:57:46,877 --> 00:57:49,197
It is about time we threw her away.

523
00:57:49,197 --> 00:57:56,667
If we let that clever and bold child live any longer, she will point a knife at my neck.

524
00:57:58,427 --> 00:58:03,157
By chance, did you set this up, Your Excellency?

525
00:58:07,267 --> 00:58:11,267
On the off chance that His Majesty decides to dig deeper into this,

526
00:58:11,267 --> 00:58:16,357
many of our people will be dragged into this!

527
00:58:16,357 --> 00:58:19,217
I did this for that reason.

528
00:58:20,727 --> 00:58:26,707
Those who want to live will come and kneel at my feet.

529
00:58:39,237 --> 00:58:41,847
It is the criminal's house! Look for anything that might be corroborating evidence!

530
00:58:41,847 --> 00:58:44,797
- Search everywhere!
  - Yes, sir!

531
00:58:46,407 --> 00:58:48,607
Why are you doing this?

532
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,197
Please let go of me.

533
00:58:55,987 --> 00:58:58,577
- Ah Ri! 
- Lady!

534
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,517
Get her!

535
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:49,137
Aigoo, Attorney Kang!

536
00:59:49,757 --> 00:59:51,727
- What is going on? 
- How would I know?

537
00:59:51,727 --> 00:59:55,267
Supposedly, it is the owner of the saloon at the end of the street.

538
00:59:55,267 --> 00:59:58,577
She is being dragged to the Royal Investigation Bureau, not the Ministry of Justice.

539
00:59:58,577 --> 01:00:01,317
Maybe it had to do with the dead man in Jongro yesterday.

540
01:00:01,317 --> 01:00:04,287
The dead man was a nobleman and an official of the Royal Court.

541
01:00:04,287 --> 01:00:07,107
Then, it would make sense for the Royal Investigation Bureau to come!

542
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:09,007
Yeah?

543
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:19,007
His Majesty requests to meet with you urgently.

544
01:00:19,007 --> 01:00:20,757
Please get in.

545
01:00:26,027 --> 01:00:28,877
It appears Minister Yu has played a major hand.

546
01:00:28,877 --> 01:00:32,997
He is sacrificing one of his arms for this high-level strategy.

547
01:00:32,997 --> 01:00:38,757
He probably decided that it was better to use the fact that he has been caught by me.

548
01:00:39,957 --> 01:00:42,527
You should not only lose your people.

549
01:00:42,527 --> 01:00:47,717
Of course not. I will definitely have that girl put to death.

550
01:00:48,407 --> 01:00:53,387
I should do at least that much to deal a blow to Minister Yu.

551
01:00:55,137 --> 01:00:57,467
Any ideas?

552
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:00,317
Who am I?

553
01:01:20,757 --> 01:01:24,957
It is the King, His Majesty. Pay your respect.

554
01:01:27,957 --> 01:01:29,817
Your Majesty!

555
01:01:37,837 --> 01:01:42,217
Are you really the King?

556
01:01:43,017 --> 01:01:47,457
You will... surely die.

557
01:01:48,957 --> 01:01:51,697
Do you have any last words?

558
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:09,757
I would like to... touch the King's face just once.

559
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:30,437
Just from looking at you, you do not seem much different from anyone else.

560
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:36,297
Your hair, eyes, skin...

561
01:02:38,307 --> 01:02:41,087
You are just another person.

562
01:02:42,267 --> 01:02:43,877
Why...

563
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:51,727
did so many people's blood have to be shed to establish you as king?

564
01:02:56,797 --> 01:03:02,877
 Why... did my parents...

565
01:03:02,877 --> 01:03:08,247
 have to be sacrificed so unjustly?

566
01:03:11,427 --> 01:03:14,027
What a mess.

567
01:03:18,067 --> 01:03:19,457
Huh?

568
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:24,247
You...

569
01:03:30,857 --> 01:03:34,757
 I am sorry for what happened earlier.

570
01:03:34,757 --> 01:03:36,877
 Huh?

571
01:03:36,877 --> 01:03:39,557
 That was me.

572
01:03:39,557 --> 01:03:41,467
It was not you, after all.

573
01:03:41,467 --> 01:03:44,567
There was no way my eyes saw wrong.

574
01:03:44,567 --> 01:03:46,637
Then who was the one who was just arrested?

575
01:03:46,637 --> 01:03:49,057
Is she your mistress?

576
01:03:49,057 --> 01:03:51,457
Why did your mistress get arrested—

577
01:03:52,257 --> 01:03:55,007
Please save us, sir.

578
01:03:55,007 --> 01:03:57,477
Please save us!

579
01:04:01,377 --> 01:04:03,257
My Lady.

580
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:06,827
Please save My Lady!

581
01:04:46,737 --> 01:04:51,707
What is your mistress's name?

582
01:04:57,117 --> 01:04:59,817
Answer me!

583
01:04:59,817 --> 01:05:02,697
It is Kang Eun Su.

584
01:05:17,367 --> 01:05:21,037
 Why do you keep crying? Should I not go?

585
01:05:21,037 --> 01:05:23,327
 Gosh, do not say such a thing!

586
01:05:23,327 --> 01:05:25,187
 Of course, you should go. Why would you not?

587
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:27,797
 They say it is the house of a nobleman.

588
01:05:28,617 --> 01:05:32,497
 For our household, this is a great marriage offer.

589
01:05:32,497 --> 01:05:34,677
My daughter,

590
01:05:35,697 --> 01:05:38,177
 you cannot do anything about the family you were born into,

591
01:05:38,177 --> 01:05:41,417
 but you should live a different life for the remainder of your life.

592
01:05:42,417 --> 01:05:46,797
 Being treated well as the wife of a nobleman.

593
01:05:46,797 --> 01:05:50,367
 And my grandsons and granddaughters should live as nobility as well.

594
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:54,397
 I am happy that I was born as the daughter of Mother and Father.

595
01:05:54,397 --> 01:05:57,817
 I could live forever like this if I needed to—

596
01:06:00,147 --> 01:06:01,837
 What is this?

597
01:06:02,737 --> 01:06:04,277
 How embarrassing!

598
01:06:04,277 --> 01:06:06,667
 - Eun Su put on makeup! 
- Darn.

599
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:09,917
 It is all your fault that I am getting married, Orabeoni!

600
01:06:09,917 --> 01:06:12,867
 I cannot stand to see your face!

601
01:06:13,907 --> 01:06:16,037
 Go away!

602
01:06:17,867 --> 01:06:21,107
 It is not makeup but a disguise!

603
01:06:27,147 --> 01:06:30,047
 I will always leave the door open

604
01:06:30,047 --> 01:06:32,687
 so that you can come home at any time.

605
01:06:32,687 --> 01:06:36,367
 They say that a daughter who's been married off is no longer part of the original family,

606
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:39,217
 but I do not believe in that.

607
01:06:39,217 --> 01:06:45,017
 Eun Su, you will always be my and Father's daughter.

608
01:06:45,967 --> 01:06:51,247
 So if anything happens, or if your in-laws abuse you,

609
01:06:51,247 --> 01:06:54,407
 return home at any time, okay?

610
01:06:54,407 --> 01:06:56,677
 Okay, Mom.

611
01:06:57,757 --> 01:07:01,777
 In return, I will come when Orabeoni is not home.

612
01:07:12,597 --> 01:07:18,247
 Orabeoni, are you going to come and visit me?

613
01:07:19,267 --> 01:07:20,687
 Of course.

614
01:07:20,687 --> 01:07:23,787
 You really have to come.

615
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:28,867
 To be honest, I am scared.

616
01:07:28,867 --> 01:07:31,877
 I will definitely visit you.

617
01:07:34,197 --> 01:07:36,077
 Promise.

618
01:07:39,587 --> 01:07:41,437
 I promise.

619
01:08:47,747 --> 01:08:49,397
You...

620
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:04,167
Why are you...

621
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:06,517
Why are you here?

622
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:07,977
How...

623
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,497
Why are you here?

624
01:09:31,257 --> 01:09:33,227
Eun Su...

625
01:09:38,127 --> 01:09:40,437
Eun Su!

626
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:46,577
Orabeoni.

627
01:09:49,247 --> 01:09:51,317
Orabeoni.

628
01:09:52,077 --> 01:09:54,067
I am sorry.

629
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:16,640

630
01:10:17,767 --> 01:10:22,250
 We worked with animal experts for scenes involving animals for their safety.

631
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:30,327
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

632
01:10:30,327 --> 01:10:33,047
 Help me save Eun Su.

633
01:10:34,237 --> 01:10:37,287
 I will pay a million gold if needed!

634
01:10:38,087 --> 01:10:42,807
 Will you really not regret it?

635
01:10:43,737 --> 01:10:50,297
 I am sure you have come expecting what my answer would be already.

636
01:10:52,127 --> 01:10:57,097
 When a person dies, supposedly, they become a star.

637
01:10:57,877 --> 01:11:00,587
 I will become a magnolia.

638
01:11:01,927 --> 01:11:08,377
 So, Orabeoni, do not cry because of me.
