(All people, incidents, and periods in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,740
Father, it is your loss.

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,489
I have not taken the trouble to play an elaborate move.

4
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:17,419
So is there any meaning in deciding the outcome?

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,559
At the least, this incident can cause conflict within Hungu,

6
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,690
and a complaint will arise against you.

7
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:26,900
Those who have betrayed my trust will be dealt with.

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,800
I can always fill up the vacancy.

9
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:31,699
Father.

10
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,709
Do not be alarmed and take my words to your heart.

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,639
No relationship in this world remains the same forever,

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,879
other than blood relations.

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,309
Do you understand?

14
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,779
Magistrate Yoo.

15
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,659
I did not want to go home.

16
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,829
And I could not go to Hanseongbu looking like this.

17
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,570
I am glad you are here.

18
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:40,770
This is your home. Please get your rest.

19
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,680
Did you know?

20
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:52,719
You are the only one...

21
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:55,049
who welcomes me gladly.

22
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,610
You are also the only one...

23
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,840
who receives me warmly.

24
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,400
What is going on?

25
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,840
Magistrate Yoo?

26
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:02,650
It is nothing.

27
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:05,590
Let us go inside.

28
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,979
What brings you here?

29
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,420
What is the occasion?

30
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,360
The incident with the new commissioner broke out...

31
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,059
at the bar in Namchon for middle-class women and widows.

32
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:43,529
The Princess has informed me...

33
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,830
that the food here is wonderful.

34
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,340
And it must be true.

35
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,240
You are not a man with a big appetite,

36
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,870
yet you are here hanging out with the lady of the house.

37
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,740
Is it not what you think...

38
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:04,779
I do not understand why I owe you an explanation.

39
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:10,150
Because you are about to marry the Princess.

40
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,099
I apologize for my discourtesy just now.

41
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,570
What?

42
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,140
You are not the woman I just saw.

43
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,580
I am the one you just saw.

44
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,450
No, you are not...

45
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,219
It was her.

46
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:49,029
Then please,

47
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:50,659
enjoy your conversation.

48
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,770
I heard my father saved her life.

49
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,510
So I think of her like a sister, and I simply look after her.

50
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,109
Like a sister? Sure.

51
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,810
I knew you would not believe me no matter what I said.

52
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,320
Is there anything else you would like to say?

53
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,060
Why are you...

54
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,289
getting into this marriage?

55
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,159
No.

56
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,369
Whose side are you on?

57
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,770
Executive Minister Yoo? The Princess?

58
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,469
Will you marry her and try to reconcile...

59
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:36,369
Executive Minister Yoo and the Princess?

60
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,310
Or will you take her side and help her bring him down?

61
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:48,650
You should find...

62
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:51,719
the answer before you marry her.

63
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,500
Goodness.

64
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,650
I played along with you,

65
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:24,719
but why did you hide from him?

66
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,489
I will inquire Kang Han Soo myself.

67
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:34,830
I once put him in trouble...

68
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,900
under the order of Executive Minister Yoo.

69
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,609
So I hid without realizing it.

70
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:46,479
Have you been spying on him for my father?

71
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:50,549
I just wanted to repay the kindness Executive Minister Yoo showed.

72
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,849
Is it not proper...

73
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,619
to return one's kindness once I am indebted?

74
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:57,190
My father caused the death of Kang Han Soo's parents.

75
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,060
That is not all.

76
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,289
He was deeply involved in the death of the former King.

77
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:04,900
No.

78
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,859
I am sure you have the wrong information.

79
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,169
I would rather hope so.

80
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:31,960
My son has been helping your older brother.

81
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:36,690
Hang in there a little longer.

82
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,060
There will come a day...

83
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,869
when you will share the truth with your brother.

84
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,140
Scholars are always used and abandoned by politicians,

85
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,510
just like your father.

86
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,179
I will help you too.

87
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,750
If it is something...

88
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,750
that will help you and your son.

89

(Episode 13: Falling Blossoms 1)

90
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,580
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

91
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,180
That is a man who is about to marry soon,

92
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,479
yet he is already at a bar early in the morning.

93
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,719
Hey, do you not think this is just awful?

94
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,519
Right? It is awful.

95
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,030
Goodness, men.

96
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,670
What are you doing?

97
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,170
You must leave at once!

98
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,719
Please do not be angered,

99
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,460
Grand Queen Dowager.

100
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,359
I am here...

101
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:57,099
to take the heart of the Princess which remains here.

102
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,269
This place must disappear...

103
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,739
to stop her from coming here.

104
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:11,509
There are people who barely make a living in this neighbourhood.

105
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,920
Please watch over them.

106
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,759
This place is filthy and noisy...

107
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,989
because of all the low-class people.

108
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,690
She has been living here with no status or name.

109
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,830
That is why she gets herself involved in such a vulgar scandal.

110
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,830
An attorney!

111
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:35,040
An attorney from the middle class?

112
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,969
But Grand Queen Dowager, that was already...

113
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,389
I know.

114
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,190
I have promised the Princess...

115
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,800
that I would keep him alive.

116
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,530
However,

117
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:07,639
if I see the same issue again,

118
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,040
I will not show mercy.

119
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,009
Put your worries to rest.

120
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:17,310
I merely come to this place to hand it over.

121
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,019
The Princess has never come back here...

122
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:22,590
since she moved back into the palace.

123
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:06,830
I have promised the Princess...

124
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,170
that I would keep him alive.

125
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:56,749
Have you seen a ghost or what?

126
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:01,450
Are you marrying Magistrate Yoo...

127
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,219
because of me?

128
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,359
Did Grand Queen Dowager force you to marry him...

129
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:11,830
by promising to keep me alive?

130
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,030
You should have told me.

131
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:21,499
How should I?

132
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:25,280
You already felt betrayed and got angered.

133
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,340
You knew that and still kept it from me?

134
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,680
If I must get married eventually,

135
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:36,790
I wanted to help...

136
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:40,320
the Royal Court, the Royal Family, and this state.

137
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,160
As I told you,

138
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,759
that is the way of the Royal Family...

139
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,229
and the princess's responsibility.

140
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,410
Do you know what I hate the most?

141
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,950
The look you give me as you think,

142
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,280
"I will get back at the executive minister."

143
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:10,149
"I can do anything. I will help you."

144
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,519
Those reckless eyes!

145
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,160
Your pointlessly firm determination.

146
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,259
And your dangerous resolutions.

147
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:26,599
Do not go through with that wedding.

148
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,340
I will not allow it.

149
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,619
I didn't realize,

150
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,759
but I think I wanted to hear you say that.

151
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,410
It is all good now. I heard it.

152
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:08,080
So Won.

153
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,219
Whatever anyone says,

154
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,690
you are So Won to me.

155
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,129
That is why I will protect you.

156
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,160
So,

157
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,399
keep your promise.

158
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,599
So, you promised.

159
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,710
We will be each other's cheongsimhwan...

160
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,580
and always be there.

161
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,899
I am allowed to do this...

162
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:07,499
since I am So Won, right?

163
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:17,770
You seem delighted.

164
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:20,439
Grandmother.

165
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:23,379
Where have you been?

166
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,250
Well, it...

167
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,290
felt stuffy to stay in the palace, so...

168
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,820
So?

169
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,590
- The capital... - The capital?

170
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,590
Where? With who?

171
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:40,060
It was...

172
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,470
Magistrate Yoo.

173
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:46,699
Magistrate Yoo?

174
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:48,970
Yes.

175
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,939
Princess, Magistrate Yoo would like to see you.

176
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,609
Let him in.

177
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:05,820
Grand Queen Dowager.

178
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,859
Princess Yeon Joo.

179
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,189
You came at the right time.

180
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,730
Princess Yeon Joo says...

181
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:28,480
You left this.

182
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:32,780
Thank you.

183
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,480
You will get married soon,

184
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,149
so it is probably best to get more intimate.

185
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,300
You came all the way here, so spend some time with her...

186
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:49,330
while watching the moon in the back garden.

187
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,240
Thank you, Grand Queen Dowager.

188
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:05,179
She let me off the hook, thanks to you.

189
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,879
I was wise to come here.

190
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,790
Yes, you were. By the way, where did you find this?

191
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:13,790
I accidentally saw you.

192
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,139
I must have been running away from my grandmother.

193
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,510
Yes.

194
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:35,340
You would rather run away than let her see you...

195
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,550
with Attorney Kang.

196
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,020
How about we step outside?

197
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:45,959
Sorry?

198
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,230
She ordered us to spend some time, so we must listen.

199
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,720
It seems the Grand Queen Dowager...

200
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,849
made a special command for us.

201
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,560
It cannot be helped, I guess.

202
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:23,129
Now that things turned out this way,

203
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:24,359
why do we not just watch the stars?

204
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:39,409
Oh, right.

205
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,639
Did Kang Han Soo tell you...

206
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:43,280
that he ran into me at the bar for middle-class women and widows?

207
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,209
Pardon?

208
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:48,980
So he did not.

209
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,250
I think he got the wrong idea about me and her,

210
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,859
seeing how he kept it from you.

211
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,429
Then what is your relationship with her?

212
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,560
Well...

213
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:01,899
She lets me have a glimpse...

214
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:03,929
of how it feels to have a sister.

215
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:08,500
That lady...

216
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,669
loves you, does she not?

217
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,050
She was kicked out and had nowhere to go.

218
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:23,050
You did not call her lowly or unlucky.

219
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,820
Instead, you treat her like a friend and a sister.

220
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,560
How could she possibly not love you?

221
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,500
Is that right?

222
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:36,899
To you,

223
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,699
was Kang Han Soo like that?

224
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,240
When you were So Won,

225
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:49,709
you were just a female broker working at the merchant house.

226
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,780
But did he treat you like a friend and a sister...

227
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,389
instead of calling you lowly or unlucky?

228
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:00,290
I apologize. I...

229
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,459
I know.

230
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:04,189
Not every love...

231
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,260
can be both-sided.

232
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:09,500
She taught me so.

233
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,770
It was fascinating.

234
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:17,570
I was certainly older than her...

235
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,280
and higher than her in rank with more fortunes.

236
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,349
But it was always her who comforted and taught me.

237
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,580
I was always on the receiving end.

238
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,919
Then could it be...

239
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,659
my misunderstanding to wonder...

240
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,530
if she was Executive Minister Yoo's spy?

241
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,099
I found it out today.

242
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,040
So she told you honestly.

243
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:51,409
It must not have been easy to confess.

244
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,050
She must have wanted...

245
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,419
to keep it from me of all people.

246
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:05,889
Nevertheless, she confessed that easily.

247
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:14,199
There must be something else between Kang Han Soo and her.

248
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:15,560
Pardon?

249
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,300
But she is not even a courtesan.

250
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,199
A woman in connection with him...

251
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,709
I heard he had a sister.

252
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,740
A sister?

253
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:31,280
Never mind.

254
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,510
It is nothing.

255
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,669
Look into Kang Han Soo's sister...

256
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:52,869
as soon as possible.

257
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,699
Yes, master.

258
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,280
- Han Soo. - Gosh, you startled me.

259
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,480
What is it?

260
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,689
Just where did you go with the Princess?

261
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:12,389
What happened?

262
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,189
How did you know?

263
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:16,730
Lady Hong came looking!

264
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,129
Tell me what happened!

265
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,959
Well...

266
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,570
We just buried the hatchet...

267
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,169
while doing this and that.

268
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,139
Gosh, it is hot.

269
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:29,240
Shall we open the windows?

270
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,869
- It is winter. - Yes, right.

271
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,939
What is that? I have not seen it before.

272
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,609
Stop changing the topic.

273
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,750
- Gosh. - Oh, this?

274
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:46,889
When you were locked up in jail,

275
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,590
some woman left it.

276
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,260
I spent all the money inside on your medicine.

277
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,459
This is what is left.

278
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,560
Be honest with me.

279
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,330
How much did you pocket?

280
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,730
I swear I used it all up.

281
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:07,240
Was it not from So Won... I mean... Was it not from the Princess?

282
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
No, it was definitely not her.

283
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:11,649
Her voice sounded unfamiliar.

284
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,820
Another woman?

285
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,849
Who could it be?

286
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,290
I thought it would be one of the ladies who liked you.

287
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,459
A lot of ladies like me.

288
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,760
But none of them...

289
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,060
are rich, you know.

290
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:30,070
You are right.

291
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:33,570
Then could she have a crush on me?

292
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,409
Whatever.

293
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:38,609
Lady Choi?

294
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:42,080
No, she is married.

295
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:56,159
My father is Kang Han Soo's enemy who brought death to his parents.

296
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,820
Bring out an internal conflict?

297
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
Yes.

298
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,459
It is said the Hungu officials are quite unhappy...

299
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:34,760
with Executive Minister Yoo.

300
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,959
We must shake them up at a time like this...

301
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,889
so that they crumble from within.

302
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,760
For that matter,

303
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:45,830
we need someone influential enough to take a toll on him.

304
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,540
And we have worked on someone in particular.

305
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,510
Your Majesty.

306
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,409
Left State Councillor Choi Soo Yong is here to see you.

307
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,280
Let him in.

308
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,359
His Majesty has been asking for Left State Councillor Choi often.

309
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:41,560
Yes.

310
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,790
Office of Special Advisers will be taking over the duties...

311
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,629
which the Hall of Worthies had.

312
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,359
Thus, His Majesty has asked Left State Councillor Choi...

313
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,169
to be in charge of the Office of Special Advisers.

314
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,139
Office of Special Advisers...

315
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,010
From the 1st adviser to the 5th adviser...

316
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,980
and everyone else there are with Sarim.

317
00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:07,449
A lot of the Hungu officials are concerned...

318
00:29:07,449 --> 00:29:10,520
Left State Councillor Choi might side with His Majesty and Sarim.

319
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,129
Investigator Cho Chang Woo of Saheonbu,

320
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:24,800
you will double as a deputy minister of Board of Personnel as of today.

321
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:29,810
Do the best you can to eradicate the corruption in its personnel.

322
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,909
However, Your Majesty,

323
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,649
letting an official of Saheonbu supervise personnel issues...

324
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,060
is invading the sole discretion that Board of Personnel has.

325
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,659
That is right, Your Majesty.

326
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:53,500
Only those in the King's favour will be appointed in this case.

327
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,669
Executive Minister Yoo and Right State Councillor,

328
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:02,139
I think you are misleading.

329
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,849
An official of Saheonbu...

330
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:16,619
will only inspect and denounce court officials.

331
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,560
He is not a eunuch who listens and speaks for His Majesty.

332
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,320
Nor are they the first royal secretary...

333
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,629
to deliver the King's command.

334
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:28,099
They must be fair and upright, more than any other officials.

335
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,699
What is your intention in making them the King's puppet?

336
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:41,240
Have you, by any chance,

337
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,050
forgotten about the recent improper solicitation?

338
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,320
(Accepting requests for a special favour for a position)

339
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,149
It was not the executive minister's objective.

340
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:51,020
But I realized...

341
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,260
many were not ashamed to think...

342
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,230
improper solicitation was a shortcut to success...

343
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,560
and bribery was a stepping stone to promotion.

344
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:02,659
Therefore, I am trying to regulate the corruption...

345
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:04,129
in the Office of Personnel's Board of Personnel,

346
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:08,099
not demonstrate my influence in personnel authority.

347
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,169
However, Your Majesty...

348
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,619
However...

349
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,389
I will do my utmost best.

350
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:32,490
- We will obey the royal command. - We will obey the royal command.

351
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:51,250
For Left State Councillor Choi...

352
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,220
to fully support His Majesty's order.

353
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,750
Is this not him expressing his will to take His Majesty's side?

354
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,459
I am not sure if we should trust and leave everything...

355
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:03,459
to Executive Minister Yoo.

356
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:05,330
What are you saying?

357
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,330
Honestly, were we not the only ones who suffered from the land lawsuit?

358
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,530
It sure was a disappointment.

359
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:16,540
Had Executive Minister Yoo stepped in a bit more aggressively,

360
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,669
things would not have come this far.

361
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,879
Rumours are circulating that...

362
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:22,040
Magistrate Yoo is marrying Princess Yeon Joo.

363
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:24,550
Once he becomes the King's son-in-law,

364
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,580
he can't secure his government position.

365
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,480
In other words, the position of Executive Minister Yoo,

366
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,790
who had full faith in his smart son, is on the line.

367
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,189
You are right. It has been at stake for a while now.

368
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,629
Commissioner Park, who was like his loyal servant, killed himself.

369
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:43,169
Even Lord Chu died unexpectedly.

370
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,500
All his limbs have practically been cut off.

371
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,409
Executive Minister Yoo's era is slowly coming to an end.

372
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:51,939
Watch your mouth.

373
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,649
Have you decided to take the King's side?

374
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,389
"Side?"

375
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,830
If I am not the King's vassal,

376
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,530
whose vassal am I?

377
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,129
I thought we were working...

378
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:19,169
for Joseon in our own ways. No?

379
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:25,409
So by not meddling in each other's business regardless of what we did,

380
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,310
were we not respecting each other's goals and paths?

381
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,050
Yes, we were.

382
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,290
That was surely what we had to do.

383
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:01,439
I left something behind in the workhouse.

384
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,430
There is a ledger.

385
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,709
It is the golden crown that is supporting...

386
00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:35,280
Executive Minister Yoo's power.

387
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,749
Did you finish cleaning the lord's room?

388
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,950
Yes.

389
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:01,720
- Welcome back, my lord. - Welcome back, my lord.

390
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,209
Eun Soo.

391
00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:24,209
Magistrate Yoo.

392
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:26,010
So it was you.

393
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:28,979
You were Eun Soo.

394
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,390
- Where are we going? - To Kang Han Soo.

395
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,729
We cannot.

396
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,459
What you were doing in my father's room...

397
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,269
and why you were holding a dagger. I will not ask.

398
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:22,370
In return, let us go meet Kang Han Soo.

399
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,410
And with you, I will tell him to leave the capital...

400
00:38:26,209 --> 00:38:27,640
as soon and as far away as possible.

401
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:34,050
Han Soo knows nothing.

402
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,749
I hope he continues not to.

403
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,220
I do not want to...

404
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,530
show him such a sight.

405
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,789
Of course, you do not.

406
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,700
How could you?

407
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:51,229
You, Kang Han Soo's sister?

408
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,660
I am sorry.

409
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:19,090
Please...

410
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,930
leave.

411
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:28,169
So that my father...

412
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,910
can no longer harm you and your family,

413
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,539
please...

414
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,180
go far away.

415
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,729
It is not your fault, Magistrate Yoo.

416
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,499
It is my fault for being a fool.

417
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,439
Magistrate Yoo.

418
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,169
You are different from Executive Minister Yoo.

419
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,280
Both what you are after...

420
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:09,579
and the path you are taking.

421
00:40:12,249 --> 00:40:15,550
So please do not take on his sins...

422
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,120
simply because you are his son.

423
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,399
Father, it is your loss.

424
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,470
"Side?"

425
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,169
If I am not the King's vassal,

426
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,539
whose vassal am I?

427
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:15,840
Executive Minister Yoo's era is slowly coming to an end.

428
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,200
Someone who deserves to die, by tomorrow?

429
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,240
This is an order from Executive Minister Yoo.

430
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,499
Master.

431
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,970
You will not,

432
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,870
will you?

433
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,640
There is nothing a merchant cannot do for profit.

434
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,070
And you are willing to trade someone's life?

435
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,010
No man in this world is worthy of death.

436
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,249
There are those who would be more helpful after death...

437
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,379
to one's family...

438
00:42:26,379 --> 00:42:27,649
and to the world.

439
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,979
Gamblers, prisoners, and slaves.

440
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,689
Get someone who owes more than their life is worth.

441
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:39,530
Tell them they will be paid handsomely for their life.

442
00:42:46,629 --> 00:42:48,470
I heard my name out loud...

443
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,840
for the first time in decades.

444
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:54,180
And it was by you.

445
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:58,809
I am terribly happy for that.

446
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,519
I finally understand...

447
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,950
such heartrending feelings Her Highness had for Kang Han Soo.

448
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,030
She must have known there is nothing she can do...

449
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,590
to pay back this heart.

450
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,399
I am nothing...

451
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:22,100
more than a sinner to you.

452
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:25,140
Yet you filled me...

453
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:29,010
with such profound and deep love all along.

454
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,680
I could never repay your heart even after my death.

455
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:37,050
- Magistrate Yoo. - I will keep you safe.

456
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,789
I will make sure...

457
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,559
you will live an ordinary life in a safe haven,

458
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:48,800
where people will always call you by your name once again.

459
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:51,499
I will make that happen.

460
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:58,609
If doing that will put your heart at ease,

461
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:02,240
then yes,

462
00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:03,950
I shall do that.

463
00:44:05,149 --> 00:44:06,450
Do you mean it?

464
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:07,649
Yes.

465
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:10,720
However, grant me a little more time.

466
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:14,820
I must say goodbye...

467
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,729
to my brother.

468
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,990
Yes.

469
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,229
In the meantime, I will prepare everything you will need.

470
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,959
Are you here to see the attorney?

471
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,030
Well, I...

472
00:44:54,629 --> 00:44:56,359
We do not know when he will be here.

473
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,169
You should go inside and wait.

474
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,999
It is a cold day.

475
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,039
Come in.

476
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,609
It is all right.

477
00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:09,510
The day is too cold. Let us all wait inside.

478
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:13,550
Why are we here?

479
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:15,879
I thought we were having a meeting to plan strategy.

480
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,249
That is why I came out,

481
00:45:17,249 --> 00:45:19,090
but the weather suddenly became too chilly.

482
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:21,919
I must be equipped before I begin my battle.

483
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,930
What good is money for anyway?

484
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,129
This is the time to spend.

485
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:27,059
- That one and that one, please. - Sure.

486
00:45:36,669 --> 00:45:38,109
Look, silk.

487
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:43,410
Which one will look good on Eun Soo?

488
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,550
Come here.

489
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,590
So? Do you like it?

490
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:53,620
Dressing her up will not make her any prettier.

491
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:03,160
What about this?

492
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:10,070
Eun Soo, you have such a fair tone.

493
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:12,769
This looks pretty on you too.

494
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,079
- Do you like it? - Yes.

495
00:46:14,379 --> 00:46:15,510
It is pretty.

496
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,280
Mother.

497
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,649
Let me see that.

498
00:46:19,649 --> 00:46:20,879
Let me...

499
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,249
put this around you.

500
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:26,950
One moment. And this one...

501
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,490
goes here.

502
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:29,660
She looks much prettier now.

503
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:31,789
Cut it out.

504
00:46:35,899 --> 00:46:37,129
That looks better.

505
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,640
What is on your mind?

506
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,439
What? No, nothing.

507
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,140
Here it is.

508
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:51,180
What do you think?

509
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:52,280
Not bad.

510
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:13,970
This is nice.

511
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,470
- Do you like it? - Yes.

512
00:47:18,939 --> 00:47:20,140
Excuse me.

513
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,680
Would you like to see some baby clothes?

514
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,079
Sorry?

515
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,050
It is always great to be ready.

516
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:29,180
No.

517
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,579
It is not like that.

518
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,249
We will...

519
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,590
come for that next time.

520
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,329
Hey.

521
00:47:37,629 --> 00:47:39,359
Says who?

522
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,999
What do you think? I do.

523
00:47:42,899 --> 00:47:45,999
How can you make that call on your own?

524
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,769
That is not something you can decide on by yourself.

525
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:50,840
Why not?

526
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:53,970
First off, we must...

527
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,410
We must?

528
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:56,579
Get...

529
00:47:57,109 --> 00:47:58,709
- Get... - Get?

530
00:47:59,709 --> 00:48:00,720
- Get... - Get?

531
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,280
You already know what it is.

532
00:48:04,149 --> 00:48:05,419
I am not sure.

533
00:48:05,419 --> 00:48:08,189
Is there a reason for us to do this together?

534
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:09,689
What?

535
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:13,359
I want to get baby clothes for Chu Sal as a present.

536
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:15,859
What?

537
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,450
Did you bring your consultation fee?

538
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:34,649
Attorney Kang...

539
00:48:34,649 --> 00:48:36,680
only works after he is paid.

540
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:40,019
Goodness, stop it.

541
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,160
Please feel free to look around.

542
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,289
Hey, stop that.

543
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,300
You cannot bring up money as soon as someone new comes.

544
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,959
But she must pay to talk to him.

545
00:48:49,959 --> 00:48:52,870
You already had this talk with Han Soo before.

546
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,169
When a first-time visitor comes, we serve a warm cup of tea first,

547
00:48:56,169 --> 00:48:58,439
and then we continue with the consultation.

548
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,840
So what are you doing right now?

549
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,910
We have to start by asking if they came prepared.

550
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:03,140
Be quiet.

551
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,410
I am talking quietly.

552
00:49:04,479 --> 00:49:05,709
Even quieter.

553
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,620
Nobody follows these rules.

554
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,220
We have to serve her tea first.

555
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,289
She has to pay us first before we serve tea.

556
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:13,189
- Be quiet. - I am talking quietly.

557
00:49:13,189 --> 00:49:14,419
Even quieter.

558
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,870
Goodness.

559
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,240
Again?

560
00:49:32,709 --> 00:49:34,410
- What? - Be quiet.

561
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:36,640
- I am talking quietly. - Even quieter.

562
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,680
Goodness.

563
00:49:40,379 --> 00:49:41,720
See?

564
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,149
She left.

565
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,019
Why did she come if she didn't have any money?

566
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,629
What? Why?

567
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,840
How does it feel?

568
00:50:40,769 --> 00:50:43,180
Well... It is warm.

569
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:45,149
I did not want you to be warm.

570
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:49,419
I wanted to stir your heart.

571
00:50:58,689 --> 00:50:59,729
How about now?

572
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:02,129
This will not stir my heart.

573
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,999
That was not to stir your heart.

574
00:51:04,499 --> 00:51:05,899
It was to warm you up.

575
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:07,669
Seriously?

576
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:14,140
I will make...

577
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,709
the clothes for our child.

578
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:21,120
I will change the diapers...

579
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,649
and hold the child.

580
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:29,660
I have tried it, and it was not too hard.

581
00:51:34,999 --> 00:51:36,100
So,

582
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,439
just come to me.

583
00:51:44,609 --> 00:51:47,169
I do not care how long it takes...

584
00:51:49,479 --> 00:51:51,350
as long as we can be together.

585
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,019
It does not have to be here.

586
00:51:58,519 --> 00:51:59,550
It also...

587
00:52:01,059 --> 00:52:02,519
does not have to be...

588
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:05,189
in this life.

589
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,120
Same here.

590
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:33,390
I do not care how long it takes.

591
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:36,789
It may not have to be in this life.

592
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,030
I would be happy, even if it was a dream.

593
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,809
I want to be with you.

594
00:53:17,229 --> 00:53:19,899
- How is this happening? - Goodness.

595
00:53:19,899 --> 00:53:22,370
- That is terrifying. - This cannot be happening.

596
00:53:30,979 --> 00:53:33,579
- Oh, my gosh. - That poor man.

597
00:53:58,209 --> 00:53:59,240
Move!

598
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,579
Step aside.

599
00:54:07,649 --> 00:54:09,050
A murder?

600
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,519
His name is Hong Bo Geun.

601
00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:12,850
He was a young official recently assigned...

602
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,019
to the Office of Special Advisers.

603
00:54:14,959 --> 00:54:16,490
His body was found...

604
00:54:17,689 --> 00:54:19,629
in the back alley.

605
00:54:23,229 --> 00:54:25,129
He disguised it to look like a mugging,

606
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,200
but we caught the perpetrator and interrogated him...

607
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:31,510
to find out that it was a murder due to a love affair.

608
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:33,970
A love affair?

609
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:40,709
Forgive me for the vulgar words, but the victim and the murderer...

610
00:54:41,149 --> 00:54:43,850
were in love with the same woman.

611
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,419
They were arguing to date that woman,

612
00:54:46,649 --> 00:54:48,459
and one of them murdered the other.

613
00:54:48,859 --> 00:54:51,930
And the woman was married to a nobleman.

614
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,100
How indecent.

615
00:54:57,129 --> 00:54:58,570
If that was the case,

616
00:54:58,769 --> 00:55:00,570
the Ministry of Law Enforcement could have handled it.

617
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:11,809
The arrested murderer claimed that other people were...

618
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,510
also in love with that woman...

619
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,720
and named all the officials...

620
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,180
in important posts.

621
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,749
Who were they?

622
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,660
Boo Je Ha and Jang Myung Ki from the Office of Special Advisers,

623
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,930
Suchan Jang Yoon,

624
00:55:25,229 --> 00:55:27,629
and Kim Young Jae, the minor inspector of Saheonbu.

625
00:55:34,229 --> 00:55:35,370
So,

626
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,570
who was the woman that had affairs with them?

627
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,379
We do not know her real name.

628
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:44,579
But she runs a bar for middle-class women and widows in Namchon.

629
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,850
The bar in Namchon?

630
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,550
Is that the one we know?

631
00:56:03,899 --> 00:56:06,700
Executive Minister Yoo, what is on your mind?

632
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:29,620
Close the gate!

633
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,620
Yes.

634
00:56:38,169 --> 00:56:40,070
Has there been a mishap?

635
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:46,570
I will go to the office and find out.

636
00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:50,140
Then, I will go back and wait for you.

637
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:55,649
- What is going on? - What is this?

638
00:57:06,129 --> 00:57:09,030
Minister, will you just sit here?

639
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,399
Eun Soo is...

640
00:57:10,999 --> 00:57:12,899
She is Officer Kang Eon Jik's daughter.

641
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:17,470
It is time that we abandon her.

642
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,840
If I let her live,

643
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,240
that clever, audacious girl...

644
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,579
will aim her sword at me instead.

645
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:31,050
Were you behind all of this?

646
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,059
If His Majesty starts looking into this incident,

647
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,800
a lot of our people...

648
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,829
will be imprisoned.

649
00:57:45,399 --> 00:57:46,999
That is why I called her.

650
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,410
If anyone wants to live,

651
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,570
they will come and kneel before me.

652
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,890
It is the house of the criminal. Find anything that can be evidence.

653
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:11,990
Start searching!

654
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,059
- Yes. - Yes.

655
00:58:15,399 --> 00:58:16,559
What are you doing?

656
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:20,970
Let me go.

657
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:26,039
A Ri!

658
00:58:26,439 --> 00:58:27,510
Young lady!

659
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:28,640
Catch her!

660
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:17,390
- Attorney Kang. - Hi.

661
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,829
- What is happening? - How would I know?

662
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:24,229
She is the owner of the bar at the end of the road.

663
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:26,200
And the Ministry of Justice is taking her away,

664
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,499
not the Ministry of Law Enforcement.

665
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,399
Maybe it has something to do with the dead body in Jongno.

666
00:59:30,399 --> 00:59:33,370
It was a nobleman and a government official.

667
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:35,809
No wonder the Ministry of Justice is here for her.

668
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,209
You are right.

669
00:59:42,479 --> 00:59:43,479
Hi.

670
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,890
His Majesty would like to talk to you.

671
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,059
Hop in.

672
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:57,959
Executive Minister Yoo is risking a lot of things this time.

673
00:59:57,959 --> 01:00:00,530
He is giving up his arm for something bigger.

674
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:03,669
Now that I have already caught him,

675
01:00:04,439 --> 01:00:06,709
he must have decided to turn it around on me.

676
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:11,479
You cannot lose your people only.

677
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,709
Of course not.

678
01:00:13,479 --> 01:00:15,550
I will behead that girl, no matter what.

679
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:21,249
I must go to that extent to hurt him back.

680
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:25,390
Do you have an idea?

681
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:28,359
You know me, Your Majesty.

682
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,320
His Majesty is here.

683
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:52,950
Show your respect.

684
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,019
Your Majesty.

685
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,140
Are you really...

686
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,340
His Majesty?

687
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,240
You are...

688
01:01:14,439 --> 01:01:15,640
going to die.

689
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:19,579
Do you have any last words to say?

690
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:33,729
I would like...

691
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:37,700
to touch your royal face once.

692
01:01:53,249 --> 01:01:54,479
You look...

693
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,620
just like everyone else.

694
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,419
Your hair,

695
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:03,289
your eyes,

696
01:02:03,459 --> 01:02:04,559
your skin...

697
01:02:07,459 --> 01:02:09,200
You are just another person.

698
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,269
Why...

699
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,870
did it require so much bloodshed...

700
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,609
just to make you king?

701
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,079
Why...

702
01:02:29,149 --> 01:02:30,550
Why did my innocent parents...

703
01:02:31,919 --> 01:02:33,220
have to be...

704
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,260
sacrificed to death?

705
01:02:40,459 --> 01:02:42,559
What a mess.

706
01:02:51,709 --> 01:02:52,870
You are...

707
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,180
I apologize for my discourtesy just now.

708
01:03:03,919 --> 01:03:04,950
What?

709
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:07,350
I am the one you just saw.

710
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,320
I knew it was not you.

711
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:12,260
You cannot fool my eyes.

712
01:03:13,729 --> 01:03:15,459
Then who got arrested?

713
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:16,999
Your master?

714
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:19,470
Why did your master get...

715
01:03:21,269 --> 01:03:22,870
Please help.

716
01:03:24,169 --> 01:03:25,570
Please...

717
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,280
Please help my young lady.

718
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:35,419
Please save her.

719
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,919
What is...

720
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,829
your master's name?

721
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,399
Answer me!

722
01:04:28,939 --> 01:04:30,999
It is Kang Eun Soo.

723
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:47,950
Why do you keep crying?

724
01:04:48,689 --> 01:04:49,859
Should I not go?

725
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,959
Do not be ridiculous.

726
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,859
You must go.

727
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:55,859
It is a noble family.

728
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:00,129
This is the best spouse we can get for you.

729
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:02,870
My daughter.

730
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,910
You were born regardless of your choice,

731
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,579
but the rest of your life can be different.

732
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:14,050
Live a life of luxury as a nobleman's wife.

733
01:05:15,879 --> 01:05:19,450
And my grandchildren will get to be part of the noble family.

734
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:22,959
But I am happy to be my parents' daughter.

735
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:25,729
I do not mind sticking to this life forever...

736
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:30,300
What is it?

737
01:05:31,769 --> 01:05:33,370
Look at you

738
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:35,870
- In makeup - Darn you.

739
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:38,939
I am getting married all because of you.

740
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:40,910
Because I cannot stand the sight of you!

741
01:05:42,979 --> 01:05:44,079
Go away!

742
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,350
It is almost like a makeover, not makeup.

743
01:05:56,189 --> 01:05:57,820
We will always keep our doors open...

744
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,859
so you can come anytime.

745
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:05,300
They say a married daughter is no longer part of their family.

746
01:06:05,399 --> 01:06:07,030
But that does not apply to me.

747
01:06:08,399 --> 01:06:09,700
Eun Soo,

748
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,970
you will always be our daughter.

749
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,910
So if anything happens...

750
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:19,510
or your in-laws give you a hard time,

751
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,019
come back at any time.

752
01:06:22,249 --> 01:06:23,419
Okay?

753
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:24,720
Yes, Mom.

754
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:27,890
Instead,

755
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:29,760
I will come when he is not around.

756
01:06:41,669 --> 01:06:42,870
Han Soo.

757
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,570
You will...

758
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,410
come visit me, right?

759
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:49,510
Of course.

760
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,780
Make sure you come.

761
01:06:54,209 --> 01:06:56,680
Actually, I am scared.

762
01:06:57,879 --> 01:06:59,890
I will make sure to visit you.

763
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,220
Promise me.

764
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,800
I promise.

765
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:17,760
You...

766
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:32,449
Why are you...

767
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,680
Why are you here?

768
01:08:35,619 --> 01:08:36,949
Why...

769
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,449
Why are you here?

770
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:01,470
Eun Soo...

771
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:08,720
Eun Soo.

772
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:14,619
Han Soo.

773
01:09:18,289 --> 01:09:19,489
Han Soo.

774
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,100
I am sorry.

775
01:09:46,489 --> 01:09:50,020
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

776
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,430
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

777
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:01,069
Help me save Eun Soo.

778
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,440
I will pay as much as you want.

779
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:08,340
Are you sure...

780
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:10,940
you will not regret this?

781
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:14,610
I know you already guessed...

782
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,279
what my answer would be before coming here.

783
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:22,619
They say if a person dies,

784
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,060
they become a star.

785
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,489
But I will become a magnolia.

786
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,369
So Han Soo,

787
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,499
do not cry for me.
