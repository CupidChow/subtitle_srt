(All people, incidents, and periods in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,660
Have some, my King.

3
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,139
What a liar.

4
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,209
(Tavern)

5
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,349
Please help us.

6
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,050
Do you not pity this child?

7
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:50,389
I will pay you handsomely.

8
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:51,819
What is with you?

9
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:53,319
There is not enough for my own child!

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,930
Let go of me!

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,029
Goodness!

12
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,299
I said I would pay you handsomely!

13
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,370
Be quiet, will you?

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,439
What do you want?

15
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,909
What are you doing?

16
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,040
What?

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,710
You need to soothe the child,

18
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,880
instead of yelling. Little baby, come here.

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,210
- No. - Give the kid to me. Come here.

20
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,419
There, there. Were you scared?

21
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,760
He pooped. Here.

22
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:31,600
Tell me what is going on.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,100
I can help you.

24
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:42,609
Are you crying?

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,079
I thought you were a cold-hearted roughneck,

26
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,680
but you were only human.

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,719
Tell me.

28
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,290
Or go cry outside.

29
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:04,999
My name is...

30
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,059
Chu Soo.

31
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:10,200
It means autumn harvest.

32
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,999
My brother was named Woo Soo, rain and harvest.

33
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,969
Our parents were farmers, and they named us themselves.

34
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,909
Why did you abandon that great name?

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,509
Our father lived his life as a tenant farmer...

36
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,979
and passed away under the scorching sun.

37
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,390
Since that day, it became our wish...

38
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,420
to own a piece of land of our own.

39
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:35,259
All right.

40
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,330
This is the place, Chu Soo.

41
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,370
Can we really do this, Woo Soo?

42
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,469
Of course, kiddo.

43
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,610
The law stated we could own the land...

44
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,080
if we cultivated wasteland within three years.

45
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,550
We spent every second and minute of our time...

46
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,249
cultivating that land.

47
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:08,360
My brother never gave up despite a few failed attempts.

48
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,170
How long do we have to do this?

49
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,080
Darn it!

50
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,469
Chu Soo.

51
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,770
Chu Soo.

52
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,379
But I...

53
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,479
ran away.

54
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
I even abandoned the name my parents gave me.

55
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,219
Chu Soo...

56
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,960
Chu Soo...

57
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,919
This is our land!

58
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,359
Hooray! This is wonderful!

59
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:50,529
This is wonderful!

60
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,359
We worked hard to cultivate this land,

61
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,400
so this is ours.

62
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:56,070
This is our land!

63
00:04:57,869 --> 00:04:59,000
Let me.

64
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,570
All right.

65
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:02,669
Ssal Bab.

66
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,640
I have lived my life as a tenant farmer,

67
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,679
but you will...

68
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:12,580
live your life as the lord over this land.

69
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,349
Okay?

70
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:22,029
Are you happy, Ssal Bab?

71
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,359
Yes, we are happy too!

72
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,270
There, there.

73
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,900
He smiles just like you, honey.

74
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:32,969
My gosh.

75
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:43,479
We later found out that around February,

76
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:44,650
when our three years were up,

77
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,419
Won Dae Han bought that land and had the official deed issued.

78
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:51,250
(A document notarized by a government office)

79
00:05:51,989 --> 00:05:53,690
Why are you doing this to my land?

80
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,060
- So the officials... - It is my land!

81
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,489
took Lord Won's side.

82
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,650
Who is there?

83
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,060
- Over there! - Do not do this.

84
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,200
Do not do this!

85
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,799
This is our land! We cultivated this land!

86
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,500
- Come here! - Come!

87
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,700
Do not do this!

88
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:50,479
Have you been...

89
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,380
to our land?

90
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,989
I have...

91
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,390
plowed that land vigorously by myself.

92
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:03,229
I was worried...

93
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:07,229
you would feel guilty...

94
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:11,070
that our wish fell through because of you.

95
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:14,369
So...

96
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,539
Chu Soo.

97
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,010
Please come...

98
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,409
and settle on our land.

99
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,390
What do you mean, his last words?

100
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:32,719
I buried him in the mountains today.

101
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,359
Please show your pity for this child...

102
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,859
and help us.

103
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,150
Sounds great.

104
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:02,750
I was in the mood...

105
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,020
to teach them a lesson.

106
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:29,050
(Episode 12: Owner of the Land)

107
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:34,119
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

108
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:37,619
Although his deadline of three years had passed,

109
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:39,920
Jung cultivated that land until his last breath,

110
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,359
so it belongs to him.

111
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:44,060
He plowed and sowed seeds on that barren land,

112
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,830
which means he successfully reclaimed it.

113
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,930
Hence, Jung believed that land surely belonged to him,

114
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,200
so he had farmed...

115
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,570
with every drop of blood and sweat until the moment he died.

116
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,739
If he had succeeded,

117
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:55,840
we should have seen some harvest or even sprouts...

118
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,139
for anybody to realize someone owns that land.

119
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,040
When I saw that land, it was barren and fallowed.

120
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,810
Our law says land left barren for three years and longer...

121
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,080
can be registered and cultivated by another person.

122
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,389
I did not do anything wrong.

123
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,389
That is what Lord Won is saying, correct?

124
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,389
Every single piece of land in Joseon is...

125
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,830
left empty in February.

126
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,030
You are right. Lord Won reported he would begin farming in February,

127
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,139
but he suspiciously claimed his rights just before the harvest.

128
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:26,739
That is what I am saying!

129
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,710
But it will not be easy to win.

130
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,849
At any rate, Lord Won did not do anything illegal,

131
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,619
and above all, he is a man of power.

132
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,989
He is the closest associate of Executive Minister Yoo.

133
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,749
He has returned to his office...

134
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:47,320
even after the wrongdoings he committed with Lord Chu.

135
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,190
I am sure Executive Minister Yoo especially, particularly,

136
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,560
and dearly treasures him.

137
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,430
Knowing that, you would still lodge an appeal?

138
00:09:56,869 --> 00:09:58,129
That is the reason I did it.

139
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:02,070
To cause you trouble in many ways.

140
00:10:32,969 --> 00:10:34,670
See you in court in three days.

141
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,280
Good. You're all doomed.

142
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,119
(Hanseongbu)

143
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,320
A land deed lawsuit?

144
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,519
Who is the opponent?

145
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,259
It is Lord Won Dae Han, Left Assistant State Councillor.

146
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,629
I see.

147
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,099
What can we do to help?

148
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:04,330
Nothing.

149
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,840
Attorney Kang has filed this lawsuit...

150
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,269
to bring trouble to you, me, and my father.

151
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,210
You are well aware...

152
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,280
of how he used to...

153
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:17,009
take advantage of lawsuits for his revenge.

154
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,379
And we have become his tools this time.

155
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,190
Because I am a princess now.

156
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,460
Yes.

157
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,590
We own the most pieces of land in all of Joseon.

158
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,969
From here to there,

159
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:38,840
they are fertile lands.

160
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,269
It is an excellent spot.

161
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,710
- Take care of it until the end. - Yes, my lord.

162
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,239
My lord!

163
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,410
My lord!

164
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,950
What is the fuss about?

165
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:55,290
The law...

166
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,519
- The cow? - Yes!

167
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,359
No, not a cow!

168
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,660
He filed a lawsuit against you.

169
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,969
- A lawsuit? - Yes!

170
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:09,999
Who?

171
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,570
How dare you file a lawsuit against me?

172
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:16,840
Yes, my lord.

173
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,639
I have a subpoena...

174
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,879
from Magistrate Yoo to bring you to the court.

175
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:25,619
(Subpoena: An official order for a lawsuit)

176
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,019
(Magistrate Yoo Ji Sun)

177
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,719
Magistrate Yoo, that jerk.

178
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,859
You would dare to sue me?

179
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,700
You lowly commoner! Know your place!

180
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,499
You scoundrel!

181
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:43,899
Darn it.

182
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:09,560
Unlike you, who is of high rank,

183
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,759
normal officials like myself must collect...

184
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,769
as much fortune as we can while we are in service.

185
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,940
So you decided to take the small lands from the peasants?

186
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,009
Every official...

187
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:28,080
who has lands does it.

188
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:30,410
Some lend money to their tenant farmers...

189
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,509
at high interests...

190
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:32,820
so they will not be able to pay back.

191
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:36,320
Some even take away their lands for other absurd reasons.

192
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,989
Compared to them, I am nothing.

193
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,489
At least, I did not break the law.

194
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,460
Then, why do you need my help?

195
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,499
You can settle it in court.

196
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:54,070
This lawsuit is not just about me.

197
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,710
It is a fight for everyone who owns lands.

198
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,379
If I lose,

199
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:01,979
everyone will file a lawsuit against the noblemen...

200
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:04,509
to try and take away our lands.

201
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,580
I cannot stand to see that.

202
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,160
Above all,

203
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,759
the plaintiff's attorney is Kang Han Soo.

204
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,259
Kang Han Soo?

205
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,229
Yes, the tricky punk!

206
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,639
We do not know what tricks he will pull off.

207
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
I must be prepared for them.

208
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,099
Is this the land?

209
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:56,969
Yes, young master.

210
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,099
So, you are from Hanyang?

211
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,609
Introduce yourself.

212
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:08,080
He is Lord Won's second son, Won Gong Ja.

213
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,950
Right. Hello.

214
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,969
Oh, right!

215
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:32,739
It must have been tough coming all the way here.

216
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,670
But how come his son is here?

217
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,580
My father caught a cold, so I came on his behalf.

218
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,810
On his behalf.

219
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,950
So, you have found a way to take this land, right?

220
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,080
Right?

221
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,519
But...

222
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,149
he is not a tenant farmer,

223
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:52,989
so he does not owe the owner anything.

224
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:55,530
It is also far from the capital where the King is.

225
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,430
It is not even a military area,

226
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,599
so he is rarely summoned for labour duty,

227
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:02,300
which gives him plenty of time to farm.

228
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:06,639
You are right. The farmers who live near the capital...

229
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:09,910
are summoned every time to repair the city wall...

230
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,739
or help the feasts at the palace.

231
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:14,739
So they cannot afford the time to cultivate their lands.

232
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:18,149
You are saying that there are no faults to find?

233
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:21,749
What?

234
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,349
What?

235
00:16:25,349 --> 00:16:27,190
- That is it! - What?

236
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,859
That is it.

237
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:30,690
Wait. That is...

238
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,259
That is Lord Won!

239
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,300
You said you could not come!

240
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:40,899
- But... - Throw it away!

241
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,440
Leave it!

242
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,840
Oh, boy.

243
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,310
Han Soo.

244
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:54,050
What did you mean, "That is it?"

245
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,050
Follow me.

246
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:01,689
What on earth did you mean?

247
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,060
Thank you for coming.

248
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,869
Have you been summoned for labour duty...

249
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,369
in the last 3 or 4 years?

250
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,800
Of course!

251
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,399
We go there a couple of times a year.

252
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,570
There are rarely years when we are not summoned.

253
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,879
Does that mean my brother also...

254
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,609
He and I were in the same group.

255
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:23,449
Whether it was a town event or labour duty, we went together.

256
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,419
Can you say that in court as a witness?

257
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:31,449
Witness?

258
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,889
- There is going to be a lawsuit? - Yes.

259
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,730
Are you sure about this?

260
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,859
You are going against Lord Won, of all people!

261
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,359
What if you get on his bad side?

262
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,129
Dozens of people in our village...

263
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:44,429
lost their lands because of him!

264
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,570
Wait.

265
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,340
What makes you so sure that you will not end up like my brother?

266
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,709
What? How could you say that?

267
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,139
You might as well curse us.

268
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,510
That is not it!

269
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:58,409
- Dong Chi. - Yes.

270
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,379
All right, now.

271
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:03,520
I heard that you were cultivating many wastelands.

272
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,689
Sixty bu in your town, and eighty-five in your town.

273
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:07,859
Right?

274
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:10,060
Now, think about this.

275
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,060
We must win to prevent other farmers...

276
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,699
from being involved in such unfair situations.

277
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,500
We do not ask you to testify to get on Lord Won's wrong side.

278
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:23,409
We merely ask you to state the fact...

279
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:26,609
that Jung went for the labour duty for the last three years.

280
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,480
All right?

281
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,510
But...

282
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,580
what does that have to do with the land deed?

283
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,720
Not even a clump of grass grew in that land for three years.

284
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,159
Look.

285
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:45,030
We have verified that they were not cultivated...

286
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,129
for three years...

287
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,770
before taking the land.

288
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:53,800
Here you go.

289
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:59,010
Left Assistant State Councillor and the town's official...

290
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,580
would not dare to take the land with crops growing on it.

291
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,480
You keep mentioning the three-year period...

292
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,419
to be so precise. Then what?

293
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,720
We have something to say about that as well.

294
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,359
Gosh.

295
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:18,129
My lord. The plaintiff...

296
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:21,459
still has 45 days left before losing ownership of the land.

297
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,399
During the last three years of cultivating the wasteland,

298
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:28,139
the plaintiff was on three labour duties...

299
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:29,909
for 45 days.

300
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,709
In other words, he was too busy...

301
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:35,209
helping the nation to farm his land.

302
00:19:36,949 --> 00:19:40,919
If Lord Won had come in 45 days,

303
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,220
there would have been sprouts on that land.

304
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,790
Then, he would not have been able to register the land as his own.

305
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,290
Objection. The plaintiff...

306
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,359
has no evidence to prove that his brother went to do labour.

307
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,929
There is.

308
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,570
What?

309
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,369
His neighbours went with him. They can testify.

310
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,599
Let the witnesses in.

311
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:03,540
- Let them in. - Yes.

312
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,949
Is the plaintiff's assertion true?

313
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,720
It is true that we went for the labour duty...

314
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,750
almost once or twice a year.

315
00:20:21,189 --> 00:20:22,260
However,

316
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,470
Jung did not go with us.

317
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,470
That is right.

318
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,470
We did not take him with us...

319
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,409
as he had a leg problem.

320
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,980
- Why are you perjuring yourselves? - No.

321
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,189
Defence attorney.

322
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,050
Do you have more to say?

323
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,859
Master...

324
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:06,800
How can you be this unaware of the reality of farmers?

325
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:12,169
It takes years just to cultivate a wasteland.

326
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:14,780
The law states three years,

327
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,510
but it is way too short...

328
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,020
for tenant farmers to cultivate their own lands.

329
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,459
If you think it is that unfair,

330
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,000
why not change the law?

331
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:41,770
- He is right. - Right.

332
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,179
How could you do this to my brother?

333
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,550
Where is your loyalty?

334
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,659
- It is not like we wanted to do it. - Right.

335
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,990
Had you not left your brother behind,

336
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,359
this would not have happened in the first place.

337
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:05,560
Why blame us when a family should take care of him?

338
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,730
What?

339
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,429
- Let go. - Wait.

340
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:09,530
Let go!

341
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,629
- Why that... - Come here, you jerk.

342
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:12,800
Goodness, gracious.

343
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:15,070
- Honey! - Honey...

344
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,540
What?

345
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,639
What on earth?

346
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,050
Why are they all so haggard?

347
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,419
Do not tell me...

348
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:29,050
Lord Won took you hostage.

349
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,590
We just got released.

350
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,159
Of course.

351
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,260
I knew he would not stay still.

352
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:40,159
Tell me about it.

353
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,330
How cheap for a minister.

354
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,240
(We welcome advance payments.)

355
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,679
There, there.

356
00:22:58,709 --> 00:22:59,849
What is with that sag of rice?

357
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,419
The first day of next month is Ssal Bab's birthday.

358
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:04,790
We want to make rice cakes for him.

359
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,359
And throw his first birthday party.

360
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:07,720
Birthday?

361
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:09,389
Birthday...

362
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,159
Birthday, my foot.

363
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,399
How could she lie about her birthday, of all things?

364
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:15,629
I mean, it is a sacred day!

365
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,030
We did not lie.

366
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,169
We got the date right.

367
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:21,369
It is November 1.

368
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:24,070
Chu Sal bragged that his birthday was so easy to remember...

369
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,570
because it was the first day of November.

370
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:32,550
An easy birthday is nothing to brag about.

371
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:35,720
He is proud of all sorts of things about his nephew.

372
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:39,560
Han Soo?

373
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,889
Han Soo.

374
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:45,830
Hey.

375
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,199
Hey, brat.

376
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:49,159
Oh, my!

377
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,340
When did Lord Won get the certification issued again?

378
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,599
February 1 this year.

379
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,510
I saw it written on the certification.

380
00:23:58,139 --> 00:23:59,280
That is right.

381
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,240
February 1.

382
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,609
I saw it clearly.

383
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,679
What is wrong with you? You are scaring me.

384
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:09,790
Drop your eyes.

385
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:13,689
Lord Won, this old weasel.

386
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:22,669
What? What is it?

387
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,129
- Chime with me first. - Okay.

388
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,540
How exciting!

389
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,840
We won!

390
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:36,780
This should be enough...

391
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,980
to run Sowongak for a year, right?

392
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,379
This is just...

393
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,590
what you got for your birthday.

394
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,389
The rice field you received from the former king...

395
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:49,220
produces 17,000 Seok of rice every year.

396
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,330
And the price of your house in Sujinbang went up a lot.

397
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,099
So you are actually...

398
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,270
very rich, Your Highness.

399
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:00,869
Still,

400
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:04,369
it was not enough to support the people of Mapo Riverport.

401
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,810
You are right,

402
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:09,849
but Sowongak cannot support them all forever.

403
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:14,520
Of course, it is best to provide a way to support themselves.

404
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,220
But how?

405
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,090
Pardon?

406
00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:21,189
I make money out of what is produced in my land,

407
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,830
but they do not have any land.

408
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,359
Well...

409
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:26,599
If they do not have land, they can be a tenant farmer,

410
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,230
sell goods,

411
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,669
catch fish,

412
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:32,669
or work at the palace like me...

413
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:35,340
None of those ways can be better than owning a land.

414
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:42,010
Are you bothered by that land lawsuit?

415
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,449
I want Kang Han Soo to win this case no matter what.

416
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,879
Not only for tenant farmers.

417
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,149
It is also a good chance to take a toll...

418
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,990
on Executive Minister Yoo and the Hungu officials.

419
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,060
It will be even harder to win for that reason.

420
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,490
Executive Minister Yoo will be helping.

421
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,399
What if I distract him?

422
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,899
How?

423
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,909
Gosh.

424
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:16,080
What brought you all the way here, Your Highness?

425
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:18,310
I came to make an official greeting.

426
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,649
Together.

427
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:25,490
Magistrate Yoo.

428
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,189
What is it?

429
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:30,990
Attorney Kang Han Soo is here.

430
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,830
- Kang Han Soo? - Yes.

431
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,929
He is requesting to see Lord Won's land certification again.

432
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:43,240
Sit back down.

433
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,179
Her Highness came all the way here,

434
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:49,209
so you should not leave her side.

435
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:19,070
Wait inside while I get the certification.

436
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,240
- I will go with you. - It is Minister Yoo's order.

437
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,349
Follow me, please.

438
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:57,810
What a palace.

439
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:54,899
Are you that famous attorney,

440
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,169
Kang Han Soo?

441
00:28:57,409 --> 00:28:58,669
Greetings.

442
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,609
It is my family's honour to meet you, Executive Minister Yoo.

443
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,109
I am glad you came at an important moment.

444
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,639
This is my wedding gift for you.

445
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,000
Your Highness came in person...

446
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:03,840
to announce Your Highness will marry my son.

447
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,669
As a vassal,

448
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,879
I could not simply disapprove of it.

449
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,050
So I already gave my approval...

450
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,020
to Ji Sun.

451
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:18,449
And as a father, I promised to change the law.

452
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,119
You will change the law?

453
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,459
Goodness. Why do you look so surprised?

454
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:29,629
Laws that are not helpful to the people should be changed, no?

455
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,639
Once Ji Sun becomes the King's son-in-law,

456
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:37,070
he must resign from the magistrate of Hanseongbu...

457
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:40,139
and many important posts.

458
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,609
That is losing an outstanding talent,

459
00:30:43,949 --> 00:30:46,449
which will also be a big loss to the kingdom.

460
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,990
That is why I called you here.

461
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,730
Rather than me changing the law,

462
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:03,800
you stopping this marriage will be faster.

463
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,840
I will leave it to you.

464
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:12,040
Now then, this old man has prior engagements.

465
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:13,510
Please excuse me.

466
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,290
There are many occasions to celebrate.

467
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,060
A few days ago was Your Highness's birthday.

468
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:34,330
And today, I hear of Your Highness's marriage.

469
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:38,030
Please give me a hint on what I will have to...

470
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,970
congratulate Your Highness for tomorrow.

471
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:44,270
Let me apologize on his behalf.

472
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:47,580
I am sorry, Your Highness.

473
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,409
Do not worry.

474
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,349
I was ready for this when I came to see the executive minister.

475
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:55,419
It will happen again from now on.

476
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:01,520
Your Highness sounds as if a war is ahead of you, not a wedding.

477
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,859
A princess's marriage...

478
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,159
is different from that of an ordinary woman.

479
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,030
Oh, is that so?

480
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,740
Your Highness...

481
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,010
has finally become a full-fledged princess.

482
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,159
If it is about the land lawsuit, let us talk at Hanseongbu.

483
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,359
I am not sure about that.

484
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,689
Is there a need to do that?

485
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,389
What do you mean by that?

486
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,159
Executive Minister Yoo...

487
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,929
already knows about it all.

488
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,040
That Lord Won's certification is fake.

489
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,119
(February 1)

490
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:03,250
- "Fake?" - Are you sure?

491
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,849
If not,

492
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,760
he would not have gathered all three of us here...

493
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
to watch us fight over love.

494
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:26,510
- Where is the certification? - Did you not receive it?

495
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,220
I knew this would happen.

496
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:37,050
Lord Won would not have done it by the books.

497
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:40,159
Right. My apologies, my lord.

498
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,060
I will let Lord Won know at once and fix this.

499
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,490
If you leave right now,

500
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:46,500
you might bump into Kang Han Soo.

501
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,869
My lord. Why not just burn it?

502
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,340
But if we burn the evidence...

503
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,039
Saying we lost the evidence...

504
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:05,180
is better than getting caught with a fake one in many ways.

505
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:07,519
- It will also buy us time. - Give it to me.

506
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,470
You should have told me if you had a hunch.

507
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,800
I could have helped.

508
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,800
You, Your Highness?

509
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:05,769
What are you implying?

510
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,709
Are you not hoping...

511
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:12,050
for Executive Minister Yoo to win this land lawsuit?

512
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:15,780
Why? Because I am a landowner myself?

513
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,890
Because if Executive Minister Yoo loses this lawsuit,

514
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,390
the other nobles with land will be in a tight spot?

515
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,729
Am I wrong?

516
00:35:26,899 --> 00:35:27,999
If I say so,

517
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:31,530
will you believe me?

518
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,970
Of course,

519
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:41,010
I cannot believe Your Highness.

520
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,550
What Your Highness showed me...

521
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,450
are lies,

522
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,720
lies,

523
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,090
and lies.

524
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,890
It was all lies.

525
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,729
Is there any sincerity in you, Your Highness?

526
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,079
What about you?

527
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,379
When you decided to get revenge for your father.

528
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:25,749
You were nothing but a sword to me.

529
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,090
A well-forged sword.

530
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,930
That was my only sincerity.

531
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:56,149
I feel sorry for Magistrate Yoo.

532
00:36:57,419 --> 00:36:59,649
I was fooled by Your Highness,

533
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:00,820
but what about him?

534
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,320
He knows what you are after.

535
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,030
And yet, he stays by Your Highness's side.

536
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,729
Even by making an enemy of his father.

537
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:13,169
How will you pay for all your sins later on?

538
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,840
I will deal with that.

539
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,320
I advise you to focus on your duties only.

540
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:38,189
What is your basis for claiming this document was fabricated?

541
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,859
When I checked during the trial,

542
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:44,169
Lord Won issued that certification on February 1,

543
00:37:44,169 --> 00:37:45,870
the government office's official holiday.

544
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,899
What kind of an officer would work on a holiday?

545
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:53,840
(February 7)

546
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:03,950
(February 7)

547
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,490
(February 7)

548
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,300
Right.

549
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,899
How impressive. Truly impressive.

550
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:25,510
The number has aged in that short time.

551
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:40,050
We came to help but were used.

552
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,059
My apologies.

553
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,660
It is not your fault.

554
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:04,910
Is there any sincerity in you, Your Highness?

555
00:39:20,129 --> 00:39:21,829
You were nothing but a sword to me.

556
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,169
A well-forged sword.

557
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,959
(Sowongak)

558
00:39:56,499 --> 00:39:57,899
Han Soo.

559
00:39:57,899 --> 00:39:59,070
What happened?

560
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,539
Have you checked?

561
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,309
I was a step behind.

562
00:40:05,939 --> 00:40:06,979
What?

563
00:40:13,749 --> 00:40:14,879
Where is the baby?

564
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,519
Ssal Bab.

565
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,220
What is wrong with Ssal Bab?

566
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:23,289
Why is my baby so feverish?

567
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:25,189
His fever will not drop.

568
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:26,999
I spoke to a physician,

569
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:28,499
and he said it is due to malnutrition.

570
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,640
Please open the door.

571
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,200
Receive permission from the up above before you pester me.

572
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,370
If I open the cell, I will get flogged instead.

573
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,740
A few slaps on your buttocks will not hurt you!

574
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:43,079
This baby is about to die!

575
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:45,010
This is my body we are talking about, not yours.

576
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,180
That little...

577
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,689
Why?

578
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,789
Is that not enough?

579
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:56,289
No.

580
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:57,859
Come on.

581
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,859
Ssal Bab.

582
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:04,600
Goodness, my baby.

583
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:05,999
My dear.

584
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,539
I am...

585
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:13,370
so sorry.

586
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:18,379
Mommy is sorry.

587
00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:29,189
What are you doing here?

588
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,959
Everything is my fault.

589
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,769
I put up a reckless fight without morals, away from the law.

590
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,700
That is why I always ruin everything.

591
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:44,709
It is not over yet.

592
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:46,340
They say what goes around...

593
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:48,680
comes around.

594
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,979
All of my sins have returned to me...

595
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:54,879
and punished my brother instead,

596
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,350
which also caused our loss in the trial.

597
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:07,760
No, pull it together, Jung Chu Soo.

598
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,829
It is not over yet, okay?

599
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,970
We did not lose.

600
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,600
But there is no way around this!

601
00:42:14,669 --> 00:42:17,539
Everything we tried has failed!

602
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,780
Lord Won was correct.

603
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,309
He said even you would not be able to find a way around this.

604
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,249
He is right.

605
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,620
We cannot win against the men who are in power.

606
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:35,519
How in the world are we going to win?

607
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,950
My brother never gave up...

608
00:43:00,149 --> 00:43:01,419
despite a few failed attempts.

609
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,999
Are you all right?

610
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,910
- Goodness. - Be careful.

611
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,510
- You should be careful. - Goodness.

612
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,850
I am fine.

613
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,450
Ssal Bab.

614
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,419
- You need to be careful. - Thank you.

615
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,930
You keep sweating.

616
00:44:12,649 --> 00:44:14,289
Why is it so hot today?

617
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,070
Did you wish to see me,

618
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,939
my lord?

619
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,649
Han Soo!

620
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,990
What?

621
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,459
Do not be so loud.

622
00:44:47,459 --> 00:44:48,559
Chun Sal is...

623
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:49,990
giving up on the lawsuit.

624
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,760
- What? Where is he? - Hurry!

625
00:44:53,689 --> 00:44:54,760
Stop right there!

626
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,269
How dare you...

627
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,930
Transfer of the deed?

628
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,439
I heard Lord Won has forged the deed,

629
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,800
and he lost the chance to reveal the truth.

630
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,910
You must fight...

631
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:07,939
a violation of the law with another violation.

632
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:10,979
And?

633
00:45:10,979 --> 00:45:13,149
We can forge the document too.

634
00:45:13,709 --> 00:45:15,720
We can make it look like...

635
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,090
Jung had transferred the deed to somebody else...

636
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,050
before Lord Won issued his deed.

637
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:23,660
And that somebody else is the Palace Treasury?

638
00:45:23,959 --> 00:45:25,329
Palace Treasury?

639
00:45:25,629 --> 00:45:28,359
The Palace Treasury is in charge of the Royal Family's assets.

640
00:45:28,499 --> 00:45:29,629
That means...

641
00:45:29,629 --> 00:45:31,769
He will only have to offer a percentage of his crops...

642
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:33,530
and exempted from taxes too.

643
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,769
Above all, Jung's family will be able to farm there...

644
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,740
as long as they wish.

645
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,840
We only register the land under the Palace Treasury,

646
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,579
but it is still as good as our land.

647
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,950
Who came up...

648
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:48,450
with this ridiculous idea?

649
00:45:49,479 --> 00:45:50,550
Me.

650
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,240
Instead of losing the lawsuit and the land his brother worked for,

651
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,070
it is much better to resort to an expedient...

652
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:13,340
to let them have a way to make a living.

653
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:14,609
What?

654
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,510
If he claims to have sold it to the Palace Treasury...

655
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:18,149
and not just any old nobleman,

656
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,450
Lord Won will not be able to hog the land tenaciously.

657
00:46:23,379 --> 00:46:25,149
What a hypocrite.

658
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:29,019
You are trying to expand the assets of the Palace Treasury...

659
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,760
by using these farmers as an excuse.

660
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,160
You are the one...

661
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,899
who is driving them to their ruin just to vent your spite.

662
00:46:36,899 --> 00:46:38,229
Stop talking nonsense.

663
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,840
That means he will continue to be a tenant farmer.

664
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,879
This does not change the fact he must farm someone else's land!

665
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,450
If he wanted to be his own man,

666
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:54,579
he should have been cleverer!

667
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:57,289
Your client is the one...

668
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:59,419
who was tricked into this because of illiteracy!

669
00:46:59,919 --> 00:47:01,390
He cannot stand on his own yet.

670
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,260
He still needs somebody's help.

671
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:05,430
I see. He cannot stand on his own?

672
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,829
Who?

673
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,399
These farmers?

674
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,629
Have you tried standing out there...

675
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:14,200
under the scorching sun even for 15 minutes?

676
00:47:21,379 --> 00:47:22,640
What are you doing?

677
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,649
Look.

678
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,919
I spent...

679
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:37,959
just one day carrying stones and woods to build an embankment.

680
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:39,530
Just one day.

681
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:44,430
My body was ruined in just a few hours.

682
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,470
My limbs began to shake as I ran out of breath.

683
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,070
This day...

684
00:47:50,399 --> 00:47:51,809
turns into two days,

685
00:47:52,209 --> 00:47:53,970
three days, four days,

686
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,780
ten days, a hundred days, then a year.

687
00:47:57,649 --> 00:47:59,809
This bloody pus begins to grow new flesh,

688
00:47:59,809 --> 00:48:02,220
then it rips open again repeatedly,

689
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,320
creating calluses all over the body.

690
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,289
All farmers have hundreds of calluses...

691
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:09,689
all over their bodies...

692
00:48:09,689 --> 00:48:11,760
as they endure the pain of their torn bodies!

693
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,289
And when the sun rises,

694
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,959
they go out to the field once again.

695
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:18,970
And what now?

696
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,999
Did you say they cannot stand on their own?

697
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:24,410
These people already stand on their own...

698
00:48:24,709 --> 00:48:26,140
for the sake of their own lives...

699
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,180
and the livelihood of this entire kingdom!

700
00:48:28,879 --> 00:48:31,579
How can you ask these people to resort to an unlawful act?

701
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:33,579
I see.

702
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:35,320
Is this that so-called power a princess can wield?

703
00:48:36,019 --> 00:48:37,689
Is this the way of the Royal Family?

704
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,930
Then what?

705
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:47,600
Do you have another plan?

706
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,600
See? You do not.

707
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:58,439
Talking big without a plan.

708
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,740
Is that not more irresponsible?

709
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:06,680
The decision will be made tomorrow.

710
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:10,649
Find a way to save your client until tomorrow...

711
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:13,689
or accept my offer.

712
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,090
You will have to make the call.

713
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,609
I heard that Lord Won's land lawsuit would come to an end tomorrow.

714
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:10,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

715
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,680
Are you also going to watch it?

716
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,680
I do not own that much land,

717
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:19,620
neither am I interested in lawsuits.

718
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,890
I see.

719
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,530
Not all members of Hungu...

720
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,890
own much land.

721
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:29,729
No, Your Majesty.

722
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:32,899
That must mean...

723
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:35,870
that not all members of Hungu...

724
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:38,570
share the same opinion.

725
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:42,910
Left Councillor,

726
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,749
I am quite lonely.

727
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,620
Your Majesty.

728
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:02,559
(The last day of the lawsuit)

729
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,200
The tenant farmers are always the problem.

730
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,870
They should be grateful for borrowing land...

731
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,010
and focus on their work.

732
00:51:11,439 --> 00:51:14,280
They are cultivating wastelands for no good reason.

733
00:51:14,879 --> 00:51:16,079
My point exactly.

734
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,309
Having their own land...

735
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:20,550
does not make them noblemen.

736
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,780
They will only get to pay less land taxes.

737
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,950
What is the point of all this?

738
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:27,249
They speak nonsense after eating all that expensive food.

739
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:28,859
That little tax...

740
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:31,789
is large enough to determine our life and death.

741
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:35,129
The noblemen who have no clue about the real world make the laws,

742
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,700
and we suffer the loss.

743
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,149
Magistrate Yoo.

744
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:03,490
I, Attorney Kang Han Soo, have something to say to you.

745
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:04,930
What is it?

746
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,800
I will...

747
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,200
drop the lawsuit.

748
00:52:14,129 --> 00:52:15,870
- What? - What did he say?

749
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,269
What is he saying?

750
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,470
- What about us? - That was so sudden.

751
00:52:26,649 --> 00:52:29,649
You would drop the lawsuit?

752
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,149
Yes.

753
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:33,419
I will drop it...

754
00:52:33,419 --> 00:52:36,519
to turn everything back to normal.

755
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,260
Back to normal?

756
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:57,010
They carried soil and rocks to build an embankment in a stranger's land.

757
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,419
So, I told them...

758
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,260
to get rid of all of it.

759
00:53:10,919 --> 00:53:12,660
If you get rid of it...

760
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,379
Oh, no. My land.

761
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:40,950
My land. Where is it?

762
00:53:41,459 --> 00:53:42,590
My land!

763
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,229
My land!

764
00:53:53,399 --> 00:53:55,269
You!

765
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:58,669
Give me back my land.

766
00:54:00,209 --> 00:54:02,180
My fertile land.

767
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,079
You scumbag.

768
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:06,709
What have you done?

769
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,479
I merely got it back to the way it had been.

770
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,680
What?

771
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,490
You can start over from scratch.

772
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,090
Just like my brother did!

773
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,689
You...

774
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:24,300
Oh, my land...

775
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,470
Let us see.

776
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:36,840
About nine months ago,

777
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,109
you registered the cultivation in February. So, you have...

778
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,120
about 2 years and 3 months remaining.

779
00:54:44,919 --> 00:54:46,320
Do you think you can make it?

780
00:54:47,419 --> 00:54:49,519
Lord Won, to cultivate the land from scratch,

781
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,019
we must hire servants.

782
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,329
What servants? Do you know how expensive they are now?

783
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,499
What if you used the servants working at your house?

784
00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:01,740
Then who will do the housework?

785
00:55:02,769 --> 00:55:05,209
Well, someone has to cultivate the land.

786
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,780
That is why I chose Jung's land, to begin with.

787
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:10,979
If I were to pay my money...

788
00:55:10,979 --> 00:55:12,350
to cultivate this land,

789
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,050
why would I be wasting my time on this lawsuit?

790
00:55:15,249 --> 00:55:16,320
Does that mean...

791
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:20,490
you meant to steal the land that Jung had worked hard to cultivate?

792
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,769
I will give up on the land.

793
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:35,570
I see.

794
00:55:36,939 --> 00:55:38,240
Will you?

795
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,010
(Land Deed)

796
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:46,209
Now, that land wholly belongs to your family.

797
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:50,249
Thank you.

798
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:52,590
Thank you so much.

799
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,519
Congratulations.

800
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:58,430
Attorney Kang, I am eternally grateful.

801
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,930
Do not mention it.

802
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,200
Thank you.

803
00:56:13,709 --> 00:56:16,740
You wanted to put all of us on the spot, and you did.

804
00:56:17,609 --> 00:56:19,050
You did not get the princess's help,

805
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,249
and you managed to get...

806
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,280
my father criticized by the members of Hungu.

807
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:26,990
But Chu Sal did not...

808
00:56:27,419 --> 00:56:30,160
exactly reclaim the land that his brother cultivated.

809
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,260
How come you used such a reckless and radical method?

810
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:37,129
It was all his idea.

811
00:56:38,629 --> 00:56:41,399
Even though it meant losing all of his efforts,

812
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:43,640
he wanted to reclaim the land.

813
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,439
He also wanted to set a precedent for future cases...

814
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:50,510
to prevent the farmers from being victimized.

815
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,379
He was willing to risk it all,

816
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,649
and I finally saw the solution.

817
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,329
Look.

818
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:18,240
Do not tell me...

819
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,979
Yes, it was supposed to be a wetland.

820
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,490
We merely moved the stakes...

821
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,959
and told him that we had destroyed the embankment,

822
00:57:34,959 --> 00:57:37,720
and that stupid Lord Won bought it.

823
00:57:41,729 --> 00:57:44,559
But how did he confuse this land with that land?

824
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:49,200
Lord Won did not intend on cultivating this land,

825
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,470
so he did not know the exact location.

826
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,669
He only had to think...

827
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,780
about how to take away this land.

828
00:57:56,939 --> 00:57:58,209
What if you had gotten caught?

829
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:09,559
Beats me.

830
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,129
If he had,

831
00:58:13,459 --> 00:58:15,760
he would have actually destroyed the embankment.

832
00:58:16,629 --> 00:58:18,499
What matters to Attorney Kang...

833
00:58:19,169 --> 00:58:20,669
is not the immediate gains...

834
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,140
but the future of the farmers.

835
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,209
He could not let this lawsuit be...

836
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:29,140
a poor precedent for other tenant farmers.

837
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:33,180
Yes. Which would have made him desperate.

838
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,990
Have you ever thought about this?

839
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,859
What changes the world...

840
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,129
is not power.

841
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,359
Perhaps it is the people's genuine desire.

842
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,939
What all the Royal Court and the Royal Family...

843
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,669
must do is...

844
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,749
to convince them that they will be rewarded for their hard work.

845
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,620
How much is this?

846
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,620
Has Joseon...

847
00:59:18,689 --> 00:59:21,059
established such trust with its people?

848
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,720
- So Ssal Bab... - Grab this, Ssal Bab.

849
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:50,990
- Ssal Bab. - Great job.

850
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:55,399
- Ssal Bab. - There, there.

851
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:57,499
- Pick the brush. - Pick the liquor.

852
00:59:58,669 --> 01:00:00,669
- He might become a painter. - Ssal Bab.

853
01:00:01,439 --> 01:00:02,899
- You picked the brush? - How nice.

854
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:04,700
- He has to pick the book. - I know.

855
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,209
I will raise him to be a great man.

856
01:00:06,209 --> 01:00:08,479
Right, I hope he draws nice paintings too.

857
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,039
Goodness.

858
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:14,309
I feel very embarrassed to say this myself,

859
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,720
but my sister-in-law and I decided to name Ssal Bab...

860
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,720
Han Soo.

861
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,789
- What? - What?

862
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,930
- What? - What?

863
01:00:29,999 --> 01:00:31,300
Can we?

864
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,300
Well...

865
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,910
What is wrong with everyone?

866
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:42,939
The other day, that newlywed wife...

867
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:44,479
You know Young Sil, right?

868
01:00:44,479 --> 01:00:46,950
She also said when she gave birth to her child,

869
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:48,649
she would name them Han Soo.

870
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,350
Really?

871
01:00:50,879 --> 01:00:54,419
Then there might be a lot of Han Soos in the future.

872
01:00:54,419 --> 01:00:56,789
I wish they do not take anything else after him.

873
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:03,829
I prepared a lot,

874
01:01:04,129 --> 01:01:05,300
so eat up.

875
01:01:05,399 --> 01:01:06,800
- Enjoy. - Sure.

876
01:01:06,899 --> 01:01:09,669
- Enjoy. - There is not much, though.

877
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,039
- Is it good? - It is great.

878
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,809
It is to die for. Nice job buying this.

879
01:01:12,809 --> 01:01:13,809
Eat up.

880
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,840
So now, your sister-in-law...

881
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,039
I delivered the goods safely.

882
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,640
Good job.

883
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:20,809
Thanks to you,

884
01:02:21,169 --> 01:02:23,910
I handled it very well...

885
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,609
on my own.

886
01:02:26,979 --> 01:02:28,680
It certainly got me mad.

887
01:02:30,419 --> 01:02:31,749
I am grateful,

888
01:02:34,649 --> 01:02:38,559
Your Highness.

889
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,600
I am glad I was helpful.

890
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:58,209
But please just stick to one from now.

891
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:00,709
Whether it is hypocrisy...

892
01:03:03,019 --> 01:03:04,079
or breaking our promise.

893
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:37,050
What is it?

894
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:38,890
Is it because of So Won... No.

895
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:42,390
I mean, Her Highness?

896
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:43,890
So,

897
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:46,260
why do you have to be so mean to her?

898
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:47,930
Because she lied?

899
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:49,829
Or because she is the Princess?

900
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,459
Because she is putting herself in danger.

901
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,669
What?

902
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,609
What is this?

903
01:04:11,919 --> 01:04:13,249
According to His Majesty,

904
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:14,990
the new commissioner's issue was raised...

905
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:16,590
at the bar for middle-class women and widows in Namchon.

906
01:04:16,959 --> 01:04:18,930
That place may be Executive Minister Yoo's source.

907
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,999
It seems...

908
01:04:24,129 --> 01:04:27,370
Her Highness is the incarnation of revenge.

909
01:04:28,129 --> 01:04:30,800
She wrote this to you in the midst of all that.

910
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,669
Why is it that all the women I know...

911
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:35,240
do not care for themselves?

912
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,410
Women who?

913
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,709
My mother was like that her whole life.

914
01:04:37,709 --> 01:04:39,209
The Princess and...

915
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:43,479
my Eun Soo.

916
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,350
- You are right. - Gosh.

917
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,660
All the women you know...

918
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,359
are better than you.

919
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:53,760
Yes, they are better than you too.

920
01:04:55,399 --> 01:04:57,229
Well, that is true.

921
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,129
Anyway,

922
01:05:01,399 --> 01:05:04,300
I bet Eun Soo has a child by now.

923
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:07,070
Han Soo.

924
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:08,579
Do you not want to see your nephew or niece?

925
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,939
Her child?

926
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,340
Want to go visit them?

927
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:13,109
- Her child? - Yes.

928
01:05:14,609 --> 01:05:16,149
- Should we? No. - Yes.

929
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:17,649
Not yet.

930
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,850
Should we go sneak a look at them?

931
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:19,890
No...

932
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:22,660
No...

933
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,189
Her child...

934
01:05:52,919 --> 01:05:54,189
Mother, Father.

935
01:05:56,189 --> 01:05:57,419
You are watching...

936
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,329
over our Eun Soo, right?

937
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,289
Wait here.

938
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:38,559
What is going on?

939
01:07:43,899 --> 01:07:44,999
Magistrate Yoo?

940
01:07:58,039 --> 01:07:59,479
It is nothing.

941
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:02,519
Let us go inside.

942
01:08:54,169 --> 01:08:57,669
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

943
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:08,150
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

944
01:09:08,919 --> 01:09:11,480
My father is Kang Han Soo's enemy who brought death to his parents.

945
01:09:12,449 --> 01:09:14,949
You must be mistaken.

946
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:17,819
I promised the Princess...

947
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,390
to spare his life.

948
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:21,789
However,

949
01:09:21,789 --> 01:09:23,730
I will not show mercy again.

950
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,499
Do you know what I really detest?

951
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:32,970
Do not do it.

952
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,310
That marriage.

953
01:09:34,869 --> 01:09:36,980
Your unnecessarily firm determination.

954
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:38,709
Your dangerous decisions.

955
01:09:40,879 --> 01:09:42,150
I do not permit it.
