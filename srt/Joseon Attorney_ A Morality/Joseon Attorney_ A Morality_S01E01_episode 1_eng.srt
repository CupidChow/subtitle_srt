1
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:47,670

2
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,420
 Notice on the sail:  Attorney for you available

3
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,834
 The spirit who dies unjustly wanders in the afterlife,

4
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:24,854
 harms a living person, or causes natural disasters.

5
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:30,094
 Aristocrats, commoners, and slaves

6
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:32,764
 are all equal only within the law.

7
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:37,984
 The people complain of injustice to the monarch through petitions.

8
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:44,294
 There are individuals who help ignorant people who can neither read nor know the law.

9
00:01:44,294 --> 00:01:48,454
 They are called attorneys.

10
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:57,854
Good, good, good.

11
00:01:57,854 --> 00:02:00,834
We finally arrived in Hanyang.

12
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:03,534
What are you going to do now?

13
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:06,844
We need to set up an attorney's office.

14
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:11,654
You spent all the money you saved in the country to buy this boat.

15
00:02:11,654 --> 00:02:13,984
Who comes to Hanyang without a single story?

16
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:17,834
Who leaves Hanyang without a single story?

17
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:21,204
Don't you understand?

18
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:25,384
All I see is my cash cow.

19
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:28,294
This is the best place for business.

20
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:34,024
But what is the place you are talking about?

21
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:36,700
Here!

22
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:40,684
Pardon? Here?

23
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:44,074
It even smells different.

24
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:47,664
It smells f-fishy.

25
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:53,704
I love this Hanyang smell so much.

26
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:07,764
 Episode 1: Attorney Kang Han Su

27
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:12,260
 Joseon Attorney

28
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:17,214
Please buy gat (hats for men). Gat!

29
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:19,150
We have paraengi too. Please buy gat.

30
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,670
 Wishes Inn

31
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:34,184
- Here are two bowls of rice soup. 
- Okay.

32
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:38,714
Here is Hanyang's most delicious rice soup.

33
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:43,104
Enjoy your drink.

34
00:03:43,104 --> 00:03:48,074
 Emergency Funds, Loans

35
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:52,524
- Here it is. 
- Oh, thank you!

36
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,304
And...

37
00:03:55,394 --> 00:03:58,174
I'll give you condolence money in advance.

38
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:02,454
On your way home, you should prepare a good coffin.

39
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:08,164
- Thank you, Innkeeper. 
- I hope the funeral goes well.

40
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,254
Thank you.

41
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:18,864
Have a cool drink.

42
00:04:23,434 --> 00:04:29,324
At first, you looked like the youngest daughter of a fallen noble family,

43
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:33,994
but you completely look like a maidservant now.

44
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:39,424
If I relied on my rights as a princess, whom could I comfortably ask for help?

45
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:41,584
What kind of princess would be doing this?

46
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:46,324
That's why I did it. Because someone has to do what others cannot.

47
00:04:46,324 --> 00:04:48,094
Prin–

48
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,354
If there are three zeros,

49
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:57,734
If there are three zeros...

50
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:02,314
How much was it?

51
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:09,904
You should do like this, My Lady!

52
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:11,984
Enjoy your drink.

53
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:19,804
Next person.

54
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:24,244
 Merchant Jang's Plum Wine Bar

55
00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:31,604
 Plum Wine

56
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,004
This tastes awful. This tastes awful.

57
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:46,014
The plum wine from the street stall over there smelled so good.

58
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:48,614
But what's wrong with this?

59
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:03,714
What?

60
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:27,384
Aigoo. Here is plum wine.

61
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:30,964
This smells amazing.

62
00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:33,704
Here, here.

63
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:36,464
Enjoy your drink. Yes, yes, coming!

64
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,724
It smells good.

65
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,424
- Please enjoy it and spread the word. 
- Hey.

66
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:46,304
Yes, yes.

67
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:52,254
How dare you sell plum wine, plum wine, plum wine?

68
00:06:52,254 --> 00:06:55,444
- Aigoo, my son.
 - Get out of the way, old lady.

69
00:06:55,444 --> 00:06:58,134
Mother! Mother! Mother!

70
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:00,330
What the hell are you looking at!

71
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:03,814
Hurry up and run away! Go!

72
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:07,484
Go! Hurry up and go!

73
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:10,824
Hey, get him! Get him!

74
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:25,764
What are you doing?

75
00:07:55,084 --> 00:07:56,764
Yum, yum.

76
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:58,584
Aren't you going to eat it?

77
00:08:00,844 --> 00:08:04,564
Please hide me. If I get caught, I will be beaten to death.

78
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:08,084
Oh, you should not be beaten. Go hide behind my donkey.

79
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:12,284
Where are you, knave? Come out!

80
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,680
Hey!

81
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:18,024
More, more. Go to the corner.

82
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:21,964
Where is he? Shit!

83
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:25,854
Hey, didn't you see the guy who ran away here?

84
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,680
Hey, catch him quickly!

85
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:38,964
There he is!

86
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:59,604
You should've given me a commission and obeyed me when I asked nicely.

87
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:02,294
How dare you sell plum wine without our merchant's permission?

88
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:04,304
You thieves!

89
00:09:04,304 --> 00:09:08,234
I set up first, and I make my own wine out of my own rice.

90
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:12,154
Who gives you the right to take a commission from me?

91
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:16,194
Stand up.

92
00:09:16,194 --> 00:09:20,124
You still don't understand what I am saying.

93
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:23,894
Stand up.

94
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:27,784
Stop it!

95
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:30,784
What is this?

96
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:35,284
Who are you?

97
00:09:36,204 --> 00:09:37,964
What is that?

98
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:53,394
What?

99
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:56,584
Let's go!

100
00:09:57,604 --> 00:09:59,244
Boss.

101
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,854
What are you doing in the backyard of someone's inn?

102
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,584
What is this?

103
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:08,394
Who is she?

104
00:10:08,394 --> 00:10:12,304
She is the owner of Wishes Inn, Inkeeper Hong.

105
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:17,344
Salted shrimp, liquor jars,

106
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:19,434
broken and ruined troughs...

107
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:23,364
Even at a rough estimate, the damage seems to be at least 50 nyang.

108
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:26,854
Are you standing here to compensate me for them?

109
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:41,254
Let's go.

110
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:46,824
Consider yourself lucky.

111
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:54,104
Aigoo. What should I do with all these?

112
00:10:58,674 --> 00:11:01,584
It is okay. Just go.

113
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:07,794
- Excuse me? 
- I was trying to scare them.

114
00:11:07,794 --> 00:11:10,344
Do not worry, and just go.

115
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:13,974
But what about this precious thing?

116
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:20,354
Thank you. Thank you, So Won.

117
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:22,594
Thank you.

118
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:30,884
Who are those rogues?

119
00:11:30,884 --> 00:11:32,794
They belong to Merchant Jang.

120
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:36,254
- Find out what is going on. 
- Yes.

121
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:54,224
A drink you cannot sell is worse than wastewater.

122
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:04,314
Why is the world so heartless to me?

123
00:12:04,314 --> 00:12:08,534
Do you want me to starve to death like this?

124
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:36,234
 Hire an attorney for legal problems

125
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:41,004
 Advance Payment Welcome

126
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:44,884
Nice to meet you again.

127
00:12:45,674 --> 00:12:49,044
Are you a real attorney?

128
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:54,224
Right. I am attorney Kang Han Su.

129
00:12:54,224 --> 00:12:56,774
What a rotten guy!

130
00:12:58,504 --> 00:13:02,264
Why do you get slapped at the Han River and vent your anger at the Nakdong River?  (i.e. why shift the blame to me?)

131
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:07,374
Is it not human nature to help people in need?

132
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:11,174
But you, the so-called attorney...

133
00:13:11,174 --> 00:13:14,604
That was before I was hired as an attorney.

134
00:13:14,604 --> 00:13:16,694
I...

135
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:20,694
only work when I am paid.

136
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:25,554
- What? 
- Are you upset? Is it unfair?

137
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,394
Then file a lawsuit.

138
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:31,994
It would be quicker to rely on the law than on human nature.

139
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:37,344
I would rather drown with my nose in the dishwater than trust a guy like you.

140
00:13:40,524 --> 00:13:43,324
Which dish are you going to stick your nose in?

141
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:48,014
Crazy bastard!

142
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:59,424
Or is there another way for you to make a living?

143
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:06,674
Try to cry and worry like that for a hundred days. See who will listen to you.

144
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:12,424
I tried to save the people whom the king has abandoned, yet you try to punch me?

145
00:14:12,424 --> 00:14:16,634
That's why you live your whole life like that!

146
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:22,184
- Honey! 
- Father!

147
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:24,414
Why did you come all the way here?

148
00:14:24,414 --> 00:14:26,554
What happened to your face?

149
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:30,084
Let's go home. Let's go.

150
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:32,594
Ouch.

151
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:34,954
You! Come in!

152
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:38,000
- Why are you hitting me, too?
 - Hurry!

153
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:41,394
Hey, hey, hey!

154
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:45,584
Are you out of your mind or not?

155
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,144
It took so much to bring in that client!

156
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:50,394
He still has a long way to go.

157
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:55,814
How many people have we seen who rush to file a lawsuit and give up so easily?

158
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:03,734
So we have to push him to the extreme limit so

159
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:08,504
he will not be swayed by any variables, temptations, or fears.

160
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:12,034
E-Extreme limit?

161
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:15,984
Sir, I'm Park, who sells plum wine. Please help me with the lawsuit—

162
00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:19,354
No, no. Go find somewhere else.

163
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:25,694
Attorney Sir, I need to sue Merchant Jang...

164
00:15:25,694 --> 00:15:26,744
Oh, I can't, I can't.

165
00:15:26,744 --> 00:15:28,494
We cannot defeat Merchant Jang.

166
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,674
Please do not do this here.

167
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:20,734
 He will definitely come back.

168
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:23,714
 He will not survive unless he comes back here.

169
00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:38,674
 So are you leaving Hanyang?

170
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:45,124
This is your hometown, where you were born and raised.

171
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:47,734
What about the work you have been doing all your life?

172
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:51,284
There's no place to rely on, no place to appeal.

173
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:55,304
What's the point of a hometown?

174
00:16:58,314 --> 00:17:03,024
I'm sure there is a way. If you wait a little longer...

175
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:05,824
I have endured enough, so it is okay.

176
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:09,704
Even if I want to file charges, the only attorney willing to take it is

177
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:12,394
only that scumbag, Kang Han Su.

178
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:15,214
I will be sure to pay you back this money.

179
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,264
Thank you, So Won.

180
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:44,284
Your Majesty, Princess Yeon Ju is here.

181
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:53,034
- Your Majesty. 
 - Sister.

182
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:57,124
Where did all these carp come from?

183
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:59,904
I guess people caught them and brought them here.

184
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:04,764
People like to catch and trap something, don't they?

185
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:09,594
I'm no different than an unlucky carp who is trapped.

186
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,154
Then I was lucky.

187
00:19:20,154 --> 00:19:26,054
I got to leave the palace and live freely, thanks to our father's early passing.

188
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,834
That's not what I meant.

189
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,154
I know. I was just joking.

190
00:19:31,154 --> 00:19:34,504
Anyway, I cannot joke with you, Your Majesty.

191
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:41,794
You can joke about everything but the throne.

192
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:48,384
It's the throne my uncle ascended so hurriedly that he even overthrew my older brother.

193
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,114
It's a bed of thorns,

194
00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:54,884
so I cannot face you nor the grand prince.

195
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:59,724
Why do you often summon me when you say you cannot face me?

196
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:04,644
That is because no one else tells me real stories besides you.

197
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:11,374
Now, what other fun stories are you going to tell me today?

198
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:22,344
This has a deep and intense smell.

199
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:24,644
Yes, this is wine.

200
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:29,714
It's plum wine made with a secret method that has been handed down for three generations.

201
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:36,144
Is it not a waste to enjoy it alone?

202
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:38,764
Then go ahead, Sister.

203
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:43,564
The people. I want to introduce this taste to them as well.

204
00:20:43,564 --> 00:20:47,824
But the city's alcohol trade is held tightly by Merchant Jang.

205
00:20:47,824 --> 00:20:53,754
Therefore, small merchants like Park cannot do business freely but rather get kicked out.

206
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,794
To them, power is the law.

207
00:20:55,794 --> 00:21:00,654
That is why we need to clear the way for small merchants to run businesses freely.

208
00:21:01,414 --> 00:21:03,504
We should do that.

209
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:07,264
Even though I am under a regency, I am still the king.

210
00:21:07,264 --> 00:21:10,044
I can handle something like this without a problem.

211
00:21:12,534 --> 00:21:14,434
Then I will finish the rest of your drink.

212
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:16,434
Do you want some more?

213
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,570
 Attorney for Hire / Legal Department / Kang Han Su

214
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,884
Here. I am attorney Kang Han Su.

215
00:21:23,884 --> 00:21:27,674
I am attorney Kang Han Su. Just tell me if you experience something unfair and bitter.

216
00:21:27,674 --> 00:21:30,284
We will definitely win. Please trust me.

217
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:33,894
Get one nyang and earn ten nyang. I am attorney Kang Han Su!

218
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:38,014
Just tell me something that is unfair and bitter. We will definitely win.

219
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:40,624
- Attorney? 
- On behalf of your siblings, uncles, nephews,

220
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:42,974
in-laws, and relatives, I will file a lawsuit.

221
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:45,794
We will definitely win. I am attorney Kang Han Su!

222
00:21:45,794 --> 00:21:48,804
I am attorney Kang Han Su!

223
00:22:05,254 --> 00:22:07,954
Except for the cases where the slave accuses the owner, the son accuses the father,

224
00:22:07,954 --> 00:22:10,584
and the wife accuses the husband, we will settle everything.

225
00:22:10,584 --> 00:22:13,694
Here is one for you, My Lady!

226
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:18,284
Here. I am attorney Kang Han Su. We will definitely win!

227
00:22:18,284 --> 00:22:21,214
 Hire an attorney to act on your behalf, Attorney Kang Han Su. Boat office next to Sowongak.

228
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,284
Kang Han Su?

229
00:22:27,234 --> 00:22:28,784
 What?

230
00:22:29,644 --> 00:22:32,704
We will definitely win. I'm Kang Han Su, the best attorney in Joseon.

231
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,704
Despicable guy.

232
00:22:38,884 --> 00:22:40,694
Who was it?

233
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,524
Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim!

234
00:22:44,574 --> 00:22:46,874
We are in trouble!

235
00:22:46,874 --> 00:22:48,444
Why?

236
00:22:48,444 --> 00:22:51,874
Park must be planning to leave Hanyang.

237
00:22:51,874 --> 00:22:55,114
He is packing now.

238
00:22:57,764 --> 00:23:00,134
W-Wait...

239
00:23:00,134 --> 00:23:02,034
Wait...

240
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:04,034
Hurry up!

241
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:13,474
 Your Excellency, this is Eunuch Go.

242
00:23:24,514 --> 00:23:28,340
Your Excellency, the king is looking for you.

243
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:34,664
I have an urgent meeting, so let him know I will visit him as soon as this is done.

244
00:23:39,504 --> 00:23:41,424
Y-Yes.

245
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,370
 Order

246
00:23:51,224 --> 00:23:55,674
Then I will turn this agenda over to the Ministry of Justice.

247
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:09,400
It is burning well.

248
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:12,484
It will burn everything down.

249
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:24,624
Fire! Fire!

250
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,944
Fire! It is fire!

251
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:29,574
Aigoo. It is fire!

252
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:33,154
- Aigoo. Aigoo.
 - Fire!

253
00:25:39,944 --> 00:25:42,364
Mother!

254
00:25:42,364 --> 00:25:45,314
Honey! What should we do?

255
00:25:45,314 --> 00:25:47,784
Oh, what should we do?

256
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,374
Are you all right?

257
00:25:57,044 --> 00:26:01,074
How do we live now? This precious thing is...

258
00:26:01,074 --> 00:26:06,714
Aigoo, what should we do? Aigoo, what should we do?

259
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:22,564
I beg you.

260
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,200
Please take the case.

261
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:43,624
Are you teasing me? I am really desperate.

262
00:26:43,624 --> 00:26:46,234
You have not had dinner yet, have you?

263
00:26:47,144 --> 00:26:50,474
We were just about to have a late-night snack.

264
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:56,604
Have a seat. Make yourself at home.

265
00:26:56,604 --> 00:26:58,314
Now!

266
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:05,184
Please eat. They say everything goes better on a full stomach.

267
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:20,914
Okay! I am glad you came back.

268
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:26,554
Attorney Kang Han Su has been in Hanyang for less than a month.

269
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,500
He is already a famous attorney in Gyeongsang-do, Jeolla-do, and Chungcheong-do.

270
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:35,294
Civil law, criminal law, and commercial law. If he takes the case, he will win without fail.

271
00:27:35,294 --> 00:27:38,444
He has never lost.

272
00:27:38,444 --> 00:27:44,134
From now on, I will be your lawyer, your rope, and your straw.

273
00:27:44,134 --> 00:27:48,234
I have enough for your family, so do not hesitate to eat.

274
00:27:56,254 --> 00:28:00,450
I think I misunderstood you, Sir.

275
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,620
I apologize.

276
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:08,504
Gosh, this is so heartwarming.

277
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:09,844
All right!

278
00:28:09,844 --> 00:28:13,494
From now on, I will treat you as my hyeongnim.

279
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:16,564
- H-Hyeongnim? 
- Yes, Hyeongnim.

280
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:20,194
Please call me younger brother.

281
00:28:20,194 --> 00:28:22,700
From now on, I will be your cousin-brother.

282
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,060
That's how I will introduce myself in front of the judge.

283
00:28:27,004 --> 00:28:28,714
Okay.

284
00:28:32,864 --> 00:28:36,744
- Don't you want to ask us why? 
- I have heard of it.

285
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:40,854
There are many who think of you as a rogue or swindler.

286
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:44,684
When you file a lawsuit, you usually pretend to be your client's relative.

287
00:28:44,684 --> 00:28:48,554
It is not necessarily because of that.

288
00:28:48,554 --> 00:28:56,404
I want to be very sincere in this lawsuit as if it were my business.

289
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:59,494
Of course, he does.

290
00:29:01,394 --> 00:29:05,724
Then now...

291
00:29:06,874 --> 00:29:10,484
please sign here, Hyeongnim.

292
00:29:18,184 --> 00:29:20,524
No!

293
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:24,174
- So Won. 
- Ajeossi, do you not know him?

294
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:26,414
He is that guy from then.

295
00:29:26,414 --> 00:29:29,944
I know. I know, but

296
00:29:29,944 --> 00:29:35,184
all the other attorneys run away when I say it is Merchant Jang, so what should I do?

297
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:40,724
I already knew this attorney was rude with a terrible temper, but who knows?

298
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:44,714
He might beat Merchant Jang with his terrible temper.

299
00:29:44,714 --> 00:29:47,714
We cannot win with a bad temper. Rather than that,

300
00:29:47,714 --> 00:29:52,074
it would be better to persuade the judge by sincerely telling him your unfair story.

301
00:29:56,844 --> 00:29:58,844
Sincerely?

302
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:02,754
Do you still believe that is going to work?

303
00:30:02,754 --> 00:30:05,194
It's not because I believe it, but that is what I hope for.

304
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:08,454
If we hope and try hard, the reality might get a little better.

305
00:30:08,454 --> 00:30:11,584
So has it changed?

306
00:30:20,704 --> 00:30:23,724
- Oh, Ajeossi!
- There you go.

307
00:30:23,724 --> 00:30:27,154
You made a good choice, Hyeong Park.

308
00:30:28,154 --> 00:30:31,174
I am going to trust this person.

309
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:36,094
There is nothing else I can do right now.

310
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:02,054
Ajeossi, please wait a little bit longer.

311
00:31:02,054 --> 00:31:04,244
To be honest, I am...

312
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:07,284
To be honest...

313
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,454
Wait a minute.

314
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:21,764
 (The king's eunuch, Eunuch Go)  He said there was no way.

315
00:31:21,764 --> 00:31:25,044
He also said to tell you he was sorry.

316
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:48,384
What did we get? Did we get sued?

317
00:31:48,384 --> 00:31:50,674
Did we get sued?

318
00:31:57,844 --> 00:32:02,974
Do you not know how important this time is for our business?

319
00:32:02,974 --> 00:32:04,764
We are aware!

320
00:32:04,764 --> 00:32:06,614
And yet you do this?

321
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:10,094
I've grown my business by wandering around the countryside on my feet,

322
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,864
and now is the critical time to decide whether or not to supply to the palace in Hanyang.

323
00:32:13,864 --> 00:32:16,354
What? What did we get?

324
00:32:16,354 --> 00:32:19,764
We got sued? A lawsuit?

325
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:24,074
We were just trying to teach him the law of our business.

326
00:32:26,934 --> 00:32:29,074
Then shall we look for a famous attorney, too?

327
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:32,084
Just shut up and sit still!

328
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:38,174
Why would we waste money on lawyers?

329
00:32:38,174 --> 00:32:44,274
We need to spend money where it is worth spending.

330
00:32:46,184 --> 00:32:48,564
A bunch of wretched bastards.

331
00:33:24,464 --> 00:33:27,644
 He said there was no way.

332
00:33:27,644 --> 00:33:30,944
 He also said to tell you he was sorry.

333
00:33:52,954 --> 00:33:56,754
This was not part of my plan. This is an expensive one at that!

334
00:33:56,754 --> 00:33:58,734
Goodbye!

335
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:11,534
No way.

336
00:34:24,084 --> 00:34:28,224
I knew it! Did you do it?

337
00:34:30,884 --> 00:34:34,194
- What if I say yes? 
- I must report you to the government office immediately.

338
00:34:34,194 --> 00:34:38,274
Then who is going to take charge of Park's lawsuit?

339
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:44,524
Is it important to punish me, or is it important to save him?

340
00:34:44,524 --> 00:34:48,654
Think about it. I am not going to run away.

341
00:35:03,404 --> 00:35:07,734
It is going to be an obvious outcome! 
  Hanseong-bu

342
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:13,900
How can they defeat Merchant Jang?

343
00:36:02,554 --> 00:36:07,744
That guy next to you with the pretty face is Attorney Kang Han Su.

344
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:09,854
Who the heck is that?

345
00:36:09,854 --> 00:36:14,164
Did he eat a flatfish or something? Why is he glaring at me like that?

346
00:36:18,064 --> 00:36:20,064
Don't be intimidated.

347
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:23,714
A lawsuit is all about its momentum.

348
00:36:24,804 --> 00:36:26,434
Yes.

349
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,600
Plaintiff, please submit the parties' lawsuit initiation agreement.

350
00:36:52,274 --> 00:36:56,354
 We will pursue this lawsuit fair and square.

351
00:36:56,354 --> 00:37:00,314
 Please give us a judgment according to the law.

352
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:06,694
I am a country bumpkin, so it is my first time seeing a lawsuit.

353
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:08,294
Who is suing whom?

354
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:13,634
And plaintiff, defendant... I have no idea what they are talking about.

355
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:15,904
How would I know?

356
00:37:17,554 --> 00:37:20,134
Think of it simply.

357
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:24,704
The plaintiff is the one who has a grudge and initiates the lawsuit.

358
00:37:24,704 --> 00:37:28,124
And the opposing party going up against the plaintiff is called the defendant.

359
00:37:29,344 --> 00:37:31,244
I see.

360
00:37:31,244 --> 00:37:33,384
The one with a grudge is called the plaintiff.

361
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,874
The one defending himself is called the defendant.

362
00:37:34,874 --> 00:37:36,794
Right.

363
00:37:52,614 --> 00:37:54,064
 What is this?

364
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:58,014
 I hear it is the evidence that Jang has submitted.

365
00:37:58,014 --> 00:38:04,044
 He has requested that you take a close look at it, Mayor Sir.

366
00:38:06,924 --> 00:38:10,804
 There is quite a lot of evidence here!

367
00:38:10,804 --> 00:38:13,174
 Great. Sounds great.

368
00:38:17,654 --> 00:38:22,914
Plaintiff Park has initiated a lawsuit against defendant Jang

369
00:38:22,914 --> 00:38:28,714
for assault, obstruction of business, and damage to property,

370
00:38:28,714 --> 00:38:32,684
and has requested compensation for damages.

371
00:38:33,414 --> 00:38:39,104
Then plaintiff Park, begin your argument.

372
00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:47,304
I sell one or two jars of plum wine to barely make a living, caring for an elderly mother.

373
00:38:47,304 --> 00:38:49,084
Yet he tells me to close my business?

374
00:38:49,084 --> 00:38:54,554
To put it bluntly, how is it my fault that Merchant Jang has lost business selling his wine?

375
00:38:54,554 --> 00:38:58,884
It is so unfair for him to coerce me to pay him a commission.

376
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:01,374
Come on now! Coerce?

377
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:06,844
Lord Mayor, our store is a proper business that runs while paying taxes to the government.

378
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,424
If our rights as a business have been violated,

379
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:12,624
the government should rightly protect us. Do you not think so?

380
00:39:12,624 --> 00:39:16,684
That is right! I am very well aware of it.

381
00:39:16,684 --> 00:39:24,634
Thanks to Merchant Jang, the businesses in Mapo have been vitalized.

382
00:39:24,634 --> 00:39:29,164
And I hear you pay quite a huge sum in taxes to the government.

383
00:39:29,164 --> 00:39:31,204
We pay taxes as well.

384
00:39:31,204 --> 00:39:36,104
We even pay four paper bills per month at that.

385
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:41,484
The Daejeon* says that merchants must pay four paper bills per month.
  (Book of law)

386
00:39:41,484 --> 00:39:43,644
And we are only doing business based on national law.

387
00:39:43,644 --> 00:39:46,714
So what is so wrong with this?

388
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:49,264
The national law?

389
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:53,064
Book—

390
00:39:53,774 --> 00:39:57,674
Does the Book of Law even mention things like that?

391
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:03,394
We were merely following a conventional practice.

392
00:40:03,394 --> 00:40:09,894
Traditionally, only one merchant produces and distributes alcohol in a region. Thus...

393
00:40:09,894 --> 00:40:14,204
there has been a similar conflict in another region as well in the past.

394
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:19,494
And the government sided with the proper merchant rather than the street vendor.

395
00:40:19,494 --> 00:40:22,514
I will submit the precedent case as my evidence.

396
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:24,224
Look!

397
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,330
 Editor's note:  I think he is speaking Chinese.

398
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,750
How dare you! This is not the content in the code of law. (Speaking in Chinese.)

399
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,080
This is the summary of verdict from the previous lawsuit.

400
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,940
Isn't it?

401
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,714
What?

402
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:46,754
What is he saying?

403
00:40:46,754 --> 00:40:48,864
I don't get it at all.

404
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:52,074
Speak our language. Speak Korean.

405
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,104
That is what I mean.

406
00:40:54,104 --> 00:40:59,424
We should speak in Korean when you are in Joseon. That is the same way with the law!

407
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:05,094
But why is the defendant submitting precedence from the Ming Dynasty?

408
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:15,664
I am not saying this to boast.

409
00:41:15,664 --> 00:41:19,314
As for me, whatever I have studied, whether it's law books, other books, or even the royal court newspaper,

410
00:41:19,314 --> 00:41:21,890
I do not ever forget what I have read once.

411
00:41:45,144 --> 00:41:48,004
Therefore, I do remember this very clearly.

412
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:52,214
The precedent that Innkeeper Jo brought with him is not from April 3rd of the year of the white tiger in Joseon,

413
00:41:52,214 --> 00:41:55,044
but it is a precedent case from the Ming Dynasty!

414
00:41:55,044 --> 00:42:00,534
On top of that, since it is a summary, all the details of the lawsuit, such as the plaintiff, have been omitted.

415
00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:03,534
I will inquire of you one more time, Lord Mayor.

416
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:10,274
- Where are we right now? 
- Joseon?

417
00:42:10,274 --> 00:42:12,764
And who are we?

418
00:42:14,374 --> 00:42:16,604
People of Joseon.

419
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:21,354
Lord Mayor, do you wish to adhere to our Joseon's law, or

420
00:42:21,354 --> 00:42:25,314
is it the precedent case of the Ming Dynasty that Merchant Jang as put forth?

421
00:42:25,314 --> 00:42:28,354
That's right!

422
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:37,974
Where are we again?

423
00:42:38,874 --> 00:42:40,824
Joseon!

424
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:43,984
- Where are we now? 
- Joseon!

425
00:42:43,984 --> 00:42:47,324
- And who are we? 
   - People of Joseon!

426
00:42:47,324 --> 00:42:50,304
- What is our law? 
- Daejeon (Book of Law)!

427
00:42:50,304 --> 00:42:53,774
So why should we have a judgment based on the Ming Dynasty's precedence?

428
00:42:53,774 --> 00:42:57,724
- Is that not so, everyone? 
- That is right!

429
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:15,674
Therefore, you must allow him to run his plum wine business.

430
00:43:15,674 --> 00:43:21,054
We believe it is only right that he receive compensation for damages incurred by Merchant Jang's misconduct.

431
00:43:26,914 --> 00:43:29,494
Why do you not watch it to the end?

432
00:43:29,494 --> 00:43:31,804
We have the answer already.

433
00:43:31,804 --> 00:43:35,974
If he were to side with Merchant Jang at this point, he would be called a traitor.

434
00:43:35,974 --> 00:43:39,724
That judge will not have a choice.

435
00:43:49,654 --> 00:43:51,794
Merchant Jang,

436
00:43:55,884 --> 00:44:00,244
do not disturb Park's business from now on

437
00:44:00,244 --> 00:44:05,214
and compensate for all the damage he has suffered thus far.

438
00:44:15,544 --> 00:44:18,294
Lord Mayor Heo! Lord Mayor Heo!

439
00:44:18,294 --> 00:44:20,334
Wait! Sir!

440
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:22,924
- This lawsuit is not over. 
- Sir!

441
00:44:22,924 --> 00:44:27,944
 Kang Han Su! Kang Han Su!

442
00:44:27,944 --> 00:44:33,320
 Kang Han Su! Kang Han Su!

443
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,930
♫  Run away  ♫

444
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:42,644
The law books that His Majesty put so much effort into assembling are finally shining through.

445
00:44:42,644 --> 00:44:44,474
Yes, he is very good.

446
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:50,234
He thoroughly knows the Book of Law that even the head government official has not mastered.

447
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:52,754
He is very clever.

448
00:44:52,754 --> 00:44:56,614
On top of that, something that even His Majesty had given up on

449
00:44:56,614 --> 00:45:00,294
one mere attorney has done.

450
00:45:02,764 --> 00:45:09,304
Kang Han Su! Kang Han Su! Kang Han Su!

451
00:45:16,044 --> 00:45:20,244
How did you know that I would bring in a wrong precedent case?

452
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:24,354
By putting myself in your shoes.

453
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:29,274
I thought if I were Merchant Jang's attorney, I figured I would look through all the precedent cases.

454
00:45:29,274 --> 00:45:33,524
But most of the precedent cases are written in summaries.

455
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:36,714
The lawyers usually do not look up the original cases.

456
00:45:36,714 --> 00:45:39,654
Why? Because we are lazy.

457
00:45:40,784 --> 00:45:44,514
Where exactly did you see the original case document?

458
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:47,624
I have not seen them, either.

459
00:45:47,624 --> 00:45:49,404
What did you say?

460
00:45:49,404 --> 00:45:52,614
Fortunately, our judge was also lazy, so I was able to get past that.

461
00:45:52,614 --> 00:45:55,784
Thus, if you want to make an issue out of this,

462
00:45:55,784 --> 00:46:01,834
bring it up to a judge who receives lots of taxpayer money.

463
00:46:01,834 --> 00:46:03,694
Not me, though.

464
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,400
There! 
  Verdict

465
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:22,154
So do you feel a bit more relieved now?

466
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,244
Aigoo, of course!

467
00:46:24,244 --> 00:46:26,724
I have been running my business trying to avoid Merchant Jang.

468
00:46:26,724 --> 00:46:30,914
My tight and anxious heart is finally at ease!

469
00:46:38,204 --> 00:46:40,840
 Verdict

470
00:46:50,814 --> 00:46:53,200
Then you have to pay me to make you feel better.

471
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,800
Also, pay for the cost of this verdict too.

472
00:46:56,434 --> 00:46:59,594
- P-Pardon? 
- "Pardon"?

473
00:46:59,594 --> 00:47:02,304
The payment for winning your case. Do you not remember?

474
00:47:02,304 --> 00:47:04,314
I-I do remember.

475
00:47:04,314 --> 00:47:07,774
Since I have a way to sell my wine, I will sell it on the market day...

476
00:47:07,774 --> 00:47:10,684
Oh, so you cannot pay up now?

477
00:47:10,684 --> 00:47:13,874
So are you changing your mind now that you have won the lawsuit?

478
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:16,624
N-No, that is not it.

479
00:47:17,744 --> 00:47:20,944
My house had burnt down. I just do not have any money to give you right this moment.

480
00:47:20,944 --> 00:47:24,234
- Look at this guy— 
- Hey, Dong Chi!

481
00:47:26,454 --> 00:47:30,824
Do not worry. We also accept goods instead.

482
00:47:30,824 --> 00:47:32,784
Pardon?

483
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:34,974
Let us go.

484
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:37,414
Okay. Let us go.

485
00:47:55,904 --> 00:47:57,194
Why are you doing this?

486
00:47:57,194 --> 00:48:01,014
How can I prepare my father's memorial table without things for his table?

487
00:48:01,014 --> 00:48:03,124
Even if you prepared a memorial table after ripping someone off,

488
00:48:03,124 --> 00:48:07,954
would your father even come and enjoy the memorial table?

489
00:48:07,954 --> 00:48:09,884
You all are too much!

490
00:48:09,884 --> 00:48:12,874
Too much?

491
00:48:12,874 --> 00:48:14,624
We saved you while you were almost dying!

492
00:48:14,624 --> 00:48:17,824
It is too much for you to be glaring at us!

493
00:48:24,464 --> 00:48:26,614
Give them everything.

494
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:31,714
We can finally run our business, thanks to these men.

495
00:48:31,714 --> 00:48:34,574
We can earn money again,

496
00:48:34,574 --> 00:48:38,844
but we cannot pay for the grace they have shown us if not now.

497
00:48:39,994 --> 00:48:41,634
So...

498
00:48:44,754 --> 00:48:48,534
Thank you so much for understanding our situation.

499
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:51,284
I wish you long life.

500
00:48:58,254 --> 00:49:00,474
What are you doing?

501
00:49:01,574 --> 00:49:04,594
Can you not tell? I am collecting my fee.

502
00:49:04,594 --> 00:49:09,284
Did you do all that only to take away stuff like this?

503
00:49:09,284 --> 00:49:10,664
"Stuff like this"?

504
00:49:10,664 --> 00:49:14,354
How are you different from Merchant Jang, then?

505
00:49:16,794 --> 00:49:22,064
He suffocates people, and I am a benefactor who opens up the doors for them to survive.

506
00:49:22,064 --> 00:49:25,814
So would they not have to pay for at least this much payment?

507
00:49:25,814 --> 00:49:28,394
What a money monger.

508
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:35,684
Do you know why human blood smells metallic? It is the smell of money.

509
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:41,424
Because people like money so much that the smell of it has seeped into their blood.

510
00:49:43,454 --> 00:49:45,394
It's them!

511
00:49:46,974 --> 00:49:50,564
He set fire to Park's house.

512
00:49:52,564 --> 00:49:55,404
- W-Wait...
 - Take them away!

513
00:49:56,664 --> 00:49:58,844
W-Wait...

514
00:49:58,844 --> 00:50:02,354
H-Hyeongnim! What is going on here? Hyeongnim!

515
00:50:02,354 --> 00:50:06,944
Was it really you and not Merchant Jang's people?

516
00:50:23,574 --> 00:50:28,494
They say people change their minds when they go in and out of the outhouse.

517
00:50:28,494 --> 00:50:32,534
That moron, Park. I am sure he is doing this because he does not want to pay us.

518
00:50:32,534 --> 00:50:37,264
- He looks mild-tempered, but he's completely— 
- I set it on fire.

519
00:50:37,264 --> 00:50:40,724
- Yeah. He's completely— You set it on fire.

520
00:50:41,544 --> 00:50:42,974
What?

521
00:50:42,974 --> 00:50:46,294
- This is the injury from then. 
- Really?

522
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:49,814
Wh-Why? Why did you do it?

523
00:50:52,244 --> 00:50:55,844
But thanks to that, Park was able to come on time.

524
00:50:59,554 --> 00:51:01,864
"Thanks to that"?

525
00:51:01,864 --> 00:51:05,284
I guess I will not die when it is my rightful time to go.

526
00:51:05,284 --> 00:51:09,034
Why would you set fire to someone else's house? Fire?

527
00:51:09,034 --> 00:51:14,084
If you set fire, it means beheading...

528
00:51:14,084 --> 00:51:18,834
So deny it no matter what. Say it was a mistake, not intentional.

529
00:51:18,834 --> 00:51:20,764
Do you think that is a solution here?

530
00:51:20,764 --> 00:51:23,064
It is the only solution that is out there, so keep that in mind.

531
00:51:23,064 --> 00:51:26,954
And... remember that you and I are on the same side.

532
00:51:26,954 --> 00:51:29,324
Kang Han Su!

533
00:51:31,574 --> 00:51:38,614
That attorney... is my lifesaver.

534
00:51:38,614 --> 00:51:40,874
Mother, what are you talking about right now.

535
00:51:40,874 --> 00:51:47,064
I was... trying to kill myself.

536
00:51:52,854 --> 00:51:57,604
 We were leaving our hometown, trying to survive somehow.

537
00:51:57,604 --> 00:52:00,024
 But with my leg in this state,

538
00:52:00,024 --> 00:52:03,234
 rather than become a burden to you both,

539
00:52:04,424 --> 00:52:07,984
 I thought I would be one less mouth for you to feed.

540
00:52:16,704 --> 00:52:19,974
 Fire!

541
00:52:19,974 --> 00:52:21,774
 What?

542
00:52:21,774 --> 00:52:25,044
 Fire... Oh, no...

543
00:52:28,244 --> 00:52:31,194
 Fire! Fire.

544
00:52:31,194 --> 00:52:34,774
 It's our family's livelihood. Aigoo!

545
00:52:34,774 --> 00:52:37,584
 Oh, no! Aigoo!

546
00:52:37,584 --> 00:52:44,084
 You intend to die anyway. Why do you care whether dried shit or ashes go into the wine jars?

547
00:52:45,424 --> 00:52:49,464
 Do you think this life and the afterlife exist in different places?

548
00:52:49,464 --> 00:52:51,294
 No way.

549
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:56,894
 Once you depart this life that way, your remaining children will feel as though this place is the afterlife,

550
00:52:56,894 --> 00:53:01,614
 and every moment they breathe will be hellish.

551
00:53:04,624 --> 00:53:07,444
 A child needs a mother.

552
00:53:08,594 --> 00:53:10,824
 No matter how old the mother is.

553
00:53:10,824 --> 00:53:14,064
 That is when I realized it.

554
00:53:14,064 --> 00:53:16,674
That I am a mother.

555
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:24,124
I-I am sorry, Mother!

556
00:53:24,124 --> 00:53:27,274
- I am sorry, Mother! 
- Mother.

557
00:53:31,154 --> 00:53:32,874
I am sorry, Mother.

558
00:53:32,874 --> 00:53:38,684
My son, I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

559
00:53:38,684 --> 00:53:41,714
I am sorry, Mother.

560
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,080
 In mourning

561
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,084
 Mother?

562
00:54:44,574 --> 00:54:47,214
 Mother! Mother!

563
00:54:47,214 --> 00:54:50,534
 Mother! Mother!

564
00:57:14,224 --> 00:57:17,264
Are you still thinking about that man?

565
00:57:18,074 --> 00:57:19,984
Because this is the first time.

566
00:57:19,984 --> 00:57:25,714
Using the law, he saved one person's— No, he saved an entire family's life.

567
00:57:25,714 --> 00:57:28,674
Although he did use trickery,

568
00:57:28,674 --> 00:57:32,144
I do not know if I have the right to blame him for it.

569
00:57:33,304 --> 00:57:36,274
Actually, I have been feeling frustrated.

570
00:57:36,274 --> 00:57:41,304
I have been lending money to the needy with the profit from the inn and sharing rice.

571
00:57:41,304 --> 00:57:43,534
I am doing all I can in my own way.

572
00:57:43,534 --> 00:57:48,904
Yes. It was like filling a bottomless vessel. It was only a temporary solution.

573
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,534
But that guy guaranteed one family's livelihood.

574
00:57:54,534 --> 00:57:56,454
And legally, with a judgment.

575
00:57:56,454 --> 00:57:58,974
I remember what Father used to say.

576
00:57:58,974 --> 00:58:03,174
What the late king said?

577
00:58:03,174 --> 00:58:09,334
He said that the law ultimately has to rule over the people, not the king.

578
00:58:09,334 --> 00:58:13,004
Now, I understand a little bit of what he meant.

579
00:58:20,444 --> 00:58:24,464
Aigoo! I'm dying!

580
00:58:24,464 --> 00:58:29,654
Aigoo! We helped someone who was drowning.

581
00:58:29,654 --> 00:58:33,134
How could he pay kindness with evil?

582
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,744
Thirteen!

583
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:39,334
- Fourteen! 
- We traveled all over the country

584
00:58:39,334 --> 00:58:41,764
and fed him and dressed him!

585
00:58:41,764 --> 00:58:45,094
 We should've left him alone!

586
00:58:46,234 --> 00:58:48,604
 How could he...

587
00:58:49,324 --> 00:58:52,554
Did you put in a good word? What is going to happen to them?

588
00:58:52,554 --> 00:58:55,114
I said he got startled because of me

589
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:59,844
and that he dropped the spark that he was holding, and the fire started from that mistake.

590
00:58:59,844 --> 00:59:06,004
I did ramble on and say that it was not intentional in any way.

591
00:59:06,004 --> 00:59:08,644
They get twenty strokes even with extenuating circumstances.

592
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:13,174
They say starting a fire, even as a mistake, is a huge crime.

593
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:16,004
Well, the law is the law.

594
00:59:16,004 --> 00:59:18,644
Since I reported them, I will take care of the aftermath, be it an apology or other things.

595
00:59:18,644 --> 00:59:21,004
Ajeossi, take your mother home.

596
00:59:21,004 --> 00:59:22,474
Okay.

597
00:59:22,474 --> 00:59:25,844
No, please.

598
01:00:13,124 --> 01:00:18,654
We brought in musicians especially for you, Chief Advisor.

599
01:00:18,654 --> 01:00:21,344
Sounds nice. Very nice.

600
01:00:26,464 --> 01:00:30,224
Ouch! Gentle, gentle.

601
01:00:31,424 --> 01:00:33,134
- Ouch! 
- Gosh, you're exaggerating!

602
01:00:33,134 --> 01:00:35,554
You will not die from twenty strokes of flogging.

603
01:00:35,554 --> 01:00:41,374
Alcohol is best for treating flogging. Go ahead and drink up!

604
01:00:41,374 --> 01:00:44,734
Yes, yes...

605
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:49,314
But how did you get flogged like that?

606
01:00:49,314 --> 01:00:52,324
Aigoo, do not even mention it.

607
01:00:52,324 --> 01:00:54,974
We were lucky to just get a flogging.

608
01:00:54,974 --> 01:01:01,884
If we hadn't been, this drinking table could have become our funeral table.

609
01:01:01,884 --> 01:01:04,684
It was not luck. It was the law.

610
01:01:04,684 --> 01:01:07,544
Someone who knows the law very well told Park and his mother

611
01:01:07,544 --> 01:01:10,994
to testify, saying that it was not intentional. That is why this happened.

612
01:01:10,994 --> 01:01:13,164
And you!

613
01:01:13,164 --> 01:01:16,604
I heard everything you said.

614
01:01:16,604 --> 01:01:22,554
I mean, that is not what we are talking about here.

615
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:28,654
Because you were up to something you had never done before,

616
01:01:28,654 --> 01:01:34,130
we almost got to meet the grim reaper!

617
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:39,874
So are you disappointed? Do you want me to send you there again?

618
01:01:39,874 --> 01:01:45,174
But you know, considering you sacrificed your bottoms like this, is the result not that great?

619
01:01:45,174 --> 01:01:47,484
Memorial table bowls and utensils...

620
01:01:47,484 --> 01:01:51,164
We will surely collect properly from now on.

621
01:01:51,164 --> 01:01:55,474
Are you thinking of getting more out of the wine vendor and his mother?

622
01:01:58,954 --> 01:02:02,954
I have tossed bait elsewhere.

623
01:02:02,954 --> 01:02:06,284
Elsewhere?

624
01:02:07,804 --> 01:02:10,154
That is that.

625
01:02:10,154 --> 01:02:14,124
I am sure you did not invite me over just to listen to some music.

626
01:02:14,124 --> 01:02:18,674
You had not said anything further about the Dohwaseo* contract...  (Office in charge of paintings needed by the court)

627
01:02:18,674 --> 01:02:20,564
Right.

628
01:02:20,564 --> 01:02:25,914
I did think about giving you both a chance this time around,

629
01:02:25,914 --> 01:02:29,664
but that was until yesterday.

630
01:02:29,664 --> 01:02:31,764
Wh-What do you mean until yesterday?

631
01:02:31,764 --> 01:02:35,564
Come on now. Look how dense you are.

632
01:02:35,564 --> 01:02:38,824
No wonder you were humiliated in a lawsuit.

633
01:02:38,824 --> 01:02:43,844
I mean, that case and this contract have nothing to do with each other.

634
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:47,694
How could it not be relevant? How, huh?

635
01:02:47,694 --> 01:02:51,904
You do not bring goods into the palace just because they are good.

636
01:02:51,904 --> 01:02:59,224
It is a place where all the people who are out to find even your slightest flaw are gathered.

637
01:03:00,334 --> 01:03:03,374
If you are going to do the job, do it right.

638
01:03:03,374 --> 01:03:08,084
Who would work with a merchant who got mixed up in a lawsuit?

639
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:13,070
 Moonlight Pavilion

640
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:16,774
Myeong Wol, I do not want to go home.

641
01:03:16,774 --> 01:03:18,864
My gosh...

642
01:03:29,674 --> 01:03:34,084
Do you now know what you have done to me?

643
01:03:34,084 --> 01:03:36,794
My apologies, Sir.

644
01:03:40,824 --> 01:03:42,584
Sir!

645
01:03:46,304 --> 01:03:50,814
- What did you say? Is he here? 
- Yes.

646
01:03:54,184 --> 01:03:56,044
I feel a little better.

647
01:03:56,044 --> 01:03:57,994
I wish I could have gotten flogged instead!

648
01:03:57,994 --> 01:04:01,924
- You would die in the process. 
- Seriously...

649
01:04:49,124 --> 01:04:52,354
A-Again! It is you again!

650
01:04:52,354 --> 01:04:56,144
W-Well, I waited for you in front of the government office.

651
01:04:56,144 --> 01:04:59,434
You disappeared while I went away for a moment to purchase tofu.

652
01:04:59,434 --> 01:05:01,174
Why?

653
01:05:01,174 --> 01:05:05,004
Oh, right. You want to give me the disease and offer medicine, too?

654
01:05:05,004 --> 01:05:07,244
Well...

655
01:05:09,834 --> 01:05:11,584
Well...

656
01:05:13,024 --> 01:05:16,584
I am sorry about what happened.

657
01:05:16,584 --> 01:05:18,094
Huh?

658
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,924
Is that the tone you use to apologize?

659
01:05:23,924 --> 01:05:27,034
It is the first time I've apologized to someone in my life.

660
01:05:27,034 --> 01:05:30,384
No wonder I am not used to using the right tone.

661
01:05:39,824 --> 01:05:42,574
Right. That could happen.

662
01:05:42,574 --> 01:05:50,874
With my generous heart, I will teach you how to apologize with all sincerity.

663
01:05:50,874 --> 01:05:53,474
First, put your two hands together like this.

664
01:05:55,644 --> 01:05:57,624
Put them together.

665
01:06:02,284 --> 01:06:06,094
And close your eyes.

666
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:09,944
Yes. And then...

667
01:06:14,924 --> 01:06:18,464
- Do you want to give me a peck on the cheek? 
- Pardon?

668
01:06:18,464 --> 01:06:21,504
You said you were here to apologize to me.

669
01:06:22,784 --> 01:06:26,604
- Are you joking? 
- I mean it.

670
01:06:26,604 --> 01:06:30,164
Attorney Han, if I am being sincere with you, please...

671
01:06:30,164 --> 01:06:32,914
You do not need to apologize.

672
01:06:32,914 --> 01:06:37,744
It is true that I set it on fire. So I just paid for the wrong I had committed.

673
01:06:41,444 --> 01:06:44,214
Although my buttocks did hurt a bit.

674
01:07:21,724 --> 01:07:25,714
Wow! Nice picture!

675
01:07:27,014 --> 01:07:28,504
Huh?

676
01:07:57,274 --> 01:07:59,014
What the hell?

677
01:08:03,974 --> 01:08:06,744
Are you awake now?

678
01:08:06,744 --> 01:08:09,794
W-W-Wait! Hey, hey!

679
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,684
Hey! Dong Chi! Damn it!

680
01:08:17,494 --> 01:08:19,634
Here we go again.

681
01:08:19,634 --> 01:08:21,764
Merchant Jang?

682
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:26,454
Since you recognize me, I guess you know what is about to happen now.

683
01:08:26,454 --> 01:08:28,654
Of course.

684
01:08:30,414 --> 01:08:32,634
- You laugh? 
- What took you so long, Merchant Jang?

685
01:08:32,634 --> 01:08:37,024
I thought my neck was going to give.

686
01:08:37,024 --> 01:08:38,854
What did you say?

687
01:08:39,624 --> 01:08:42,924
By chance, did you have business to take care of with me from the start?

688
01:08:42,924 --> 01:08:46,844
If not for that, there is no reason I would be here,

689
01:08:46,844 --> 01:08:50,574
hanging like this, right?

690
01:09:19,104 --> 01:09:21,084
Merchang Jang.

691
01:09:22,544 --> 01:09:26,754
 Arrest all the family and search throughout the house!

692
01:09:26,754 --> 01:09:28,434
 Yes, Sir!

693
01:09:29,334 --> 01:09:32,004
Should we make a deal?

694
01:09:32,004 --> 01:09:34,624
I will let you live.

695
01:09:38,094 --> 01:09:40,254
Who is going to save whom?

696
01:09:40,254 --> 01:09:43,814
I said I will...

697
01:09:47,654 --> 01:09:51,684
save you. Okay? Okay?

698
01:09:51,684 --> 01:09:54,354
Geez! Wait, wait, wait! Hey!

699
01:09:54,354 --> 01:09:58,494
I am talking to you! You are dead!

700
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:05,044
I said I would let you live. Okay?

701
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:13,680

702
01:10:16,084 --> 01:10:18,754
♫  Light you up, I'm on fire  ♫

703
01:10:18,754 --> 01:10:21,174
♫  Got you right down to the hell  ♫

704
01:10:21,174 --> 01:10:24,994
♫  Yeah we singing, oh  ♫

705
01:10:24,994 --> 01:10:26,814
♫  Everybody gotta&nbsp;stand up  ♫

706
01:10:26,814 --> 01:10:29,484
♫  Light you up, burn me down  ♫

707
01:10:29,484 --> 01:10:33,124
♫  Put you perfect undergound  ♫

708
01:10:33,124 --> 01:10:34,654
 Joseon Attorney

709
01:10:34,654 --> 01:10:38,284
 I mean, how could she like you, Hyeongnim?

710
01:10:38,284 --> 01:10:40,024
 I fell in love with you at first sight!

711
01:10:40,024 --> 01:10:44,134
 She's bold and decisive. She also seems crazy.

712
01:10:44,134 --> 01:10:47,954
 So please fulfill your goal. I will earn some time for you.

713
01:10:47,954 --> 01:10:51,984
 The opposing attorney is highly skilled.

714
01:10:51,984 --> 01:10:55,614
 Talking about Daejeon that the late king put together and whatnot...

715
01:10:55,614 --> 01:10:57,034
 Daejeon?

716
01:10:57,034 --> 01:11:04,244
 Now that I think about it, it has been a while since I have heard about Princess Yeon Ju.

717
01:11:04,244 --> 01:11:11,654
 Your Majesty, I wish to... train Kang Han Su as my man.

718
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,500
♫  Let's fix everything  ♫
