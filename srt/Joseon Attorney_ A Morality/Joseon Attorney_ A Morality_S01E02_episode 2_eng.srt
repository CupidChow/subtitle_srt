1
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,474

2
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:44,704
 There was a time when I was happy, although we were poor.

3
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:53,644
 Because my mother felt bad for humble dinner tables,

4
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:59,864
 she exchanged the precious hair she inherited from her parents for yellow corvina.

5
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:05,674
 And my father, who felt badly for his wife...

6
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:07,264
Here you go. 
  Classic of Filial Piety

7
00:01:08,514 --> 00:01:11,034
- Good day. 
 - Thank you.

8
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:13,634
 ...sold books he had cherished

9
00:01:16,234 --> 00:01:18,774
 and purchased a gift for my mother.

10
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:20,690
 Those were the days.

11
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,304
Father!

12
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:25,124
Hi, Han Su.

13
00:01:25,124 --> 00:01:26,774
What is that?

14
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:28,774
Oh, this?

15
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:33,784
Here you go. Say you bought this.

16
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:35,304
Okay?

17
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,804
 Beginning of luck | Living in a peaceful country

18
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:11,234
What is this?

19
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:15,054
My goodness. It's silk.

20
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:17,104
By chance, did you purchase it?

21
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:20,124
Do you think I stole it somewhere, then?

22
00:02:20,124 --> 00:02:24,084
Gosh! You can't even eat this. Why would you pay for this?

23
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:30,134
But what is this?

24
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:32,664
My goodness! I totally forgot!

25
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:37,114
Someone asked to use the outhouse, so I kept it for them.

26
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:39,524
Just leave it. Don't look through someone else's things.

27
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:44,274
You need to check to see if they forgot it or threw it out.

28
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,744
What is that?

29
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:55,414
My goodness...

30
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:57,944
Wait...

31
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:02,154
Arrest all family members and search throughout the house!

32
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:04,064
Yes, Sir!

33
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:07,804
Oh, no! Han Su! No!

34
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:10,554
Why are you doing this? What did we do?

35
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:12,194
Why are you doing this?

36
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:15,324
Stop this! No!

37
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:17,374
No!

38
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,374
 That is when I learned that

39
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:30,314
 when anger, hatred, anguish, remorse, pain...

40
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:35,384
 are all gathered into one emotion, it becomes bitter resentment.

41
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:38,110
No! No!

42
00:03:38,974 --> 00:03:41,344
 - I will take revenge.  
 - Mother!

43
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:47,074
 I will let the world know how we suffered.

44
00:03:50,254 --> 00:03:54,724
 That is the reason I became a lawyer.

45
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:59,604
 Episode 2: Prelude to Revenge

46
00:04:00,884 --> 00:04:05,074
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

47
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:20,714
I said let's make a deal. Why don't we work together?

48
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:23,494
I said I'd save you!

49
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:28,204
A deal is made when each party has something to exchange.

50
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:32,324
What could a lawyer possibly give a merchant like me?

51
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:44,964
Let's see...

52
00:04:44,964 --> 00:04:50,054
Do you know the palace supply contract you lost recently?

53
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:55,514
The palace supply contract you recently lost.

54
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:59,124
I will get it for you.

55
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:02,084
How could you possibly?

56
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:08,004
Hey.

57
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:25,804
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

58
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:39,064
Hey!

59
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:41,294
Hey!

60
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,804
Wait, wait, wait! Wait a minute!

61
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:55,474
Hold on!

62
00:05:55,474 --> 00:06:00,134
Do you know the painting the chief advisor is dying to locate?

63
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:01,944
I will hand that to you, Merchang Jang.

64
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:07,164
I have looked all over the country for that. How could you possibly do that?

65
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:11,114
Come, come out.

66
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:16,564
That man Pyo, who possesses the painting.

67
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:18,844
I know him well.

68
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,300
 About a month earlier

69
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,934
There are so many.

70
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:40,324
Okay! Let us eat some taffy!

71
00:06:42,204 --> 00:06:44,274
Okay, eat some taffy!

72
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:48,074
Give me some, please!

73
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,164
Eat plenty, okay?

74
00:06:51,164 --> 00:06:53,714
Look at this stretch.

75
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,714
 For some reason, he's behind bars at the Hanseongbu prison.

76
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:04,064
As an attorney, I'll get him out.

77
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:07,604
And I'll take the painting as payment.

78
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:11,420
How about it? Do you want to trust me and go with it?

79
00:07:13,294 --> 00:07:18,384
Do you want me to trust you after winning one lawsuit with that glib tongue of yours?

80
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:21,214
There is no way.

81
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:24,764
- Indeed, you are right in saying so.
 - What is that?

82
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:36,134
You should put up collateral instead of asking for blind trust.

83
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:43,974
She must still be asleep.

84
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:50,024
- Then I will... 
 - Who the hell is that girl?

85
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:53,774
Why did you drag her? Shut her up and get rid of her!

86
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,944
Three hundred nyang.

87
00:07:58,884 --> 00:08:04,014
How about 300 nyang as collateral?

88
00:08:04,014 --> 00:08:07,604
I am suspicious that the attorney knows too much about us.

89
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:10,704
You cannot let him go with just that deal.

90
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:13,684
Fine!

91
00:08:14,604 --> 00:08:18,774
However, I will decide on the collateral.

92
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:45,714
She may be quite useful if we put her to good use.

93
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:48,864
I think she will be worth at least 300 nyang.

94
00:08:51,444 --> 00:08:56,154
I think 300 nyang might be a bit much—

95
00:08:57,524 --> 00:09:01,684
- Why not ask for other collateral– 
 - Fine.

96
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,924
She says fine.

97
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:10,274
Can you give us some privacy to discuss it?

98
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:15,254
It will only take a moment.

99
00:09:31,794 --> 00:09:33,944
Do not be distracted, and watch them carefully.

100
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:36,064
Yes, Sir.

101
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:50,894
- What in the world—
 - Am I thinking? If you ask me that, yes, I wasn't thinking.

102
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:53,324
It just came out.

103
00:09:53,324 --> 00:09:56,134
Because I want to trust you, Sir.

104
00:09:56,134 --> 00:09:59,334
But why exactly? I do not remember giving you a reason to trust me.

105
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:01,994
But you did make me curious.

106
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:09,444
 I have become curious as to

107
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:13,634
 what you are trying to do and what you're capable of.

108
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:17,444
Well, I cannot say that, so...

109
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:22,814
What are you saying? Tell me so I can understand!

110
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:26,744
- Oh well, the thing is...
 - Yes?

111
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:29,084
- Well... 
 - Yes?

112
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:31,754
Well?

113
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:34,564
I fell in love with you at first sight!

114
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:39,554
I want to repay you and help you in some way.

115
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:46,214
Would that not be the feeling of love, the attitude of someone in love?

116
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:50,874
So please accomplish what you can! I will make time for you.

117
00:10:51,994 --> 00:10:53,564
- I see you are crazy. 
 - Yes.

118
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:55,734
I mean, pardon?

119
00:10:58,184 --> 00:11:01,574
You can still be sick without a fever. You are sick.

120
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:04,434
Forget everything that happened today, and go on your way.

121
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:07,494
I am not that disloyal of a girl! I mean what I say.

122
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:10,044
- I do not like debts. 
 - It is not a debt. It is a connection.

123
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,384
This is how two people become connected.

124
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:13,834
I hate that even more.

125
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:18,254
I am good to look for when you have a lawsuit. Otherwise, you gain nothing by knowing me.

126
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:21,824
I will decide that for myself. They say a person knows himself the least.

127
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:23,754
Please trust...

128
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:26,884
my eyes.

129
00:11:33,564 --> 00:11:35,284
I mean...

130
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:42,004
Will ten days do it for you?

131
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,744
Eleven days?

132
00:11:44,994 --> 00:11:46,814
Twelve days?

133
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:49,504
Thir...

134
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,934
Fourteen days?

135
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:56,414
I will finish it in five days.

136
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,274
Great!

137
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,620
Go! Go!

138
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:17,124
I mean, how could she fall for you, Hyeongnim?

139
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:18,754
What?

140
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:23,794
You should have cut her off at once!

141
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:26,794
"I have my plans. So go away!"

142
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:28,984
"Are you not busy with your inn?"

143
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:31,930
If I had, that child's temperament would have bitten down more nosily

144
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,270
and stretched the questioning, like taffy to midsummer.

145
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:42,614
I guess she is not normal, seeing how she said she has fallen for you.

146
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:47,964
She's bold and decisive. She also seems crazy.

147
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:52,004
I can feel the inner strength that she has developed from

148
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,634
working with sailors who stay at her inn.

149
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:57,604
However...

150
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,944
she does not smell fishy at all.

151
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:06,314
What should I say? For some reason, I smell something unfamiliar coming from her.

152
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:16,814
Is it the scent of green grapes?

153
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:20,034
I do not think it is the maiden who fell in love

154
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:23,854
but you, Hyeongnim.

155
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:28,904
Because this is the first time.

156
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:31,734
First time?

157
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:34,654
 I am sorry about what happened.

158
00:13:34,654 --> 00:13:38,034
The first time I received an apology from someone.

159
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:41,924
"I'm sorry, spare my life. Let me go this once."

160
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:44,394
I begged and pleaded every time.

161
00:13:44,394 --> 00:13:47,854
 It is my first time apologizing to someone in my life.

162
00:13:47,854 --> 00:13:53,604
I have never received a sincere apology from anyone before.

163
00:13:57,534 --> 00:14:01,894
Geez! Whatever! You have never done so, either!

164
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:03,894
Geez!

165
00:14:04,914 --> 00:14:06,490
Let us go for a drink, Hyeongnim.

166
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,930
 Wishes Inn

167
00:14:12,504 --> 00:14:16,814
Baek, check the market streets. Eo Rim and Ban Poon, check the ferry dock.

168
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,874
We might get caught!

169
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:23,434
Should we not tell her where she is? On a humane level.

170
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:27,990
Can you not sense what would happen to us then?

171
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:32,080
Hurry up!

172
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:38,034
It was too long a night.

173
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:43,614
So? What is your next step?

174
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:46,074
What else? I have to release Pyo.

175
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:48,264
And I can just get the painting instead of a payment.

176
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:50,144
What? Damn it!

177
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:53,414
Then why did you put Pyo behind bars to begin with?

178
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:56,784
You knew those bastards were looking for the painting, so you told me to find Pyo!

179
00:14:56,784 --> 00:15:01,154
I searched the city with a fine-toothed comb for a month and finally found him!

180
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:04,114
You will release him? That criminal?

181
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:08,544
I got it. I got it. Calm down. I got it.

182
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:10,304
Calm down.

183
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:13,774
Don't you think he's pretty exceptional?

184
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:16,564
A mere thief who ran away with a painting from the Ming Dynasty.

185
00:15:16,564 --> 00:15:20,824
How dare he think of stealing children to sell in a foreign country?

186
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:24,234
But thanks to that, I have bait to throw at Merchant Jang.

187
00:15:24,234 --> 00:15:27,614
He makes me so happy.

188
00:15:27,614 --> 00:15:29,914
So...

189
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:33,404
how will you get Merchant Jang with that bait?

190
00:15:33,404 --> 00:15:36,534
I will repay him in exactly the same way he did my father.

191
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:39,104
So how?

192
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:43,044
What is the relationship between Pyo and Merchant Jang?

193
00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:51,244
Some kind of special relationship.

194
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:01,084
You will get me acquitted?

195
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:02,744
In our country Joseon,

196
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:07,524
the moment you are charged with a crime and are sitting in prison, your life is over.

197
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:11,934
Either you die from the torture during the interrogation or die in prison waiting for a verdict.

198
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:14,884
Either way, you die all the same. So...

199
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:17,894
that is why you need a lawyer like me.

200
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:22,744
Our attorney Kang Han Su has a winning rate of 100%.

201
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:25,304
But I do not have any money.

202
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:28,464
But you have something else.

203
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:33,624
Valuable goods that came across the sea.

204
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:41,664
So you must know me, right?

205
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:44,894
Yes. Very well.

206
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:50,234
Then please hurry.

207
00:16:50,234 --> 00:16:52,044
The kids are starving.

208
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,674
 Save us!

209
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:59,694
 Because I got arrested so fast, I could not even give them any water.

210
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:08,264
In order for me to leave Joseon safely,

211
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:11,884
please prepare a boat for me.

212
00:17:11,884 --> 00:17:14,204
Hyeongnim—

213
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:18,114
I guess I must be getting old, seeing how I got caught sitting here.

214
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:23,014
Taking all of them with me is too much of a hassle. So, you guys buy the kids from me.

215
00:17:23,014 --> 00:17:26,064
I will give you a cheap price. One hundred nyang.

216
00:17:26,064 --> 00:17:28,234
O-One hundred nyang?

217
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:31,974
Hyeongnim, a moment. A moment with me.

218
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,554
Hyeongnim, it is not that I do not want to waste the money.

219
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:41,144
L-Look at that bastard's attitude.

220
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:45,784
Who knows what he'll do when he gets out.

221
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:56,324
Lend you a boat?

222
00:17:56,324 --> 00:18:01,564
It's one of Pyo's conditions. We are to purchase the children he kidnapped as well.

223
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:04,484
- Is that all you need?
 - One more thing.

224
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:09,314
You must stand as a witness, Sir.

225
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:16,434
You just have to testify and say you were with Pyo on the night he kidnapped the children.

226
00:18:16,434 --> 00:18:19,264
I have to stand and testify as well?

227
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,324
It seems you are asking him to commit perjury. If so, then I should—

228
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:26,834
It must be you, Sir.

229
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:28,324
How so?

230
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:33,244
The mayor, who will judge the case, will be suspicious and think I bribed the witness. However,

231
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:37,684
you and I have been involved in a lawsuit recently, and we are not on good terms.

232
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,984
You would never be bribed by me and commit perjury.

233
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:45,734
But how would you trust him and take such a risk?

234
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:04,994
With one perjury, if I could gain supply rights to the palace.

235
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:14,474
Grand Merchant Sir, this is not it.

236
00:19:14,474 --> 00:19:16,444
Grand Merchant Sir!

237
00:19:16,444 --> 00:19:19,464
There is no other solution!

238
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:23,244
Or else, all of this will become trash.

239
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:26,224
He has already caused damage to our business once before.

240
00:19:26,224 --> 00:19:28,814
Who knows what he might do to us again?

241
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:31,034
So what?

242
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:36,084
I will find out if Kang Han Su has any other motive.

243
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:38,244
Please wait for me.

244
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:48,344
Why are you doing this? We still have some time, according to our agreement.

245
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:51,804
I hear Kang Han Su is taking on the case of the guy who kidnapped children.

246
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:55,034
- Did you not know? 
 - Is he releasing such a man?

247
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:57,794
Please release me! I need to stop him.

248
00:19:57,794 --> 00:20:00,104
I should just crush him.

249
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:03,284
Then,

250
00:20:03,284 --> 00:20:08,914
you have no idea of his plan and what he might do, yet you volunteered to be a hostage?

251
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:11,234
I trusted that he would do whatever it took.

252
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:14,344
I did not know what he might do.

253
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:19,144
And you expect me to believe that?

254
00:20:19,144 --> 00:20:22,864
Would you like to take my heart and have a look at it?

255
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:34,504
Then go now and try to stop him.

256
00:20:34,504 --> 00:20:37,354
Or crush him, as you have said.

257
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:44,534
You are trying to use me to distract Attorney Kang

258
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,384
and then follow him, are you not?

259
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:51,914
You are uselessly smart!

260
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:54,984
I make a living as a broker in an inn.

261
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:58,144
I would be of no use if I wasn't quick witted.

262
00:20:58,144 --> 00:21:01,574
Then that means I could just drag out some time, right?

263
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:04,214
Then you are letting me go for good.

264
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:06,464
All right.

265
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:08,304
Hurry up and go.

266
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:10,034
Yes, Sir.

267
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:32,974
You must appear at the right time.

268
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:34,580
You will give him time to run away if you appear too early.

269
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,990
If you're too late, something unexpected could happen.

270
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:41,664
Well, if we do this well, we can get more money, right?

271
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:44,854
The basic goal is to take revenge. The money is a given.

272
00:21:47,994 --> 00:21:53,414
Great. Let us get a boat better than the one Merchant Jang has.

273
00:21:53,414 --> 00:21:56,704
Sounds good. Let us go.

274
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,970
You?

275
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:15,944
I mean, what are you trying to do now? How did you get out?

276
00:22:15,944 --> 00:22:17,874
Is that important right now?

277
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:19,504
Then what else is important?

278
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,344
Let's make a bet.

279
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:24,374
A bet?

280
00:22:24,374 --> 00:22:26,174
If you win, go ahead with the lawsuit.

281
00:22:26,174 --> 00:22:31,094
But if you lose, you must give up on representing that criminal.

282
00:22:31,094 --> 00:22:32,114
Is that what this is about?

283
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:34,224
- Do you accept? 
 - If I don't?

284
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:36,114
I will stop acting as collateral.

285
00:22:36,114 --> 00:22:41,534
Then you will be locked up in storage instead of me, Sir.

286
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:47,934
Either way, I guess I cannot go to court if I do not win.

287
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:52,004
Do give up now if you are not confident.

288
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,070
Give up?

289
00:22:54,834 --> 00:23:00,024
You better not give up. It is no fun if it is too easy.

290
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:03,734
Then starting now,

291
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:07,604
- we will have a drinking game. 
 - Drinking?

292
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:12,584
Quiet. Quiet.

293
00:23:14,904 --> 00:23:18,394
The one who passes out first loses.

294
00:23:18,394 --> 00:23:20,554
Bring on the alcohol!

295
00:23:27,814 --> 00:23:31,904
I guess I will get to have plenty of free drinks today.

296
00:23:31,904 --> 00:23:39,044
I wonder if you know that I used to be called the "Hellish Alcohol Jar" at the courtesan house.

297
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,234
Do you know where you are?

298
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:46,374
This is the inn the biggest drunkards in the eight provinces of Joseon walk by.

299
00:23:46,374 --> 00:23:50,814
When they address me, they call me "Heavenly Shot Glass,"

300
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:54,554
because if they play drinking games against me, they see heaven.

301
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:12,514
All right! First bowl!

302
00:24:22,664 --> 00:24:26,204
You are not emptying your class completely. So dishonest.

303
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:28,944
I think you are dripping more than you are drinking.

304
00:24:28,944 --> 00:24:31,504
All right. Second bowl!

305
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:45,244
You know Pyo's case?

306
00:24:45,244 --> 00:24:48,504
Can you show me the case report?

307
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:56,124
Well, that would be easy.

308
00:24:56,124 --> 00:24:58,184
Follow me.

309
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,064
Twelveth bowl.

310
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:31,254
Must you go through all this to defend that criminal who sells children?

311
00:25:31,254 --> 00:25:34,254
To be in Merchang Jang's good graces?

312
00:25:44,214 --> 00:25:48,824
 The first person to report him was a girl named Oh Wol from Ahneum Village.

313
00:25:48,824 --> 00:25:51,054
 I heard she's a courtesan.

314
00:25:51,714 --> 00:25:52,804
Oh Wol.

315
00:25:52,804 --> 00:25:54,734
Eonni!

316
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:56,184
Eonni, where did you go?

317
00:25:56,184 --> 00:25:57,484
I went to eat.

318
00:25:57,484 --> 00:25:59,224
Did you go to eat?

319
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,524
- Gosh, I was waiting for you, Eonni. 
 - That girl?

320
00:26:03,544 --> 00:26:07,384
 Are you okay? I wish I could have gotten flogged instead!

321
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:10,254
 You're better than Dong Chi.

322
00:26:10,254 --> 00:26:13,694
Kang Han Su, that guy.

323
00:26:27,164 --> 00:26:29,104
Twentieth bowl!

324
00:26:48,614 --> 00:26:55,584
Wow, well... there are twenty bowls in one jar.

325
00:26:55,584 --> 00:27:00,514
If you catch up to me, then let us talk again then.

326
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:03,744
I will be going to the outhouse. Dong Chi!

327
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,640
Search!

328
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:20,784
- Search thoroughly. 
  - Yes, Hyeongnim.

329
00:27:34,324 --> 00:27:35,970
Hyeongnim!

330
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,264
Hyeongnim!

331
00:27:42,844 --> 00:27:45,434
- So Won! 
 - Are they tied?

332
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:48,504
I thought she was the Heavenly Shot Cup.

333
00:27:49,764 --> 00:27:54,314
She goes to heaven whenever she holds a cup. So I gave her that nickname.

334
00:27:57,074 --> 00:27:59,004
Move it.

335
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,040
 Wishes Inn

336
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:14,734
So I told you to learn how to drink from me.

337
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,874
Why are you wasted in the middle of the day?

338
00:28:17,874 --> 00:28:21,080
How humiliating is this?

339
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:24,774
- Stay still. 
 - Hey!

340
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:44,664
 What is it that you do going all around?

341
00:28:44,664 --> 00:28:48,554
 I don't know what you are thinking, but if you do not want to get caught,

342
00:28:48,554 --> 00:28:51,134
 drink only what is in the left jar.

343
00:29:05,694 --> 00:29:08,074
 I told you I do not like to be in debt.

344
00:29:08,074 --> 00:29:10,224
 I believe I said it is not debt but a connection.

345
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:13,354
 So will you help me get that criminal out?

346
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:18,244
 You must have your reason. I told you that I want to trust you this time.

347
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:22,724
So what you said was true.

348
00:29:22,724 --> 00:29:26,354
That maiden must really like you a lot, Hyeongnim.

349
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:28,254
We do not have time. Let us hurry.

350
00:29:28,254 --> 00:29:30,644
Y-Yes.

351
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:41,954
- How about the girl? 
 - The innkeeper will not let her go.

352
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:45,664
- Where is Merchant Jang? 
 - I think he went to the government office.

353
00:29:58,314 --> 00:30:02,524
 I will find out if Kang Han Su has any other motive.

354
00:30:02,524 --> 00:30:04,184
 Please wait for me.

355
00:30:04,184 --> 00:30:07,044
Where did he go? Did he forget?

356
00:30:07,044 --> 00:30:09,464
What is taking him so long?

357
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,930
 Hanyang Prefecture

358
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,654
That is him! I saw him with my own eyes!

359
00:30:23,654 --> 00:30:28,964
I also saw him! He definitely climbed over the wall!

360
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:32,274
So why were you two roaming around in the middle of the night?

361
00:30:32,274 --> 00:30:34,334
W-Well, that is...

362
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:38,634
Are you sure that the person who took the children is Pyo?

363
00:30:38,634 --> 00:30:40,094
I did see him.

364
00:30:40,094 --> 00:30:44,444
It is obvious that you would have been completely drunk after drinking until so late.

365
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:46,244
So how can you be so sure?

366
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,264
Well...

367
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:55,984
Mayor! Based on my knowledge, the average drinking limit of Kim and Choi is one gourd bowl.

368
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:58,074
They get drunk fast with a small amount of alcohol.

369
00:30:58,074 --> 00:31:01,604
If they drank that late after working all day, it means they could not decipher

370
00:31:01,604 --> 00:31:04,834
up, down, left, and right, nor recognize who their ancestors were!

371
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:08,874
Therefore, for their testimonies to carry any weight, on the night of the incident,

372
00:31:08,874 --> 00:31:10,794
they must prove that they may have drunk but were clear-headed

373
00:31:10,794 --> 00:31:13,854
and had good vision and judgment to recognize a person at night,

374
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:18,044
especially that they had such an alcohol tolerance.

375
00:31:19,214 --> 00:31:25,634
Even so, that would not prove that Pyo was innocent.

376
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,364
I will summon a witness.

377
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:30,494
- A witness? 
 - Yes.

378
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:33,644
There is another person who saw Pyo that night.

379
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:36,814
He was with another person at another location.

380
00:31:36,814 --> 00:31:38,614
You!

381
00:31:40,224 --> 00:31:46,274
I mean, you could have bribed this witness and summoned him.

382
00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:51,344
You will know when you see him, but he is not someone I can bribe.

383
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:55,984
Let him come in.

384
00:31:55,984 --> 00:31:58,074
Let him in!

385
00:32:03,534 --> 00:32:05,404
He's coming. Who is he?

386
00:32:05,404 --> 00:32:07,954
Oh, Merchant Jang!

387
00:32:07,954 --> 00:32:10,074
Is that not Merchant Jang?

388
00:32:10,074 --> 00:32:13,394
I mean, how could it be.

389
00:32:17,214 --> 00:32:22,544
I am Head Merchant Jang, who runs a business.

390
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:25,054
So...

391
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:31,984
is it true that you were with that Pyo that night?

392
00:32:33,854 --> 00:32:36,594
That is correct, Mayor.

393
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:42,784
That night, where were you, and what were you doing with the head merchant?

394
00:32:42,784 --> 00:32:48,104
If both of your testimonies match, I will accept the testimony that you two were together.

395
00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:51,254
I do not know this man!

396
00:32:51,254 --> 00:32:52,974
What?

397
00:32:53,684 --> 00:32:55,404
I do not know this man!

398
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:59,564
That night, I was sleeping in a lookout shed by myself.

399
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:04,794
Witness, are you sure you were with Pyo that night?

400
00:33:06,524 --> 00:33:08,074
Well...

401
00:33:10,374 --> 00:33:11,774
Y-Yes...

402
00:33:11,774 --> 00:33:16,034
But Pyo was alone.

403
00:33:16,034 --> 00:33:17,850
That's right!

404
00:33:18,574 --> 00:33:22,704
Pyo, Merchant Jang is trying to help you.

405
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:25,484
Think carefully.

406
00:33:26,644 --> 00:33:29,064
This man is the culprit!

407
00:33:29,064 --> 00:33:33,554
The man who knows that I am not the culprit must be the true culprit!

408
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:36,984
But as to the reason this man is trying to help me,

409
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:41,294
I am clueless myself!

410
00:33:44,094 --> 00:33:46,624
How could this be?

411
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:55,034
True culprit? A culprit? Why would I?

412
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:57,294
This is absolutely absurd, Mayor!

413
00:33:57,294 --> 00:34:01,644
I have nothing to do with the kidnapping of children.

414
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:04,224
Well, well.

415
00:34:04,224 --> 00:34:07,174
Then why did you testify that you were with Pyo?

416
00:34:07,174 --> 00:34:09,694
T-That is because...

417
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:13,914
Oh! He told me to do so!

418
00:34:13,914 --> 00:34:16,234
He said he would get me a painting!

419
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:18,074
A painting?

420
00:34:18,074 --> 00:34:21,094
Did you commit perjury over a painting?

421
00:34:26,894 --> 00:34:31,294
He could be the culprit.

422
00:34:32,984 --> 00:34:37,294
I was with Innkeeper Jo that night.

423
00:34:37,294 --> 00:34:40,004
You cannot believe a man who committed perjury once already.

424
00:34:40,004 --> 00:34:44,174
I committed perjury because that man deceived me. This is unfair, Mayor!

425
00:34:44,174 --> 00:34:49,074
Innkeeper Jo is here, and he will prove my whereabouts.

426
00:34:49,074 --> 00:34:52,634
You cannot trust Innkeeper Jo's testimony. These two have a mutually beneficial relationship–

427
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:56,904
That says we spend a lot of time together.

428
00:34:56,904 --> 00:35:00,474
No one knows my whereabouts better than Innkeeper Jo.

429
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:03,504
On top of that, we did not have time to sync our stories.

430
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:06,344
Please make a good decision, Mayor.

431
00:35:06,344 --> 00:35:08,994
However, Mayor.

432
00:35:08,994 --> 00:35:11,884
Innkeeper Jo, step forward!

433
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:20,244
I am Innkeeper Jo working for Merchant Jang.

434
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:22,074
Yes.

435
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:26,644
Is it true that you were with the head merchant that night?

436
00:35:26,644 --> 00:35:28,684
That is correct.

437
00:35:31,274 --> 00:35:32,854
Attorney Kang is correct.

438
00:35:32,854 --> 00:35:38,024
The culprit of this case is Merchant Jang.

439
00:35:40,274 --> 00:35:44,224
What? What did you just say, you bastard?

440
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:48,844
- How could it be? 
 - That wretched man!

441
00:35:52,254 --> 00:35:56,224
I also just found out while inspecting the boats belonging to the merchant.

442
00:35:56,224 --> 00:35:58,294
Inside our boat

443
00:35:58,294 --> 00:36:02,764
there were more than ten nameless children trapped.

444
00:36:05,684 --> 00:36:08,844
Anyhow, Innkeeper, I cannot believe you would even do a background check on me.

445
00:36:08,844 --> 00:36:12,074
How could you be so distrustful?

446
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:20,024
I guess it means you are that much more ambitious.

447
00:36:20,024 --> 00:36:22,454
Who the hell are you?

448
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:29,064
By chance, do you know the easiest way to destroy a man?

449
00:36:48,594 --> 00:36:52,274
 Frame him.

450
00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:56,654
 Will you go down with Merchant Jang or ,

451
00:36:56,654 --> 00:37:01,264
 will you become the new owner of Jang's Mercantile?

452
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:06,544
Huh? What is this?

453
00:37:06,544 --> 00:37:10,554
They are children who were rescued from boats owned by Merchant Jang.

454
00:37:10,554 --> 00:37:12,434
All right.

455
00:37:15,564 --> 00:37:19,014
You jerk! You set me up because you are going after my position!

456
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:23,604
You two plotted together and are entrapping me!

457
00:37:23,604 --> 00:37:26,044
Mayor, I am an attorney.

458
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:30,634
I help people who face injustice. I do not slander someone for no reason!

459
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:33,334
Please understand my heart for defying the master

460
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:39,024
I have served and told the truth courageously!

461
00:37:40,414 --> 00:37:44,224
Mayor, Innkeeper Jo is telling a lie right now!

462
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:46,014
This is unfair, Mayor!

463
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:49,494
That night, where were you, and what were you doing with the head merchant?

464
00:37:49,494 --> 00:37:54,444
You can prove your innocence only if you bring in another witness or show other circumstantial evidence!

465
00:37:54,444 --> 00:37:56,834
That is right! Yes.

466
00:37:56,834 --> 00:38:02,274
What, where, with whom, and why did you do what you did that night...

467
00:38:02,274 --> 00:38:04,554
Tell us in detail.

468
00:38:04,554 --> 00:38:07,044
O-Of course!

469
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:09,114
That night, I was...

470
00:38:11,534 --> 00:38:14,134
 Chief Advisor, how is it?

471
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:18,984
 It is a drug that a black-market trafficker had brought in, especially from the Ming dynasty.

472
00:38:26,444 --> 00:38:28,374
That night, I was...

473
00:38:29,914 --> 00:38:31,734
T-That night...

474
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,674
That night, we were...

475
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:41,664
 Wow, the color of this jade shade is...

476
00:38:48,364 --> 00:38:50,314
That night?

477
00:38:54,604 --> 00:38:56,194
T-That...

478
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:00,804
T-That...

479
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:04,844
Well, I was with an important man...

480
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:11,034
 No, you cannot. You'll be on your way to the afterlife the minute you open your mouth.

481
00:39:11,034 --> 00:39:12,954
W-Well...

482
00:39:13,764 --> 00:39:16,254
I do not remember, Sir.

483
00:39:22,004 --> 00:39:25,094
However, I did not do this!

484
00:39:25,094 --> 00:39:27,754
This is injustice, Mayor Sir!

485
00:39:29,044 --> 00:39:30,734
Fine!

486
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:34,564
When I look at your face carefully,  Merchant Jang,

487
00:39:34,564 --> 00:39:37,444
it looks as though you feel extreme injustice.

488
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:42,994
Then I will reconvene this hearing when you do remember.

489
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:46,784
Until then, you will remain a suspect.

490
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,454
Look here.

491
00:39:48,454 --> 00:39:52,124
For now, put Jang behind bars!

492
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:55,054
Sir! Mayor!

493
00:39:55,054 --> 00:39:58,244
I-I do not r-remember!

494
00:39:58,244 --> 00:40:00,314
I do not remember.

495
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,794
I will get you for this!

496
00:40:02,794 --> 00:40:05,124
You wretched bastards!

497
00:40:15,134 --> 00:40:18,194
I cannot believe you would release me for a painting.

498
00:40:18,194 --> 00:40:22,134
Wow, I can tell at a glance that you two are right in the head.

499
00:40:22,134 --> 00:40:28,724
But how did you know that they would not be able to tell the details of the night?

500
00:40:28,724 --> 00:40:31,934
As for those bastards' every mov—

501
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:38,704
None of your business. Hand over the goods first.

502
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:42,514
I should. I should give it to you.

503
00:40:42,514 --> 00:40:44,034
Here you go.

504
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:48,404
I placed it at the inn, the first one you see once you arrive in Hanyang.

505
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,374
I think it was called Wishes Inn.

506
00:40:51,374 --> 00:40:54,964
Gosh, it was right in front of my eyes.

507
00:40:54,964 --> 00:40:56,334
Let us go.

508
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:59,234
Thank you! Thank you!

509
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:11,980
 Dohwaseo

510
00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:26,294
The minister personally asked me!

511
00:41:26,294 --> 00:41:32,454
So I promised him I would find it and bring it to him before the Ming envoy returned!

512
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:35,314
Yet you still could not find that one thing?

513
00:41:35,314 --> 00:41:37,154
You useless fools.

514
00:41:37,154 --> 00:41:40,944
- My apologies, Chief Advisor! 
 - We will look for it again.

515
00:41:40,944 --> 00:41:43,084
Chief Advisor!

516
00:41:43,914 --> 00:41:46,554
You have a guest. It is urgent.

517
00:41:50,114 --> 00:41:53,324
So what brings you here?

518
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:57,704
Merchant Jang got mixed up in a terrible incident, so I am here in his place.

519
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:05,264
This is the painting you have been looking for.

520
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,854
Wait, how did you find this?

521
00:42:19,854 --> 00:42:21,914
It is a long story, Sir.

522
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,884
Please put out the urgent fire first, Sir.

523
00:42:24,884 --> 00:42:27,694
Oh! I should!

524
00:42:30,054 --> 00:42:32,414
You, come with me!

525
00:42:41,104 --> 00:42:42,974
Chief Advisor.

526
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:44,524
What is this about?

527
00:42:44,524 --> 00:42:47,714
Chief Advisor, you will have to come with us.

528
00:42:47,714 --> 00:42:51,664
Jang, who was arrested for kidnapping children, requested you as a witness.

529
00:42:51,664 --> 00:42:53,454
What did you say?

530
00:42:58,394 --> 00:43:00,244
Your Excellency.

531
00:43:00,974 --> 00:43:03,734
How do you manage your subordinates?

532
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:08,284
I will take care of it immediately so it does not become an issue.

533
00:43:09,704 --> 00:43:11,794
Bring the painting and follow me.

534
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:14,044
Yes, Your Excellency.

535
00:43:24,194 --> 00:43:26,360
That wretch!

536
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:29,534
Just wait and see.

537
00:43:54,074 --> 00:43:57,694
Sir, please save me.

538
00:43:57,694 --> 00:44:00,614
What is it regarding that you have brought me all the way here?

539
00:44:00,614 --> 00:44:02,390
- Open up. 
 - Yes, Sir.

540
00:44:06,574 --> 00:44:08,694
Chief...

541
00:44:08,694 --> 00:44:12,084
You are the one who committed the crime. Why are you clinging to me?

542
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:15,034
Chief Advisor, why do you say that also? I did not do this!

543
00:44:15,034 --> 00:44:17,034
How about all the evidence they collected from your boat?

544
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:19,644
That is all Innkeeper Jo's doing.

545
00:44:19,644 --> 00:44:25,464
He schemed with an attorney named Kang Han Su and fabricated evidence to frame me.

546
00:44:25,464 --> 00:44:30,674
You know better what I was doing and where that night!

547
00:44:31,604 --> 00:44:36,174
Please think carefully about this. There was a similar incident in the past as well.

548
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:40,754
The easiest way to bring down someone is to frame them.

549
00:44:40,754 --> 00:44:45,264
By fabricating an adequate reason and evidence and framing someone to bring them down.

550
00:44:45,264 --> 00:44:47,814
You are the one who said that!

551
00:44:54,144 --> 00:44:57,964
 Arrest all family members and search throughout the house!

552
00:44:57,964 --> 00:44:59,724
 Yes, Sir!

553
00:44:59,724 --> 00:45:03,334
You must be dying to end your life!

554
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,904
How dare you speak of that incident!

555
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:09,034
Because I cannot afford to die!

556
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:13,274
How dare you!

557
00:45:14,764 --> 00:45:18,784
I guess you remembered a way to bring a man down,

558
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:24,484
but you forgot why that legal officer had to be taken out.

559
00:45:24,484 --> 00:45:26,874
Chief Advisor.

560
00:45:26,874 --> 00:45:29,614
Please spare me.

561
00:45:29,614 --> 00:45:35,744
If only you had not mentioned that incident, I would have let you live.

562
00:45:35,744 --> 00:45:37,614
Chief Advisor.

563
00:45:38,914 --> 00:45:40,964
I will as you now.

564
00:45:40,964 --> 00:45:46,944
That man is dead, but why must you live?

565
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,354
Please let me live. Let me live.

566
00:45:49,354 --> 00:45:54,804
You dare envy what you should not envy

567
00:45:56,784 --> 00:46:01,894
and go for something you should not go after. This is the end of such a man!

568
00:46:01,894 --> 00:46:04,854
Back then, and even now!

569
00:46:04,854 --> 00:46:07,294
Do you understand?

570
00:46:19,904 --> 00:46:26,194
If this incident were to leak outside, you two would not be safe.

571
00:46:26,194 --> 00:46:28,824
- Yes, Sir. 
 - Yes...

572
00:46:31,184 --> 00:46:34,384
I will bring the warden in. You guard this place.

573
00:46:34,384 --> 00:46:36,094
Yes.

574
00:46:43,154 --> 00:46:47,044
I finally got to see this painting.

575
00:46:47,044 --> 00:46:49,724
It is truly amazing.

576
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:55,024
I heard that there is nothing you cannot do in Joseon, Minister.

577
00:46:55,024 --> 00:46:58,084
But it is indeed true.

578
00:46:58,964 --> 00:47:03,650
I hope it is a great gift to Prince Lee.

579
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,224
Do not worry.

580
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:12,024
You have no idea how upset Prince Lee was after the painting he treasured was stolen.

581
00:47:12,024 --> 00:47:15,124
When I return this painting to him,

582
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:19,884
he will be elated.

583
00:47:22,144 --> 00:47:23,954
All right.

584
00:47:23,954 --> 00:47:27,054
Cheers.

585
00:47:44,584 --> 00:47:47,424
You should have just died quietly after being framed.

586
00:47:47,424 --> 00:47:51,564
Why did you cause such royal anger by upsetting your superiors?

587
00:47:51,564 --> 00:47:53,734
Kang.

588
00:47:53,734 --> 00:47:55,984
Kang Han Su?

589
00:47:55,984 --> 00:48:00,454
Yes. I am Kang Han Su.

590
00:48:00,454 --> 00:48:03,454
The son of legal officer Kang, the one you killed seven years ago.

591
00:48:03,454 --> 00:48:05,094
Who.

592
00:48:07,014 --> 00:48:09,274
Who are you again?

593
00:48:11,914 --> 00:48:14,384
Do you get it now?

594
00:48:14,384 --> 00:48:17,084
How my father must have felt?

595
00:48:17,084 --> 00:48:21,844
Y-You are that legal officer Kang's son.

596
00:48:21,844 --> 00:48:23,744
The one who was so reckless.

597
00:48:23,744 --> 00:48:25,504
Yes.

598
00:48:27,424 --> 00:48:29,684
So speak.

599
00:48:29,684 --> 00:48:33,824
Why did you kill my father? Who made you do it?

600
00:48:33,824 --> 00:48:37,374
Park Je Su? Chu Yeong Wu?

601
00:48:44,344 --> 00:48:46,924
They are no different from me.

602
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:52,644
We just did what we were told.

603
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:56,394
It was an order from the highest.

604
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:59,744
It was an order we could not disobey.

605
00:48:59,744 --> 00:49:02,444
If you say the highest place?

606
00:49:03,404 --> 00:49:05,444
By chance.

607
00:49:07,374 --> 00:49:09,884
Why would the king want to kill my father?

608
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:15,124
So why did he not just live the way he was born?

609
00:49:15,124 --> 00:49:18,884
Why did he dare try to change things?

610
00:49:19,794 --> 00:49:26,074
He was nothing but a middle-class man who worked under the noble class.

611
00:49:28,534 --> 00:49:33,964
I may have been born a low-class man,

612
00:49:33,964 --> 00:49:37,804
but for selling out your father,

613
00:49:37,804 --> 00:49:41,364
I got to make money to my heart's content, saw the world,

614
00:49:41,364 --> 00:49:44,624
and got a chance to live in luxury.

615
00:49:44,624 --> 00:49:48,734
But you middle-class men, because of your shallow pride,

616
00:49:48,734 --> 00:49:52,304
you cannot sell, cannot farm,

617
00:49:52,304 --> 00:49:56,314
and it is not like you are a noble.

618
00:49:56,314 --> 00:50:01,464
So I guess he must have wanted to change the law to benefit them.

619
00:50:01,464 --> 00:50:03,544
But no way!

620
00:50:04,744 --> 00:50:09,040
Do you think the world is that easy to deal with!

621
00:50:09,804 --> 00:50:14,054
If you want a change, you are bound to be trampled on.

622
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:18,154
Do you understand, kid?

623
00:50:21,674 --> 00:50:24,974
I do not think now is the time for you to laugh like that.

624
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,464
I cannot help but laugh.

625
00:50:28,464 --> 00:50:30,424
Merchant Jang!

626
00:50:30,424 --> 00:50:34,884
As for your foolish father, he hastened his own death.

627
00:50:34,884 --> 00:50:39,564
But I know why I am dying.

628
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,614
So it is not the worst.

629
00:51:31,584 --> 00:51:34,464
Will you still not confess?

630
00:51:42,754 --> 00:51:46,294
- Father!
- Han Su.

631
00:51:46,294 --> 00:51:48,204
Wife!

632
00:51:56,524 --> 00:52:00,064
It is the bundle I handed him

633
00:52:00,064 --> 00:52:04,364
as a bribe to cover up for the lawsuit.

634
00:52:04,364 --> 00:52:08,804
Sir Park, how could you do this?

635
00:52:09,604 --> 00:52:14,004
It also matches what I have been spying on for a long time.

636
00:52:14,004 --> 00:52:17,284
Look, Detective Jang, that is not so.

637
00:52:17,284 --> 00:52:21,824
I did not do that, Sir! The only thing I did wrong was deny him.

638
00:52:21,824 --> 00:52:25,854
The witness and evidence are so clearly present. Will you continue to deny the charges?

639
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:28,714
Magistrate, it is my fault!

640
00:52:28,714 --> 00:52:31,564
I accepted the bundle! My husband...

641
00:52:31,564 --> 00:52:34,104
- Please let my husband live! 
 - No!

642
00:52:34,104 --> 00:52:36,614
No, Magistrate Sir!

643
00:52:37,544 --> 00:52:40,944
My family did nothing wrong!

644
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,100
Then are you saying you admit your crime?

645
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:07,434
I know it. I saw it.

646
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,154
Yes. You are honest since you're a legal officer's son.

647
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:13,814
I clearly saw the face of the  person who left the bundle at my house.

648
00:53:13,814 --> 00:53:18,894
That woman left it on her own. We did not accept it from her.

649
00:53:18,894 --> 00:53:21,504
I know what she looks like. I will go find her.

650
00:53:21,504 --> 00:53:25,064
Just give me one hour. Please, just one hour.

651
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,510
Father!

652
00:53:57,214 --> 00:53:59,384
- Father! 
 - Honey!

653
00:53:59,384 --> 00:54:01,334
Father!

654
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:04,964
Father! Father!

655
00:54:09,444 --> 00:54:11,584
Father!

656
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:13,404
Father.

657
00:54:24,454 --> 00:54:28,094
Father! Father!

658
00:54:28,094 --> 00:54:30,934
Father!

659
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,544
Honey.

660
00:54:36,624 --> 00:54:39,014
Honey!

661
00:54:39,014 --> 00:54:42,574
How can you leave us? What will we do without you?

662
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,030
 In Mourning

663
00:55:05,654 --> 00:55:08,474
Mother!

664
00:55:08,474 --> 00:55:11,234
Mother!

665
00:55:11,234 --> 00:55:14,554
No! No, Mother!

666
00:55:14,554 --> 00:55:17,444
No!

667
00:55:18,934 --> 00:55:21,934
Mother! Mother, don't go!

668
00:55:21,934 --> 00:55:25,524
No! Don't go, Mother!

669
00:55:26,474 --> 00:55:30,104
Mother... Mother...

670
00:55:30,104 --> 00:55:32,654
- Mother! Mother! 
 - It's okay, it's okay.

671
00:55:32,654 --> 00:55:35,534
It's okay. Calm down.

672
00:55:35,534 --> 00:55:38,254
No! No.

673
00:55:38,254 --> 00:55:41,234
It's only a dream. A dream.

674
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:49,290
Hyeongnim.

675
00:56:11,424 --> 00:56:14,304
Are you feeling better?

676
00:56:17,224 --> 00:56:19,774
So what happened?

677
00:56:19,774 --> 00:56:22,924
- You were tied— 
 - No, not that.

678
00:56:22,924 --> 00:56:25,794
- It cost 20 nyang... 
 - Not that!

679
00:56:25,794 --> 00:56:28,904
- For exactly two hours—
 - Gosh, not that!

680
00:56:28,904 --> 00:56:31,584
Kang Han Su! What happened to Kang Han Su?

681
00:56:31,584 --> 00:56:34,874
- Oh, that? 
 - Yes.

682
00:56:47,264 --> 00:56:50,084
You went through a lot to travel a long distance.

683
00:56:50,084 --> 00:56:54,144
I wish you a comfortable journey back.

684
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:57,174
I thank you so much for your kind generosity, Minister.

685
00:56:57,174 --> 00:57:01,514
I have had a good time for a few days.

686
00:57:01,514 --> 00:57:06,004
Minister, I will see you again.

687
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:27,680
 Human Trafficking Criminal

688
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:44,174
- Who are you? 
 - Who are you?

689
00:57:44,174 --> 00:57:47,394
Why are you in my boat?

690
00:57:50,224 --> 00:57:55,334
You must be the crow who stole Prince Lee's painting!

691
00:58:00,354 --> 00:58:03,814
How did I come back to Joseon?

692
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:06,914
I definitely left Joseon two days ago!

693
00:58:06,914 --> 00:58:10,634
Why am I here again? Why Joseon again?

694
00:58:10,634 --> 00:58:15,704
Release me now! Do you know who I am?

695
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:18,714
Release me!

696
00:58:18,714 --> 00:58:21,784
Release me!

697
00:58:27,334 --> 00:58:30,844
Of course. So you did have a plan.

698
00:58:30,844 --> 00:58:33,114
Gosh, you scared me.

699
00:58:33,114 --> 00:58:36,394
If you were going to do this, why did you release him in the first place?

700
00:58:36,394 --> 00:58:42,164
What can I do? I heard the children were trapped somewhere without any water to drink.

701
00:58:44,874 --> 00:58:48,114
- Jin! 
 - Mom!

702
00:58:50,424 --> 00:58:54,244
 We had to find those kids first.

703
00:58:54,244 --> 00:58:58,524
 Saving lives was more important than making that scumbag pay for his crimes.

704
00:58:59,174 --> 00:59:02,504
If you had left it up to the mayor, he would have interrogated the criminal—

705
00:59:02,504 --> 00:59:04,184
Do you think that bastard would have confessed?

706
00:59:04,184 --> 00:59:09,290
As soon as he confessed where the kids are, he would have been admitting to his crime.

707
00:59:10,754 --> 00:59:15,744
I am sure he would not have opened his mouth regardless of whether the kids died or not.

708
00:59:18,204 --> 00:59:22,234
Fine. Let us say that is the case. Then what is the deal you made with Merchant Jang?

709
00:59:22,234 --> 00:59:25,544
Did he make it up at the spur of the moment in order to be released?

710
00:59:25,544 --> 00:59:28,354
But why is Merchant Jang in prison now?

711
00:59:49,134 --> 00:59:53,954
You really like me, don't you?

712
00:59:53,954 --> 00:59:57,154
- Pardon? 
 - So you wish that I were a good man

713
00:59:57,154 --> 01:00:00,014
because you do not wish to be disappointed by me.

714
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:05,674
Do not worry. I do not dislike you.

715
01:00:05,674 --> 01:00:09,014
I mean, you even volunteered to be a hostage, for my sake. 
How can I not fall for you?

716
01:00:09,014 --> 01:00:12,004
I also am a man with a heart.

717
01:00:14,074 --> 01:00:19,084
However! Do not meddle in my business, out of nowhere, from now on.

718
01:00:19,084 --> 01:00:22,194
Even if it is you, I can't let it slide.

719
01:00:25,224 --> 01:00:28,824
I also cannot give you a firm answer.

720
01:00:28,824 --> 01:00:33,034
Since you did not answer my questions, either.

721
01:00:33,034 --> 01:00:34,714
All right, then.

722
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,990
Hey! Be gentle!

723
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:02,540
 Jo's Mercantile

724
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:05,930
Chief Advisor was dismissed from his post.

725
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,484
Someone had to take responsibility for this.

726
01:01:10,484 --> 01:01:13,474
Tell me honestly. Between Chief Advisor Park and Merchant Jang,

727
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:16,354
who did you hold a grudge against?

728
01:01:18,644 --> 01:01:22,224
I am the one others hold a grudge against.

729
01:01:22,224 --> 01:01:24,484
The moment I was kidnapped by Merchant Jang,

730
01:01:24,484 --> 01:01:28,464
I thought, "Wow, I cannot believe I have upset the grand merchant who controls the Hanyang market."

731
01:01:28,464 --> 01:01:32,634
"It looks like I might get kicked out of Hanyang as soon as I arrive. What should I do?"

732
01:01:32,634 --> 01:01:34,344
"Right!"

733
01:01:34,344 --> 01:01:38,544
"If I cannot please him, let me just switch the owner of Jang's mercantile."

734
01:01:38,544 --> 01:01:41,394
That is just what I decided.

735
01:01:45,704 --> 01:01:49,644
But it seems like an ambitious and reckless decision by a mere lawyer.

736
01:01:49,644 --> 01:01:52,914
I actually have a huge dream.

737
01:01:52,914 --> 01:01:57,364
"Kang Han Su," three syllables of my name. I intend to spread it far and wide,

738
01:01:57,364 --> 01:02:01,614
throughout the eight provinces of Joseon, as the best lawyer in the country.

739
01:02:01,614 --> 01:02:07,334
Then if I try to meddle in your future, will you also try to switch me out?

740
01:02:09,134 --> 01:02:13,254
You are also part of my big picture, Innkeeper.

741
01:02:13,254 --> 01:02:18,314
Next to the best mercantile in Joseon, there should be the best lawyer in Joseon.

742
01:02:20,664 --> 01:02:22,234
Is that so?

743
01:02:25,744 --> 01:02:31,294
Then this money will be a contractual amount for the future we will have together.

744
01:02:31,294 --> 01:02:34,464
Yes. I put more than what was promised.

745
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:44,124
As expected, you are different from Merchant Jang!

746
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:47,794
Of course! I knew I was good at spotting people!

747
01:02:55,644 --> 01:02:58,330
Kang Han Su.

748
01:02:59,084 --> 01:03:01,184
He's no ordinary guy.

749
01:03:01,184 --> 01:03:07,834
Not only does he toy with a person's heart, he even controls a man's lifeline.

750
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:09,524
He knows how to dance with a sword.

751
01:03:09,524 --> 01:03:14,544
Would you like me to investigate and find out where he has been?

752
01:03:14,544 --> 01:03:17,374
Move secretively, but dig in real good.

753
01:03:17,374 --> 01:03:20,560
Either I bring him to my side, or if that is not possible,

754
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,760
I must break him from the start.

755
01:03:35,464 --> 01:03:40,144
Gosh, I should have bought a bigger one. That is too bad.

756
01:03:47,254 --> 01:03:49,784
What did I tell you?

757
01:03:52,614 --> 01:03:55,674
I told you it was about money!

758
01:03:57,054 --> 01:03:59,390
On the outside, he pretended to help Merchant Jang.

759
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:02,900
But in the end, he benefited Innkeeper Jo.

760
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:10,814
Look. Even the sign changed from "Jang's Mercantile" to "Jo's Mercantile."

761
01:04:10,814 --> 01:04:16,634
The owner of the biggest mercantile controlling the city market has been changed.

762
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:23,390
 Jo's Mercantile

763
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:31,790
 Wife Sun Heung Ang Memorial Tablet

764
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:33,760
 Husband Teacher Kang Eon Jik Memorial Tablet

765
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,464
Woman who carries bundles

766
01:05:29,534 --> 01:05:32,334
You are next.

767
01:06:18,264 --> 01:06:20,424
Father, you are home from the palace.

768
01:06:20,424 --> 01:06:24,574
Yes. I heard you struggled a lot while undercover.

769
01:06:24,574 --> 01:06:27,064
Did you have a chance to rest?

770
01:06:27,064 --> 01:06:30,424
I was not too exhausted, so I was all right.

771
01:06:30,424 --> 01:06:34,804
Good. You will get busy soon.

772
01:06:43,024 --> 01:06:45,004
He is still very busy.

773
01:06:45,004 --> 01:06:49,394
Yes. He works night and day for the nation.

774
01:06:49,394 --> 01:06:51,834
He is truly a patriot.

775
01:06:52,834 --> 01:06:54,894
A patriot.

776
01:06:57,194 --> 01:07:00,444
 Chief Advisor Park cut out Merchant Jang?

777
01:07:00,444 --> 01:07:04,474
Yes. He was not useful any longer and was loose with this tongue.

778
01:07:04,474 --> 01:07:06,414
He said he could not let him live.

779
01:07:06,414 --> 01:07:09,814
So is Park Je Su trustworthy?

780
01:07:09,814 --> 01:07:11,134
Pardon?

781
01:07:11,134 --> 01:07:16,874
I am asking if it is all right to leave him in charge of our Hoongu* Party's finances. 
  (A group of high-ranking officials in power.)

782
01:07:16,874 --> 01:07:21,274
Well, there is no one who can take his place for now.

783
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:29,844
 It does not matter if one or two people die during a dispute.

784
01:07:29,844 --> 01:07:35,884
However, for one of us to lose in such a private litigation

785
01:07:35,884 --> 01:07:38,134
is extremely disappointing.

786
01:07:38,134 --> 01:07:40,214
W-Well, as for that,

787
01:07:40,214 --> 01:07:44,194
I heard the lawyer for the other party was extremely savvy.

788
01:07:44,194 --> 01:07:47,484
Bringing up Daejeon put together by late kings and whatnot,

789
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:51,554
he was outstanding in pressuring the judging official.

790
01:07:51,554 --> 01:07:53,424
Daejeon.

791
01:07:55,634 --> 01:07:57,904
Daejeon, you say?

792
01:08:02,824 --> 01:08:09,744
Now that I think about it, it has been a while since I heard about Princess Yeon Ju.

793
01:08:10,634 --> 01:08:12,734
I will look into it!

794
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:22,220
 Wishes Inn

795
01:08:28,744 --> 01:08:32,404
She must have come to her senses after going through all that.

796
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:44,050
  Wishes Inn

797
01:09:12,934 --> 01:09:15,394
Attorney!

798
01:09:18,834 --> 01:09:20,244
How do I look?

799
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:23,504
Do you not feel a different resolve starting with my outfit?

800
01:09:23,504 --> 01:09:24,884
What?

801
01:09:24,884 --> 01:09:28,254
I will start working under you starting today.

802
01:09:28,254 --> 01:09:29,454
What?

803
01:09:29,454 --> 01:09:32,874
Please use me as an assistant to outsource our workers.

804
01:09:32,874 --> 01:09:37,584
I will become your personal servant lady.

805
01:09:47,514 --> 01:09:50,084
Your Majesty. 
  Two hours ago

806
01:09:50,994 --> 01:09:55,244
I wish to train Kang Han Su as my servant.

807
01:09:55,244 --> 01:09:57,774
So Your Majesty.

808
01:09:57,774 --> 01:10:00,414
