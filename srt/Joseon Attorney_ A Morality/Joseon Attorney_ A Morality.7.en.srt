(Characters, incidents, and period depicted are purely fictional.)

2
00:00:06,678 --> 00:00:07,817
Eun Soo?

3
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:15,288
Eun Soo.

4
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:20,828
Eun Soo.

5
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:23,827
I promised...

6
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:27,698
on the day of your wedding...

7
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:30,567
that I would...

8
00:00:31,478 --> 00:00:34,077
take good care of our parents for you.

9
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:37,507
But what do I do?

10
00:00:38,518 --> 00:00:40,817
They both passed away.

11
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,158
So wrongfully...

12
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:49,927
Do not cry, my lord.

13
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:55,597
I could not even ask for their forgiveness.

14
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:01,637
Me neither.

15
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,208
I also could not tell my father...

16
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:10,107
that I was sorry.

17
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:13,017
No, far from an apology.

18
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:16,747
I may have even contributed to my father's death.

19
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:20,618
But I still lived on.

20
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,088
That is why I thought...

21
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:25,258
perhaps my father...

22
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:31,068
had already forgiven me.

23
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:35,937
I am sure that is the case for your mother.

24
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:39,937
She would have forgiven you already,

25
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:43,648
then stayed by your side to give her support.

26
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:46,478
If not,

27
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:50,788
you could not have grown up into such a fine man.

28
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,007
Then, who was the one...

29
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:13,477
that took the letter at the time?

30
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:19,477
Tell me! Who was it?

31
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:23,118
The Princess.

32
00:02:25,988 --> 00:02:27,287
The Princess.

33
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:33,858
It was...

34
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:38,467
the Princess.

35
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:50,947
- My lord. - I must meet...

36
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:54,717
the Princess.

37
00:03:04,657 --> 00:03:05,757
Princess?

38
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:16,138
Pardon me!

39
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:18,536
My lord! Oh, no.

40
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:20,577
Please bring him here. Yoon!

41
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:22,877
Please put him down in there. My goodness.

42
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:24,078
Good grief.

43
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:28,048
Goodness, I am so sorry.

44
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:30,647
Princess.

45
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:33,987
Good grief. You.

46
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:36,558
What have you done, you rascal?

47
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:40,398
He should be all right.

48
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:42,298
Please leave. Yes.

49
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:43,727
Wait.

50
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:45,937
- Darn it, stay quiet. - No, wait.

51
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:49,138
- Please leave. - No. Oh, gosh.

52
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,407
Your Royal Highness.

53
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,987
Thank you for helping...

54
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:10,427
with our recent lawsuit and tonight.

55
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:11,957
However,

56
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,128
when I said we should remain as strangers,

57
00:04:14,398 --> 00:04:17,427
it included these encounters and assistance.

58
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:20,068
Were you afraid I would notice?

59
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:21,867
What do you mean?

60
00:04:22,938 --> 00:04:25,008
What you are about to do,

61
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:27,438
this revenge.

62
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:31,078
You must know Kang Han Soo is the son of Officer Kang.

63
00:04:31,677 --> 00:04:33,176
His father, Officer Kang,

64
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:36,487
passed away in wrongful death as he worked with the late King,

65
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:38,557
and you wish to repay that debt instead.

66
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:46,797
I would not have known if I had not seen you two...

67
00:04:47,797 --> 00:04:49,128
at Officer Kang's home.

68
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:51,737
How did you know it was...

69
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,138
Officer Kang's home?

70
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:55,967
A few years ago,

71
00:04:56,807 --> 00:04:58,537
after the late King passed,

72
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:01,947
a royal physician who deserved to be exiled got promoted instead,

73
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:03,847
then came to see my father.

74
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:06,318
I began to investigate the details of the incident,

75
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:09,648
which led me to find out everything that happened to Officer Kang.

76
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:15,758
You must stop.

77
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:17,486
If you stand up against my father,

78
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:19,897
it means you also stand up against all of Joseon.

79
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:21,097
You cannot be this reckless.

80
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:22,528
There must be a misunderstanding.

81
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:26,737
I simply think highly of the talent Kang Han Soo has as an attorney...

82
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:29,967
and wish to help the people with him.

83
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:33,977
Excuse me.

84
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:35,677
Your Royal Highness.

85
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:47,856
If there is...

86
00:05:47,857 --> 00:05:49,426
a conflict of interest between strengthening my authority...

87
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:50,987
and the welfare of my people,

88
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:53,128
what must I prioritize?

89
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:55,366
When there is stability in public welfare,

90
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,427
your royal authority will automatically become more powerful.

91
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,166
There will not be any need to try harder.

92
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,607
The people will consider the King equal to their parents,

93
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:05,938
trusting, following, and depending on him.

94
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:11,518
I asked you a foolish question.

95
00:06:13,378 --> 00:06:14,518
In that case,

96
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:16,587
there are too many laws made...

97
00:06:16,588 --> 00:06:18,657
only to preserve the rights of the officials.

98
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:21,958
Will you find a solution with this problem?

99
00:06:22,828 --> 00:06:24,628
Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.

100
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:53,258
They both passed away.

101
00:06:54,557 --> 00:06:57,328
So wrongfully...

102
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:01,797
and miserably.

103
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:16,508
I am sorry, Kang Han Soo.

104
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:19,177
It is all my fault.

105
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:26,557
Give it to me. I will deliver that today.

How can you say that?

108
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:24,007
Father!

109
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:25,218
Father!

110
00:08:28,518 --> 00:08:32,057
The King is dead!

111
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:34,017

- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

00:08:44,368 --> 00:08:52,008
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

Han Soo!

119
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:43,587
- Big brother. - Han Soo.

120
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:48,098
- Big brother. - Hey, Han Soo.

121
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,998
I'm right here, Han Soo.

122
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,498
Big brother.

123
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:54,968
Han Soo.

124
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:57,238
It's all right.

(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

127
00:10:33,337 --> 00:10:35,077
Oh, my head.

128
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:44,488
I somehow arrived at the tavern... No way!

129
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:49,157
Why did you come back, Eun Soo? You fool.

130
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:51,286
Hi, Han Soo.

131
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:52,556
Eun Soo!

132
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:55,268
Run!

133
00:10:55,398 --> 00:10:58,098
Dong Chi, wake up.

134
00:10:58,167 --> 00:10:59,196
What?

135
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:03,207
What are all these memories flashing before my eyes?

136
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,567
It must have been a dream, right?

137
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:08,037
Too many things have happened, and I'm not sure where to begin.

138
00:11:09,177 --> 00:11:11,977
In front of my house, I hugged you...

139
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:14,748
and did this. Start from there.

140
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:19,557
Every time you drink,

141
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:22,427
you can't tell where the sky is...

142
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:25,898
I mean, you cannot tell who is who.

143
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:29,497
You just hug anybody and go, "Eun Soo."

144
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:32,468
"Dong Chi. Mother. Father!"

145
00:11:34,738 --> 00:11:37,368
It was not you? Then...

146
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:39,077
Who do you think it was?

147
00:11:40,238 --> 00:11:41,608
Who was it?

148
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:43,848
Eun Soo.

149
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:47,878
I am sorry, Eun Soo.

150
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,417
What are you doing?

151
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:56,057
Get dressed. We should go to Hanyang.

152
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:57,786
The sun is not even up yet.

153
00:11:57,787 --> 00:11:58,998
Well, the cock crowed.

154
00:11:59,957 --> 00:12:03,498
What is the point? You will see her again in Hanyang.

155
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:05,498
It will be less shameful then.

156
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:06,937
They say, "Time heals all wounds." Do you not know?

157
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,707
But Magistrate Yoo will be in Hanyang.

158
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:12,807
What about Magistrate Yoo?

159
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:15,907
You do not remember?

160
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:20,278
"Run!"

161
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:26,057
Go!

162
00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:28,687
Toward the Princess!

163

It must have dawned on you.

164
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:51,447
This is a natural disaster.

165
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:53,816
I, Kang Han Soo, would never do such a thing.

166

No. Never.

No one will know.

00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:56,478
Dong Chi.

176
00:14:43,988 --> 00:14:46,827
My lord. It is me.

177
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:11,388
Do not cry.

178
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:15,358
I am sure that is the case for your mother.

179
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:19,498
She would have forgiven you already,

180
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:25,067
then stayed by your side to give her support.

181
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:28,037
If not,

182
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:32,638
you could not have grown up into such a fine man.

183
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:47,718
Yes, I can do this.

184
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:49,927
I have got this.

185
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:51,787
I can do it.

186
00:16:16,248 --> 00:16:18,148
I did it. Great.

187
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:20,317
Good.

188
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:41,837
That looks like someone...

189
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:48,148
who glows.

190
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:45,897
So Won.

191
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:48,367
Thank you.

192
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:53,208
Come.

193
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:57,147
Why are you leaving so early in the morning?

194
00:18:57,948 --> 00:19:01,448
We urgently need to meet someone in Hanyang.

195
00:19:02,317 --> 00:19:04,347
Who would that be?

196
00:19:05,587 --> 00:19:06,718
Who do you think it is?

197
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:09,827
Our source of income.

198
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:15,698
- Come. - Let us go.

199
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:31,647
If you hear the truth,

200
00:19:33,978 --> 00:19:35,988
will you be able to forgive me?

201
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:38,688
Hey.

202
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:41,617
It may be out of embarrassment for me,

203
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:43,287
but why is she avoiding me?

204
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:47,797
Because she would laugh when she sees you?

205
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:51,127
Let me think. Or maybe...

206
00:19:52,268 --> 00:19:55,137
she got scolded by Magistrate Yoo.

207
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,408
- I see. - Or...

208
00:19:59,037 --> 00:20:00,238
Hey.

209
00:20:00,577 --> 00:20:03,107
I appreciate what you did for me yesterday.

210
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:06,948
I do not remember much, but I feel like I owe you big.

211
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:08,077
Thanks.

212
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:11,418
No, not really.

213
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:15,287
By any chance,

214
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,428
did Magistrate Yoo scold you?

215
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:22,096
No, not really.

216
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,268
That is a relief.

217
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:26,197
But then,

218
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:28,367
why were you with him at that time?

219
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:30,468
Pardon?

220
00:20:31,468 --> 00:20:33,978
Do not tell me...

221
00:20:36,377 --> 00:20:38,807
You have not been won over, have you?

222
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:41,647
They say women are fickle.

223
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:44,146
That is nonsense.

224
00:20:44,147 --> 00:20:45,657
It was just a coincidence.

225
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:47,386
Right, it had to be.

226
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:49,587
I mean, he is not a catch at all.

227
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:51,086
His family...

228
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:52,897
is reputable.

229
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:54,396
His fortune...

230
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:55,968
is probably more than a lot.

231
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:57,796
Still, his personality...

232
00:20:57,797 --> 00:21:00,267
does not seem so bad either.

233
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:01,738
Seriously.

234
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:02,908
Right.

235
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:05,408
His looks.

236
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:08,938
At least, I look more handsome.

237
00:21:17,117 --> 00:21:21,457
I guarantee he must be arranged to marry a noble young lady.

238
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,227
Noble people and commoners are strictly separated in this society.

239
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:25,698
He is way out of your league, so give up.

240
00:21:31,228 --> 00:21:33,297
Why did she even give me butterflies then?

241
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:35,738
- What was that? - No, nothing.

242
00:21:37,238 --> 00:21:38,408
It is nothing.

243
00:21:58,627 --> 00:22:00,198
I guess today is the day for something.

244
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:03,168
It seems so.

245
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:06,498
It is my birthday.

246
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:10,767
Yes, right.

247
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:11,937
It is the Ghost Day.

248
00:22:11,938 --> 00:22:13,636
The birthday of every labourer.

249
00:22:13,637 --> 00:22:14,707
(The day of rest after weeding, 1 of the 24 seasonal divisions)

250
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,178
The day when servants dress up with new clothes...

251
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:19,847
- and enjoy partying all day long? - Right.

252
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:22,617
No, really. It is also my birthday.

253
00:22:24,988 --> 00:22:27,387
Well, then. Would you like a birthday gift or something?

254
00:22:33,698 --> 00:22:35,626
- Let us enjoy the festival too. - That is...

255
00:22:35,627 --> 00:22:36,768
No.

256
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:41,867
Just for this day. I am not prepared, so please.

257
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:44,107
- What... - Prepared for what?

258
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:50,647
Well, the thing is...

259
00:22:56,248 --> 00:22:59,617
Once we go to Hanyang, we have to work hard again.

260
00:23:01,758 --> 00:23:04,258
So please. I want it as my birthday gift.

261
00:23:04,357 --> 00:23:05,658
It is free anyway.

262
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:18,107
I doubt the Princess will run away overnight.

263
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:27,178
Time means money to me now.

264
00:23:29,047 --> 00:23:30,847
But I will spend that money...

265
00:23:31,047 --> 00:23:32,248
for you.

266
00:23:33,817 --> 00:23:35,018
Sweet!

267
00:23:41,758 --> 00:23:42,927
Han Soo.

268
00:23:42,928 --> 00:23:44,168
Have you lost your senses?

269
00:23:44,728 --> 00:23:46,366
Let us not bother.

270
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,836
It is Ghost Day and So Won's birthday.

271
00:23:48,837 --> 00:23:50,037
We will have fun just for today.

272
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:54,137
I would love to.

273
00:23:54,678 --> 00:23:56,106
Do not change your mind later.

274
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:57,448
- I will not. - All right?

275
00:24:13,297 --> 00:24:14,857
It will not take long.

276
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:18,698
Give me just one more day to think.

277
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:22,807
Let me be So Won just for another day.

278
00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:26,278
I am sorry.

279
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:29,408
I am sorry, Han Soo.

280
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:42,418
- What are you doing? - Let us go.

281
00:24:43,087 --> 00:24:44,258
- Stop! - Move!

282
00:24:48,758 --> 00:24:55,367
(Subak Championships in Jongyuhyun Village, Ansung)

283
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:12,087
Gosh, they have crazy prizes.

284
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:19,027
(First place: Cow)

285
00:25:19,028 --> 00:25:20,797
(Second place: A seom of rice)

286
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:24,468
Who else want to challenge him?

287
00:25:24,627 --> 00:25:25,866
Me!

288
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:27,698
Goodness. Never mind!

289
00:25:28,397 --> 00:25:30,637
You cannot be a match. Hey.

290
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:32,336
- Are you good at subak? - You cannot do it.

291
00:25:32,337 --> 00:25:34,107
- I am pretty good. - Are you doing it for real?

292
00:25:34,877 --> 00:25:36,178
Just wait.

293
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:37,377
Goodness.

294
00:25:50,387 --> 00:25:51,857
Ready, go.

295
00:26:04,337 --> 00:26:06,238
Gosh, he got lucky.

296
00:26:06,837 --> 00:26:08,208
He is good.

297
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:11,908
All right.

298
00:26:23,688 --> 00:26:26,357
He will not be able to win unless he plays dirty.

299
00:26:26,797 --> 00:26:27,897
I bet one nyang on his defeat.

300
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:31,268
Deal. I bet five pun more.

301
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,268
Deal.

302
00:26:35,037 --> 00:26:36,238
I bet two nyang.

303
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:39,438
Ready, go.

304
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:08,737
Go, Han Soo!

305
00:27:08,738 --> 00:27:09,866
You can do it!

306
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:12,037
- Go for it. - You can do it!

307
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,537
- Kang Han Soo! - Go!

308
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:50,708
Did you see that?

309
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:52,147
Did you see it?

310
00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:55,978
Give a hand to today's winner!

311
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:09,528
(Cow, A seom of rice, Floral shoes)

312
00:28:09,728 --> 00:28:11,468
He nailed it.

313
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:13,867
- What will he choose? - A cow.

314
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:17,208
- Choose a cow. - A cow.

315
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:19,508
- A cow. - A cow.

316
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:21,077
- A cow. - A cow.

317
00:28:21,178 --> 00:28:23,178
- A cow. - A cow.

318
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:33,158
A pair of floral shoes, really?

319
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:35,987
Attorney Kang.

320
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:38,487
Are you out of your mind? How could you...

321
00:28:38,488 --> 00:28:40,096
You can farm a year with a cow.

322
00:28:40,097 --> 00:28:42,896
And you can feed four people with a seom of rice.

323
00:28:42,897 --> 00:28:44,998
So those are for people who actually need them.

324
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:46,498
Pardon?

325
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:51,607
Here.

326
00:28:51,768 --> 00:28:52,938
My birthday gift for you.

327
00:29:02,147 --> 00:29:03,386
These shoes...

328
00:29:03,387 --> 00:29:05,117
will take you anywhere you want...

329
00:29:06,218 --> 00:29:07,688
and help you go over any kinds of humps.

330
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:09,627
They will take you...

331
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:13,557
to a better and a more precious place.

332
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:18,297
Come on.

333
00:29:19,097 --> 00:29:21,968
Did you go out of your way to win for those?

334
00:29:22,198 --> 00:29:23,768
You could have just come in third place.

335
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:26,577
Losing does not suit me.

336
00:29:30,508 --> 00:29:32,178
"Losing does not suit me."

337
00:30:40,478 --> 00:30:41,918
Is that really all you know?

338
00:30:43,448 --> 00:30:44,488
- Yes. - Yes.

339
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,587
It is best to answer me when I am the one asking.

340
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:50,057
When my master comes,

341
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:52,158
who knows how you will end up?

342
00:30:59,837 --> 00:31:00,998
Did you find something out?

343
00:31:01,837 --> 00:31:03,238
Those wenches are stubborn.

344
00:31:12,408 --> 00:31:14,018
What is it that you want to know?

345
00:31:14,718 --> 00:31:16,647
Tell us, and we will tell you.

346
00:31:17,488 --> 00:31:18,587
Where are the ledgers?

347
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:29,397
These are the ledgers Kang Han Soo stole and kept in the gisaeng house.

348
00:31:32,998 --> 00:31:35,597
A total of six. Yes, they are the ones.

349
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:39,238
What about what I asked you?

350
00:31:40,837 --> 00:31:43,876
Those girls did not know much about Kang Han Soo, either.

351
00:31:43,877 --> 00:31:46,778
He only threw jokes and barely spoke of himself.

352
00:31:47,377 --> 00:31:50,587
All they heard was that after his parents died, he made a living...

353
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:54,018
roaming around markets in the country with a guy named Dong Chi.

354
00:31:54,488 --> 00:31:56,988
Oh, right. His hometown is Cheongsan.

355
00:31:58,087 --> 00:31:59,127
"Cheongsan?"

356
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:02,658
Yes. That must be why he had recently gone to Cheongsan.

357
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:07,337
- Are you sure it is Cheongsan? - Yes.

358
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:11,067
Were you not the former governor in Cheongsan, my lord?

359
00:32:14,438 --> 00:32:16,076
(7 years ago in Cheongsan)

360
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:17,208
My lord.

361
00:32:18,347 --> 00:32:22,918
What brings you all the way to this countryside?

362
00:32:24,587 --> 00:32:27,057
There is one thing you must do for me.

363
00:32:28,718 --> 00:32:32,958
Do it for me, and there will not be a dismissal...

364
00:32:33,228 --> 00:32:36,698
but a promotion in your next month's personnel transfer document.

365
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:48,637
Good grief. Luck is not on my side at all.

366
00:33:09,057 --> 00:33:10,896
I heard you were close...

367
00:33:10,897 --> 00:33:13,738
with Commissioner Park and Master Jang since back then.

368
00:33:14,537 --> 00:33:18,137
Close, my foot. We were simply after our own benefits.

369
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:20,177
I had to get help from whomever I could...

370
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:21,938
to get out of that boonies.

371
00:33:26,847 --> 00:33:27,847
Do not tell me...

372
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:30,047
Officer Kang?

373
00:33:49,468 --> 00:33:50,537
It is him!

374
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:59,877
I have never seen a tavern owner leave to enjoy the festival day.

375
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:04,288
To offer a room but have the guest make dinner themself?

376
00:34:05,247 --> 00:34:07,917
The owner should also get some rest and perform ancestral rites.

377
00:34:16,528 --> 00:34:17,897
Oh, no.

378
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:20,538
I will do it.

379
00:34:23,238 --> 00:34:26,138
You must be tired, Lady Hong, no?

380
00:34:37,147 --> 00:34:38,247
How dare you?

381
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:49,428
The flour cake depends on you, Han Soo.

382
00:34:51,127 --> 00:34:52,368
I will just starve tonight.

383
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:55,296
- I will do it. - No, I will.

384
00:34:55,297 --> 00:34:57,437
- I will do it. Give it to me. - No, I will.

385
00:35:05,508 --> 00:35:06,547
Goodness.

386
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:12,687
Oh, gosh. What happened?

387
00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:13,988
They messed it up.

388
00:35:15,087 --> 00:35:17,587
The flour cake turned into nothing.

389
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:25,297
Lady Hong.

390
00:35:25,828 --> 00:35:27,968
Train So Won again.

391
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:33,278
It tickles.

392
00:35:45,788 --> 00:35:47,158
What is so funny?

393
00:35:48,218 --> 00:35:49,317
Myself.

394
00:35:51,258 --> 00:35:54,227
I am not the type to procrastinate and goof around.

395
00:35:55,058 --> 00:35:56,258
Likewise.

396
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:59,198
But I have changed after meeting you.

397
00:36:01,437 --> 00:36:02,767
Actually,

398
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:05,767
I almost drowned to death when I was a kid.

399
00:36:06,638 --> 00:36:10,348
Since then, water has frightened me. So I kept away from it.

400
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:12,877
But yesterday, I even bathed in the stream water.

401
00:36:15,618 --> 00:36:16,887
I got better since the moment...

402
00:36:16,888 --> 00:36:19,288
you jumped into the Han River to save me.

403
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:24,626
Take the newlywed bride's case as an example.

404
00:36:24,627 --> 00:36:26,897
My usual self would not have made such a decision.

405
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:30,528
And today as well.

406
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:34,897
But it felt better than I thought.

407
00:36:35,897 --> 00:36:37,038
No, it was great.

408
00:36:38,837 --> 00:36:41,977
To the point I want the rest of my life to be like today.

409
00:36:43,877 --> 00:36:44,948
Was there a time...

410
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:47,877
you did not want to live?

411
00:36:48,578 --> 00:36:50,817
At least, living was not my purpose in life.

412
00:36:58,457 --> 00:36:59,888
Do not look so sad.

413
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:02,758
I did not say that to bring the mood down.

414
00:37:04,368 --> 00:37:07,337
I simply wanted to give an honest response to your comfort.

415
00:37:08,738 --> 00:37:09,797
"Comfort?"

416
00:37:10,508 --> 00:37:12,107
Remember? You comforted me yesterday.

417
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:14,778
In Eun Soo's stead.

418
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:25,547
Let me bring some water.

419
00:37:30,058 --> 00:37:31,127
I will...

420
00:37:32,457 --> 00:37:33,658
do it.

421
00:37:35,558 --> 00:37:36,997
My purpose in life.

422
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,837
I will set it to make you live a happy life.

423
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:44,638
So that you can be happy...

424
00:37:46,008 --> 00:37:48,937
and that your life purpose could be to simply live on,

425
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:52,377
I will work hard and help. Whatever it takes,

426
00:37:54,178 --> 00:37:55,278
I will do it.

427
00:37:58,448 --> 00:38:00,988
If, by any chance, there comes a day...

428
00:38:03,788 --> 00:38:06,288
I disappoint you,

429
00:38:08,928 --> 00:38:11,227
please remember what I told you today.

430
00:38:15,397 --> 00:38:17,138
Regardless of how I was before,

431
00:38:17,968 --> 00:38:20,738
all my actions and decisions after today...

432
00:38:23,377 --> 00:38:24,808
will be for you.

433
00:38:36,587 --> 00:38:39,488
What has gotten into her? She is making my heart flutter.

434
00:38:44,828 --> 00:38:46,837
- Is that true? - Yes.

435
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:51,868
At first, I kept calling him Big Brother as a joke.

436
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:55,038
- But one day, you know... - But one day what?

437
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:58,278
Why are you so serious?

438
00:38:59,747 --> 00:39:00,816
Han Soo...

439
00:39:00,817 --> 00:39:03,277
ran an errand to the upper village on my behalf,

440
00:39:03,278 --> 00:39:04,687
then caught a fever.

441
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:07,118
He was in a critical situation for ten days.

442
00:39:07,218 --> 00:39:08,957
Even physicians had given up on him.

443
00:39:09,058 --> 00:39:11,487
Please do not die!

444
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:12,687
I am sorry!

445
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:16,427
I will never ask you to run an errand for me.

446
00:39:16,428 --> 00:39:18,127
Please do not die, Han Soo.

447
00:39:22,203 --> 00:39:24,368
How dare you come here?

448
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:29,308
Dong Chi.

449
00:39:30,877 --> 00:39:32,377
Han Soo.

450
00:39:32,508 --> 00:39:34,718
I will be the younger one from now.

451
00:39:35,078 --> 00:39:37,388
I will always think of you as my big brother.

452
00:39:37,618 --> 00:39:40,047
So please do not die, Han Soo.

453
00:39:44,457 --> 00:39:45,557
Do you mean it?

454
00:39:45,558 --> 00:39:46,687
Yes.

455
00:39:47,198 --> 00:39:49,997
Han Soo, I am sorry. I am so sorry.

456
00:39:50,698 --> 00:39:52,997
Then call me big brother.

457
00:39:53,497 --> 00:39:54,797
Big Brother...

458
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:01,738
You were alive, Han Soo?

459
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:04,747
What do you mean, Han Soo? I am your big brother.

460
00:40:08,317 --> 00:40:09,578
Han Soo.

461
00:40:09,678 --> 00:40:11,317
- You are bleeding. - What?

462
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:13,046
You are bleeding.

463
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:14,357
What? Blood?

464
00:40:20,528 --> 00:40:21,857
I knew it.

465
00:40:22,828 --> 00:40:26,328
I thought it was because you took the wrong medicine...

466
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:29,067
or fell from a high place as a child.

467
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:32,408
What do you mean, you thought so?

468
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,337
Are you saying...

469
00:40:34,508 --> 00:40:36,477
I look older than him?

470
00:40:36,808 --> 00:40:38,808
What is that face you are making?

471
00:40:39,008 --> 00:40:40,377
Do not lose your heart.

472
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,247
You have better looks.

473
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:46,587
I knew it.

474
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:47,988
What?

475
00:40:50,788 --> 00:40:52,788
- Yoon, we need your opinion. - Yes.

476
00:41:07,107 --> 00:41:11,207
If so, do you mean Kang Han Soo will come after you this time?

477
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:12,778
I believe so.

478
00:41:13,377 --> 00:41:16,447
He probably did not find anything while he was in Cheongsan.

479
00:41:16,448 --> 00:41:17,988
In that case, you must be prepared.

480
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:20,618
If you also go down just as Commissioner Park did...

481
00:41:20,857 --> 00:41:22,988
Do you think I am stupid like those men?

482
00:41:23,687 --> 00:41:25,627
I apologize.

483
00:41:30,397 --> 00:41:31,928
All I must do is refrain from providing a cause.

484
00:41:31,997 --> 00:41:33,198
No.

485
00:41:33,267 --> 00:41:35,037
I will get rid of him first...

486
00:41:35,038 --> 00:41:36,738
before he uses his trickery.

487
00:41:38,508 --> 00:41:39,667
My lord.

488
00:41:42,308 --> 00:41:43,477
What is it?

489
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:45,947
A man urgently came from your house.

490
00:41:45,948 --> 00:41:47,517
There is an emergency with your son.

491
00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:49,447
He should be in a Confucian school studying.

492
00:41:49,448 --> 00:41:50,517
Why is he in trouble?

493
00:41:50,948 --> 00:41:51,948
Let go of me!

494
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:53,956
Are you crazy? Move away!

495
00:41:53,957 --> 00:41:56,416
Do you know who I am? Let go of me!

496
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:58,328
You will all be dismissed.

497
00:42:02,727 --> 00:42:04,198
I registered your faces.

498
00:42:04,368 --> 00:42:05,727
Hey!

499
00:42:07,437 --> 00:42:08,767
Those worthless vermin.

500
00:42:09,297 --> 00:42:11,038
It is his fault for dying after a few punches.

501
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:13,437
How dare they arrest my son?

502
00:42:13,808 --> 00:42:14,937
This way.

503
00:42:19,908 --> 00:42:21,078
Father.

504
00:42:22,647 --> 00:42:23,718
Darn it.

505
00:42:25,618 --> 00:42:27,118
You vermin.

506
00:42:28,158 --> 00:42:30,328
If you get in trouble, patch it up well.

507
00:42:30,627 --> 00:42:32,057
If you cannot do that,

508
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:33,587
simply do not get in trouble!

509
00:42:35,098 --> 00:42:37,797
Why do you always do things wrong?

510
00:42:38,198 --> 00:42:39,927
I told you time and time again...

511
00:42:39,928 --> 00:42:42,397
not to do anything at all if you cannot do something right!

512
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:46,467
You finally ended up shaming me, and of all time, right now!

513
00:42:46,468 --> 00:42:47,908
Please calm down, my lord.

514
00:42:48,038 --> 00:42:49,477
Please calm down, my lord.

515
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:09,957
(A few days ago)

516
00:43:20,477 --> 00:43:21,877
Darn it.

517
00:43:31,687 --> 00:43:32,917
Hey.

518
00:43:35,888 --> 00:43:37,127
Hey.

519
00:43:42,658 --> 00:43:44,428
You scum.

520
00:43:45,428 --> 00:43:47,897
How dare you not answer to a nobleman's call?

521
00:43:48,098 --> 00:43:49,538
Do you wish to die so badly?

522
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,007
You must...

523
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:52,367
You must answer me!

524
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:54,178
How dare you ignore me?

525
00:44:28,578 --> 00:44:30,547
(In mourning)

526
00:44:48,558 --> 00:44:52,897
(Lee's Guild)

527
00:45:00,207 --> 00:45:01,477
You are here.

528
00:45:03,538 --> 00:45:04,847
It must have been a long journey.

529
00:45:04,848 --> 00:45:06,376
Was everything all right at the merchant house?

530
00:45:06,377 --> 00:45:07,448
Of course.

531
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,828
("Book of the Law")

532
00:45:28,368 --> 00:45:32,337
(Officer Kang Eon Jik)

533
00:45:49,317 --> 00:45:52,388
Goodness, who did this to you?

534
00:45:52,528 --> 00:45:54,158
What is going on?

535
00:45:54,658 --> 00:45:55,897
Yes, hurry.

536
00:45:56,598 --> 00:45:57,897
- Goodness. - Goodness.

537
00:45:58,928 --> 00:46:00,126
Lady Hong,

538
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:03,238
- please bring cloth and warm water. - Okay.

539
00:46:05,207 --> 00:46:06,667
I am sorry, my lord.

540
00:46:08,238 --> 00:46:10,238
Lord Chu knows everything.

541
00:46:12,078 --> 00:46:13,547
We had no choice.

542
00:46:14,517 --> 00:46:16,747
Otherwise, we would have lost our lives.

543
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:21,917
I will call a physician for you. Get some rest.

544
00:46:23,058 --> 00:46:24,158
Han Soo.

545
00:46:24,227 --> 00:46:26,988
They must be warning us...

546
00:46:27,087 --> 00:46:29,158
by sending those girls to our office.

547
00:46:30,727 --> 00:46:32,167
- Let us go out for now. - What?

548
00:46:32,468 --> 00:46:35,396
This is not something you should think over.

549
00:46:35,397 --> 00:46:38,206
First things first, you must flee to find your safety.

550
00:46:38,207 --> 00:46:40,166
We lost the ledgers too.

551
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:41,807
To be frank,

552
00:46:41,808 --> 00:46:45,146
we do not have any weaponry or shields in this war.

553
00:46:45,147 --> 00:46:46,376
That is why we must find another weapon.

554
00:46:46,377 --> 00:46:47,646
Let us go meet the Princess first.

555
00:46:47,647 --> 00:46:51,288
That is not going to help us find a brilliant idea.

556
00:46:51,788 --> 00:46:52,917
Good grief.

557
00:46:58,087 --> 00:46:59,627
Did he find out already?

558
00:47:04,397 --> 00:47:08,067
Her Royal Highness is in recuperation down south.

559
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:09,996
Where in the south?

560
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:11,836
Please tell me where I can send her a letter...

561
00:47:11,837 --> 00:47:13,067
I do not know.

562
00:47:13,138 --> 00:47:15,008
Wait! When will the Princess...

563
00:47:19,707 --> 00:47:21,047
Gosh, darn it.

564
00:47:23,247 --> 00:47:25,416
Han Soo!

565
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:26,687
What?

566
00:47:27,218 --> 00:47:30,416
I have this amazing news.

567
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:31,987
What is it?

568
00:47:31,988 --> 00:47:33,127
- Come here. - What?

569
00:47:43,098 --> 00:47:44,437
That is quite amazing.

570
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:47,408
This is driving me crazy.

571
00:48:03,788 --> 00:48:05,388
How can fate...

572
00:48:06,488 --> 00:48:07,727
do this?

573
00:48:09,497 --> 00:48:10,797
Are you all right?

574
00:48:13,828 --> 00:48:15,567
So please do not worry.

575
00:48:16,968 --> 00:48:19,808
Even if I do not bother to forget my feelings for him,

576
00:48:22,738 --> 00:48:24,178
I cannot be that shameless.

577
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:28,047
It is Yoon. Please allow me to enter.

578
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,058
Your Royal Highness, it is just as anticipated.

579
00:48:39,727 --> 00:48:41,627
Will I end up telling him first?

580
00:48:42,658 --> 00:48:44,167
Or will I get busted first?

581
00:48:44,598 --> 00:48:46,098
You do not need to worry.

582
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:48,238
How is any of this your fault?

583
00:48:48,997 --> 00:48:51,707
If Attorney Kang does blame you for that incident,

584
00:48:52,437 --> 00:48:54,377
then I will not just stand idle.

585
00:48:54,977 --> 00:48:56,477
I would rather be blamed...

586
00:48:57,508 --> 00:48:59,078
than have Han Soo get hurt.

587
00:49:03,778 --> 00:49:05,887
It seems that Lord Chu harassed the people close to Attorney Kang...

588
00:49:05,888 --> 00:49:07,658
to do a little digging.

589
00:49:08,357 --> 00:49:11,187
Tighten the security around Sowongak and the shipping office.

590
00:49:12,388 --> 00:49:13,488
Yes, my lady.

591
00:49:15,457 --> 00:49:17,928
I will also keep an eye on Dong Chi.

592
00:49:31,977 --> 00:49:33,948
I thought that we were done.

593
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:37,416
I hear the Cheongsan case is being solved smoothly,

594
00:49:37,417 --> 00:49:39,448
thanks to your superb petitioning abilities.

595
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:42,356
Or are you, by any chance, here to apologize...

596
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:43,758
for the drunken frenzy?

597
00:49:51,968 --> 00:49:55,266
I heard that you were engaged to Princess Yeon Joo.

598
00:49:55,267 --> 00:49:56,337
Is that true?

599
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,567
What if it is?

600
00:50:01,437 --> 00:50:05,178
I thought you would know how to get in touch with her,

601
00:50:05,408 --> 00:50:07,377
so I made bold to come here.

602
00:50:07,817 --> 00:50:11,146
I must speak to Princess Yeon Joo.

603
00:50:11,147 --> 00:50:13,218
- So you mean... - Yes.

604
00:50:13,788 --> 00:50:17,058
Do you know where she is?

605
00:50:18,488 --> 00:50:19,758
So, you do not know...

606
00:50:20,558 --> 00:50:23,497
where Princess Yeon Joo is, nor who she is?

607
00:50:23,828 --> 00:50:24,897
No.

608
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:28,937
How would an attorney like me know who or where she is?

609
00:50:30,808 --> 00:50:32,738
What you are about to do,

610
00:50:33,968 --> 00:50:35,107
this revenge.

611
00:50:35,877 --> 00:50:37,008
"Revenge?"

612
00:50:37,238 --> 00:50:39,408
Is that not why you are working with Han Soo?

613
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:51,856
I need you to take a case.

614
00:50:51,857 --> 00:50:52,957
Yes. What?

615
00:50:53,288 --> 00:50:55,597
I must ask the Princess if I may tell you...

616
00:50:55,598 --> 00:50:58,767
where she is, so it will take some time.

617
00:50:58,928 --> 00:50:59,968
So...

618
00:51:02,337 --> 00:51:03,397
Well,

619
00:51:04,238 --> 00:51:07,638
do you have a troublesome case?

620
00:51:08,408 --> 00:51:10,336
The governor of Gyeonggi Province at the first trial...

621
00:51:10,337 --> 00:51:12,507
requested a joint interrogation to Hanseongbu.

622
00:51:12,508 --> 00:51:13,546
Okay.

623
00:51:13,547 --> 00:51:14,777
The Ministry of Law Enforcement...

624
00:51:14,778 --> 00:51:16,017
will investigate it at the second trial,

625
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:19,647
but I must do my part as the joint investigator.

626
00:51:20,047 --> 00:51:22,787
I need you to look into the investigation, trial, and ruling...

627
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,157
of the Gyeonggi governor to see if they were fair.

628
00:51:25,158 --> 00:51:26,328
Yes. But...

629
00:51:26,988 --> 00:51:29,558
if you are only trying to distract me...

630
00:51:29,658 --> 00:51:31,967
by putting me on this case...

631
00:51:31,968 --> 00:51:35,297
The suspect will not speak at all, which is giving us a hard time.

632
00:51:36,368 --> 00:51:38,408
If an attorney like yourself talks to him,

633
00:51:38,868 --> 00:51:40,537
I am sure he will open up.

634
00:51:40,538 --> 00:51:43,008
To an attorney like myself, yes.

635
00:51:44,377 --> 00:51:45,607
Well, then.

636
00:51:45,877 --> 00:51:48,578
It sounds like a fair price to pay to meet the princess.

637
00:51:51,448 --> 00:51:52,448
May I...

638
00:51:52,618 --> 00:51:54,017
No, you may not. Just go.

639
00:52:03,127 --> 00:52:04,158
What was that?

640
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:08,397
Who do you think you are staring at?

641
00:52:08,497 --> 00:52:10,167
Young master, we must go.

642
00:52:12,308 --> 00:52:13,508
Gosh.

643
00:52:25,317 --> 00:52:26,988
- That is him. - Thank you.

644
00:52:32,558 --> 00:52:33,658
Lee Bong Sam.

645
00:52:34,397 --> 00:52:37,427
You have been arrested for beating Kang Chil Gu, your neighbour,

646
00:52:37,428 --> 00:52:39,067
to death. Is that correct?

647
00:52:43,267 --> 00:52:45,267
I am Attorney Kang Han Soo.

648
00:52:45,437 --> 00:52:48,408
I will devote myself to helping you if you need help.

649
00:52:50,638 --> 00:52:51,877
Yes.

650
00:52:52,247 --> 00:52:54,617
You are looking at the best attorney in Joseon,

651
00:52:54,618 --> 00:52:56,578
Kang Han Soo...

652
00:52:59,917 --> 00:53:02,687
Are you refusing my help?

653
00:53:04,957 --> 00:53:07,457
Listen. I am Kang Han Soo.

654
00:53:07,558 --> 00:53:10,396
The plum wine case, the scholar-official divorce case,

655
00:53:10,397 --> 00:53:12,368
and the first-degree murder...

656
00:53:13,198 --> 00:53:15,567
I cannot believe I am listing my achievements.

657
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,267
Lee Bong Sam.

658
00:53:21,078 --> 00:53:23,507
You may want to keep your mouth shut before the judge...

659
00:53:23,508 --> 00:53:25,476
as you will be confessing to your crimes,

660
00:53:25,477 --> 00:53:28,118
but that is unnecessary in front of an attorney.

661
00:53:31,647 --> 00:53:32,687
Hello?

662
00:53:33,317 --> 00:53:35,258
Hey!

663
00:53:38,988 --> 00:53:40,957
Get well rested.

664
00:53:42,957 --> 00:53:44,258
Oh, boy.

665
00:53:44,828 --> 00:53:45,868
Goodness, you scared me!

666
00:53:47,497 --> 00:53:49,538
How long have you been standing there?

667
00:53:51,107 --> 00:53:53,238
This is my house. I will stand wherever I like.

668
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,337
You have a client.

669
00:54:01,017 --> 00:54:02,118
Could she be...

670
00:54:03,317 --> 00:54:04,417
jealous?

671
00:54:15,658 --> 00:54:17,296
There he comes.

672
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:19,397
That is Attorney Kang.

673
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:22,067
How frustrating.

674
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,908
What is everyone doing here?

675
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,078
Please save my father.

676
00:54:28,908 --> 00:54:32,278
My father is not a murderer.

677
00:54:36,747 --> 00:54:39,618
Someone else attacked the victim.

678
00:54:43,118 --> 00:54:46,258
Yet, the young master claims that he died...

679
00:54:46,758 --> 00:54:48,127
because your father shoved him?

680
00:54:49,028 --> 00:54:52,698
Yes. And my mom told me to keep my mouth shut.

681
00:54:53,368 --> 00:54:54,667
Otherwise, we'd all be dead.

682
00:54:56,638 --> 00:54:59,368
And that no farmhand can report his owner.

683
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:01,436
I think she meant the law that forbids them...

684
00:55:01,437 --> 00:55:03,077
from reporting the elderly.

685
00:55:03,078 --> 00:55:05,778
The servants can never report their owners.

686
00:55:06,107 --> 00:55:08,347
And the people can never report the authorities...

687
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:10,348
even though they are mistreated! That is the law!

688
00:55:10,448 --> 00:55:11,517
Darn it.

689
00:55:12,247 --> 00:55:14,816
He is about to be framed for his owner's sin.

690
00:55:14,817 --> 00:55:16,316
What is the use of such laws...

691
00:55:16,317 --> 00:55:17,787
when you are about to be executed?

692
00:55:17,788 --> 00:55:18,988
Calm yourselves.

693
00:55:19,957 --> 00:55:21,928
Let us hear from the boy.

694
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:26,997
So, the true murderer of the next-door neighbour...

695
00:55:27,428 --> 00:55:30,067
is your father's owner?

696
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:32,667
Yes.

697
00:55:33,337 --> 00:55:35,106
And your father is a servant.

698
00:55:35,107 --> 00:55:38,047
Yes. When I was little,

699
00:55:38,678 --> 00:55:41,718
there was famine and the plague,

700
00:55:42,078 --> 00:55:44,417
so my father went to the current owner's house...

701
00:55:44,788 --> 00:55:46,848
and borrowed rice by promising to work...

702
00:55:47,517 --> 00:55:48,817
for ten years for them.

703
00:55:49,587 --> 00:55:50,857
He has seven years left.

704
00:55:51,388 --> 00:55:55,457
Goodness. So he sold his labour to feed his son.

705
00:55:56,258 --> 00:55:58,427
A lot of people come here and complain...

706
00:55:58,428 --> 00:56:00,626
with the servant documents.

707
00:56:00,627 --> 00:56:01,797
(Documents of promising to sell themselves)

708
00:56:01,897 --> 00:56:03,698
If they cannot borrow money from us,

709
00:56:04,337 --> 00:56:06,267
they have no choice but to become servants.

710
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:08,876
But they were not originally servants,

711
00:56:08,877 --> 00:56:12,178
so such law does not apply to them, does it?

712
00:56:12,607 --> 00:56:14,678
It is obvious.

713
00:56:16,017 --> 00:56:19,448
They think that we are stupid and do not know the laws.

714
00:56:19,618 --> 00:56:22,058
So the owner must have scared his family,

715
00:56:22,388 --> 00:56:25,257
saying that it is the national law.

716
00:56:25,258 --> 00:56:27,586
Who on earth is this brazen, wicked owner?

717
00:56:27,587 --> 00:56:29,058
Your owner.

718
00:56:30,627 --> 00:56:32,897
Well...

719
00:56:36,638 --> 00:56:37,937
It is Lord Chu.

720
00:56:40,508 --> 00:56:41,607
Did you...

721
00:56:42,877 --> 00:56:44,178
just say, "Lord Chu?"

722
00:56:45,578 --> 00:56:48,647
Lord Chu Young Woo from State Council?

723
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:52,417
Yes. Lord Chu's son, the young master,

724
00:56:52,587 --> 00:56:54,086
assaulted Chil Gu.

725
00:56:54,087 --> 00:56:56,817
Oh, I see.

726
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:08,767
Here. Eat it.

727
00:57:15,278 --> 00:57:17,848
- Just say it here. - Be quiet.

728
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:23,817
How could this happen?

729
00:57:23,877 --> 00:57:25,916
What is going on?

730
00:57:25,917 --> 00:57:27,186
What do you mean?

731
00:57:27,187 --> 00:57:30,058
We just acquired a secret weapon.

732
00:57:30,258 --> 00:57:32,488
Thanks to that, we can stop running away.

733
00:57:33,528 --> 00:57:36,558
Do not tell me you are taking this case.

734
00:57:37,658 --> 00:57:39,467
It seems that Lord Chu...

735
00:57:39,468 --> 00:57:42,266
was trying to be smart and put the blame on Bong Sam...

736
00:57:42,267 --> 00:57:44,738
using this law against accusing the elderly.

737
00:57:48,607 --> 00:57:49,877
This time,

738
00:57:50,937 --> 00:57:52,607
I will teach him...

739
00:57:53,408 --> 00:57:54,917
whose side the law should take.

740
00:58:00,348 --> 00:58:02,856
We will have Bong Sam's son file a complaint...

741
00:58:02,857 --> 00:58:04,627
against Young Master Chu for framing his father.

742
00:58:04,988 --> 00:58:07,387
Then the court hearing for Bong Sam will be postponed.

743
00:58:07,388 --> 00:58:08,428
In the meantime,

744
00:58:09,198 --> 00:58:11,868
we must find proof that Young Master Chu is the culprit.

745
00:58:12,368 --> 00:58:14,598
What is the point?

746
00:58:14,797 --> 00:58:17,967
They managed to change the suspect overnight.

747
00:58:17,968 --> 00:58:20,007
They must have destroyed all the evidence.

748
00:58:20,008 --> 00:58:23,107
And they must have bought off all the witnesses.

749
00:58:25,078 --> 00:58:26,308
They must have, right?

750
00:58:26,578 --> 00:58:28,016
You bet!

751
00:58:28,017 --> 00:58:29,047
Besides,

752
00:58:30,618 --> 00:58:32,816
rumours are rampant that he is marrying the daughter...

753
00:58:32,817 --> 00:58:35,388
of Minister Won Dae Han of Law Enforcement.

754
00:58:35,618 --> 00:58:36,956
Given connections and all,

755
00:58:36,957 --> 00:58:38,988
we are hardly their match.

756
00:58:39,388 --> 00:58:40,888
- Is that right? - Yes.

757
00:58:41,758 --> 00:58:42,928
I see.

758
00:58:44,457 --> 00:58:45,727
Why are you grinning?

759
00:58:46,528 --> 00:58:48,997
It excites me. I am getting competitive.

760
00:58:51,908 --> 00:58:53,767
Hey, I am getting goosebumps.

761
00:58:59,247 --> 00:59:00,448
Strain the tips of your fingers.

762
00:59:01,448 --> 00:59:02,517
Straighten your back.

763
00:59:03,747 --> 00:59:06,288
Write each character with all your heart.

764
00:59:14,428 --> 00:59:16,528
I am boundlessly afraid...

765
00:59:16,997 --> 00:59:18,928
to inform the great local magistrate,

766
00:59:19,328 --> 00:59:21,437
but for my resentment is so big,

767
00:59:21,968 --> 00:59:23,937
I am mustering my courage to write to you.

768
00:59:24,707 --> 00:59:26,508
My father is innocent.

769
00:59:53,368 --> 00:59:54,396
I will...

770
00:59:54,397 --> 00:59:55,738
make you pay for sure.

771
00:59:56,098 --> 00:59:57,738
I will visit the Chungcheong government office...

772
00:59:57,937 --> 00:59:59,808
and even His Majesty in Hanyang.

773
01:00:00,207 --> 01:00:03,408
I will report every detail of what you did.

774
01:00:06,977 --> 01:00:08,618
The law is not as sloppy as you think.

775
01:00:09,078 --> 01:00:10,278
Give it a try.

776
01:00:10,547 --> 01:00:12,887
You will learn what happens if a mere commoner...

777
01:00:12,888 --> 01:00:14,917
accuses a local magistrate.

778
01:00:16,817 --> 01:00:18,227
How foolish of you.

779
01:00:18,687 --> 01:00:20,428
No wonder you still do not know whose side the law is on.

780
01:00:51,957 --> 01:00:53,058
It is me.

781
01:01:20,118 --> 01:01:22,317
- Do not go. - Hey, why...

782
01:01:22,618 --> 01:01:24,618
You have neither evidence nor witnesses.

783
01:01:24,957 --> 01:01:26,988
Must you go against Lord Chu?

784
01:01:28,158 --> 01:01:30,356
Magistrate Yoo left this case to me.

785
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:32,627
It is a difficult case. That must be why...

786
01:01:33,067 --> 01:01:34,726
he designated me, Kang Han Soo.

787
01:01:34,727 --> 01:01:36,336
I do not want to disappoint him.

788
01:01:36,337 --> 01:01:37,337
That is just an excuse.

789
01:01:37,338 --> 01:01:39,508
You are trying to take revenge on Lord Chu.

790
01:01:43,138 --> 01:01:44,308
How...

791
01:01:45,547 --> 01:01:46,646
did you know?

792
01:01:46,647 --> 01:01:47,877
Of course, I know.

793
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:50,717
From the beginning, I have only seen you,

794
01:01:50,718 --> 01:01:52,218
thought of you, and studied you.

795
01:01:52,888 --> 01:01:55,357
Everything about you was suspicious.

796
01:02:01,758 --> 01:02:03,158
Yes, you are right.

797
01:02:04,158 --> 01:02:05,627
It was to take revenge at first.

798
01:02:06,297 --> 01:02:08,297
But now, that is not everything.

799
01:02:09,837 --> 01:02:11,638
I have become wanting to live a decent life...

800
01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:14,538
and to be a real attorney.

801
01:02:16,308 --> 01:02:17,778
So how could I run away?

802
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:20,847
Someone is wronged, there is a way to resolve it,

803
01:02:20,848 --> 01:02:22,747
and now is the only chance to save him.

804
01:02:22,877 --> 01:02:26,488
You have to be alive to seize that chance.

805
01:02:27,017 --> 01:02:28,288
I will not die.

806
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:30,988
Not when you are here.

807
01:02:33,288 --> 01:02:34,957
You said you would live for me.

808
01:02:36,098 --> 01:02:38,767
That you would do anything for my happiness.

809
01:02:39,828 --> 01:02:43,297
I am not foolish enough to leave behind someone...

810
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,368
who adores and loves me.

811
01:02:46,837 --> 01:02:48,377
My parents taught me...

812
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:51,678
that I must never do so,

813
01:02:52,278 --> 01:02:54,308
or I would regret it even after death.

814
01:02:56,948 --> 01:03:00,317
I did not care when or how I died.

815
01:03:01,388 --> 01:03:04,058
I did not dream of happiness at all.

816
01:03:06,488 --> 01:03:08,357
But for the first time, I wanted to stay alive.

817
01:03:09,558 --> 01:03:10,727
And I even...

818
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:13,497
made up my mind to live a decent life.

819
01:03:16,337 --> 01:03:18,707
That determination itself is a miracle to me.

820
01:03:20,808 --> 01:03:21,937
So,

821
01:03:24,107 --> 01:03:25,178
do not worry.

822
01:03:26,848 --> 01:03:28,417
If you experience a miracle,

823
01:03:28,817 --> 01:03:30,147
you do not die easily.

824
01:03:38,158 --> 01:03:40,187
Hey, So Won.

825
01:03:40,288 --> 01:03:41,457
Just for a moment.

826
01:03:43,558 --> 01:03:45,267
Let me be in your arms for just a moment.

827
01:04:28,638 --> 01:04:29,778
Attorney Kang!

828
01:04:41,618 --> 01:04:43,388
Go without me. Now.

829
01:05:42,618 --> 01:05:43,848
How dare you!

830
01:05:45,087 --> 01:05:46,788
Do you really want to die?

831
01:05:51,517 --> 01:05:52,727
But you failed to kill me.

832
01:06:05,468 --> 01:06:06,607
Do you not get it?

833
01:06:08,437 --> 01:06:11,508
I am here to reply to your warning.

834
01:06:12,778 --> 01:06:14,008
Kang Han Soo!

835
01:06:15,147 --> 01:06:16,948
Yes, I am Kang Han Soo.

836
01:06:18,647 --> 01:06:20,487
Kang Han Soo, the best attorney in Joseon...

837
01:06:20,488 --> 01:06:22,788
who has never lost a case.

838
01:06:23,118 --> 01:06:24,258
And...

839
01:06:24,857 --> 01:06:26,686
the son of Officer Kang...

840
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,698
whom you killed seven years ago.

841
01:06:43,138 --> 01:06:45,078
So look forward to it.

842
01:06:47,508 --> 01:06:49,646
Consider this a hat...

843
01:06:49,647 --> 01:06:51,278
I am throwing into the ring.

844
01:06:52,317 --> 01:06:54,247
War has begun.

845
01:07:27,547 --> 01:07:30,988
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

846
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,067
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

847
01:07:39,497 --> 01:07:40,767
Kang Han Soo, that jerk.

848
01:07:41,028 --> 01:07:43,138
Lord Chu will not stay still.

849
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:45,138
Do you have a plan?

850
01:07:46,968 --> 01:07:49,008
Are you not curious, Your Highness?

851
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:50,477
If it is a coincidence...

852
01:07:50,638 --> 01:07:52,408
or if everything is part of his revenge.

853
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:56,618
I would like to live an ordinary life too.

854
01:07:57,817 --> 01:07:59,118
I am proposing...

855
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:01,388
to you.

856
01:08:02,988 --> 01:08:04,158
I also have...

857
01:08:05,535 --> 01:08:07,064
a confession to make.
