1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:02,930
(All people, incidents, and periods in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,191
You are...

3
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,890
Hold it back, Kang Eun Soo.

4
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:32,191
Do not let him find out.

5
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,431
Let him consider that I am just a lookalike.

6
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:38,030
I will hold out.

7
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,901
Why are you...

8
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:41,901
Why are you here?

9
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,001
How...

10
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,720
Do not do that.

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,651
Eun Soo...

12
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:08,661
Eun Soo...

13
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:11,571
Han Soo...

14
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:15,970
I am sorry.

15
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,810
I am sorry, Han Soo.

16
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,640
- I am sorry. - Eun Soo...

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,950
I am sorry, Han Soo.

18
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,491
What have you said to Eun Soo?

19
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:38,731
What did you say to entice her,

20
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,500
and why did you use her like that?

21
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:47,571
Actually,

22
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,241
it was not the former King's order to eliminate Officer Kang.

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,840
It was the Queen Dowager,

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
who wanted to subdue the fury of the subjects.

25
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,911
It was also the Queen Dowager who enthroned the current King...

26
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:04,751
instead of the former, who suffered from a chronic illness.

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,520
So technically speaking,

28
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,291
the Royal Family of Joseon is your enemy.

29
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,460
Will you get your revenge...

30
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:16,631
against the Royal Family?

31
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:31,080
I hoped...

32
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,781
to forgive you, Father.

33
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,721
I am waiting for an opportunity...

34
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:39,691
to understand and forgive you.

35
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,460
Do you not see that?

36
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:02,680
Do not cry.

37
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,550
And do not worry either.

38
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,620
I will get you out of here.

39
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:10,050
Han Soo.

40
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:11,890
I will not condone...

41
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,791
another wrongful death, so...

42
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,191
It is not wrongful.

43
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,830
I was not framed.

44
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,930
It is something I have done.

45
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:29,300
So...

46
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:31,670
I will pay for my crime.

47
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,841
No.

48
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,381
No.

49
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,520
Who decides what the price is for your crime?

50
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,251
Do you really think there is justice here?

51
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,791
This kingdom of Joseon...

52
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,460
is entirely rotten!

53
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,960
On top of that, the King wants to kill you.

54
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,161
That is why I am trying to stop him.

55
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:58,731
So...

56
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,400
Han Soo.

57
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,541
So...

58
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,941
Eun Soo.

59
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,781
Let me save your life first.

60
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,050
Okay?

61
00:04:21,891 --> 00:04:23,021
Okay?

62
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,560
Okay?

63
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,651
Yoo Je Se!

64
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:54,990
Get away.

65
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,430
I will kill you! You...

66
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,531
Han Soo!

67
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,070
No!

68
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,341
Not Eun Soo.

69
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,440
Not my sister!

70
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,541
You should not have exploited her!

71
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,180
I will kill you.

72
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,851
I will...

73
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:21,851
kill you!

74
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:23,880
Let go of me!

75
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:25,451
Let go!

76
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:27,990
Let us go.

77
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:36,401
I will kill you.

78
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:38,670
I will kill you.

79
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,180
Dong Chi...

80
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:02,760
Eun Soo... My Eun Soo...

81
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:14,130
Dong Chi...

82
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,951
(Episode 14: Falling Blossoms 2)

83
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,021
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

84
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:35,190
What?

85
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,490
Kang Han Soo's sister?

86
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,831
Yes.

87
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:43,661
She was also exploited by Executive Minister Yoo,

88
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:46,601
and she has been abandoned.

89
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,041
I see.

90
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,981
That is why.

91
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:56,481
So please,

92
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,781
you must not create yet another innocent victim.

93
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,021
- Please... - Innocent?

94
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:04,750
She is not innocent.

95
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:07,190
Sorry?

96
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,820
I will make sure the subjects of Joseon...

97
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,760
will never be manipulated by a single woman again.

98
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,461
I shall punish her as a warning to others.

99
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:15,731
But Your Majesty.

100
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,670
A king's reward and punishment...

101
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,130
must be given according to the will of the skies,

102
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,500
and one must not reflect one's personal feelings.

103
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:27,471
I do not agree.

104
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:32,351
Is it personal to punish her...

105
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,120
in order to punish Executive Minister Yoo?

106
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,050
Or is it more personal to show mercy because she is a sister of a friend?

107
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,791
You are also trying to persuade me right now...

108
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:51,461
because of personal feelings.

109
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,750
Kang, who operated a bar in Namchon for middle-class women and widows,

110
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:11,281
is the daughter of Kang Eon Jik, a former officer in the Royal Court,

111
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,891
and the daughter-in-law of Nam Kyung Moon,

112
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:15,591
a former governor of Siheung.

113
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,731
Kang Eon Jik?

114
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:29,571
Is he not a criminal who passed during interrogation for bribery?

115
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:32,311
You are right.

116
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,981
His daughter must have inherited...

117
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:37,981
the unethical nature of her father.

118
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:49,561
Kang was a woman of noble birth.

119
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:51,561
State your crimes honestly!

120
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:55,030
But she has not remained chaste and committed adultery with many men.

121
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,201
You must interrogate her thoroughly and punish her accordingly.

122
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,030
I wish to ask the Ministry of Justice...

123
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,000
to interrogate Jang Myung Ki, Jang Yoon, Kim Young Jae,

124
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:06,410
Seo Byung Ho, Choi Heung Seon, and Lee Geun Woo.

125
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,681
They must be interrogated.

126
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,140
Listen up!

127
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:12,150
Strip them!

128
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:13,410
- Yes, my lord! - Yes, my lord!

129
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:18,890
(Eun)

130
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:24,221
When...

131
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,591
will you expose my name?

132
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,071
Are you afraid?

133
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:38,101
Did you approach me...

134
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:40,410
that night...

135
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:43,510
to prepare for a day like this?

136
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,961
I eavesdropped on the conversation between the Saheonbu officials.

137
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,360
The King has given secret orders...

138
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,471
to crack down on the illegal trades near the border.

139
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:09,941
If this issue arises,

140
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,071
who will Executive Minister Yoo put the blame on?

141
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:17,481
Who will be...

142
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:21,750
abandoned this time?

143
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,221
What is your purpose...

144
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:34,231
of telling me this?

145
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:39,931
I thought...

146
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,270
you were on Executive Minister Yoo's side.

147
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,410
You are mistaken.

148
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,380
As a matter of fact, if you ask me whose side I am on,

149
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,020
I will tell you that I am the daughter of my parents.

150
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:58,221
Your parents?

151
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:03,691
Who are your parents?

152
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:05,431
My father...

153
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:10,000
once went by the name of Kang Eon Jik.

154
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:12,801
No way.

155
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:25,380
(Officer Kang Eon Jik)

156
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,910
You are...

157
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:30,020
You are...

158
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:33,520
Officer Kang's daughter?

159
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,530
Yes.

160
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,301
So, I have decided to give you a chance to apologize to my father.

161
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:48,370
Tell me how I can defeat Executive Minister Yoo.

162
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,221
There were no ledgers.

163
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:07,490
Are you sure you did not tell me a lie...

164
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,821
to put me in a fix?

165
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,221
If I did...

166
00:12:15,331 --> 00:12:17,601
I would not have been foolish enough to prove my loyalty to you...

167
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:19,130
(Eun)

168
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,030
by getting this.

169
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,581
I pity you.

170
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,551
Even with all that wealth and power,

171
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,591
what makes you so insecure?

172
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,191
What will you do now?

173
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,660
You have just...

174
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:52,701
pushed your luck.

175
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,890
What do you think you are doing here?

176
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,520
I have come to calm you down.

177
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,061
Calm me down?

178
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,130
You must be more cautious at a time like this.

179
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,561
Do not make me laugh.

180
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,500
Who could stay calm in this situation?

181
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:31,101
So, what is it that you want to tell me?

182
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:36,681
Eun Soo is negatively influenced by your late father's reputation.

183
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,311
They criticize her and her family customs...

184
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:41,351
and say that she inherited an unethical nature.

185
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,181
Unbelievable. Family customs?

186
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,421
What about them messing with innocent people's lives?

187
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,760
Is that part of the national customs?

188
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:52,691
Get off me!

189
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,740
If you step up to tell them that you are her brother,

190
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,711
things will get worse for her.

191
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:09,740
You know better than anyone...

192
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,640
that no one in the Royal Court favours you.

193
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:14,650
And you are an attorney.

194
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,780
They are even discussing...

195
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,721
whether to ban attorneys by law or not.

196
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:22,790
Whether you are Eun Soo's brother or an attorney,

197
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,831
stepping forward to help her will only backfire.

198
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:27,890
Then...

199
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,201
what do you expect me to do?

200
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:31,701
What you want to do.

201
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,941
Use me to do them.

202
00:14:43,941 --> 00:14:45,250
What must I do...

203
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:47,380
to save Eun Soo?

204
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:24,551
Dong Chi?

205
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:28,290
Eun Soo.

206
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,630
What happened?

207
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,030
Princess Yeon Joo and Magistrate Yoo helped.

208
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:42,301
I am going to stay here and protect you for a while.

209
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,900
Just in case.

210
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,811
In case I kill myself?

211
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,780
No. Han Soo is worried sick...

212
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:57,150
that someone might hurt you.

213
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:06,530
I apologize.

214
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,231
Why would you?

215
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:12,431
I should have stopped you...

216
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,941
when you were getting married.

217
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:18,870
I should have told you...

218
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,240
how I felt about you and eloped with you.

219
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:23,910
Then,

220
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:29,221
you would not have ended up here.

221
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:35,821
Why are you smirking?

222
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:37,660
I mean it.

223
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,431
I am in agony here.

224
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:43,101
I was not smirking.

225
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,971
I smiled because I was glad.

226
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:49,140
I was thinking it would have been better.

227
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,140
Had you done that,

228
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:56,580
I would have been happier than now.

229
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,611
Because you are someone...

230
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:03,750
who makes me smile.

231
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,111
According to the law, in the case of adultery,

232
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:30,141
it is punishable by 80 floggings...

233
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:31,911
if it was by mutual consent,

234
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:34,951
by 90 floggings if the woman was married,

235
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:38,921
and by 100 floggings if either of the party was tricked.

236
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,540
What must I do...

237
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,070
to save Eun Soo?

238
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,711
I am sure that everyone knows this case is a fight...

239
00:18:02,711 --> 00:18:03,840
between Executive Minister Yoo and His Majesty.

240
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,211
Most people will want to stay quiet.

241
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,750
But a few officials, who want be in the Kings' favour,

242
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,651
will take a tough stance and say she must be put to death.

243
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,421
Kang's lewd behaviours...

244
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,191
were as vulgar as a gisaeng.

245
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,500
She must be sentenced to death, Your Majesty.

246
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:25,770
First off,

247
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,471
emphasize the law against adultery.

248
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,740
But to sentence her to death,

249
00:18:32,171 --> 00:18:35,780
all men who were in a relationship with her must be punished the same.

250
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:38,540
How so?

251
00:18:38,981 --> 00:18:40,250
When a man and a woman...

252
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:43,381
were both in a relationship by consent,

253
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,050
or when one tricked the other to believe it,

254
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:47,590
they'd both get the same punishment.

255
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,861
So, if Kang Eun Soo is sentenced to death,

256
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:54,330
the other men must also be sentenced to death.

257
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,361
But it was one woman...

258
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:00,701
who allured multiple men into adultery.

259
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,641
How should the men who were lied to...

260
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:05,671
be punished the same as her?

261
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,481
Of course, the arrested men will claim that they were lied to.

262
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:18,421
The government officials are all men as well,

263
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:20,951
so they will take their words more than Eun Soo's.

264
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,861
Still, it should not be punishable by death.

265
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:25,221
No.

266
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,861
So, our best defence is...

267
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:35,231
to punish it by the law.

268
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,671
But once the law is established,

269
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:43,840
you cannot adjust the penalty as you see fit.

270
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,181
If we do not execute the sinner who violated the rules,

271
00:19:49,181 --> 00:19:52,590
how will we fix these obscene customs?

272
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,921
The customs do not change overnight for one severe punishment.

273
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:57,290
Punishment is there...

274
00:19:57,661 --> 00:19:59,631
to discipline the people.

275
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,401
If customs cannot be changed,

276
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,161
there will be no use of legal punishment.

277
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:23,151
However,

278
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,050
reaching a verdict recklessly without following the law...

279
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,721
out of passing anger could set a bad example.

280
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,891
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

281
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,711
How did it go?

282
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,711
He still insists on executing her.

283
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,221
But even His Majesty himself...

284
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:03,820
will have to punish her within the lawful boundary.

285
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,760
He can.

286
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:18,340
If he changes his perspective.

287
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,181
Since "Book of the Law" was promulgated,

288
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,391
no woman has been executed for adultery.

289
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:40,631
That is correct, Your Majesty.

290
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,800
Thus,

291
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,800
it is unacceptable to punish the criminal against the law.

292
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,800
Pardon me for saying this,

293
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,570
but it will set a bad example.

294
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,411
It needs to be handled according to the law.

295
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,381
Your Majesty,

296
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,621
I, Right State Councillor Im, would like to speak to you.

297
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:06,621
Come in.

298
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,800
What is the matter?

299
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,070
I have brought a way to lessen your concern.

300
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,090
What is he trying to pull in the middle this time again?

301
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,961
Again?

302
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:49,760
Right State Councillor Im stole Officer Kang's letter.

303
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,330
If we think about it,

304
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:58,141
every tragedy started from him.

305
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:03,181
I will look into what he is after.

306
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,461
You have just pushed your luck.

307
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:25,830
My lord.

308
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,240
My lord.

309
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:32,570
Are you all right?

310
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,270
Help me take him!

311
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,441
- Yes, master. - Yes, master.

312
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:44,951
What happened?

313
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,891
He seems to be poisoned.

314
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,421
- Poisoned? - Yes.

315
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,590
I think the scar on his arm caused it.

316
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,161
In some cases,

317
00:23:57,161 --> 00:24:00,100
heat spreads poison all over one's body.

318
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:04,701
Then how should he be treated?

319
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,611
I am afraid...

320
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:09,481
he is hopeless.

321
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,411
Should we step outside for a bit?

322
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,481
Sure.

323
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,330
Shall I let the Princess know?

324
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:29,830
Yes.

325
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:31,800
No.

326
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:34,971
Bring Attorney Kang over first.

327
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,270
Yes, my lady.

328
00:24:57,961 --> 00:25:01,131
This is how he pays the price in the end.

329
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,000
But...

330
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:08,600
right before he died,

331
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:10,901
he spoke to His Majesty...

332
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:13,770
and gave him the answer he was looking for.

333
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:43,441
I have brought a way...

334
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,371
to lessen your concern.

335
00:25:45,941 --> 00:25:48,171
A way to lessen my concern?

336
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:50,211
Punish her according to the civil law...

337
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,850
instead of the criminal law.

338
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,550
(Regarding civilian life such as marriage and land)

339
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,780
The civil law?

340
00:25:56,881 --> 00:25:58,181
Yes, Your Majesty.

341
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:02,090
If you punish her for adultery according to the criminal law,

342
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,421
the maximum sentence is 100 floggings and a 2,000-Ri exile.

343
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:07,461
But according to the civil law,

344
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:11,600
she can be put to death by hanging...

345
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,830
for abandoning her husband and getting remarried right away.

346
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,000
(Execution by hanging)

347
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,750
(Death, Life)

348
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,590
Is this the only way?

349
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,010
Your Majesty.

350
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:05,121
Are you really going to use that method?

351
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,530
You refer to a similar law...

352
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,530
only when there are no appropriate laws to apply.

353
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:19,500
She is clearly charged with adultery,

354
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,201
so why apply another law?

355
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:23,641
Do you think...

356
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:25,941
the law can be applied differently...

357
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:27,840
depending on how you perceive it?

358
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:29,481
Then,

359
00:27:31,211 --> 00:27:33,211
are you telling me to stick to being a young puppet king,

360
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:35,780
who gets used by Executive Minister Yoo?

361
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,651
If I spare her now,

362
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,060
then I will end up...

363
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,621
becoming an incompetent king who has lost my subjects...

364
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,330
without even getting to handle Executive Minister Yoo's spy.

365
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,161
Then,

366
00:27:51,431 --> 00:27:53,731
how would you call a king...

367
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:55,431
who supports constitutionalism only by words...

368
00:27:55,431 --> 00:27:57,000
and applies the law as he pleases?

369
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,641
A foolish king?

370
00:27:58,641 --> 00:27:59,671
Yeon Joo!

371
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:02,441
This will be recorded in history forever.

372
00:28:03,411 --> 00:28:04,840
Will you ruin your great purpose...

373
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:07,580
over immediate gains?

374
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:15,090
This is for that great purpose.

375
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:16,260
Your Majesty.

376
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,520
If I defeat a disloyal subject...

377
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,090
and straighten the royal authority,

378
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,191
there will be much more I can do.

379
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:23,300
Then,

380
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,270
I will be able to make many more achievements.

381
00:28:28,371 --> 00:28:30,441
Reputations are bound to change in the future.

382
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,800
For now,

383
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,310
seizing a chance comes first.

384
00:28:51,121 --> 00:28:53,161
Please save her, my lord.

385
00:28:53,931 --> 00:28:55,691
I will give up on everything.

386
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,131
Whatever it is, I will give up...

387
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,530
and leave far away with Eun Soo.

388
00:29:02,471 --> 00:29:03,701
So please...

389
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:06,000
spare her life.

390
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:09,711
It was arrogant of me.

391
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,010
I had a stupid dream of getting my revenge with the law.

392
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,520
But now that my sister is in danger,

393
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,290
I have realized that it is much faster...

394
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,621
to rely on power than the law.

395
00:29:27,131 --> 00:29:29,030
You are the only one...

396
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:34,270
who can save Eun Soo.

397
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,510
Are you suggesting a deal...

398
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,941
just by going on your powerless knees?

399
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:52,181
What will I get in exchange...

400
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,090
for saving Eun Soo?

401
00:29:57,391 --> 00:29:58,891
He wants something from me.

402
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,060
What could it be?

403
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:07,931
I will bring what you want.

404
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,981
What did you just say?

405
00:30:18,981 --> 00:30:20,711
I asked where the ledgers were.

406
00:30:21,681 --> 00:30:24,780
I thought you had offered them to Executive Minister Yoo, but no.

407
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,191
Then it is obvious, is it not?

408
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:31,921
Lord Chu would not have taken those with him to the fiery pit.

409
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,131
I will bring them.

410
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,871
No, you will not.

411
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,381
If I hand them over to you right now,

412
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,711
what will happen to me?

413
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:56,820
You will seize a chance.

414
00:30:57,681 --> 00:30:59,590
A chance to fulfill your duty as a human.

415
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:03,161
A chance to act according to your conscience, not wealth.

416
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,961
And a chance to ask for my forgiveness.

417
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,171
I saw you that day.

418
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,570
At the back alley.

419
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,530
Get ready to go to the palace.

420
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:50,401
- Yes, my lord. - Executive Minister Yoo.

421
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,340
What are you planning to do?

422
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,111
Why is it that you visited me?

423
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,721
Because you believed I could solve...

424
00:32:03,951 --> 00:32:06,520
what you could not with your method, right?

425
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:14,330
Executive Minister Yoo came to the Ministry of Justice?

426
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,131
Yes.

427
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,300
Do not tell me...

428
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,441
Your Highness?

429
00:32:25,671 --> 00:32:26,671
Your Highness!

430
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,141
According to the law,

431
00:32:31,911 --> 00:32:33,411
you should live.

432
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:37,320
But the one who establishes law...

433
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,881
and administers justice...

434
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:41,590
wants you to die.

435
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,461
You mean the King.

436
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,060
Yes.

437
00:32:46,861 --> 00:32:48,961
To save you,

438
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,500
we need to devise a scheme and not rely on the law.

439
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:56,131
And so your brother...

440
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,671
came to see me, not the King.

441
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,350
I am going to save you once more.

442
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,750
After sneaking you away to a safe place,

443
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,721
I will have a different person executed.

444
00:33:25,931 --> 00:33:28,100
According to the national law, the prisoner who escaped jail...

445
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:30,871
and the one who had known but did not report it...

446
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:33,441
must be beheaded.

447
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,941
Roughly ten people,

448
00:33:35,941 --> 00:33:38,481
including the lieutenant of Ministry of Justice,

449
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,711
the prison guard, and the executioner,

450
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,481
will lose their lives because of me.

451
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,161
Han Soo will surely not agree to such a plan, either.

452
00:33:50,921 --> 00:33:51,990
Will you...

453
00:33:53,191 --> 00:33:54,760
truly not regret it?

454
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:57,530
Did you not already predict my answer...

455
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:01,131
before coming here?

456
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:19,450
Eun Soo.

457
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,060
What did Executive Minister Yoo say to you?

458
00:34:29,491 --> 00:34:30,761
It was nothing important.

459
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:45,941
Your Majesty.

460
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,321
Did you come to see what happened to the girl...

461
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,560
you abandoned?

462
00:35:02,461 --> 00:35:05,531
Kang Han Soo paid me a visit,

463
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,970
asking to save Eun Soo.

464
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:13,470
He must have thought only I...

465
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,211
could save that child in the entire nation.

466
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,781
And not the King.

467
00:35:46,841 --> 00:35:47,941
Your Majesty.

468
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,051
I heard you went and begged Executive Minister Yoo.

469
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,231
If you were to beg, you should have done it to me.

470
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,830
The one you should have begged...

471
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,500
and persuaded is me.

472
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:19,200
The answer was already decided, was it not?

473
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:21,011
The verdict...

474
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,711
can change anytime.

475
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,111
Were you not the man...

476
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:32,180
who taught me that?

477
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,560
But...

478
00:36:38,261 --> 00:36:39,421
it is too late now.

479
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:01,180
Come watch the trial tomorrow.

480
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,381
I made a mistake.

481
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:37,821
Despite being friends, I did not fully trust the King.

482
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:44,591
Having become blind at the thought of saving Eun Soo,

483
00:37:46,961 --> 00:37:48,430
I made the wrong move...

484
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,801
of pleading to power,

485
00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:56,231
not to the law.

486
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,020
All because of me.

487
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,790
According to the criminal law,

488
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,131
all adultery...

489
00:38:56,761 --> 00:38:59,160
must be by all means caught in action...

490
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,801
for the crime to be convicted.

491
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:05,040
But Kim Young Jae, Choi Heung Seon, and Lee Geun Woo,

492
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,571
who were arrested for committing adultery with Kang,

493
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,540
were not caught at the scene.

494
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,211
Nor were there any witnesses.

495
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:14,711
They were simply the names in the statement...

496
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:16,781
made by Heo Joong Sik, who was arrested for murder.

497
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,680
It was likely...

498
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:22,620
a false accusation in order to lessen his sins.

499
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,060
Therefore,

500
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,430
Kim Young Jae, Choi Heung Seon,

501
00:39:27,961 --> 00:39:29,631
and Lee Geun Woo cannot be questioned.

502
00:39:31,031 --> 00:39:32,560
Release them all.

503
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:34,370
- Thank you... - Thank you...

504
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,540
- for your boundless generosity. - for your boundless generosity.

505
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,741
Nonetheless,

506
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,111
adultery is an act of secrecy.

507
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,011
There was a precedent where one got punished...

508
00:39:47,111 --> 00:39:49,551
with clear evidence despite not getting caught red-handed.

509
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,080
Those who are found guilty by having the same tattoo...

510
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,450
as the woman,

511
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,850
Jang Myung Ki, Jang Yoon, and Seo Byung Ho...

512
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,220
are to get 100 floggings and be exiled 2,000 Ri away.

513
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,970
Lastly,

514
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,571
a word for Kang.

515
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:20,981
A conjugal relationship is strictly protected...

516
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:22,750
under the three basic bonds.

517
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:24,950
It is not any different from relationships...

518
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,551
between a subject and his King and a parent and their child.

519
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,790
However,

520
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:31,120
Kang has destroyed this basic principle.

521
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:33,591
She must be punished accordingly...

522
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,301
and placed under capital punishment.

523
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,611
If you interfere now, your sister will be brutally killed.

524
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,520
Announce the verdict.

525
00:42:31,511 --> 00:42:32,810
"Kang's crime..."

526
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:39,580
"of committing adultery with many different men..."

527
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:43,961
"is considered a violation..."

528
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,790
"of the Family Law, which prohibits her..."

529
00:42:50,461 --> 00:42:51,731
"from betraying her husband..."

530
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,941
"and running away to be remarried right away."

531
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:09,511
"She is sentenced..."

532
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,890
"to death by hanging."

533
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:20,051
Please help me save Eun Soo.

534
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,761
I will pay you a fortune if that is what you want.

535
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,361
You must be the Princess.

536
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,830
Do you know me?

537
00:45:06,401 --> 00:45:08,301
Right, you worked for Executive Minister Yoo.

538
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:11,270
You must know me as his political opponent.

539
00:45:13,941 --> 00:45:15,671
I know you as someone...

540
00:45:16,571 --> 00:45:18,511
who is cherished by those whom I love.

541
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,211
I've always wanted to know...

542
00:45:23,281 --> 00:45:25,180
what you were like.

543
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,250
And what do you think now that we met?

544
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,861
I wish to be you.

545
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:36,591
If I were you,

546
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:38,830
I could remain...

547
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:42,301
by those whom I love.

548
00:45:43,671 --> 00:45:46,040
I take that as your wish to live.

549
00:45:47,841 --> 00:45:49,071
Is that correct?

550
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,261
I must see His Majesty.

551
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:08,790
This decision was wrongful.

552
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:14,270
Think of how he must have felt as he made the decision...

553
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:15,901
knowing that it is wrong.

554
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:17,941
What a loyal subject you are.

555
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:22,511
Princess Yeon Joo will save Eun Soo.

556
00:46:29,711 --> 00:46:32,051
I will persuade Eun Soo again.

557
00:46:32,651 --> 00:46:36,421
She will be switched out by another dead body.

558
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,821
In that case,

559
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,191
she might get caught.

560
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:42,961
I do not care if the act is caught.

561
00:46:43,361 --> 00:46:45,961
All I need is enough time to let Eun Soo escape.

562
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:49,031
And I will take responsibility for everything.

563
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,250
Do you have any idea what you are saying right now?

564
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,680
Of course.

565
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:06,250
I will be punished severely for helping a felon escape.

566
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,750
I may even get deposed.

567
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,290
(Deposed: Losing one's social status)

568
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,890
I must take things that far...

569
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:14,461
for His Majesty to realize his mistake.

570
00:47:15,231 --> 00:47:16,390
Above all,

571
00:47:18,131 --> 00:47:20,000
I cannot condone...

572
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:22,700
your attempt to pay back everything you did to that family...

573
00:47:23,801 --> 00:47:26,171
over a matter like this one.

574
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,180
You will face a more severe punishment...

575
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:33,680
after this.

576
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,470
Get changed and follow Dong Chi.

577
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:59,040
Nobody will dare to stop the Princess.

578
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:10,580
I cannot make Han Soo...

579
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:15,051
live as a fugitive for life just to save myself.

580
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:20,091
His life was already ruined...

581
00:48:21,261 --> 00:48:23,631
when our father was framed and killed.

582
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,560
I cannot make him live in hiding for the rest of his life.

583
00:48:30,031 --> 00:48:32,470
I will gladly receive the price for my crime,

584
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:35,910
and I received a promise from His Majesty too.

585
00:48:37,011 --> 00:48:39,611
A promise? From His Majesty?

586
00:48:42,511 --> 00:48:43,910
Your Majesty.

587
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,151
A soul that suffered a wrongful death...

588
00:48:47,421 --> 00:48:49,020
wanders around this world...

589
00:48:49,651 --> 00:48:52,060
to harm the living...

590
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,060
or cause natural disasters.

591
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,491
That is why for generations,

592
00:48:57,031 --> 00:49:00,560
kings always paid attention to the chagrin of their people.

593
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,770
Are you threatening me right now?

594
00:49:03,301 --> 00:49:04,941
I mean you are solely in power...

595
00:49:06,241 --> 00:49:08,310
to decide if this virtueless woman...

596
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,171
will pass away...

597
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,741
in spite or not.

598
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,321
So Your Majesty,

599
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,520
please become a strong and benevolent King...

600
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,390
and push out treacherous subjects such as Executive Minister Yoo...

601
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,861
and resolve the deep sorrows of your people...

602
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,191
who suffered because of them.

603
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,870
If you give me that promise,

604
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,370
I will...

605
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,180
gladly go yonder to the other world.

606
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:17,711
I understand your intention.

607
00:50:17,941 --> 00:50:20,180
But I cannot back down this time.

608
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,750
Your parents were wrongfully killed.

609
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,651
If you leave like this,

610
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,790
how will Han Soo...

611
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,131
live the rest of his life?

612
00:50:38,801 --> 00:50:40,261
I will do whatever I can...

613
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:43,031
to protect you and your brother.

614
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,500
Even if it means killing Executive Minister Yoo.

615
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:53,040
Princess Yeon Joo,

616
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,821
you must love my brother from the bottom of your heart.

617
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,250
I get it.

618
00:51:03,051 --> 00:51:06,361
But I have a favour to ask you.

619
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,390
What is it?

620
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:11,160
Please bring something from my house.

621
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:14,100
It is for Han Soo,

622
00:51:15,301 --> 00:51:17,941
so can you deliver it to him?

623
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:20,810
I will not take long.

624
00:51:40,491 --> 00:51:43,631
My men will set fire to the scaffold and in the market...

625
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:46,600
to scatter their forces and cause confusion.

626
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:49,370
Dong Chi and Chu Sal will subdue the executioner in the meantime,

627
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,970
and I will rescue Eun Soo.

628
00:51:52,801 --> 00:51:53,870
Han Soo!

629
00:52:02,611 --> 00:52:04,850
Eun Soo!

630
00:52:05,781 --> 00:52:07,281
No, Eun Soo.

631
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,741
Get a physician! Now!

632
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:37,450
No.

633
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,350
- Han Soo. - Yes?

634
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:41,850
It was great...

635
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,591
to see you again.

636
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:49,961
No, stop speaking.

637
00:52:50,091 --> 00:52:51,361
Don't say anything.

638
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,231
Stop speaking.

639
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:55,830
You look...

640
00:52:59,071 --> 00:53:01,171
so lovely.

641
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:03,941
No, Eun Soo. Stop speaking.

642
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,441
What are you doing? Get a physician!

643
00:53:07,511 --> 00:53:08,781
Okay.

644
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,350
Young Master.

645
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,261
Thank you for everything.

646
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,731
You were there for me...

647
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:30,231
during the hard times,

648
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:34,770
and I could...

649
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:36,810
breathe for once.

650
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,481
No, Eun Soo. Don't go.

651
00:53:49,991 --> 00:53:52,691
Eun Soo. Hang in there.

652
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,671
I leave you this letter for one reason.

653
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,410
It is because...

654
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:13,810
I do not want my death to be another grudge of yours.

655
00:54:17,481 --> 00:54:18,620
Han Soo.

656
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,691
Do you remember...

657
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:26,020
what we said the day before I got married?

658
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,970
What is your dream, Han Soo?

659
00:54:39,941 --> 00:54:42,241
You already know. Being rich.

660
00:54:43,011 --> 00:54:44,040
You?

661
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,140
To live like a human being.

662
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:51,551
What is living like a human being?

663
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,821
You respect your parents, love your siblings,

664
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,421
and be loyal to your king.

665
00:54:57,151 --> 00:54:59,060
Do you mean the Three Bonds in Confucianism?

666
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:02,430
It would be nice to abide by all of them.

667
00:55:03,491 --> 00:55:06,861
But I will keep this one word in my heart.

668
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:09,301
What word?

669
00:55:10,131 --> 00:55:11,171
"Repay."

670
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:15,941
I want to be a person who knows how to repay kindness.

671
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:20,211
That is why I stepped up to marry...

672
00:55:20,211 --> 00:55:21,711
a complete stranger.

673
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,450
The first kindness I want to repay...

674
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,120
is from my parents.

675
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,631
It was the same for Executive Minister Yoo.

676
00:55:38,531 --> 00:55:40,401
I was indebted to him,

677
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,970
so I wanted to repay him.

678
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:44,941
That is why I believed him.

679
00:55:46,671 --> 00:55:48,171
I know that I was foolish.

680
00:55:49,241 --> 00:55:50,711
But Han Soo,

681
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,410
I do not regret it.

682
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:00,421
I merely feel sorry for you.

683
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,071
This is not right.

684
00:56:33,821 --> 00:56:35,120
Eun Soo...

685
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,321
Han Soo.

686
00:57:15,991 --> 00:57:19,361
Do you remember the magnolia tree in our backyard?

687
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,801
We used to say that the flowers in full bloom...

688
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:26,941
looked like the stars in the night sky.

689
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:30,711
They say that you become...

690
00:57:31,711 --> 00:57:33,111
a star when you die.

691
00:57:34,881 --> 00:57:36,511
I will be a magnolia flower instead.

692
00:57:37,611 --> 00:57:39,321
I will blossom like a star every year...

693
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,390
to come and see you.

694
00:57:45,991 --> 00:57:47,591
So, Han Soo,

695
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,830
do not cry for me.

696
00:57:56,231 --> 00:57:59,741
For we will meet every spring.

697
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,481
Han Soo!

698
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,051
There you are.

699
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:12,080
What took you so long? We are all waiting for you.

700
00:58:12,321 --> 00:58:13,921
What are you waiting for? Come on in.

701
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,921
Mom made noodles with anchovy broth, your favourite.

702
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,020
Hurry!

703
00:58:29,401 --> 00:58:30,600
You must be hungry.

704
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,241
Hi, son.

705
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,571
Mom.

706
00:58:36,611 --> 00:58:39,841
Why are there egg garnishes only in his bowl?

707
00:58:40,981 --> 00:58:44,250
Your brother is a poor man. He is still a bachelor.

708
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,020
That is because of his bad temper.

709
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:50,491
No way. Let me have them.

710
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:52,020
All right.

711
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:55,031
You can have mine. Happy?

712
00:58:55,631 --> 00:58:58,031
You are the best, Dad!

713
00:58:58,031 --> 00:58:59,131
Of course.

714
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,600
Han Soo, why are you standing there?

715
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,571
Let us eat already. I am hungry.

716
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:06,241
Come on!

717
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,450
I guess you adored her very much.

718
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,151
Yes.

719
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:08,790
She was very smart and beautiful.

720
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,790
She was obedient too.

721
01:02:15,361 --> 01:02:17,160
Did you not already predict my answer...

722
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,131
before coming here?

723
01:02:21,731 --> 01:02:22,830
Then,

724
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:26,870
you better make a decision yourself...

725
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,171
before your brother acts recklessly.

726
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,881
You left this in my house.

727
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:46,091
Please...

728
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:51,060
comfort her soul so that she can rest in peace.

729
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:21,491
"Kim Young Jae, Choi Heung Seon, and Lee Geun Woo were..."

730
01:03:21,491 --> 01:03:25,830
"all testified to have committed adultery with the same woman."

731
01:03:26,531 --> 01:03:29,901
"But as no evidence could prove it,"

732
01:03:29,901 --> 01:03:32,401
"Kim Young Jae will be reinstated as a minor inspector of Saheonbu,"

733
01:03:32,401 --> 01:03:34,770
"Choi Heung Seon will be reinstated as a section chief of Taxation,"

734
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:36,470
"and Lee Geun Woo will be reinstated..."

735
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:37,640
"as a third minister of Public Works. "

736
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,410
"Fulfill your duties with dedication."

737
01:03:43,281 --> 01:03:45,120
Entrusting a person with a duty...

738
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,651
cannot be done lightly.

739
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,761
And if a person corrects their faults to turn over a new leaf,

740
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,821
they can be trusted again.

741
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,301
If they are abandoned for good due to their small past mistakes,

742
01:03:58,631 --> 01:04:00,560
they will be bound to complain.

743
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,531
Small mistakes?

744
01:04:03,301 --> 01:04:05,571
The woman involved lost her life.

745
01:04:05,571 --> 01:04:06,801
But these men...

746
01:04:07,441 --> 01:04:08,841
can be spared...

747
01:04:08,841 --> 01:04:10,140
and even reinstated?

748
01:04:10,941 --> 01:04:12,781
This is utterly unreasonable.

749
01:04:13,481 --> 01:04:15,111
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

750
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,881
I will not.

751
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:29,450
You were there for me during the hard times,

752
01:05:31,051 --> 01:05:34,620
and I could breathe for once.

753
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:48,000
How come she is not recovering for this long?

754
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,941
No wonder.

755
01:05:54,481 --> 01:05:55,881
It is all my fault.

756
01:05:56,481 --> 01:05:57,651
I...

757
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:02,120
failed to take good care of her.

758
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:06,691
Please...

759
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,591
get through it, Your Highness.

760
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:10,890
Please...

761
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:13,861
get better soon, Your Highness.

762
01:06:18,671 --> 01:06:20,200
All right.

763
01:06:21,241 --> 01:06:24,140
Han Soo, let us eat.

764
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:53,640
Han Soo...

765
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:37,711
Your Highness.

766
01:07:37,711 --> 01:07:41,151
You still have a fever. Rest a little more...

767
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:42,520
I am all right.

768
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:44,120
I should get over it now.

769
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:27,130
Your Highness.

770
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:32,201
An auspicious day is out.

771
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:36,241
Will you...

772
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:39,510
marry me?

773
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:11,710
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

774
01:09:16,111 --> 01:09:17,751
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

775
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:25,121
I am happy to deliver such delightful news.

776
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:27,821
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

777
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:31,460
I know this is not what you want.

778
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,930
But I...

779
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:35,501
truly love Her Highness.

780
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:39,470
It is not your fault to love her.

781
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:44,010
Princess Yeon Joo found out about what happened to Officer Kang.

782
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,010
I believe...

783
01:09:48,481 --> 01:09:50,710
all of you will join me this time again.

784
01:09:50,951 --> 01:09:52,151
Your Highness.

785
01:09:53,081 --> 01:09:54,220
Your Highness.

786
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:55,590
This is for the better.

787
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:57,491
Use me...

788
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:59,520
in any way you can.
