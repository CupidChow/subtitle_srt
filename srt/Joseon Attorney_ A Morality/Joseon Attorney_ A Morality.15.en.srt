2
00:00:28,847 --> 00:00:29,976
Father.

3
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:32,046
Father.

4
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:38,157
Please keep Mom and Eun Soo safe.

5
00:00:38,987 --> 00:00:42,186
Han Soo, I put my trust in you.

6
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:46,697
Father!

7
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:55,437
If anything happens to Father, it is all your fault, Mother.

8
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:33,407
Han Soo!

9
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:38,377
- No! - Let go.

10
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:40,347
Let go of me. Let go!

11
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,047
I deserve to die. Let go!

12
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,217
Let go of me!

13
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,616
I cannot!

14
00:01:45,657 --> 00:01:47,116
If you kill yourself, what about me?

15
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:49,586
How am I supposed to go on?

16
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,056
What about me?

17
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:00,736
It is all your fault!

18
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,937
Even if I said no, you should have forced me!

19
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:06,407
You should have forced me to go!

20
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:09,706
You should have told me...

21
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:13,416
to find out where my only sister was and how she was living her life.

22
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:18,516
You should have nagged me...

23
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:23,786
hundreds and thousands of times to take care of her!

24
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:36,166
That is why...

25
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:38,036
That is why...

26
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:42,976
if anybody should die, it should be me.

27
00:02:44,476 --> 00:02:45,946
Why should you die?

28
00:02:46,516 --> 00:02:47,516
Right?

29
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:03,666
I missed her so much.

30
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:07,597
I did not get a good look at her.

31
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:12,306
The prison was...

32
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:14,677
too dark.

33
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:17,506
I have no idea how Eun Soo...

34
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,847
grew up...

35
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:24,086
and the kind of adult she became.

36
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:26,587
I did not get to see anything.

37
00:03:28,687 --> 00:03:31,187
You saw her, right?

38
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:34,196
I did.

39
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:36,696
I saw her...

40
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:38,136
again and again,

41
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,766
until there was nothing more to see.

42
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:44,067
She was beautiful like a flower...

43
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:46,877
and bright like a star.

44
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:49,976
And her smile was...

45
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:53,976
so dazzling.

46
00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:57,786
- She smiled? - Han Soo.

47
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:01,286
When she smiled,

48
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:03,886
she looked...

49
00:04:06,397 --> 00:04:08,797
just like how she was as a child.

50
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,406
I will get to see her once I die.

51
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:27,346
Goodness.

52
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:30,646
You are one twisted man.

53
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,237
You are...

54
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:51,937
nothing like Executive Minister Yoo.

55
00:04:53,737 --> 00:04:55,107
Both in your vision...

56
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:57,446
and your journey.

57
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:42,326
Your Highness.

58
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:47,057
An auspicious day is out.

59
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:51,766
Will you...

60
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:55,206
marry me?

61
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:09,716
If you simply wish to marry me to defeat my father's power,

62
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,617
this marriage is no longer meaningful in any way.

63
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,026
I have stepped down from my office,

64
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:16,356
and even in the future...

65
00:06:16,357 --> 00:06:17,756
I need a stage.

66
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,627
Our wedding...

67
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:25,636
will turn into an interrogation against Executive Minister Yoo.

68
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:29,037
I will expose every illegal deed, corruption,

69
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,537
and wrongdoings he has committed.

70
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,206
A large crowd will gather for the wedding,

71
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,576
so it will be a perfect stage.

72
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:42,287
Is it all right...

73
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:45,057
if I continue to use you...

74
00:06:45,557 --> 00:06:46,987
until the very end?

75
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:50,127
No.

76
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:55,867
You are no longer using me.

77
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:00,096
I am going to use you instead.

78
00:07:04,406 --> 00:07:05,636
Because I want...

79
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:08,006
this revenge.

80

(Episode 15: The Promise of a Wedding Ceremony)

81
00:07:26,357 --> 00:07:29,826
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

82
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,635
There had been...

83
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:34,867
much troubling news in and out of the palace.

84
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,806
I am greatly pleased to share...

85
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:39,977
such joyous news with you.

86
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:45,617
Everything was made possible thanks to you, Grand Queen Dowager.

87
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:49,417
- Congratulations, Your Highness. - Congratulations, Your Highness.

88
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:55,057
I plan on holding this wedding at a merchant house in Mapo...

89
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:57,687
for all of our people to come and see.

90
00:07:58,127 --> 00:07:59,755
Ministry of Rites shall...

91
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:03,895
prepare everything to a T according to our customs.

92
00:08:03,896 --> 00:08:05,937
Please do not worry.

93
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:10,607
I hope everyone will attend and celebrate with us.

94
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:15,206
- We are honoured by your favour. - We are honoured by your favour.

95
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:39,836
Master Ji Sun is to marry the Princess.

96
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:44,166
Thank you.

97
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:45,407
Thank you.

98
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:46,937
Congratulations.

99
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:50,276
Do not forget. This is a kindness from Executive Minister Yoo.

100
00:08:50,277 --> 00:08:52,276
Of course, we know.

101
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:53,975
He always shows such kindness...

102
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:55,485
whenever something great happens to his son.

103
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:57,116
We are always grateful.

104
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,887
Executive Minister Yoo is here.

105
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:03,757

121
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:07,757
Executive Minister Yoo would not accept the marriage that easily.

122
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:11,126
He has no reason to oppose it.

123
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:14,626
But I cannot be sure what he will do behind my back.

124
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:44,985
You are certainly a master of calligraphy.

125
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:47,297
(December 25)

126
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:58,876
I am aware that this is not what you want.

127
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,606
But I am deeply in love with Princess Yeon Joo.

128
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:07,677
There is nothing wrong with falling in love.

129
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,517
I simply do what I must as your father.

130
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:03,907
Mr. Gourd,

131
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:06,976
do you have a family?

132
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:09,576
Let us have a drink since we are both orphans.

133
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,446
Where is your mouth?

134
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:16,187
I could have died...

135
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,386
because of a gourd once,

136
00:12:19,387 --> 00:12:22,527
so I have hated gourds ever since, but you are not so bad.

137
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:28,326
All right.

138
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:50,017
It was just as you said, my lord.

139
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:53,456
- Bring him to me. - Yes, my lord.

140
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:19,446
(We welcome advance payments.)

141
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:26,216
Let me see. Where should I hide it?

142
00:13:27,716 --> 00:13:30,557
Yes. He will never be able to find it...

143
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:32,626
if I keep it here.

144
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:16,606
Hey!

145
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:20,537
What is this?

146
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:22,677
Get off!

147
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:26,017
Take a look. It looks like a letter.

148
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,276
- Whatever. - Just look.

149
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:30,346
- Get that away from me! - Come on!

150
00:14:32,757 --> 00:14:34,716
How long are you going to keep this up?

151
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:36,626
Why did you even come back?

152
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:38,626
To frustrate me to death?

153
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:40,326
Get a grip, will you?

154
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:43,267
I will! I will get a grip!

155
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:46,236
I will get a grip when I am dead.

156
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:48,596
All right.

157
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:50,637
Fine. Drink more.

158
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:53,576
Go on. Keep drinking.

159
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:56,206
Just keep drinking.

160
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:59,076
That will not be enough to kill you.

161
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:01,317
Here. Drink this.

162
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:02,746
Drink all of them.

163
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:36,647
I am so sick of alcohol.

164
00:15:57,537 --> 00:15:58,736
Gosh.

165
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,346
Dong Chi.

166
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:12,086
Dong Chi!

167
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:16,086
Brother!

168
00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:56,366
(Meet me at Sowongak.)

169
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:06,606
Dong Chi!

170
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:09,507
Dong Chi!

171
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:14,076
Hey.

172
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,146
You are here.

173
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:20,057
That punk.

174
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:26,027
- What... - What happened?

175
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:27,826
What on earth happened?

176
00:17:28,126 --> 00:17:30,095
You are killing me.

177
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:32,396
Calm yourself.

178
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,436
Without you...

179
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:41,136
What will I ever do if I lose you also?

180
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:49,317
My lord!

181
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,207
Everyone.

182
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:54,416
Will you move the load piled up in the backyard?

183
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:56,317
- Yes, my lady. - Yes, my lady.

184
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:58,116
Let us go.

185
00:18:58,586 --> 00:18:59,757
Go along.

186
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:07,126
This was the only way...

187
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:09,797
to get you back up.

188
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:14,037
I had them do it.

189
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:24,247
I missed you.

190
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:29,717
I worried about you.

191
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:46,237
About Eun Soo...

192
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:48,267
So Won.

193
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:51,567
Let us not...

194
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:53,507
talk about it.

195
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:09,057
When will you stop turning a blind eye?

196
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:29,277
Why?

197
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:31,105
Just why did you do it?

198
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,307
Why?

199
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:36,047
Hit me more.

200
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:42,186
It will not make your anger subside.

201
00:20:43,957 --> 00:20:45,957
It will not make Eun Soo come back to life,

202
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:54,636
but only then, I will be able to breathe.

203
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:02,807
I am sorry, Kang Han Soo.

204
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:05,817
I know it is shameless even to apologize,

205
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:10,116
but I am sorry.

206
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,487
Eun Soo meant...

207
00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:21,997
so much to me too.

208
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,646
Where are you going?

209
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:19,557
I have a lot of work to do.

210
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,186
We used the wedding as an excuse to leave the palace.

211
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:24,487
I need something to report...

212
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:26,257
so that the Grand Queen Dowager does not suspect.

213
00:22:27,697 --> 00:22:28,926
Wait.

214
00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:30,366
So?

215
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:33,197
What do you mean, so?

216
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:36,707
I will go out to the market and buy chestnuts, jujubes,

217
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:39,636
blue and red threads, and others for the wedding table.

218
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:42,646
Goodness, wait.

219
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:45,346
Then,

220
00:22:50,317 --> 00:22:52,386
you might need someone to carry all those.

221
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:00,356
I will consider that as a yes.

222
00:23:01,027 --> 00:23:02,226
All right.

223
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:03,426
Let us go.

224
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,507
Have you been well?

225
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:20,016
Hello.

226
00:23:20,017 --> 00:23:21,076
Take a look.

227
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:31,757
How is the business these days?

228
00:23:31,856 --> 00:23:33,426
- It is going all right. - Let me...

229
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:35,797
- Come. - No, wait...

230
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:38,027
Lady Hong.

231
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:40,866
These shoes will take you anywhere you want...

232
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,136
and help you go over any kinds of humps.

233
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,007
What was next?

234
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:48,737
Well...

235
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:50,606
I will come again next time.

236
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:57,247
All right.

237
00:23:57,487 --> 00:23:58,616
Ta-Da.

238
00:23:58,686 --> 00:23:59,816
Ta-Da.

239
00:23:59,817 --> 00:24:01,017
Honk-honk.

240
00:24:05,156 --> 00:24:06,596
How pretty.

241
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:08,626
How much are these?

242
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:09,967
Three nyang, my lady.

243
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:19,007
- Here. - Thank you.

244
00:24:21,636 --> 00:24:22,947
I am touched.

245
00:24:23,906 --> 00:24:25,207
They are for you.

246
00:24:30,447 --> 00:24:31,616
She is my lady.

247
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:56,507
I will protect you...

248
00:25:56,606 --> 00:25:58,067
so that you can live...

249
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:01,906
an ordinary life in a safe place...

250
00:26:02,576 --> 00:26:03,906
like other people.

251
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:35,636
Eun Soo found out before she died.

252
00:26:37,747 --> 00:26:38,977
What?

253
00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:44,747
That I am deeply in love with you.

254
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:48,156
So,

255
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:50,227
she must have died in peace.

256
00:27:06,936 --> 00:27:09,447
Mother, Father. Do you see this?

257
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:11,406
Eun Soo, do you see it?

258
00:27:13,247 --> 00:27:14,416
What are you doing?

259
00:27:14,547 --> 00:27:15,876
Stay still.

260
00:27:19,317 --> 00:27:20,456
Here.

261
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:23,186
I will hold his hand tightly...

262
00:27:23,356 --> 00:27:25,757
and stay by his side until the day I die.

263
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:28,426
So do not worry about a thing...

264
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,727
and rest in peace.

265
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:27,057
Thank you.

266
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:29,386
Here, dig in.

267
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:32,757
Have the Sujeonggwa topped with pine nuts.

268
00:28:32,856 --> 00:28:35,426
There are three in each. Okay?

269
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:43,807
Me too.

270
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:51,507
Wait for me.

271
00:28:57,047 --> 00:29:00,017
So what is your plan?

272
00:29:13,237 --> 00:29:15,366
We have been investigating Lord Chu's case in secret.

273
00:29:15,936 --> 00:29:17,166
Testify you witnessed...

274
00:29:17,237 --> 00:29:20,507
Executive Minister Yoo killing Lord Chu at the wedding,

275
00:29:20,906 --> 00:29:23,207
and we will not have you pay for framing Kang Han Soo.

276
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:24,846
Your help is needed.

277
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:29,646
Everyone from the King to the vassals will be all there.

278
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:31,987
It is the best interrogation hall, is it not?

279
00:29:39,557 --> 00:29:42,126
If Kang Han Soo asks, I will think about it.

280
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:46,497
I have a lot of scores to settle with him.

281
00:29:52,866 --> 00:29:55,636
Master Cho knew I went into hiding and worked his brains.

282
00:29:55,906 --> 00:29:58,747
He used me as an excuse to get out of the situation.

283
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:02,146
Chu Sal is keeping an eye on Master Cho, just in case.

284
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:04,547
If something happens, he will let me know at once.

285
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:07,717
Meeting him in person will help me figure out his sincerity.

286
00:30:10,027 --> 00:30:11,386
Anyway, you two.

287
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:14,957
How very daring.

288
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:17,266
To think of exposing the evil deeds of your father...

289
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:19,797
and your future father-in-law on your wedding day.

290
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:24,105
People could point fingers at you for being a reprobate son.

291
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:25,467
Are you not scared?

292
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:27,636
And So...

293
00:30:29,176 --> 00:30:30,207
Her High...

294
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:34,277
Princess So Won?

295
00:30:34,717 --> 00:30:36,616
The dignity and honour...

296
00:30:36,787 --> 00:30:38,885
this person thinks highly of...

297
00:30:38,886 --> 00:30:40,416
could be brought to disgrace.

298
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:42,287
Do not worry about the Royal Family.

299
00:30:42,886 --> 00:30:46,086
The King and Grand Queen Dowager will even hold a funeral...

300
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:48,027
if that is what it will take...

301
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:51,626
to weaken Executive Minister Yoo's power which they could not.

302
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:56,866
We must bear the consequences.

303
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:02,136
That is it?

304
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:07,277
As Her Highness has decided for the Royal Family,

305
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,916
I, too, have for my family.

306
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:15,557
So that Father does not make any more mistakes,

307
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:17,326
stopping him...

308
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:20,527
is the best I can do.

309
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:25,697
Well...

310
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:30,366
With this much support, it sure will succeed this time.

311
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:42,916
So Won. It is best for you to go to the palace first.

312
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,146
Leaving the palace for far too long will raise suspicions.

313
00:31:46,717 --> 00:31:48,386
Are you not meeting Master Cho?

314
00:31:48,686 --> 00:31:49,856
The two of us are enough.

315
00:31:50,186 --> 00:31:51,456
Let me join.

316
00:31:51,457 --> 00:31:55,027
No. That will only make Executive Minister Yoo aware.

317
00:31:57,396 --> 00:31:58,467
Let us go.

318
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,676
Be careful on your way.

319
00:32:53,886 --> 00:32:55,156
Can you not wait for me?

320
00:33:00,957 --> 00:33:01,957
What?

321
00:33:05,626 --> 00:33:08,896
Good grief. What on earth happened here?

322
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:14,606
Die!

323
00:33:16,507 --> 00:33:17,547
Darn it.

324
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,176
Stop!

325
00:33:25,886 --> 00:33:27,257
What?

326
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:30,727
Hey.

327
00:33:33,126 --> 00:33:34,656
- You little... - Gosh.

328
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:38,197
Give me a minute. That wore me out.

329
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:40,666
- What happened? - Where is Master Cho?

330
00:33:41,037 --> 00:33:42,967
I have no idea what went on.

331
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:45,267
Some men suddenly barged in...

332
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,237
and dragged Master Cho away.

333
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:49,176
What?

334
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:12,967
Good grief.

335
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,226
Please help me!

336
00:34:45,327 --> 00:34:48,436
Help me! Is anyone out there?

337
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:50,936
I need help!

338
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:21,266
I can see something over there!

339
00:35:22,766 --> 00:35:24,507
- Gosh. - Darn it.

340
00:35:31,577 --> 00:35:32,677
Master Cho!

341
00:35:34,376 --> 00:35:36,916
Chu Sal and Attorney Kang?

342
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:39,686
Duck down.

343
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:45,726
This is exhausting.

344
00:35:46,356 --> 00:35:47,657
Duck down!

345
00:36:00,137 --> 00:36:01,137
My gosh.

346
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:05,646
Dong Chi!

347
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:07,177
Hurry.

348
00:36:09,177 --> 00:36:10,286
Dong Chi!

349
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:12,487
Dong Chi! Wake up!

350
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:15,055
Hey!

351
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:16,856
Wake up! Come to your senses!

352
00:36:22,257 --> 00:36:24,766
- Wake up! - Han Soo!

353
00:36:25,297 --> 00:36:27,367
- Han Soo. - Hey!

354
00:36:28,797 --> 00:36:30,766
Han Soo!

355
00:36:43,146 --> 00:36:44,717
We should shorten it.

356
00:36:46,146 --> 00:36:48,786
Do not bother. There is no need to work on useless things.

357
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,555
How is it useless?

358
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:52,226
It is your one and only wedding.

359
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:54,097
Later.

360
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:58,666
- Your Highness. - Come in.

361
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:07,036
Executive Minister Yoo is here.

362
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:08,577
What?

363
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:38,507
Do you wish to let him live?

364
00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:09,367
Attorney Kang!

365
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:10,907
Hello.

366
00:38:15,206 --> 00:38:16,376
Goodness.

367
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:25,786
What happened?

368
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:28,286
I thought I would never see you again.

369
00:38:41,197 --> 00:38:42,467
What happened to him?

370
00:38:50,106 --> 00:38:51,376
Well...

371
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:53,306
Look!

372
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:56,277
Han Soo!

373
00:39:09,996 --> 00:39:11,226
Are you all right?

374
00:39:11,597 --> 00:39:12,867
Well, so far.

375
00:39:12,996 --> 00:39:14,036
Let us go, Dong Chi.

376
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:16,806
Hurry up.

377
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:37,126
One moment.

378
00:39:37,257 --> 00:39:39,456
Please stop. One moment.

379
00:39:39,856 --> 00:39:41,126
One moment.

380
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:42,796
- I am too tired. - I am dying.

381
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,027
I am too tired. I cannot do this.

382
00:39:45,297 --> 00:39:47,666
I am too tired. I cannot do this.

383
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:49,336
I am too tired.

384
00:39:50,336 --> 00:39:51,436
I am dying.

385
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,706
Darn it.

386
00:39:56,947 --> 00:39:58,406
- Darn it. - Goodness.

387
00:39:58,407 --> 00:39:59,947
They are driving me insane.

388
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:01,947
Who send you here?

389
00:40:04,347 --> 00:40:06,786
You did not just ask that, hoping for an answer, right?

390
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:13,027
Did you just talk down to me?

391
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:15,096
They are about to chop our heads off.

392
00:40:15,097 --> 00:40:17,027
Why do you care if I got a little casual with you?

393
00:40:19,396 --> 00:40:21,637
What are you two doing?

394
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:26,907
Now.

395
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:39,047
Follow them.

396
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:56,797
Let us go.

397
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:05,145
They are gone.

398
00:41:05,146 --> 00:41:06,577
They left.

399
00:41:13,186 --> 00:41:14,356
Let us go.

400
00:41:14,387 --> 00:41:15,516
Goodness, to where?

401
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:17,356
To save Yoo Ji Sun.

402
00:41:18,487 --> 00:41:19,725
You are coming out too.

403
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:21,027
Are you serious?

404
00:41:38,077 --> 00:41:40,047
Goodness, I almost wet my pants.

405
00:41:42,347 --> 00:41:44,047
Magistrate Yoo.

406
00:41:45,617 --> 00:41:46,887
Are you all right?

407
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:09,407
Han Soo. Hey.

408
00:42:10,306 --> 00:42:11,507
Magistrate Yoo.

409
00:42:16,376 --> 00:42:17,586
I am all right.

410
00:42:18,217 --> 00:42:19,987
You are not all right.

411
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,456
The poison has spread a lot. Let me take you to a dispensary.

412
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:29,126
This is great.

413
00:42:29,896 --> 00:42:31,097
Make use of me...

414
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,166
somehow.

415
00:42:44,847 --> 00:42:46,106
I brought an antidote.

416
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:50,487
Is that so? Why did you bring this?

417
00:42:50,547 --> 00:42:52,447
Executive Minister Yoo came.

418
00:42:53,956 --> 00:42:56,157
He tried to lure me saying you were afflicted...

419
00:42:56,317 --> 00:42:58,686
in an attempt to stop me from attending the wedding.

420
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:13,237
Move back.

421
00:43:31,686 --> 00:43:33,027
What now?

422
00:43:34,126 --> 00:43:36,126
He told me to make use of him, so I should do that.

423
00:43:39,126 --> 00:43:40,535
- Dong Chi. - Yes?

424
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:42,336
I am coming in.

425
00:43:50,706 --> 00:43:54,016
This is the letter my father sent to the former King.

426
00:43:54,947 --> 00:43:56,277
The one you lost.

427
00:43:58,186 --> 00:43:59,947
This is the last present...

428
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:02,987
Eun Soo left for us.

429
00:44:11,896 --> 00:44:13,367
I, Kang Eon Jik,

430
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:16,536
dare to plead His Majesty.

431
00:44:18,036 --> 00:44:19,466
We have established laws,

432
00:44:19,467 --> 00:44:21,777
but there are those who live above them.

433
00:44:22,177 --> 00:44:26,806
They are the members of Hungu who currently lead the Royal Court.

434
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:29,916
Please turn over a new leaf...

435
00:44:30,987 --> 00:44:35,617
and put an end to the politics of conflicts between factions.

436
00:44:38,327 --> 00:44:39,987
So this was what he said.

437
00:44:48,766 --> 00:44:51,836
Is this enough to take down Executive Minister Yoo?

438
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:53,606
Probably.

439
00:44:54,706 --> 00:44:56,336
Did you not catch something out of the ordinary?

440
00:44:57,746 --> 00:44:59,007
Out of the ordinary?

441
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:00,146
Yes.

442
00:45:18,197 --> 00:45:19,297
You found it.

443
00:45:24,106 --> 00:45:25,166
I plan...

444
00:45:26,806 --> 00:45:28,137
on using that.

445
00:45:45,487 --> 00:45:46,786
Who is there?

446
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:17,626
Princess Yeon Joo found out about Officer Kang.

447
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:26,427
I have faith that everyone will unite once again.

448
00:47:24,757 --> 00:47:26,387
He is getting changed, my lord.

449
00:47:26,456 --> 00:47:28,556
I will bring him on time.

450
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:14,336
(Sowongak)

451
00:48:38,027 --> 00:48:39,896
I cannot wait.

452
00:48:50,947 --> 00:48:53,206
Have you received it?

453
00:48:56,117 --> 00:48:57,277
I have received it also.

454
00:48:58,047 --> 00:48:59,947
I cannot imagine what he is up to.

455
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:20,007
(Sowongak)

456
00:49:28,746 --> 00:49:31,086
We have been listening to the same music for hours.

457
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:33,016
I know, right?

458
00:49:33,586 --> 00:49:36,016
The wedding should have begun a long time ago.

459
00:50:00,347 --> 00:50:02,376
Aside from the bride,

460
00:50:02,646 --> 00:50:04,786
we do not even see the groom.

461
00:50:11,726 --> 00:50:13,527
Go and...

462
00:50:19,896 --> 00:50:21,097
Executive Minister Yoo.

463
00:50:22,597 --> 00:50:26,036
I am afraid that I must...

464
00:50:27,976 --> 00:50:29,976
Princess Yeon Joo is coming out.

465
00:51:33,306 --> 00:51:34,336
Princess!

466
00:51:35,376 --> 00:51:36,407
Princess.

467
00:51:38,376 --> 00:51:39,447
Princess!

468
00:51:40,007 --> 00:51:41,016
Yeon Joo!

469
00:51:41,947 --> 00:51:44,317
- Princess. - Princess Yeon Joo.

470
00:51:55,626 --> 00:51:56,927
The physician is here.

471
00:51:58,766 --> 00:52:00,527
Send him in, and keep everyone else out.

472
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:02,797
The princess needs absolute rest.

473
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:04,567
Yes, my lady.

474
00:52:04,737 --> 00:52:05,766
You may go in.

475
00:52:44,777 --> 00:52:46,646
I have...

476
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,516
committed a mortal sin!

477
00:52:57,387 --> 00:52:59,786
Princess Yeon Joo is currently...

478
00:53:00,286 --> 00:53:03,226
unconscious due to poison.

479
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,626
What?

480
00:53:08,697 --> 00:53:11,137
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

481
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:13,766
The criminal...

482
00:53:14,706 --> 00:53:16,936
who aims to hurt the princess is among us,

483
00:53:18,047 --> 00:53:20,306
so please apprehend them to unveil the truth...

484
00:53:21,376 --> 00:53:23,376
and punish them!

485
00:53:31,056 --> 00:53:33,927
What are you talking about? The perpetrator is among us?

486
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:03,086
- Spare us, Your Majesty! - Spare us, Your Majesty!

487
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:11,496
I do not know anything!

488
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:13,927
It was not us, Your Majesty.

489
00:54:14,327 --> 00:54:15,697
It was not you?

490
00:54:17,336 --> 00:54:19,067
Does that mean you know who did it?

491
00:54:25,407 --> 00:54:26,777
Speak to me!

492
00:54:28,617 --> 00:54:30,347
Who is the perpetrator?

493
00:55:05,786 --> 00:55:09,086
Princess Yeon Joo found out about Officer Kang.

494
00:55:10,786 --> 00:55:14,726
I have faith that everyone will unite once again.

495
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,217
The perpetrator is...

496
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:43,016
Executive Minister Yoo.

497
00:56:13,347 --> 00:56:15,416
It will be the same stage. However,

498
00:56:18,427 --> 00:56:21,297
Executive Minister Yoo will have a different charge.

499
00:56:22,726 --> 00:56:26,097
Executive Minister Yoo and the officials here...

500
00:56:26,996 --> 00:56:29,036
attempted to murder the Princess.

501
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:37,847
Is that true?

502
00:56:38,547 --> 00:56:41,277
It is true I received such a letter from Executive Minister Yoo.

503
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:44,375
But I did not comply.

504
00:56:44,376 --> 00:56:46,717
I did not either.

505
00:57:10,706 --> 00:57:11,947
Why did Executive Minister Yoo...

506
00:57:12,407 --> 00:57:14,777
send this letter to you?

507
00:57:15,376 --> 00:57:18,047
Well, the thing is...

508
00:57:23,257 --> 00:57:24,456
Because around ten years ago,

509
00:57:26,226 --> 00:57:28,556
we joined in the conspiracy to get rid of Officer Kang...

510
00:57:29,257 --> 00:57:30,697
and took part in excluding clauses unfavourable...

511
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:35,097
to Executive Minister Yoo and us when "Book of the Law" was made.

512
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:39,706
And when the former King suddenly passed away,

513
00:57:39,967 --> 00:57:41,677
he even brought up treason...

514
00:57:41,907 --> 00:57:44,237
and held us responsible.

515
00:57:44,606 --> 00:57:45,805
That is right.

516
00:57:45,806 --> 00:57:47,645
Since that day,

517
00:57:47,646 --> 00:57:50,317
we had no choice but to follow his orders.

518
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,447
This is a lie, Your Majesty.

519
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,987
No.

520
00:57:58,387 --> 00:57:59,827
It is the truth.

521
00:58:03,297 --> 00:58:05,566
Let me submit the letter from my father,

522
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,796
who was an officer at that time, sent to the former King...

523
00:58:07,797 --> 00:58:09,766
as evidence.

524
00:58:22,976 --> 00:58:24,686
Please look at the end of the letter.

525
00:58:24,987 --> 00:58:27,046
Executive Minister Yoo wrote the sentence himself.

526
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:30,016
(Punishment given by the government office)

527
00:58:32,827 --> 00:58:34,157
"Exterminate the source of trouble."

528
00:58:36,157 --> 00:58:37,967
He wanted to cut off the source of trouble.

529
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:39,726
That is right.

530
00:58:40,496 --> 00:58:43,396
My father wanted to make bills that the Hungu would not like,

531
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:46,206
such as banning nepotism...

532
00:58:46,737 --> 00:58:49,577
and restricting special favours for officials.

533
00:58:50,606 --> 00:58:52,277
When Executive Minister Yoo found out about this,

534
00:58:52,646 --> 00:58:54,476
he brought a false charge against my father...

535
00:58:55,516 --> 00:58:57,277
and got him killed.

536
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,616
Along with the officials here,

537
00:59:01,617 --> 00:59:04,085
Park Jae Soo, Chu Young Woo, Im Sang Ho, and others...

538
00:59:04,086 --> 00:59:05,626
carried out his intentions.

539
00:59:05,927 --> 00:59:07,157
This is...

540
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:11,297
how Executive Minister Yoo eliminated...

541
00:59:11,797 --> 00:59:13,567
those who went against him.

542
00:59:14,396 --> 00:59:16,936
He is slandering me, Your Majesty.

543
00:59:17,867 --> 00:59:19,806
If his words are true,

544
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:22,376
there is one more person here...

545
00:59:23,177 --> 00:59:27,806
who is as guilty as me.

546
00:59:31,686 --> 00:59:34,016
The signature at the very end of the letter.

547
00:59:38,186 --> 00:59:39,256
Is that not...

548
00:59:39,257 --> 00:59:43,527
the childhood name of the Grand Queen Dowager?

549
00:59:44,226 --> 00:59:45,927
Without any proper evidence,

550
00:59:46,097 --> 00:59:47,996
are you going to believe what someone like him claims...

551
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:51,237
and continue this ridiculous interrogation?

552
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:23,367
It is all true.

553
01:00:25,106 --> 01:00:26,336
Grandmother.

554
01:00:35,016 --> 01:00:36,146
Executive Minister Yoo...

555
01:00:37,777 --> 01:00:39,847
showed me Officer Kang's letter...

556
01:00:40,686 --> 01:00:42,617
and suggested we get rid of him.

557
01:00:43,717 --> 01:00:45,056
I gave him my consent.

558
01:00:47,786 --> 01:00:48,956
At that time,

559
01:00:50,797 --> 01:00:52,027
I believed...

560
01:00:52,597 --> 01:00:54,496
it was to maintain the Royal Family...

561
01:00:54,626 --> 01:00:57,237
and bring peace to the Royal Court.

562
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:02,007
I needed to stop another bloodshed in the palace.

563
01:01:06,047 --> 01:01:08,646
But he is using the same method again.

564
01:01:09,277 --> 01:01:11,117
How dare he attempt...

565
01:01:12,686 --> 01:01:15,387
to murder the Princess, my granddaughter?

566
01:01:15,556 --> 01:01:17,116
Your Highness.

567
01:01:17,117 --> 01:01:20,286
This is Kang Han Soo's trap.

568
01:01:25,197 --> 01:01:26,665
Then how would you explain...

569
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:28,967
that this letter and the sentence have the same handwriting?

570
01:01:29,137 --> 01:01:30,566
Just because they have the same handwriting,

571
01:01:30,567 --> 01:01:32,706
it does not mean they were written by me.

572
01:01:33,407 --> 01:01:35,336
If it were not Executive Minister Yoo,

573
01:01:39,507 --> 01:01:40,706
it would be...

574
01:01:41,106 --> 01:01:42,246
Magistrate Yoo.

575
01:01:46,586 --> 01:01:47,786
Magistrate Yoo Ji Sun?

576
01:01:53,086 --> 01:01:54,226
That is right.

577
01:01:55,027 --> 01:01:58,266
I have seen hundreds of sentencing written by him.

578
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:01,496
Usually, when it comes to calligraphy,

579
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:04,637
one writes the last stroke of a character inward.

580
01:02:04,737 --> 01:02:06,507
But Magistrate Yoo...

581
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:08,936
writes it outward,

582
01:02:09,007 --> 01:02:13,106
leaving a trace on the paper.

583
01:02:16,677 --> 01:02:17,847
Are you saying...

584
01:02:19,286 --> 01:02:21,146
the father and son have the same handwriting?

585
01:02:53,516 --> 01:02:54,746
That is right.

586
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:10,396
So this letter was written...

587
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:14,007
by either Executive Minister Yoo or Yoo Ji Sun.

588
01:03:16,737 --> 01:03:18,277
How dare you...

589
01:03:19,047 --> 01:03:20,706
use my son...

590
01:03:22,047 --> 01:03:23,947
to trap me?

591
01:03:35,927 --> 01:03:38,097
That is your expertise, no?

592
01:03:40,396 --> 01:03:41,766
What will you do?

593
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:45,766
Will you give in and come clean?

594
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:47,007
Or...

595
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,737
will you put all the blame on your son?

596
01:03:51,976 --> 01:03:53,407
How dare you...

597
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:57,806
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

598
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:05,186
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

599
01:05:06,117 --> 01:05:07,317
Executive Minister Yoo...

600
01:05:07,646 --> 01:05:09,617
will not fall for fake acting.

601
01:05:11,217 --> 01:05:13,056
Somebody...

602
01:05:13,086 --> 01:05:15,996
has to take the real risk.

603
01:05:17,157 --> 01:05:19,027
You were wrong, Father.

604
01:05:19,726 --> 01:05:20,827
Thus,

605
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:24,536
I found and did what I could do.

606
01:05:26,336 --> 01:05:27,606
Let me decide...

607
01:05:28,476 --> 01:05:31,036
on how Executive Minister Yoo should be punished.

608
01:05:33,376 --> 01:05:35,317
Make a decision, Your Majesty.

609
01:05:38,686 --> 01:05:39,817
Hear me!

610
01:05:40,916 --> 01:05:42,416
Arrest Executive Minister Yoo.
