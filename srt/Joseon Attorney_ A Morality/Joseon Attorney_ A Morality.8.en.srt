2
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:07,910
Attorney Kang!

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,320
Go without me. Now.

4
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,209
Move out of here. Now!

(Sowongak)

6
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,709
Attorney Kang!

7
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,480
Father!

8
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:30,550
You have finally lost your mind.

9
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:32,219
Have you forgotten?

10
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,559
The local magistrate of a village is...

11
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:38,059
the father figure for all of its people.

12
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,899
Seven years ago, I was your son, a local resident.

13
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,830
All of Cheongsan trusted and followed you.

14
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:53,939
But what have you done to my father and my family?

15
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,950
On top of that, I could not even report you.

16
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:01,749
If a villager accused the magistrate of doing something,

17
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,920
the villager got punished instead according to the law...

18
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:07,050
which prohibited one from accusing such officers.

19
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:12,159
So?

20
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,100
Do you wish to bring it up again and file a lawsuit?

21
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,709
I will teach you.

22
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,839
What?

23
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,480
I will teach you how the real court of laws is operated,

24
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:36,279
how to live as a real magistrate,

25
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,679
and how to live...

26
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,890
as a true father.

27
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,399
You failed as a local magistrate and as a father.

28
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,059
How dare you!

29
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:52,670
Do you really want to die?

30
00:03:57,499 --> 00:03:58,739
But you failed to kill me.

31
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,120
Do you not get it?

32
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,990
I am here to reply to your warning.

33
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:28,539
Kang Han Soo!

34
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,940
Yes, I am Kang Han Soo.

35
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,979
Kang Han Soo, the best attorney in Joseon...

36
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:38,109
who has never lost a case.

37
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:39,250
And...

38
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,580
the son of Officer Kang whom you killed seven years ago.

39
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,430
So look forward to it.

40
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:02,969
Consider this a hat I am throwing into the ring.

41
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,870
War has begun.

Han Soo!

- Han Soo! - Attorney Kang!

47
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:41,539
Master Cho!

48
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,440
What were you doing out there?

49
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:46,979
Please calm down, my lord.

50
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:49,080
Kang Han Soo, that little...

51
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
My lord!

52
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:52,890
Please do not risk showing yourself...

53
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,820
by making a rash move.

54
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,130
What if this ends up reaching Executive Minister Yoo's ears?

55
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,959
Then what?

56
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:04,969
We should find a way that will not draw attention.

57
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,909
Darn it!

58
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:02,060
Attorney Kang.

59
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:03,620
Are you all right?

60
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,459
I am sorry.

61
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,200
I should not have woken up so fast.

62
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:11,060
Anyway, you can go ahead and do the rest.

63
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,399
Stripping me, touching me, patting me, and everything.

64
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,570
Do you think you have ten lives?

65
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,240
Why do you continue to do these crazy things?

66
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:23,909
This is the third time you collapsed in my arms.

67
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:27,779
Right?

68
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,580
It...

69
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,719
It happened only three times in my life,

70
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,089
and you were always there.

71
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,200
I guess I trust you that much.

72
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,219
Are you hurt?

73
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,419
- Pardon? - Right here.

74
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,589
- Right. - Are you?

75
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,359
Anywhere else? What about the fall?

76
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,760
How are your knees?

77
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,330
You should have spared yourself and stayed behind me. Why...

78
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:18,330
If I had, we would both be dead by now.

79
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:24,600
Even so, do not jump in so recklessly from now on.

80
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:27,309
I will recover in a few days when I get hurt,

81
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:28,510
but when you get hurt...

82
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,210
I will never recover.

83
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,710
It will always linger in my heart...

84
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,980
with guilt.

85
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,760
I will never lose another dear one in injustice.

86
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,860
That is why I am determined to fight until death.

87
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,130
And when this fight is over,

88
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,939
I want to live an ordinary life like everyone else,

89
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,340
doing what everyone else does.

90
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:06,449
Doing what everyone else does?

91
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,549
Yes, well, you know.

92
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:10,579
Such things.

93
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,090
Well...

94
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,390
Like getting married.

95
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,429
And when I am married,

96
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,360
I will have children too.

97
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,529
And...

98
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:27,199
something like this.

99
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,480
I am asking you...

100
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,350
to marry me.

101
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,990
My lord.

102
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,220
So,

103
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,100
will you wait for me?

104
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,539
I also...

105
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:09,439
have something to confess.

106
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,189
I will tell you...

107
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,819
when this case is solved.

108
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,960
So,

109
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,559
will you wait for me?

110
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,429
Yes. I would love to.

111
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:37,770
I wait for you, and you wait for me.

112
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,510
We will wait for each other.

113
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:53,390
(Bar)

114
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:08,299
You let Kang Han Soo investigate Lord Chu's case?

115
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,970
Yes.

116
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,210
For what?

117
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:17,610
He came to me and asked to meet you.

118
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:19,880
Instead of giving him an answer,

119
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,179
I bought us some time by giving him the case.

120
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:24,319
So, it was for me?

121
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,189
And to satisfy my curiosity.

122
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:30,689
Are you not curious?

123
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,159
Were all his achievements a coincidence?

124
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,799
Or was it part of revenge?

125
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,399
Or do you already have the answer?

126
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,529
Whatever he is trying to do,

127
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,169
I do not care, even if that is revenge.

128
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,980
Starting now, as So Won,

129
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,149
I will only focus on protecting him.

130
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,260
When are you going to tell Han Soo?

131
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,529
Not now.

132
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,899
When I hastily tell him the truth,

133
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,069
it is obvious how he will lose his temper.

134
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,779
So I need to be discreet.

135
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,760
If you stand up against my father,

136
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,590
it means you also stand up against all of Joseon.

137
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,100
From now on,

138
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,939
we will have to stand against all of Joseon.

139
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,740
I have decided to protect Han Soo,

140
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:55,939
and nothing can stop me.

141
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,350
If I must lie about who I am, I will do so.

142
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,250
If I must be the villain, I will gladly be one.

143
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:10,220
So, that is why you asked to meet me first.

144
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,860
For you might need...

145
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,899
my help to protect him.

146
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,770
But that is not all.

147
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,140
I believed that you were...

148
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,770
perhaps a man to take justice's side, not your own family.

149
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,309
Well, then.

150
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,409
How did you hurt your face?

151
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:38,949
It was nothing.

152
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,529
(Sowongak)

153
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,329
Goodness. How are you smiling right now?

154
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,439
You stirred up trouble in Lord Chu's heart.

155
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,069
I did.

156
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,439
He will not just sit still.

157
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,439
Do you have a plan?

158
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,949
Well...

159
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,350
I will help.

160
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,020
Before he makes his first move,

161
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,350
we will take him down.

162
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:48,020
Am I wrong?

163
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:51,159
That is right!

164
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,460
What if you get hurt?

165
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,600
Stop. It might come true.

166
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,029
We drove away the devils, so it will be smooth sailing.

167
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,929
Of course.

168
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,970
Look, Dong Chi.

169
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,569
We have so many people on our side. What are you worried about?

170
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,179
We will win at all costs.

171
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:17,949
(Wolharu)

172
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,329
What do you mean, "We are not allowed?"

173
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:27,260
It is the afternoon, and all the rooms are vacant.

174
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,960
How could you refuse guests?

175
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,829
My apologies, my lord.

176
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,569
We have special guests today.

177
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:34,699
Goodness.

178
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,000
Listen. Let us just go.

179
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:40,010
It is not like we always hung out at such a place.

180
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,980
There is a bar that I know near the southern gate.

181
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,809
- Let us go to the bar. - All right.

182
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:48,149
This is a shame. It is such a nice day.

183
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:50,620
They do not even have courtesans. The drinks will be bad.

184
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,649
The one with the fancy robe...

185
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,949
is the new commissioner.

186
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,390
They must have come here...

187
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,360
to celebrate by themselves.

188
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:01,990
Goodness.

189
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:04,730
You must be proud.

190
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,429
A member of your Sarim was appointed for an important post.

191
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,140
(Sarim: A group of officials who are up against Hungu)

192
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,039
I had taken the executive minister's side ages ago.

193
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,710
Yet, you still talk about where I am from.

194
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,840
But it is your original root.

195
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:21,480
How about you have it out with His Majesty?

196
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,890
That is not happening.

197
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,960
Six of eight provinces of Joseon...

198
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,429
still believe in Sarim.

199
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,899
If there is an internal conflict,

200
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,270
they will be after Hanyang.

201
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:42,399
They do not want money or power,

202
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,409
and they only believe in the words of the saints...

203
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,039
in the books and think it is fair to follow them.

204
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,579
If Joseon comes to an end,

205
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:57,549
the cause will be the obstinate Sarim.

206
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,319
There are more people of those in the Royal Court.

207
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:02,490
Goodness.

208
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,930
Strictly speaking, this is all because of that attorney.

209
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,329
I had no idea that one attorney could disturb everyone.

210
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,430
So, stay on your toes for a while.

211
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,869
Do not let anything happen to get the public's disapproval.

212
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,180
It will be okay. Go on.

213
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,950
(Gyeonggi Provincial Office)

214
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,240
Why have you still not gotten his confession?

215
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:53,210
Those who have nothing to lose...

216
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,609
normally cannot stand unfairness.

217
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,339
And he even has an attorney.

218
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:00,510
What are you going to do now?

219
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:01,980
An attorney?

220
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,119
You must hurry.

221
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,420
We must close the case before the executive minister...

222
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,119
finds out about this.

223
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,490
Whether it is a deal or blackmail,

224
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,389
get his confession, no matter what.

225
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:15,859
Yes, my lord.

226
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,869
If Attorney Kang manages to file a lawsuit,

227
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,170
it will be very difficult.

228
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,279
What took you so long?

229
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,750
I waited for so long.

230
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,990
I could not visit often.

231
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,200
I have to cook your meal,

232
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:52,170
food and drinks for the guards,

233
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,400
(Juban: Drink accompaniments)

234
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,839
some coins to enter the cell...

235
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,599
(Yumun: Entering the cell)

236
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,970
And it takes a whole sack of rice...

237
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,279
to get your pillory removed.

238
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,579
Are you blaming me?

239
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:14,319
No, I am not.

240
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:20,629
You were disappointed that I did not visit more often,

241
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,529
so I merely told you my troubles.

242
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,879
So, did you talk him into it?

243
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,420
How sweet.

244
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:24,260
How come a herbal decoction is this sweet?

245
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,260
Probably because life is so bitter.

246
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:31,260
You know we have never enjoyed this kind of luxury before, Han Soo.

247
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,900
Tell me about it.

248
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:36,139
I wish I could live here for good.

249
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:37,299
Me too.

250
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,940
- Here you go. - Another one?

251
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,039
Yes.

252
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,279
I will tell the merchant here.

253
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,440
Make yourselves at home.

254
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,609
Han Soo!

255
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,420
- We have a big problem! - What is it?

256
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,190
Lee Bong Sam...

257
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,289
made a confession.

258
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,829
He will be transferred to the Bureau of Punishments now.

259
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,129
What?

260
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,529
Wait.

261
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:09,099
What is going on?

262
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:10,639
Did someone from Lord Chu threaten you?

263
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,940
I...

264
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,139
killed him.

265
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:16,410
What...

266
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,379
I am the one...

267
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,650
who killed Chil Gu.

268
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,099
I thought if he were dead,

269
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:44,339
I would not have to repay my debt to him.

270
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:46,710
Hey, Bong Sam.

271
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,109
Look.

272
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,079
When will you repay...

273
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,150
the barley you borrowed from me last month?

274
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,980
You borrowed a Mal of barley,

275
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,319
but the interest has turned to three Mal already.

276
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,789
I mean,

277
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,389
drop your kid out of village school if you have no money.

278
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,460
How can you afford to pay for him...

279
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,160
when you are dead poor?

280
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,500
You are frustrating.

281
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:26,609
And my son saw that filthy intention.

282
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:33,190
Master,

283
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:36,420
I cannot dump the debt onto my family...

284
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,990
just to save my pathetic self.

285
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:50,400
I get that everyone has a different sense of conscience...

286
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,770
If you die like this,

287
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,109
what will Yong learn from it?

288
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,180
He will only learn...

289
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,910
how resentful and wrongful the world is.

290
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,650
It will only be like throwing straws against the wind.

291
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,319
I have never seen a high official's child...

292
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,260
get punished no matter how despicable they are.

293
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,490
What about your family then?

294
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,730
Are they fools or what?

295
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,000
Pardon?

296
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,839
I cannot do it.

297
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,900
No, I will not.

298
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,440
No wife can tell her husband...

299
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,010
to confess and get punished to death for what he did not even do.

300
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,010
It is not right. It certainly is not.

301
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,650
Do not tell me you will give up your chance...

302
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,849
to own 5,000m² of land over that mere morality.

303
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,420
Once you become a landlord, you will not have to pay farm rent.

304
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,059
You will be able to earn as much as you work.

305
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,129
You will be able to save enough,

306
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:54,230
and with that money, you will be able to support your genius son...

307
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,940
to take the state exam.

308
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,309
If he passes the exam, you and your son...

309
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:02,240
will be able to live as noble people.

310
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:04,410
I say no!

311
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,520
Instead of being a nobleman,

312
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:15,190
I want to be my father's son.

313
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,460
It is because you are too young to know enough.

314
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,930
Right, I do not know enough.

315
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:27,930
But I can make choices.

316
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,339
Rather than high-level noblemen...

317
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,369
who tell lies...

318
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,910
and frame innocent people for what they did not do,

319
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,109
I have much more respect for my father...

320
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:44,049
who works diligently and lives an honest life.

321
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,950
So,

322
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:49,119
I choose to be my father's son...

323
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,859
instead of a nobleman.

324
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,609
- Yong. - Father.

325
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,750
Father.

326
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,990
Please...

327
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,220
live long and healthy by my side.

328
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,559
Do not pass away like this.

329
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,270
I apologize, Attorney Kang.

330
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,440
I am sorry I ruined it.

331
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,279
It was thoughtless of me.

332
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,049
Please...

333
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,619
help me and my family.

334
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,420
I will never do anything foolish again.

335
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,490
I will never give up.

336
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,990
So please...

337
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:03,029
Yes, this is the attitude.

338
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,099
You should have been this determined a long time ago.

339
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:07,799
Do not worry.

340
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,440
I am Kang Han Soo.

342
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:28,049
Invalid?

343
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:32,319
Are you saying he made a fake confession...

344
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,230
due to excessive torture?

345
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:36,799
That is correct.

346
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,559
If you...

347
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,029
Here. If you look at "Book of the Law,"

348
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,599
one must be tortured with less than 30 beatings...

349
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:46,869
at a time in a designated ground,

350
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:49,539
and they must not be tortured twice in three days.

351
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,339
That is what the book says.

352
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:54,049
But Gyeonggi Provincial Office...

353
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:56,520
gave Lee Bong Sam 50 beatings at once...

354
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,849
and even twisted his legs,

355
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,049
Two days in a row, at that.

356
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,789
No one follows all those regulations strictly.

357
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,960
("Book of the Law")

358
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,129
These laws were enacted by royal commands.

359
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,960
Do you mean...

360
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,230
it is okay to disobey royal commands?

361
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:15,029
You are the head of the Ministry of Law Enforcement,

362
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:16,900
one of the three government offices that manages...

363
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,270
and executes the laws...

364
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,210
with Hanseongbu and Saheonbu.

365
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,010
I do not think it is appropriate for you to say so.

366
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,980
If Lee Bong Sam is not the one,

367
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:27,680
is someone else the real culprit?

368
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,619
Yes.

369
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:31,220
Lord Chu's son,

370
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:33,690
Chu Dae Sung, is the real culprit.

371
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,760
Right after the murder,

372
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,430
he was even locked up in Gyeonggi prison for one night.

373
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:41,730
The record must remain.

374
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:46,000
You sound very certain.

375
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,200
Yes. Thus, the truth must be revealed...

376
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,099
through a retrial.

377
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,339
Then,

378
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,510
will you bet your life on it?

379
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,910
Pardon?

380
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,879
Like you said,

381
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:07,589
this is the Ministry of Law Enforcement...

382
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:10,190
where criminals are punished and executed for high treason,

383
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,089
rebellion, murdering family, blasphemy, and marriage disharmony.

384
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:16,859
People walk in here and leave here unconscious.

385
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:21,629
It is also my duty as the leader of this place...

386
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:24,069
to teach what happens...

387
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,970
if one runs their mouth here.

388
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,639
As you advised, I would like to fulfill my duty.

389
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,410
I do not follow.

390
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,049
If you cannot reveal that the real culprit is Chu Dae Sung,

391
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,520
it will mean a false accusation.

392
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:42,089
For calumny,

393
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,089
you will be punished to death.

394
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:49,289
If you can handle it,

395
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,700
I will grant a retrial.

396
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,900
If not,

397
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,970
I will conclude that Lee Bong Sam is the murderer...

398
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,010
and submit the report to the Royal Court.

399
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,510
(A case report used during a trial)

400
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,109
What do you say?

401
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,020
Of course,

402
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,760
I accept.

403
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:40,210
- My lord. - How did it go?

404
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,089
All right. Well...

405
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,690
When one kills someone, one has to pay with their life.

406
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,029
So it is only natural to risk one's life when saving another.

407
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,430
Nice, is it not?

408
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,460
Even if I risk my life a million times,

409
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,500
I can only die once.

410
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,770
I am actually rather pleased.

411
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,670
I see. Everything is good, yes?

412
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:09,440
I get it. But why this?

413
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:13,809
Because we are one.

414
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,849
We share the same destiny.

415
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:18,020
We live and die together, no?

416
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,619
You really...

417
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,819
It is the three of us now.

418
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:28,230
What? Darn it.

419
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,799
Come on.

420
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,970
You are driving me nuts.

421
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,170
So what are we going to do now?

422
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,670
Is it not obvious?

423
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,440
Like always, we will battle it out using the law.

424
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:06,599
Next.

425
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,069
Give me the next one.

426
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:18,079
Officer, begin your oral statement.

427
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:20,910
(Judge, Judicial Officer)

428
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:22,879
(Lee Bong Sam, Kang Chil Gu, Chu Dae Sung)

429
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:23,950
Understood.

430
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,279
(Lee Bong Sam, Kang Chil Gu)

431
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,920
- Had I hurt Chil Gu, - I am not guilty!

432
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:33,559
such evidence should have been at the scene of the incident.

433
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,059
Do you not agree with me?

434
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,629
- I agree! - I agree!

435
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:40,569
Punish that man with 300 strikes.

436
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:42,400
- Strikes! - Strikes!

437
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,569
- He has won! - He has won!

438
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,099
- He has won! - He has won!

439
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,910
No one in Joseon can beat me in a lawsuit.

440
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,779
It is now our turn to counterattack.

441
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,520
It will take some time, but there is no helping it.

442
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:02,319
We cannot possibly win against Kang Han Soo in a lawsuit.

443
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:05,819
All right.

444
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,490
I will do so.

445
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:31,379
What?

446
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:33,950
Han Soo!

447
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:35,990
Gosh, Han Soo.

448
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:37,990
What is it?

449
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,990
Today's lawsuit has been cancelled.

450
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
How come?

451
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,660
The Law Enforcement's deputy minister...

452
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,059
serving as the investigation officer...

453
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:47,329
got a sudden upset stomach. It is absurd.

454
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:50,500
Were you told when it would be held again?

455
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,270
We are to wait for now.

456
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,440
Darn it.

457
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,889
Father!

458
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,059
Father!

459
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,039
What is it?

460
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,639
We must call for a physician.

461
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,079
Of course.

462
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,980
Han Soo. Over there. Look over there.

463
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,020
Gosh, they are all dead.

464
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:42,089
Poison?

465
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:44,190
Did you just say poison?

466
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,389
Are those people trying to kill my husband...

467
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:49,430
to stop the lawsuit?

468
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:52,200
Please take Yong home. We will...

469
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,400
- Yong! - I will go after him.

470
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,970
- So Won and Dong Chi. - Yes. Go.

471
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,239
For now, have Attorney Kang handle it.

472
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,009
How could this happen?

473
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:05,110
Those scumbags.

474
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:08,050
How dare they use such a nasty move?

475
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,579
Bring back my father!

476
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,289
What did he do so wrong?

477
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:17,960
The real person who is in the wrong is Young Master Chu!

478
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,989
I saw it all!

479
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,759
You, there.

480
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,829
Despite being small, you sure have a loud voice.

481
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,869
The one who killed Chil Gu...

482
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,079
was Young Master Chu.

483
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,880
So why must my father get punished?

484
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,480
Just why?

485
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,719
You little...

486
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:54,190
That jerk.

487
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,429
What are you doing to a kid?

488
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,400
I simply shoved away what was filthy.

489
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,770
By the looks of it, that kid seems to be that murderer's son.

490
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:09,270
But why did you not tell him the truth?

491
00:35:10,009 --> 00:35:12,710
That his father will die not because of me,

492
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:16,110
but you, Kang Han Soo.

493
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,780
What?

494
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:21,550
If that man, Lee Bong Sam, dies, it is all your fault.

495
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,759
To not give you an excuse,

496
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,630
I used him as the scapegoat.

497
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,900
So go ahead and try to save him if you can.

498
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,300
The next lawsuit...

499
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:39,239
will take at least a month to be held.

500
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,440
But that one will get cancelled too.

501
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:46,179
So will the one after that. Why?

502
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,110
Because I have the power to do so.

503
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,579
The law.

504
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:55,150
It can be handled well only by the people with power.

505
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,520
Do you understand, kid?

506
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,579
My father...

507
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,849
What will happen to him now?

508
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,150
The physician.

509
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,420
Can he get treated by the physician?

510
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:35,360
Can he?

511
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:37,699
And what about the lawsuit?

512
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,079
I am sorry.

513
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:53,349
- Pardon? - It looks like...

514
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,119
we must give up on the lawsuit.

515
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,469
Good grief.

516
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:16,469
Darn it. Who is it?

517
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,699
Father.

518
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:21,909
What a carefree life you have.

519
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:23,509
You foolish boy.

520
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,880
Do you even know what I have to go through because of you?

521
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,079
My apologies.

522
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:34,489
If only I had one more son!

523
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,550
Darn it.

524
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:13,389
If Man Gap takes a break, who will work in his stead?

525
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,159
Let me see.

526
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:19,059
The other servants will split up his duties.

527
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,770
Do you know why they exist?

528
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:31,210
Pardon?

529
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,050
They exist to support us nobles who must study...

530
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,980
our entire lives to build this country...

531
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,119
into Confucianism.

532
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,619
Aside from that,

533
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,389
they are no different from beasts who eat, take dumps, and sleep.

534
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:46,960
You are the sole son of three generations.

535
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,159
How in the world can you study...

536
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,099
if you worry whether those servants...

537
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,630
are sick or not?

538
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,000
First, you must pass the state exam.

539
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:00,670
That is why you exist.

540
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,440
I passed!

541
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,150
- Gosh. - Yes!

542
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,750
- My name is over there. - I passed.

543
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,480
- Let me see. - This is bad.

544
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:13,949
- Good grief. - Oh, my.

545
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,289
You made a mistake.

546
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,989
It has to be a mistake.

547
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,190
Understood?

548
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:24,130
Yes. Next time, I will make sure to pass the exam.

549
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,849
It was a mistake, Father.

550
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,590
No.

551
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,960
It is my fault for having and raising you.

552
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,190
Even a petty servant earns his keep.

553
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:58,460
You are no better than a servant.

554
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:17,880
How dare you ignore me?

555
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,259
How dare you?

556
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:27,389
You are nothing but a servant.

557
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:41,139
I did everything I could.

558
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,480
It is now up to the patient to endure through this condition.

559
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:48,380
Please excuse me.

560
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:55,920
How can we leave him here?

561
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,770
My sister?

562
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,619
Executive Minister Yoo.

563
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:28,520
I brought appeals which require your response within the day.

564
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,550
(The King provided responses to appeals.)

565
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,289
But...

566
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,389
were you on your way out?

567
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,030
Well...

568
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:46,199
Your Royal Highness.

569
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,579
What brings you here?

570
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,039
I heard Young Master Chu's trial got cancelled,

571
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:53,509
so I became worried and visited your merchant house.

572
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:55,380
That is where I heard you came to the palace.

573
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,989
What if someone sees you here?

574
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,920
Why are you so reckless?

575
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:08,429
What will you do after meeting His Majesty?

576
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,000
I will make a request to change the judge.

577
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:14,030
It is far from proper for Lord Won to take this case.

578
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:18,340
Lord Won's daughter is about to marry Young Master Chu!

579
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,440
Marriage arrangements...

580
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:24,679
can be called off anytime.

581
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:28,150
Therefore,

582
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,050
there is no reason for Lord Won to avoid taking this trial.

583
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:33,219
It is also not Lord Won's fault that one of the investigators...

584
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,550
suddenly became sick.

585
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,059
This is all Lord Chu's scheme. Do you not see that?

586
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:38,389
Of course, I do.

587
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:40,659
However,

588
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:42,289
I am saying there is no pretext...

589
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:44,460
to blame them or make them sit out of this trial.

590
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,840
If you act this rashly,

591
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,909
you may cause harm to His Majesty.

592
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,579
There are many eyes around here, so you should leave.

593
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,449
I will let His Majesty know.

594
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,349
Court Lady Hong.

595
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:36,809
Please do not worry.

596
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:39,380
As he always has,

597
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,289
Attorney Kang will find a way.

598
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,469
Open it.

599
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,349
You finally noticed me.

600
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:19,190
What is on your mind?

601
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:21,630
What can I do to play dirtier...

602
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,630
against those who play dirty? Something like that.

603
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,900
Anything. We must do whatever we can to punish them.

604
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,070
What?

605
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:33,170
Hey, what happened to you?

606
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:35,710
You were always hung up on customs and morals.

607
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,509
That all depends on the people and the situation.

608
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:42,179
Would it not be great...

609
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,420
if there was some kind of tonic that will make the taker...

610
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,119
spill the truth?

611
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:49,690
If there was such a thing, attorneys would not...

612
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,789
exist.

613
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:56,759
It does. It does exist.

614
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:59,059
Yes, that is it.

615
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:00,199
That is it!

616
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,840
Goodness, my dear So Won.

617
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,000
You are so adorable.

618
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,340
You are the most adorable in this world.

619
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,710
- All right. - Where are you going?

620
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:10,610
To make a herbal decoction for Young Master Chu.

621
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:21,650
What is this?

622
00:45:21,949 --> 00:45:23,090
Money.

623
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,389
You must have taken money...

624
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,989
to bully my people too.

625
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,099
I would not do that just for money.

626
00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:37,969
I also am not offering just money.

627
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,639
What can you give me?

628
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,179
An opportunity to turn the tables...

629
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,309
around.

630
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,920
What?

631
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,849
Master Cho, all kinds of thoughts must be running through your head.

632
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:56,789
You may even feel like you took the wrong turn somewhere.

633
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:58,389
You kind of wished you could take our side,

634
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,489
but you were hesitant as you did not have any excuses.

635
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,670
Stop beating around the bush and get to the point.

636
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,030
I will make a decision after I hear what you have to say.

637
00:46:14,009 --> 00:46:15,409
No, come closer.

638
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:30,119
But doing that cannot move the trial up.

639
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:34,059
Who says we must only win through a trial?

640
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,429
(Cho's Guild)

641
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,090
Happy now?

642
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,389
A list of merchant ships and respective dates...

643
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:11,960
for them to anchor in Mapo Riverport next month.

644
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,099
But you could have helped out with that for free.

645
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:19,199
There is no free lunch in this world.

646
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:22,610
You already know that.

647
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,230
Young master.

648
00:47:43,789 --> 00:47:45,099
Young master?

649
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:49,170
What is it?

650
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,699
You have a guest.

651
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:04,179
Our fathers are quite close,

652
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:06,219
so it is a shame that we do not meet as often.

653
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:08,449
Do not say that.

654
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,759
It is my fault for not establishing myself in society.

655
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,559
You are diligent with your studies,

656
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,389
so you will pass the state exam very soon.

657
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:16,860
Sadly,

658
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:20,000
I hear some scholars do not have enough luck with exams,

659
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,170
but your devotion will pay off.

660
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:25,900
One day, fate will bring success into your life.

661
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:30,170
I appreciate your encouragement.

662
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:32,840
Anyway,

663
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:36,409
your venerable father must be greatly worried over this incident.

664
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:38,119
(Venerable father: A respectful way to address one's father)

665
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,780
Yes.

666
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,889
Lee Bong Sam's attorney, Kang Han Soo,

667
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:46,119
insists you are the real culprit who killed Kang Chil Gu.

668
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,329
On top of that, he found evidence too.

669
00:48:49,489 --> 00:48:50,730
Evidence?

670
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:53,800
That is why I brought you the autopsy report.

671
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:57,270
Attorney Kang's argument will not have any ground without this.

672
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,509
What is wrong?

673
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,550
Wait, did Kang Han Soo...

674
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:10,650
This is not good.

675
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,650
If Kang takes the evidence and complains to His Majesty,

676
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:16,889
your father will be held responsible.

677
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:22,960
Where are you going?

678
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,360
I must stop that attorney...

679
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,599
from saying absurd things!

680
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:27,829
Hey!

681
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,949
Kang Han Soo?

682
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,920
Kang Han Soo!

683
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:02,500
Have you not heard of calumny?

684
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:05,239
If they find out that your father framed Lee Bong Sam,

685
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,940
he will be punished for murder.

686
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,809
No.

687
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:16,309
Then, who will your father resent the most?

688
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,050
You or Kang Han Soo?

689
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:40,400
I will never forgive you.

690
00:50:40,809 --> 00:50:42,670
Stop right there, Kang Han Soo!

691
00:50:57,219 --> 00:50:58,289
Kang Han Soo!

692
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:07,670
It is my family's honour to meet you.

693
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:14,670
You jerk.

694
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:17,710
What is it?

695
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,909
- Give it. - What do you mean?

696
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:24,079
You said you found evidence. Give it to me!

697
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,150
Calm yourself.

698
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,619
It is your loss to behave this way here.

699
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,219
Look.

700
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:31,789
Oh, dear.

701
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:46,369
Shoot.

702
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,210
Are you joking with me?

703
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:55,409
So you want to sue me?

704
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,280
What have I done wrong?

705
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:59,480
The owner is supposed to educate the servant.

706
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,750
How is it my fault?

707
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:05,289
Wait! Does Lord Chu know?

708
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,730
- Get my father's name off your... - Listen to me!

709
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:09,889
Hear me out.

710
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:15,400
I heard that you were Lord Chu's only son.

711
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,199
Does Lord Chu know...

712
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,110
that his one and only son...

713
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:26,480
is a scoundrel?

714
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:29,210
Does he know?

715
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:35,989
That punk...

716
00:52:40,289 --> 00:52:42,860
Wait. He must know.

717
00:52:43,489 --> 00:52:45,199
That is why he is...

718
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:47,770
going all over the country to beg the governor of Gyeonggi,

719
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,270
beg the minister who will be his in-law,

720
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,940
buy off every single witness...

721
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,610
to ask them to give false testimony.

722
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:55,610
Shut your mouth!

723
00:52:57,809 --> 00:52:58,909
"You foolish boy!"

724
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:01,849
"If only I had one more son!"

725
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,719
What a carefree life you have.

726
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:06,480
You foolish boy.

727
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,289
I ought to rip your mouth!

728
00:53:14,789 --> 00:53:17,860
Han Soo, I am going to kill you.

729
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:21,070
Master Cho was right. It worked like a charm.

730
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,099
Kang Han Soo. Die!

731
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:29,539
Die!

732
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,190
My lords.

733
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,199
Stop causing a scene, and remove yourself.

734
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,960
Your father will be deeply upset when he finds out.

735
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,400
What are you all doing?

736
00:53:57,969 --> 00:53:59,469
Close your windows.

737
00:54:21,889 --> 00:54:23,360
Have you not heard of calumny?

738
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:26,460
If they find out that your father framed Lee Bong Sam,

739
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,230
he will be punished for murder.

740
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:00,759
What do you mean by that? Why would my son...

741
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:03,230
I am not sure.

742
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:06,869
I simply thought that you would want to know.

743
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:25,190
My gosh.

744
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:28,929
Dae Sung!

745
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:33,059
What do you think you are doing?

746
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,199
Why did you confess?

747
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:38,340
If I do not...

748
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,340
What?

749
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:43,969
You could be charged with a calumny.

750
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,039
What are you...

751
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,150
Everyone knows about it, anyway.

752
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,619
I cannot get you involved, Father.

753
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,489
It was my fault. It is fair...

754
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:02,259
that I pay for it.

755
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:06,500
I am...

756
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:11,170
not passing the state exam, anyway.

757
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,719
Before it is too late,

758
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,759
have another son.

759
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:40,699
Dae Sung.

760
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,530
What is the matter? You punk.

761
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:45,400
What has gotten into you?

762
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,539
- Father... - What are you doing?

763
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,780
Have another son.

764
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:00,480
What is going on with you?

765
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:21,409
- What? - I apologize.

766
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:24,509
I was not in the position to stop them.

767
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:39,520
- Please reconsider, Your Majesty! - Please reconsider, Your Majesty!

768
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:43,960
- Please reconsider, Your Majesty! - Please reconsider, Your Majesty!

769
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:49,270
The law must be impartial to anyone in this country.

770
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:52,599
The son of an important vassal is no exception, Your Majesty!

771
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:57,170
- Please reconsider, Your Majesty! - Please reconsider, Your Majesty!

772
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,679
- Please reconsider, Your Majesty! - Please reconsider, Your Majesty!

773
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,309
Executive Minister Yoo.

774
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:07,989
Why did you hide it for so long?

775
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,489
It is my fault.

776
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:12,920
I am solely to blame for it.

777
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,389
So, you will take responsibility.

778
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:18,559
Executive Minister Yoo...

779
00:58:33,809 --> 00:58:36,509
Executive Minister Yoo. What must I do?

780
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,880
I tried to be generous...

781
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,980
to Lord Chu to save your face,

782
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,949
and all members of Sarim and scholars...

783
00:58:43,949 --> 00:58:46,320
came running and started opposing it.

784
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:49,590
Did you not give him...

785
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:53,300
a lighter punishment, knowing that will happen?

786
00:58:53,759 --> 00:58:55,400
I am not clairvoyant.

787
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:57,869
How can I expect everything to happen?

788
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:21,829
Give him the lightest punishment.

789
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:30,300
Then those who see and hear it at the scene...

790
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,670
will raise their voices...

791
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,840
to support you, Your Majesty.

792
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:37,070
So things turned out as you said they would.

793
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:42,909
Please handle it according to the law.

794
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,090
Is it really okay to do so?

795
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:51,250
It will damage Hungu greatly.

796
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,989
I am to blame for it all.

797
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,630
It is only right that I deal with it.

798
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:00,829
The Royal Court should not antagonize Sarim scholars...

799
01:00:00,829 --> 01:00:04,840
from all over the nation over this mere issue.

800
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,770
I am grateful...

801
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:11,610
for your decision,

802
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,409
Executive Minister Yoo.

803
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:24,219
Who said a high official's child would not be executed?

804
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,190
Father...

805
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:33,099
The law must be fair to everyone.

806
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:37,099
Chu Dae Sung...

807
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:39,800
murdered a neighbour and framed an innocent man for it.

808
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:43,139
Execute him according to the law.

809
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,090
How could you...

810
01:02:03,449 --> 01:02:05,759
do this to me?

811
01:02:08,259 --> 01:02:09,460
After all...

812
01:02:10,389 --> 01:02:11,800
I did...

813
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:15,800
for you and our Hungu!

814
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:24,639
You said Joseon had to be managed under one intention.

815
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:29,309
That other voices would only cause conflicts in the country.

816
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:33,650
That we had to stop Sarim from coveting our place.

817
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,619
That we had to close ranks together!

818
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:38,119
You...

819
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,759
always said that...

820
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:44,929
we would be together forever!

821
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:46,199
So why...

822
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,849
Officer Kang's son is alive.

823
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,750
I sent the other ledgers...

824
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:11,090
to him.

825
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:18,730
He needs to have that much...

826
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,360
to fight you!

827
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,400
Yes, right.

828
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:28,940
It is not always a weapon that helps you win your war.

829
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:32,809
They say a pebble can never be a rock.

830
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:35,309
For someone with a poor disposition,

831
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:37,949
you are pathetic until the end.

832
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:39,949
Executive Minister Yoo!

833
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:41,380
Executive Minister Yoo!

834
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:44,989
Executive Minister Yoo!

835
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:16,989
Father!

836
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,889
Yong...

837
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:26,130
Lee Bong Sam pulled it through.

838
01:04:26,759 --> 01:04:30,000
It is thanks to his family's trust and support.

839
01:04:36,809 --> 01:04:37,940
Honey!

840
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:43,309
Honey...

841
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,590
Father.

842
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,759
This time, I protected a family.

843
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:00,759
Are you watching this?

844
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:33,000
Goodness, why did you have to...

845
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:42,270
Dae Sung...

846
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,210
Your father...

847
01:05:47,179 --> 01:05:49,809
Goodness, you brat.

848
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:53,579
Dae Sung...

849
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:01,619
Die!

850
01:06:01,789 --> 01:06:02,889
Die...

851
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:12,239
This is the best I can do to show respect to my old friend,

852
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,070
so do not feel bad.

853
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,809
If you rush,

854
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,039
you will be able to...

855
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:21,509
keep your son company on the way to the underground.

856
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:26,480
And do not worry that your death might be for nothing.

857
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,489
I shall present it...

858
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:32,860
to Princess Yeon Joo and Kang Han Soo as a gift.

859
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:20,539
My brother is alive.

860
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,739
Did you know?

861
01:07:35,289 --> 01:07:38,219
My son has helped your brother.

862
01:07:38,219 --> 01:07:39,559
Several times, at that.

863
01:07:41,059 --> 01:07:42,230
So,

864
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:44,690
will you meet him?

865
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,059
Or will you do your job as we first promised?

866
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:31,540
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

867
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:42,049
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

868
01:08:43,549 --> 01:08:46,419
Accidents and cases happen all the time around you.

869
01:08:46,959 --> 01:08:48,259
Do not tell me...

870
01:08:48,259 --> 01:08:49,959
you are suspecting me.

871
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:52,700
When will you stop freeloading at Sowongak?

872
01:08:52,959 --> 01:08:54,160
Attorney Kang?

873
01:08:54,629 --> 01:08:56,469
Just what is your relationship...

874
01:08:57,499 --> 01:08:59,099
with So Won, Magistrate Yoo?

875
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:06,309
Are you Attorney Kang Han Soo?

876
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:11,009
It is good to see you, Kang Han Soo.

877
01:09:12,249 --> 01:09:13,749
I heard you wanted to meet me.
