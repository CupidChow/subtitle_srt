1
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:48,670

2
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:58,454
You should eat as well.

3
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:04,264
Liar.

4
00:01:14,994 --> 00:01:16,584
Please help me this once! 
  Tavern

5
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:19,144
Do you not feel bad for the child?

6
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:21,324
I will make sure to pay you generously!

7
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:22,754
Why are you being like this?

8
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:24,394
I do not even have enough milk for my own child!

9
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:27,214
Let go!

10
00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:30,254
I told you I would pay you sufficiently for it! 
  Fish Store

11
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:35,384
So noisy!

12
00:01:35,384 --> 00:01:37,344
What the hell—

13
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:39,314
What is with you?

14
00:01:39,314 --> 00:01:40,994
What are you talking about?

15
00:01:40,994 --> 00:01:43,934
If a baby is crying, you should comfort him, not yell.

16
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:46,574
Baby, come here, come here.

17
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:49,344
All right. Yeah, yeah.

18
00:01:49,344 --> 00:01:51,694
You were scared, right?

19
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:57,234
He pooped. Here.

20
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:02,514
Tell me what happened.

21
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:05,074
I will resolve it for you.

22
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:12,374
Huh?

23
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:14,094
Are you crying?

24
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:21,544
Gosh, I thought you were a heartless ruffian, but you are human, after all.

25
00:02:23,424 --> 00:02:25,734
Tell me.

26
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:28,194
Or go outside and cry!

27
00:02:34,514 --> 00:02:38,814
My original name is Chu Su.

28
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:41,184
Chu for Autumn and Su for Harvest.

29
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:44,994
My hyeong's name was Wu for Rain and Su for Harvest.

30
00:02:44,994 --> 00:02:49,054
My parents, who were farmers, made those names for us.

31
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:52,284
Then why did you leave behind such a good name?

32
00:02:52,284 --> 00:02:55,194
My father lived his entire life as a tenant farmer.

33
00:02:55,194 --> 00:02:57,774
After he collapsed in the hot sun and passed away,

34
00:02:57,774 --> 00:03:03,494
my brother and I wished to own our own land.

35
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:06,754
All right, all right.

36
00:03:10,854 --> 00:03:13,284
 This is it, Chu Su.

37
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:16,064
 Is this possible, Hyeongnim?

38
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:18,564
 Of course!

39
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:21,494
 The national law stated that if anyone cultivates a wasteland in three years,

40
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:24,064
 that land would become theirs to own.

41
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:31,074
 So we spent all our time cultivating the land, including the time for sleeping, eating, and pooping.

42
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:40,304
 Even though we failed multiple times, Hyeong never gave up.

43
00:03:47,614 --> 00:03:50,234
 How long do I have to keep doing this!

44
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:22,054
 Chu Su.

45
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:25,834
 Ch-Chu Su. Chu Su.

46
00:04:29,254 --> 00:04:33,604
 Though... I ran away...

47
00:04:35,114 --> 00:04:37,894
 even leaving behind the name that my parents gave me.

48
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:39,910
 Chu Su.

49
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:44,804
 Chu Su...

50
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:16,834
 This is my land!

51
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:19,344
 Hooray! So happy!

52
00:05:19,344 --> 00:05:21,424
 Hooray! So happy!

53
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:25,824
 All the hard work we put into this, we will reap for ourselves as our own.

54
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:27,794
 It is our land!

55
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,444
 All right.

56
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:38,244
 White Rice, your father has lived his entire life as a tenant farmer,

57
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:44,674
 but you, White Rice, will live your entire life as the owner of this land.

58
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:47,004
 Yes.

59
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:52,164
 Are you happy?

60
00:05:52,164 --> 00:05:54,704
 White Rice, you are happy?

61
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:56,534
 Yes, we are all happy!

62
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:58,644
 All right, okay!

63
00:05:58,644 --> 00:06:02,674
 - All right, okay! 
 - You look just like your father.

64
00:06:13,184 --> 00:06:16,194
 It turns out that around February at the end of the three years,

65
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:20,104
 Won Dae Han took that land for himself and got a property deed from the government office.

66
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:22,874
 Ipan - An official document issued by the government office

67
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:24,964
 Why are you doing this on my land?

68
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:29,694
 So the prefect of Goyang took Won Dae Han's side.

69
00:06:54,444 --> 00:06:56,784
 Who is there!

70
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:02,074
 - Catch her!
 - Do not do this!

71
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:04,154
 Do not be like this! This is our land!

72
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:05,994
 This is our land that we have cultivated!

73
00:07:05,994 --> 00:07:07,624
 Come!

74
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:09,824
 Do not be like this!

75
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:25,254
 Have you... been to our land?

76
00:07:26,544 --> 00:07:32,684
 This hyeong worked even harder to cultivate the land.

77
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:35,364
 I was afraid...

78
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:42,764
 you might blame yourself for never achieving our lifelong wish because of you.

79
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:46,014
 Thus,

80
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:54,774
 Su, you should settle and live on our land.

81
00:07:58,064 --> 00:08:00,424
What do you mean, the end?

82
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:04,824
I came here after burying him in the mountains today.

83
00:08:07,014 --> 00:08:12,824
Please help... this poor child.

84
00:08:29,954 --> 00:08:32,234
Well, that is perfect.

85
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:36,914
I actually have been wanting to deal a blow to them.

86
00:08:54,544 --> 00:09:01,270
 Episode 12: The owner of the land

87
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,300
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

88
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:05,154
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

89
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:08,814
Even if he had gone past the three years,

90
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:12,194
that land was Jeong's land that he cultivated to the end of his life!

91
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:14,944
Was he not successful at cultivating that wasteland

92
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:16,714
if he managed to till the land and plant seeds?

93
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:18,854
Thus, Jeong believed that land was his

94
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:22,974
and farmed that land with all his might until the day he died.

95
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:24,104
If he succeeded in cultivating the land,

96
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:26,854
there should be at least some crops or some shoots springing forth from the land

97
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:29,244
so that people would know that this land has an owner.

98
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:32,334
From what I can see, it was just a barren, unclaimed land.

99
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:34,654
In the national law, any land that someone has stayed on for three years

100
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:37,974
can be reported and given to another to cultivate,

101
00:09:37,974 --> 00:09:40,774
so I have not done anything wrong!

102
00:09:40,774 --> 00:09:43,864
This is what His Excellency Won is claiming.

103
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:46,304
Go anywhere in Joseon!

104
00:09:46,304 --> 00:09:49,534
All the land is barren in February.

105
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:53,094
It is suspicious that His Excellency Won only claimed his property rights just before the harvest

106
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:56,044
after reporting the land for cultivation in February.

107
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:58,784
Yeah. That is what I am saying!

108
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,934
However, it will not be easy to win this case.

109
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:10,704
In the end, His Excellency Won did nothing to break the law. And most importantly, he has power.

110
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:13,784
He is a close friend of the Minister Yu.

111
00:10:13,784 --> 00:10:18,224
Seeing how he was reinstated just a few months after committing a crime with His Excellency Chu,

112
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:23,184
it appears that Minister Yu really cares a lot about him.

113
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:26,644
But you will still go through with the lawsuit, knowing all this?

114
00:10:27,814 --> 00:10:30,154
That is why I am doing it!

115
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:34,174
So that things will get awkward and complicated on multiple fronts.

116
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:06,784
I will see you in court in three days.

117
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:14,484
All right. They are all dead.

118
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,050
 Wishes Inn

119
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:23,174
A land property lawsuit? 
  Hanyang Prefecture

120
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:25,304
Who is the opponent?

121
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:29,604
It is Associate Left Minister Won Dae Han.

122
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:31,604
I see.

123
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,184
Is there anything we can do to help?

124
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:35,504
No, there is nothing.

125
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:38,054
Kang Han Su started this lawsuit in order to make things difficult

126
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:41,834
for you, me, and my father, Princess.

127
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,794
You know this very well.

128
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:48,504
From the start, Kang Han Su was someone who used lawsuits for his own revenge.

129
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:51,464
Now we have become the target.

130
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:55,414
Since I am now a princess.

131
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,904
Yes.

132
00:11:56,904 --> 00:12:01,754
And we are those who own the most land in Joseon.

133
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:10,444
From here to over there, it is fruitful land!

134
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:13,904
It is quite the ideal land!

135
00:12:13,904 --> 00:12:15,634
Please handle everything well to the end.

136
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:19,234
- Oh, yes, Your Excellency. 
- Your Excellency!

137
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:21,474
Your Excellency!

138
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,554
Why are you making such a fuss?

139
00:12:23,554 --> 00:12:24,964
A so*.(Korean for lawsuit.)

140
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:26,274
A s--s-s-so!

141
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:28,434
A so*? 
(Also a Korean homonym for cow.)

142
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:34,604
Not that kind of so!

143
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:38,654
Oh, that guy has decided to file a lawsuit against you on behalf of his dead hyeong!

144
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:39,944
- A lawsuit? 
- Yes!

145
00:12:39,944 --> 00:12:41,674
Who?

146
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:49,094
- You dare file a lawsuit against me? 
- Yes, Your Excellency.

147
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:53,560
I brought a court order from the mayor of Hanseongbu that says to bring you into court.

148
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,424
 Court Order: Mayor of Seoul Hanseongbu, Yu Ji Seon

149
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:59,204
 Mayor of Seoul Hanseongbu, Yu Ji Seon

150
00:12:59,204 --> 00:13:01,694
Mayor Yu, that bastard...

151
00:13:04,554 --> 00:13:09,024
Someone like you would dare to file a lawsuit against me?

152
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:11,824
This asshole does not even know his place!

153
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,884
You f***ing asshole!

154
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:19,614
Let us go.

155
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:40,664
Unlike Your Excellency, achieving special service to the nation,

156
00:13:40,664 --> 00:13:48,194
ordinary government officials like me need to amass as much wealth as possible while in office.

157
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:52,984
So did you rob farmers of their hard-earned land?

158
00:13:55,334 --> 00:14:00,244
Do you think there is anyone with power who has land who has not resorted to those means?

159
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:04,194
Compared to those who intentionally give tenant farmers high-interest loans, so they cannot repay them,

160
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:09,454
or nit-pick about something else and take away their land, I am somewhat of a saint.

161
00:14:09,454 --> 00:14:13,714
At least I have not broken the law.

162
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:18,684
Then why do you need my help?

163
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:21,674
You could just handle things according to the law.

164
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:25,484
Does this lawsuit pertain only to me?

165
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:28,284
It is a lawsuit that involves everyone who owns land.

166
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,464
If in the off chance that I end up losing,

167
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:36,014
then everyone will come forth and pick fights with the nobility over land disputes.

168
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:39,684
How could I watch that happen?

169
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:49,874
More importantly, the opposing side's attorney is Kang Han Su.

170
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:52,184
Kang Han Su?

171
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,614
Yes, that annoying bastard!

172
00:14:54,614 --> 00:15:02,254
Who knows what he might be up to this time, so should I not at least prepare myself for it?

173
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:26,124
Is this that land?

174
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:28,894
Yes, Young Master.

175
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:33,274
You came from Hanyang, right?

176
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:35,044
Offer your greetings.

177
00:15:35,044 --> 00:15:39,254
He is the second son of His Excellency Won, Won Gong Ja.

178
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:41,084
Oh, I see!

179
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,154
You must be so tired coming from so far away!

180
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:07,684
But what brings you here, Young Master?

181
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:12,614
My father has gotten a cold, so I came in his place.

182
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:14,324
He came in his place.

183
00:16:14,324 --> 00:16:17,034
All right, I assume you have found a way to take this land, right?

184
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:18,054
You found a way, right?

185
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:22,094
The thing is... that guy is not even a tenant farmer,

186
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:23,944
so he does not even have a loan to pay off.

187
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:26,354
Plus, this is situated far from the city where the King resides

188
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:28,364
and is not even a military zone.

189
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:30,544
So he wouldn't be called upon for labor duties,

190
00:16:30,544 --> 00:16:33,814
which means he would have plenty of time to farm.

191
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:35,214
I suppose so.

192
00:16:35,214 --> 00:16:37,714
The farmers who live near the city

193
00:16:37,714 --> 00:16:42,554
are called in whenever needed to repair the walls or serve in palace events,

194
00:16:42,554 --> 00:16:45,624
so they cannot even think about cultivating new land.

195
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:50,034
So, you are saying there is not much to really use as an excuse!

196
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:58,324
That is it!

197
00:16:58,324 --> 00:16:59,814
That is it!

198
00:16:59,814 --> 00:17:02,744
Oh! Over there!

199
00:17:02,744 --> 00:17:05,254
Is that not His Excellency Won?

200
00:17:06,864 --> 00:17:09,294
Wait, you said he would not be able to come!

201
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,184
Gosh! They...

202
00:17:11,184 --> 00:17:13,834
Just throw it away!

203
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:21,324
Hyeongnim.

204
00:17:22,114 --> 00:17:25,304
That... What is that?

205
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:29,194
Follow me.

206
00:17:29,194 --> 00:17:33,454
Gosh, what is it? What is it?

207
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:36,044
Thank you for coming.

208
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:41,254
By chance, have you gone on labor duties?

209
00:17:41,254 --> 00:17:43,074
Of course, we have!

210
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:45,774
We have had to go in at least once or twice every year.

211
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,504
It is rare for us to not have it.

212
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:50,114
Then did my hyeongnim do so, too?

213
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:51,544
Wu Su was in the same group as me,

214
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:55,574
so he would always go with me, whether it was a village event or labor duties.

215
00:17:57,014 --> 00:18:01,364
Could you testify about what you just said in court?

216
00:18:01,364 --> 00:18:03,124
Testify?

217
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:05,934
Y-You are filing a lawsuit?

218
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:07,754
Hyeongnim, would you be okay?

219
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,814
Not only that, but the opponent is His Excellency Won!

220
00:18:09,814 --> 00:18:11,314
What if you end up on his bad side?

221
00:18:11,314 --> 00:18:16,444
There are at least tens of people who are living as tenant farmers on his land, just in our village!

222
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:17,734
Wait.

223
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:20,594
Is there any guarantee that you would not end up like my hyeongnim?

224
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:22,714
What did you say? How dare you speak such a terrible thing!

225
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:24,114
Why not just curse us?

226
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:26,264
That is not what I mean!

227
00:18:28,164 --> 00:18:29,574
Hey, Dong Chi.

228
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:31,684
All right, all right.

229
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:34,454
I heard you are also cultivating wasteland here and there.

230
00:18:34,454 --> 00:18:36,564
60 bu in Hanbuk Village and 85 bu past Saegogae.

231
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:37,684
Yeah, yeah?

232
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:38,814
Yeah, yeah, yeah?

233
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:41,874
So, think carefully.

234
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:43,554
We need to win this case,

235
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:47,844
so other farmers will not experience such injustices like this in the future!

236
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:51,574
I am not telling you to give a testimony that will make him mad at you.

237
00:18:51,574 --> 00:18:54,444
All we are asking is that you testify that

238
00:18:54,444 --> 00:18:58,274
Jeong has gone on labor duties in the past three years.

239
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,464
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

240
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:02,264
But...

241
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:06,704
how does that have anything to do with the land?

242
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:13,064
Not a single shoot of grass grew on that land in the three years.

243
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:17,764
Here. After confirming that he was not able to cultivate the land within three years,

244
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:18,944
 Property Deed: February 1st

245
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:21,644
he took over that land.

246
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:25,814
Here you go.

247
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:29,934
Here. Would the Associate Left Minister and that village official

248
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:34,844
have taken over land where crops were growing?

249
00:19:34,844 --> 00:19:38,464
Wow, you keep bringing up the three years,

250
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:41,704
and being a stickler about the length of time, then what, what, what!

251
00:19:41,704 --> 00:19:44,834
Do you think we do not have anything to say about that?

252
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:53,344
Your Excellency, Plaintiff Jeong still has forty-five days left on his three years.

253
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:56,294
During the three years that Plaintiff Jeong has been cultivating the wasteland,

254
00:19:56,294 --> 00:20:01,154
he has participated in three cases of labor duties for a total of forty-five days.

255
00:20:01,154 --> 00:20:07,294
Thus, in order to serve his country, he lacked time to farm.

256
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:12,494
If, His Excellency Won came forty-five days later,

257
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:15,814
there would have been shoots of crops growing on that land.

258
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:19,114
Then he could not have reported and claimed that land as his own.

259
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:25,254
However, there is no evidence that he had participated in labor duties.

260
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:27,434
There is.

261
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,944
What?

262
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:31,344
His neighbors who went along with him are witnesses.

263
00:20:31,344 --> 00:20:32,714
Have the witnesses enter.

264
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:35,674
- Have them come in. 
- Yes.

265
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:44,094
Are the Plaintiff's claims true?

266
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:49,774
It is true that we have participated in labor duties at least once or twice a year.

267
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,094
However,

268
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:02,434
Jeong did not come with us.

269
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:04,604
Yes, Your Excellency.

270
00:21:04,604 --> 00:21:09,434
Jeong's leg was not well, so we did not take him with us.

271
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:14,244
How could you give false testimony?

272
00:21:19,014 --> 00:21:23,064
Plaintiff, do you have anything else to say?

273
00:21:34,574 --> 00:21:38,764
How could you not understand the reality that the farmers are facing?

274
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:43,764
It takes several years just to turn a wasteland into farmable land!

275
00:21:43,764 --> 00:21:46,294
The three years that have been determined by national law

276
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:52,174
are way too short for tenant farmers to cultivate their land!

277
00:22:05,044 --> 00:22:12,054
If you feel it to be that unfair, then how about you change the law?

278
00:22:23,444 --> 00:22:26,354
How could you all do this to my hyeong!

279
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:27,394
Do you not have any sense of loyalty!

280
00:22:27,394 --> 00:22:29,804
Do you think we wanted to do that?

281
00:22:29,804 --> 00:22:34,294
Yeah, if you had never abandoned your hyeong alone and left, this never would have happened!

282
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:36,694
His family should take care of him! Why are you blaming us for?

283
00:22:36,694 --> 00:22:38,114
What did you...

284
00:22:38,114 --> 00:22:40,464
Let go of me! Let go!

285
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:42,524
- Hold him back! 
- Come here!

286
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:43,924
Come here!

287
00:22:43,924 --> 00:22:47,074
- Honey!
 - Yeong Sik's father!

288
00:22:49,464 --> 00:22:52,204
What's this?

289
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,044
Why does everyone look like that?

290
00:22:56,214 --> 00:23:01,124
By chance, were you all held as hostages by His Excellency Won?

291
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:04,594
We were just released.

292
00:23:05,614 --> 00:23:07,034
Of course.

293
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:09,234
There is no way Won Dae Han would have sat idly by.

294
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:11,864
Gosh, I know.

295
00:23:11,864 --> 00:23:16,094
He is supposed to be His Excellency, yet the way he acts...

296
00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:30,724
What is with the bag of rice?

297
00:23:30,724 --> 00:23:34,594
Oh, I heard the first day of next month is White Rice's birthday.

298
00:23:34,594 --> 00:23:36,164
I am going to make some rice cakes.

299
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,034
- We should have a first birthday feast for him. 
- Birthday?

300
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:40,354
Birthday, birthday, birthday.

301
00:23:40,354 --> 00:23:42,544
Birthday, my foot.

302
00:23:42,544 --> 00:23:45,214
Did she lack things to lie about that she would lie about her birthday?

303
00:23:45,214 --> 00:23:47,684
That sacred date!

304
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:49,884
Who are you saying lied about that!

305
00:23:49,884 --> 00:23:52,244
It really is that day—November 1st!

306
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:55,084
He was born on the first day of November, so it is easy to remember. 
  February 1st

307
00:23:55,084 --> 00:23:57,394
Chu Sal* bragged about it!
 (They called Chu Su by this name after he left home.)

308
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:04,044
How is having an easy birthday to remember something to brag about?

309
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:07,734
He is bragging about the weirdest things since it is his nephew.

310
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:11,134
Hyeongnim?

311
00:24:12,904 --> 00:24:14,664
Han Su.

312
00:24:15,514 --> 00:24:17,034
What?

313
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:18,934
Annoying bastard.

314
00:24:21,964 --> 00:24:24,784
What date did His Excellency Won get his property deed issued?

315
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:29,044
I saw in the deed that it was February 1st of this year.

316
00:24:29,044 --> 00:24:30,914
Right.

317
00:24:30,914 --> 00:24:32,454
February 1st.

318
00:24:32,454 --> 00:24:35,494
I am sure I saw it.

319
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:38,924
Why are you acting like this? You are scaring me.

320
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:41,514
C-Close your eyes.

321
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:45,744
Won Dae Han, you raccoon of an old man!

322
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,930
 Rice

323
00:24:51,844 --> 00:24:53,634
- Nice! 
- What is going on? Why are you like this?

324
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:55,274
Just high-five me for now!

325
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:57,294
All right!

326
00:24:58,374 --> 00:25:01,494
Nice! We won!

327
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:11,194
This is enough for a year's operating expenses for Sowongak, right?

328
00:25:11,194 --> 00:25:15,384
These are just the birthday gifts you have received.

329
00:25:15,384 --> 00:25:18,314
Just from the land you received from the late King, His Majesty,

330
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:20,074
you gain 17,000 cheok (Korean foot–11.9 inches) of rice every year,

331
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:24,114
and the land around your private residence in Soojin-bang has gone up quite a bit in value.

332
00:25:24,114 --> 00:25:27,064
So honestly, you are...

333
00:25:28,054 --> 00:25:30,134
quite rich, Princess.

334
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:35,394
Still, it was difficult to sustain everyone living around Mapo ferry dock.

335
00:25:35,394 --> 00:25:41,334
That is true, but you cannot keep taking care of them at Sowongak forever.

336
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:46,014
Of course, it would be best for them to find their own way to sustain themselves.

337
00:25:46,014 --> 00:25:47,904
But how?

338
00:25:47,904 --> 00:25:49,284
Pardon?

339
00:25:49,284 --> 00:25:54,094
I own land, so I live off of the produce of the land, but they do not have land.

340
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,614
Well,

341
00:25:55,614 --> 00:25:57,804
if they do not have land, they can be tenant farmers,

342
00:25:57,804 --> 00:26:00,994
or merchants or fishermen.

343
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:03,984
Or they could work in the palace and get paid a salary.

344
00:26:03,984 --> 00:26:07,384
But it would be nothing compared to those who own land.

345
00:26:09,774 --> 00:26:14,044
You are worried about the land property lawsuit, right?

346
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:17,864
I really hope Kang Han Su wins.

347
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:20,174
Not only would this be good for tenant farmers,

348
00:26:20,174 --> 00:26:24,344
but this is also a good opportunity to deal a blow to Minister Yu and the Hungu Party officials.

349
00:26:24,344 --> 00:26:26,554
That is why it will be even more difficult to win

350
00:26:26,554 --> 00:26:29,454
since Minister Yu will help him.

351
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:36,594
What if I distract Minister Yu?

352
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,604
How?

353
00:26:42,874 --> 00:26:47,304
What brings you all the way here, Princess?

354
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:50,504
I came to greet you formally.

355
00:26:50,504 --> 00:26:52,454
Together.

356
00:26:55,484 --> 00:26:57,364
 Mayor.

357
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:00,104
What is it?

358
00:27:00,104 --> 00:27:03,114
 Attorney Kang Han Su is here to see you.

359
00:27:03,114 --> 00:27:04,914
- Kang Han Su?
  - Yes.

360
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:09,054
 He says he wants to take a look at the land deed that the defendant has submitted.

361
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:15,074
Sit down.

362
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:21,234
The Princess has come all the way here, so you should not be absent.

363
00:27:47,774 --> 00:27:50,714
Please wait inside until we bring out the land deed.

364
00:27:50,714 --> 00:27:54,274
- I will go with him as well– 
- These are the orders of the Minister.

365
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:01,284
Follow me.

366
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,914
 This is no different than a palace.

367
00:28:49,004 --> 00:28:52,864
 Property Deed

368
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:28,294
So are you that famous attorney, Kang Han Su?

369
00:29:28,294 --> 00:29:30,174
Greetings, Your Excellency.

370
00:29:30,174 --> 00:29:33,964
It is my family's honor to meet you, Minister Yu.

371
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:38,284
You came at the most crucial time.

372
00:30:05,014 --> 00:30:07,734
This is your wedding gift.

373
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:35,044
Now that you have come to me in person and declared that you will marry my son,

374
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:40,194
as your loyal subject, I cannot continue to reject the offer.

375
00:30:40,194 --> 00:30:45,384
Thus, I have already given my permission to Ji Seon,

376
00:30:45,384 --> 00:30:49,544
and I told him that I would change the law.

377
00:30:49,544 --> 00:30:52,234
Change the law?

378
00:30:54,784 --> 00:30:56,844
Why are you so shocked?

379
00:30:56,844 --> 00:31:01,654
The law that does not help its people should be changed, of course.

380
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:05,834
If my son becomes the Princess's husband,

381
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:08,574
never mind working as an official of the Hanseongbu,

382
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:11,444
he will have to step down from many key posts.

383
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:14,854
That means we are losing an outstanding intellect.

384
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:18,514
It would be a great loss for the nation as well.

385
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:28,104
That is why I called you here.

386
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:35,714
Rather than me changing the law, it would be faster for you to stop this wedding.

387
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:38,744
I leave it in your hands.

388
00:31:40,694 --> 00:31:45,234
I have another meeting to go to. I'll take my leave, then.

389
00:31:56,924 --> 00:32:00,604
You have so many things to celebrate.

390
00:32:00,604 --> 00:32:03,534
I heard it was your birthday a couple of days ago.

391
00:32:03,534 --> 00:32:06,704
And today, I hear the news of your wedding.

392
00:32:06,704 --> 00:32:12,004
What should I congratulate you on tomorrow? Why not give me a heads-up?

393
00:32:13,864 --> 00:32:16,234
I will apologize in her place.

394
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:19,054
I apologize, Princess.

395
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:20,824
It is all right.

396
00:32:20,824 --> 00:32:24,474
I had prepared myself from the moment I met Minister Yu.

397
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:27,484
This will continue going forward as well.

398
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:33,644
You speak like you are about to go to war, not a wedding.

399
00:32:34,514 --> 00:32:41,124
The wedding of a princess is different than any other noble lady.

400
00:32:42,844 --> 00:32:45,054
Yes, yes, yes.

401
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:52,094
You have finally become a full-fledged princess.

402
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,194
If this is about the land dispute, let us go to Hanseongbu and discuss it there.

403
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:07,144
Well, I am not sure.

404
00:33:07,144 --> 00:33:09,244
I wonder if that is necessary.

405
00:33:09,244 --> 00:33:10,724
What do you mean by that?

406
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:16,094
I am saying Minister Yu already knows about it.

407
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:21,184
That His Excellency Won's deed was fabricated.

408
00:33:24,844 --> 00:33:28,094
 Property Deed

409
00:33:28,094 --> 00:33:32,374
 February 1st

410
00:33:32,374 --> 00:33:35,404
- Fabricated? 
- Are you sure?

411
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:37,424
If that were not the case,

412
00:33:37,424 --> 00:33:43,914
do you think Minister Yu summoned me here only to watch our love triangle on display?

413
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:58,724
- Where is the deed? 
- Did you not receive it?

414
00:34:03,744 --> 00:34:06,244
I knew this would be the case.

415
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,504
There is no way His Excellency Won would have done this legally.

416
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,874
W-Well, th-this is...

417
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:11,274
My apologies, Your Excellency!

418
00:34:11,274 --> 00:34:15,244
- I will notify His Excellency Won— 
- If you walk out now

419
00:34:15,244 --> 00:34:18,684
and bump into that Kang Han Su...

420
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:28,824
Your Excellency, let us just burn this.

421
00:34:28,824 --> 00:34:31,054
But if you burn the evidence...

422
00:34:31,054 --> 00:34:33,534
It is better in many aspects to say

423
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:36,564
he lost the evidence by mistake than get caught with fabricated evidence.

424
00:34:36,564 --> 00:34:39,554
- Earn time as well.
 - Give it to me.

425
00:35:25,604 --> 00:35:29,224
You should have told me sooner if you were suspecting something.

426
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:31,764
I would have helped you.

427
00:35:32,724 --> 00:35:34,784
You, Princess?

428
00:35:35,604 --> 00:35:37,884
What do you mean by that?

429
00:35:37,884 --> 00:35:43,024
As far as this land dispute case goes, do you not want His Excellency Won to win as well?

430
00:35:43,024 --> 00:35:47,914
Why? Because I am also a land owner?

431
00:35:47,914 --> 00:35:50,424
If His Excellency Won loses this case,

432
00:35:50,424 --> 00:35:54,434
would other land-owning nobles would be in an awkward position?

433
00:35:56,434 --> 00:35:57,924
Is that not true?

434
00:35:57,924 --> 00:36:03,454
If I said it is not so, would you believe me?

435
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:09,824
Of course...

436
00:36:10,854 --> 00:36:13,044
I cannot believe you.

437
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:18,304
Princess, the only things you have demonstrated to me

438
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,464
are lies.

439
00:36:20,464 --> 00:36:22,634
Lies.

440
00:36:22,634 --> 00:36:25,110
And lies.

441
00:36:25,764 --> 00:36:27,984
That is all you have shown me.

442
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:36,784
Do you even have any truth in you, Princess?

443
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:51,644
How did you feel... when you decided to avenge your father's death?

444
00:36:55,044 --> 00:36:58,084
You were only a dagger to me.

445
00:36:58,084 --> 00:37:01,304
A well-sharpened dagger.

446
00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:06,004
That is my only truth.

447
00:37:25,464 --> 00:37:28,314
I feel sorry for Mayor Yu.

448
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:31,914
I could say I was deceived by you, Princess. But how about him?

449
00:37:31,914 --> 00:37:38,504
He already knows your objective, yet he stands by your side,

450
00:37:38,504 --> 00:37:41,304
all the while opposing his own father.

451
00:37:41,304 --> 00:37:45,224
How will you handle all this retribution?

452
00:37:50,314 --> 00:37:52,814
I will handle all that.

453
00:37:56,794 --> 00:38:00,424
I think you should just focus on what you need to do.

454
00:38:06,254 --> 00:38:09,804
What is your reason for insisting that this document is fabricated?

455
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:12,164
When I checked it during the trial,

456
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,134
the day His Excellency Won was issued the deed was February 1st.

457
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:17,694
It was an official holiday for the governmental office.

458
00:38:17,694 --> 00:38:22,124
What government official would come out and work on an official holiday?

459
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:34,384
 February 7

460
00:38:34,384 --> 00:38:37,714
 February 7

461
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,984
Yes.

462
00:38:48,984 --> 00:38:54,364
As expected. As expected, you all are quite amazing.

463
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:57,604
The number has gotten bigger in that time already.

464
00:39:07,714 --> 00:39:12,294
I had come to help, yet I only got used.

465
00:39:13,904 --> 00:39:16,164
I am sorry.

466
00:39:16,164 --> 00:39:18,734
It is not your fault, Your Excellency.

467
00:39:23,644 --> 00:39:28,894
♫  At the sound of raindrops falling  ♫

468
00:39:28,894 --> 00:39:33,304
♫  One piece of forgotten memory  ♫

469
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:38,690
 Do you even have any truth in you, Princess?

470

♫  Turn back the time  ♫

471
00:39:44,264 --> 00:39:49,680

 Capital Salt

473
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,074
 You were only a dagger to me.

474
00:39:54,074 --> 00:39:57,044
 A well-sharpened dagger.

475
00:39:57,044 --> 00:40:02,064

481
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,490

Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim.

483
00:40:29,264 --> 00:40:32,644
So what happened? Did you check it?

484
00:40:35,004 --> 00:40:38,404
- I was one step too late. 
- What?

485
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,634
Where is the baby?

486
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:50,604
White Rice!

487
00:40:50,604 --> 00:40:52,504
What's wrong with our White Rice?

488
00:40:52,504 --> 00:40:54,514
Why is my baby so hot?

489
00:40:54,514 --> 00:40:56,644
His fever will not go down, Sister-in-law.

490
00:40:56,644 --> 00:41:00,624
I showed him to a physician, who said it was due to malnutrition.

491
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:04,574
Please open the door. Please?

492
00:41:04,574 --> 00:41:07,294
Do not say that to me. Go and get permission from the higher-ups.

493
00:41:07,294 --> 00:41:09,294
I will be punished harshly by opening it up for you.

494
00:41:09,294 --> 00:41:12,274
What is the big deal about getting butt flogged a few times?

495
00:41:12,274 --> 00:41:14,194
The baby is about to die...

496
00:41:14,194 --> 00:41:18,034
- It is my butt, not yours, you bitch. 
- That jerk...

497
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:24,764
Why?

498
00:41:24,764 --> 00:41:27,764
- Is it not enough?
 - No.

499
00:41:27,764 --> 00:41:29,664
Hurry up.

500
00:41:31,634 --> 00:41:33,874
Come here!

501
00:41:35,064 --> 00:41:37,784
My baby...

502
00:41:42,694 --> 00:41:45,444
I am so sorry!

503
00:41:48,224 --> 00:41:50,504
I am sorry...

504
00:41:58,134 --> 00:42:00,664
What are you doing here?

505
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:07,054
It is all my fault.

506
00:42:07,054 --> 00:42:10,194
It is because I lived a terrible life ignoring duty and the law.

507
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,694
That is why everything is going all wrong.

508
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:15,554
It is not over yet.

509
00:42:15,554 --> 00:42:20,674
They say if I cause others to shed tears, I will eventually shed bloody tears.

510
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:23,764
It is all retribution for all the wrongs I have committed.

511
00:42:23,764 --> 00:42:29,524
My hyeongnim was punished in my place, and that is why I lost the lawsuit as well.

512
00:42:35,934 --> 00:42:38,884
No. Come to your senses, Jeong Chu Sal.

513
00:42:38,884 --> 00:42:41,704
It is not over yet. Okay?

514
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:45,574
- Who says you lost? 
- You said there is no other way!

515
00:42:45,574 --> 00:42:49,554
We are failing in everything we are trying to do!

516
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:55,184
Grand Merchant was right.

517
00:42:55,184 --> 00:42:58,244
He said you would have no choice, either.

518
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:00,394
Yes.

519
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:03,684
We cannot defeat powerful aristocrats.

520
00:43:04,854 --> 00:43:07,564
How would we ever do that?

521
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:33,464
 Hyeong did not give up, no matter how many times he failed.

522
00:43:49,734 --> 00:43:51,894
Are you all right?

523
00:43:54,124 --> 00:43:57,204
Aigoo. Be careful, careful...

524
00:44:01,804 --> 00:44:03,834
I am fine.

525
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:10,104
White Rice!

526
00:44:11,594 --> 00:44:14,694
- Gosh, be careful. 
- You worked hard.

527
00:44:32,194 --> 00:44:34,124
Come on!

528
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:46,384
Geez, why is it so hot today?

529
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:00,724
Did you call for me, Grand Merchant?

530
00:45:13,284 --> 00:45:14,834
 Hyeongnim!

531
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:17,174
- Hyeongnim!
- What?

532
00:45:17,174 --> 00:45:21,454
Hyeongnim, Chu Sal is giving up on pursuing the lawsuit!

533
00:45:21,454 --> 00:45:24,554
- What? Where is he?
- Hurry! Hurry!

534
00:45:24,554 --> 00:45:26,454
Stop right there!

535
00:45:26,454 --> 00:45:28,754
Let me see.

536
00:45:28,754 --> 00:45:30,024
Borrow the ownership?

537
00:45:30,024 --> 00:45:32,604
I heard His Excellency Won fabricated the document.

538
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,374
And you have lost your chance to prove that fact.

539
00:45:35,374 --> 00:45:39,834
You have to fight against illegality with another illegality.

540
00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:42,004
So?

541
00:45:42,004 --> 00:45:44,594
We can also fabricate the document.

542
00:45:44,594 --> 00:45:46,684
Before the property deed was issued to His Excellency Won,

543
00:45:46,684 --> 00:45:52,314
we can make it so it looks like Jeong sold that land to someone else.

544
00:45:52,314 --> 00:45:54,934
And that "someone else" is the Royal Assets?

545
00:45:54,934 --> 00:45:56,584
R-Royal Assets?

546
00:45:56,584 --> 00:46:00,564
If it is the Royal Assets, they manage the royal family's wealth. Then...

547
00:46:00,564 --> 00:46:02,704
They would submit a set amount of crops to the Royal Assets.

548
00:46:02,704 --> 00:46:04,864
But they would be exempt from paying the taxes.

549
00:46:04,864 --> 00:46:10,724
More than anything, Jeong's family could live off that land for the rest of their lives.

550
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:12,784
He says it is the same as letting the Royal Assets have the title.

551
00:46:12,784 --> 00:46:15,774
It is the same as having the land as our own.

552
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:17,594
Who is it?

553
00:46:17,594 --> 00:46:20,414
Who came up with such a nonsensical idea?

554
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:22,254
It was me.

555
00:46:35,054 --> 00:46:38,244
Rather than losing the entire land that they worked on after losing the lawsuit,

556
00:46:38,244 --> 00:46:40,444
even if you have to cheat a little bit,

557
00:46:40,444 --> 00:46:44,514
would it not be much more advantageous to figure out a way to make a living in the future?

558
00:46:44,514 --> 00:46:45,774
What?

559
00:46:45,774 --> 00:46:49,614
If you say he turned it over to the Royal Assets rather than an ordinary aristocrat,

560
00:46:49,614 --> 00:46:53,604
I am sure His Excellency Won will not be able to drag and hang onto it.

561
00:46:54,364 --> 00:46:57,874
You are like a cat worrying about the mouse he is about to kill.

562
00:46:57,874 --> 00:47:00,690
Are you sure you are not trying to increase the Royal Assets

563
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,730
by using the excuse of helping the farmers?

564
00:47:02,734 --> 00:47:05,094
Take a look at yourself.

565
00:47:05,094 --> 00:47:07,814
You are pushing these people off the cliff in order to blow off the steam.

566
00:47:07,814 --> 00:47:10,284
What nonsense.

567
00:47:16,774 --> 00:47:18,834
Even then, they would be tenant farming.

568
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:21,804
Nothing would change the fact that they will eat off of someone else's land!

569
00:47:21,804 --> 00:47:23,584
If they wanted to stand up on their own,

570
00:47:23,584 --> 00:47:26,584
they should have been much more clever than now.

571
00:47:26,584 --> 00:47:28,294
Because they did not know how to read or know the law,

572
00:47:28,294 --> 00:47:30,764
your client got robbed with his eyes wide open!

573
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,344
They still cannot stand on their own.

574
00:47:32,344 --> 00:47:34,364
They need to get help from someone.

575
00:47:34,364 --> 00:47:38,054
I see. They cannot stand on their own? Who?

576
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:40,644
The farmers?

577
00:47:40,644 --> 00:47:46,244
Are you saying that after standing out in the rice field under the scorching sun, even for 15 minutes?

578
00:47:52,354 --> 00:47:54,574
What are you doing?

579
00:47:56,644 --> 00:47:58,244
Look.

580
00:48:01,654 --> 00:48:03,574
Only one day.

581
00:48:03,574 --> 00:48:05,264
Okay?

582
00:48:06,054 --> 00:48:09,194
I carried rocks and wood to build an embankment.

583
00:48:09,194 --> 00:48:11,204
Exactly one day.

584
00:48:11,924 --> 00:48:16,424
My entire body became a wreck only after a few hours.

585
00:48:16,424 --> 00:48:19,574
My limbs were trembling, and I could not breathe.

586
00:48:19,574 --> 00:48:23,084
When this one day would become two days,

587
00:48:23,084 --> 00:48:26,174
three days, four days, ten days,

588
00:48:26,174 --> 00:48:28,514
a hundred days, and a year,

589
00:48:28,514 --> 00:48:30,704
the new skin will grow where the bloody blisters were

590
00:48:30,704 --> 00:48:33,084
and repeat tearing up the skin and hoping the new grows again.

591
00:48:33,084 --> 00:48:36,594
That is how the entire body becomes so painful.

592
00:48:36,594 --> 00:48:40,664
All the farmers have all kinds of pain in their backs, shoulders, and limbs!

593
00:48:40,664 --> 00:48:45,354
They endure the pain they feel in their entire body and when the sun rises in the morning,

594
00:48:46,264 --> 00:48:48,814
they go out to the fields again.

595
00:48:48,814 --> 00:48:53,354
And you say what? People like them cannot stand on their own?

596
00:48:53,354 --> 00:48:55,594
They are already standing on their two feet

597
00:48:55,594 --> 00:48:59,744
and are supporting their own lives as well as this entire nation!

598
00:48:59,744 --> 00:49:03,234
How could you suggest illegality to people like that?

599
00:49:03,234 --> 00:49:06,914
Oh, right. Is that what you call the power of a princess?

600
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:09,784
Is this the way of the royal family?

601
00:49:14,854 --> 00:49:19,554
If not... do you have another way?

602
00:49:21,184 --> 00:49:24,704
See? You do not.

603
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:33,764
Talking big without a solution. Is that not more irresponsible?

604
00:49:36,354 --> 00:49:38,554
Tomorrow is the conclusion of the trial.

605
00:49:38,554 --> 00:49:45,784
Either you find a way to help your client or accept my offer.

606
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:49,104
You will have to make a choice.

607
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:39,634
I heard tomorrow is the conclusion of His Excellency Won's land dispute.

608
00:50:39,634 --> 00:50:41,824
Yes, Your Majesty.

609
00:50:41,824 --> 00:50:45,044
Will you be going to watch the trial, Left State Minister?

610
00:50:45,044 --> 00:50:51,824
As for me, I do not own much land, and I am not interested in disputes at all.

611
00:50:51,824 --> 00:50:53,924
I see.

612
00:50:53,924 --> 00:50:58,954
I guess not all Hungu Party members own a lot of land.

613
00:50:58,954 --> 00:51:01,834
That is correct, Your Majesty.

614
00:51:02,824 --> 00:51:04,704
Then...

615
00:51:05,364 --> 00:51:10,614
I guess not all Hungu Party members believe in the same thing.

616
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:17,404
Left State Minister, I am very lonely.

617
00:51:17,404 --> 00:51:19,464
Your Majesty.

618
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:33,834
 The last day of the trial

619
00:51:33,834 --> 00:51:37,524
In any case, the tenant farmers are the problem.

620
00:51:37,524 --> 00:51:42,384
They should be grateful to us for lending our land to farm and do their best in their work.

621
00:51:42,384 --> 00:51:45,734
Trying to develop wasteland needlessly and whatnot...

622
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:47,214
I know.

623
00:51:47,214 --> 00:51:51,774
I mean, just because they own some land, it does not mean they will become nobles.

624
00:51:51,774 --> 00:51:54,694
They only save on a little bit of the property usage cost.

625
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,814
Why do they work so hard for it?

626
00:51:55,814 --> 00:51:58,434
Why do they spew nonsense eating perfectly good food?

627
00:51:58,434 --> 00:52:02,894
Even over the small amount of taxes, we cross over this world and the afterlife a dozen times over!

628
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:06,224
It is because those aristocrats, who know nothing of the real world, deal with the law.

629
00:52:06,224 --> 00:52:09,464
That is why we are suffering so much loss!

630
00:52:24,984 --> 00:52:27,084
Your Excellency the Mayor.

631
00:52:30,584 --> 00:52:34,834
I, Kang Han Su, the attorney for the plaintiff, have something to tell you.

632
00:52:34,834 --> 00:52:36,854
What is it?

633
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,664
I will...

634
00:52:41,804 --> 00:52:44,254
give up on this lawsuit.

635
00:52:44,254 --> 00:52:46,824
 What did he say?

636
00:52:46,824 --> 00:52:49,224
 What's going on?

637
00:52:57,584 --> 00:53:01,084
You will give up on this case?

638
00:53:01,084 --> 00:53:02,784
Yes.

639
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:09,014
We wish to take away the cow and put everything back the way it was.

640
00:53:09,014 --> 00:53:11,154
Back to the way it was?

641
00:53:16,204 --> 00:53:19,120
♫  Run away  ♫

642
00:53:21,964 --> 00:53:24,334
♫  We got the liar  ♫

643
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:28,904
They had built an embarkment by moving the rocks and dirt on someone else's land.

♫  Burning in my heart 
 A search for the light of justice  ♫

645
00:53:34,714 --> 00:53:37,524
I told them to take

646
00:53:37,524 --> 00:53:39,284
 all of that away.

647
00:53:39,284 --> 00:53:41,834
♫  Run away  ♫

648
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:44,484
I-If they take all that away...

652
00:54:05,634 --> 00:54:08,394
Aigoo, my land! My land!

653
00:54:09,254 --> 00:54:12,314
Th-The land. Where did it go?

654
00:54:12,314 --> 00:54:13,744
Aigoo, my land!

655
00:54:13,744 --> 00:54:16,724
Aigoo, my land!

656
00:54:24,274 --> 00:54:27,114
Y-You wretch!

657
00:54:27,874 --> 00:54:29,874
Give back my land!

658
00:54:29,874 --> 00:54:31,164
You!

659
00:54:31,164 --> 00:54:34,864
My fertile and rich land!

660
00:54:34,864 --> 00:54:37,984
You scumbag! What in the world did you do?

661
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:40,514
I just put it back the way it was.

662
00:54:40,514 --> 00:54:41,704
What did you say?

663
00:54:41,704 --> 00:54:45,484
You work the land from the beginning yourself, Your Excellency.

664
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:50,174
Exactly the same way my hyeongnim worked the land!

665
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:56,314
Aigoo, my land! My land...

666
00:55:03,344 --> 00:55:05,374
Let me see.

667
00:55:06,434 --> 00:55:11,704
About nine months ago, you had claimed to cultivate it in February.

668
00:55:11,704 --> 00:55:15,284
So you have about two years and three months remaining.

669
00:55:15,964 --> 00:55:18,414
Will you be able to do it?

670
00:55:18,414 --> 00:55:22,214
Your Excellency, you must get slaves to cultivate the land from scratch.

671
00:55:22,214 --> 00:55:23,694
What slaves?

672
00:55:23,694 --> 00:55:26,334
The cost of slaves is as expensive as gold these days!

673
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:30,774
How about you use the slaves in your residence?

674
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:33,714
Then, who would work on the household tasks?

675
00:55:33,714 --> 00:55:36,904
But someone would have to work the land, is that not so?

676
00:55:36,904 --> 00:55:40,024
That is why I picked Jeong's land!

677
00:55:40,024 --> 00:55:43,754
If I were going to work the land by spending my own money and slaves,

678
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:46,204
why would I be here pursuing this lawsuit?

679
00:55:46,204 --> 00:55:47,974
What you are saying is

680
00:55:47,974 --> 00:55:52,554
you meant to steal away the land that Jeong had worked hard on.

681
00:56:02,444 --> 00:56:04,684
I will give up the land!

682
00:56:07,834 --> 00:56:10,244
Will you do that?

683
00:56:12,454 --> 00:56:13,974
 Property Deed

684
00:56:13,974 --> 00:56:18,354
That land belongs to your family now.

685
00:56:20,104 --> 00:56:22,274
Thank you.

686
00:56:22,274 --> 00:56:24,314
Thank you so much, Sir.

687
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,924
Congrats.

688
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,494
I will never forget what you did, even in my death, Attorney Kang.

689
00:56:29,494 --> 00:56:31,064
Come on. Now, now.

690
00:56:31,064 --> 00:56:33,204
Thank you, sir!

691
00:56:44,604 --> 00:56:48,414
You said you would cause havoc for everyone involved. And you sure did.

692
00:56:48,414 --> 00:56:51,604
Without even getting help from the Princess, it looks like

693
00:56:51,604 --> 00:56:55,474
my father will hear some complaints from the Hungu Party members.

694
00:56:56,804 --> 00:57:01,514
However, you cannot say that Chu Sal gained the land that his brother had cultivated.

695
00:57:01,514 --> 00:57:05,394
Why did you use such a reckless and dramatic method?

696
00:57:06,454 --> 00:57:09,514
It was all Chu Sal's wish.

697
00:57:09,514 --> 00:57:12,914
Even if everything they worked on becomes nothing,

698
00:57:12,914 --> 00:57:15,204
he asked that they just get the land back.

699
00:57:15,204 --> 00:57:18,944
So that the farmers cultivating wastelands will not face injustice,

700
00:57:18,944 --> 00:57:22,724
he asked that this case would set precedence.

701
00:57:22,724 --> 00:57:29,814
When he was ready to lose everything, we finally saw a way.

702
00:57:40,914 --> 00:57:42,824
Now...

703
00:57:48,014 --> 00:57:50,224
By chance, did you...

704
00:57:50,224 --> 00:57:55,094
Yes. That was a wetland that was already underwater.

705
00:58:02,074 --> 00:58:04,944
 They only moved the stakes and said they demolished the embankment.

706
00:58:04,944 --> 00:58:09,834
 I only said that, and that idiotic His Excellency Won fell for it.

707
00:58:12,684 --> 00:58:16,534
I mean, how could he mistake this land for that land?

708
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:20,194
His Excellency Won never had an intention to work this land,

709
00:58:20,194 --> 00:58:22,884
so he had no idea of the exact location of the land.

710
00:58:22,884 --> 00:58:27,854
He only had to think of a way to take this land.

711
00:58:27,854 --> 00:58:30,354
What if he had caught on?

712
00:58:39,574 --> 00:58:41,474
Well, I am not sure about that.

713
00:58:42,694 --> 00:58:47,644
 If he had caught on, I am sure they would have demolished the embankment for real.

714
00:58:47,644 --> 00:58:50,034
What was important to Attorney Kang

715
00:58:50,034 --> 00:58:55,204
was not to benefit them right away but benefit the future of the farmers.

716
00:58:55,204 --> 00:59:00,654
I guess he did not want this case to set disadvantageous precedence for the tenant farmers.

717
00:59:00,654 --> 00:59:05,354
Yes. That is why he fought so desperately.

718
00:59:07,724 --> 00:59:12,074
By chance, have you ever thought of this?

719
00:59:13,624 --> 00:59:16,744
Perhaps what changes the world

720
00:59:16,744 --> 00:59:22,454
is not power but the sincere yearning of the people.

721
00:59:25,624 --> 00:59:31,794
 The royal court and the royal family only have to provide people trust

722
00:59:36,694 --> 00:59:40,904
 that they can earn back for the diligent effort they put into their work.

723
00:59:42,774 --> 00:59:44,814
 How much is this?

724
00:59:47,214 --> 00:59:53,304
 Did Joseon really... built that type of faith and trust with its people?

725
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:21,294
- Look! 
- You sure are White Rice!

726
01:00:21,294 --> 01:00:22,854
Good job!

727
01:00:24,104 --> 01:00:26,804
Pick one. Take one!

728
01:00:26,804 --> 01:00:29,544
He should pick a brush or a book.

729
01:00:29,544 --> 01:00:32,704
- Look at him. 
- White Rice.

730
01:00:32,704 --> 01:00:34,134
Look at him.

731
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:35,564
- He should grab the book. 
- I know.

732
01:00:35,564 --> 01:00:37,614
I will raise him to be great.

733
01:00:37,614 --> 01:00:40,634
Draw some pretty pictures, okay?

734
01:00:42,154 --> 01:00:46,254
I am so shy about having to say this, but...

735
01:00:47,104 --> 01:00:54,064
Sister-in-law and I decided that we will name White Rice, Han Su.

736
01:00:54,974 --> 01:00:56,534
Huh?

737
01:01:00,894 --> 01:01:03,424
Will that be okay?

738
01:01:06,764 --> 01:01:10,904
Geez, what the heck? What is wrong with everyone?

739
01:01:10,904 --> 01:01:13,814
I mean, last time, that new bride Yeong—

740
01:01:13,814 --> 01:01:15,324
Y-You know Yeong Sil, right?

741
01:01:15,324 --> 01:01:20,064
She also said she would name her child Han Su.

742
01:01:20,064 --> 01:01:21,894
Really?

743
01:01:21,894 --> 01:01:25,534
Then, there will be so many people with the name Han Su!

744
01:01:25,534 --> 01:01:29,014
Aigoo, I hope the name is the only thing they have in common.

745
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:36,474
We prepared a lot, so eat until you explode.

746
01:01:36,474 --> 01:01:38,594
- Eat up. 
- Okay.

747
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:40,754
- Please eat. 
- Although it's not much.

748
01:01:40,754 --> 01:01:42,814
- Is it not good? 
- It's delicious!

749
01:01:42,814 --> 01:01:45,044
- So good! 
- Please eat.

750
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,664
I delivered it, Your Highness.

751
01:02:20,664 --> 01:02:22,574
Good work.

752
01:02:50,574 --> 01:02:57,794
Thanks to you, I was able to resolve the case very well on my own.

753
01:02:57,794 --> 01:03:00,744
I was pretty pissed off about it.

754
01:03:01,504 --> 01:03:03,794
Your grace is boundless...

755
01:03:05,644 --> 01:03:09,984
Your Highness the Princess.

756
01:03:11,894 --> 01:03:14,674
I am glad you found it helpful.

757
01:03:27,254 --> 01:03:30,444
However, please do only one thing from now on.

758
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:36,064
Whether it is hypocrisy... or trying to put up a front.

759
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:56,760
 Jo's Mercantile

760
01:04:06,834 --> 01:04:09,104
Why? So Won—

761
01:04:09,104 --> 01:04:11,024
No.

762
01:04:11,024 --> 01:04:13,624
Is it about the Princess?

763
01:04:13,624 --> 01:04:17,504
So why are you so mean to her?

764
01:04:17,504 --> 01:04:20,934
Because she lied? Or because she's a princess?

765
01:04:20,934 --> 01:04:23,554
Because she is endangering herself.

766
01:04:23,554 --> 01:04:25,074
What?

767
01:04:32,084 --> 01:04:34,234
What is this...

768
01:04:42,834 --> 01:04:47,814
 His Majesty told me that the new chief advisor incident stemmed from a saloon in Namchon.

769
01:04:47,814 --> 01:04:51,074
 That place could be Minister Yu's intel source.

770
01:04:52,704 --> 01:04:58,964
Wow, it looks to be Princess is quite bent on revenge.

771
01:04:58,964 --> 01:05:01,714
To send you a note like this in the midst of all that.

772
01:05:01,714 --> 01:05:06,074
Why do all the women in my life not know how to care for themselves?

773
01:05:06,074 --> 01:05:07,264
All the women who?

774
01:05:07,264 --> 01:05:11,164
My mother was like that all her life, and Princess is like that, too. And...

775
01:05:13,334 --> 01:05:15,224
my Eun Su.

776
01:05:16,504 --> 01:05:19,044
You are right.

777
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:23,234
All the women in your life are all better than you, Hyeongnim.

778
01:05:23,234 --> 01:05:25,804
Yeah. They're better than you, too.

779
01:05:25,804 --> 01:05:29,270
Well? I guess so.

780
01:05:30,634 --> 01:05:36,214
In any case, our Eun Su must have a baby by now.

781
01:05:37,084 --> 01:05:39,514
Hyeongnim, do you not want to see your niece or nephew?

782
01:05:39,514 --> 01:05:41,024
Niece or nephew?

783
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:45,604
- Do you want to go for a visit? 
- Niece or nephew?

784
01:05:45,604 --> 01:05:48,484
Should I? No, no...

785
01:05:48,484 --> 01:05:51,684
Should I sneak and peek? No, no.

786
01:05:51,684 --> 01:05:54,224
No, no, no.

787
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,094
Niece or nephew.

788
01:06:23,834 --> 01:06:26,144
Mother and Father.

789
01:06:27,164 --> 01:06:32,720
You are keeping your eyes on our Eun Su, right?

790
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:37,070
 Lady Lee | Kang Eon Jik

791
01:06:59,104 --> 01:07:01,014
Stay here.

792
01:08:08,324 --> 01:08:10,264
What is going on?

793
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,874
Mayor Yu?

794
01:08:29,094 --> 01:08:31,514
It is nothing.

795
01:08:32,214 --> 01:08:34,654
Please go in, Young Master.

796
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:25,310

797
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,944
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

798
01:09:39,944 --> 01:09:43,454
 My father is Kang Han Su's enemy and caused his parents' death.

799
01:09:43,454 --> 01:09:46,974
 You must be mistaken, Young Master.

800
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:51,684
 I had promised Princess to let that man live.

801
01:09:51,684 --> 01:09:55,564
 However, there will not be any mercy the second time around.

802
01:09:57,424 --> 01:10:00,644
 Do you know what I really hate?

803
01:10:02,654 --> 01:10:05,704
 Do not marry him.

804
01:10:05,704 --> 01:10:10,834
 Your unnecessarily tough resolve and your dangerous determination...

805
01:10:11,984 --> 01:10:14,214
 I will not allow it.
