1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:03,016
(All people, incidents, and periods in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:11,996
You should have had a better idea of the man before appointing him,

3
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:16,295
instead of blindly choosing someone who is with the Sarim...

4
00:00:16,296 --> 00:00:19,365
just to hold me in check.

5
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:24,846
This is why I am unable to resign.

6
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:31,246
It is because you do not trust me.

7
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:34,986
I have served...

8
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:38,286
three kings until this day.

9
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:43,694
Your Majesty's grandfather was a brave general...

10
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:45,596
and a brilliant ruler.

11
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:50,434
His sons passed precipitously without achieving anything...

12
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:54,106
although they were the sons of the King.

13
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:59,346
You are sitting there...

14
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:01,876
only because you are of his blood.

15
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:07,346
Your subjects...

16
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:10,685
take state exams and go through promotions...

17
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:13,656
to cultivate their own positions.

18
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:16,695
There is nothing we earn for free.

19
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:19,565
However,

20
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:21,695
you have earned nothing,

21
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,395
and on top of that,

22
00:01:23,895 --> 00:01:25,906
you are under a regency.

23
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:29,475
So who could fully trust and follow you?

24
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:38,786
You are saying I have earned this throne for free.

25
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:43,115
Which means...

26
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:46,656
you want me to prove that I am worthy of this.

27
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:48,096
If you do,

28
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:51,195
I will give you my submission.

29
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,725
Yes.

30
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,635
Nothing you said is wrong.

31
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:59,205
You are correct.

32
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:08,675
From now on,

33
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:12,215
I will become a king who achieves something...

34
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,385
for this land of Joseon and its people.

35
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:18,126
My biggest achievement shall be...

36
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:27,026
destroying the powerful Yoo Je Se, who defies the royal authority,

37
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:30,336
and restoring the power upon the throne.

38
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:34,675
Will you keep your eyes on me?

39
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:46,316
Yes.

40
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:51,015
It would be a great honour...

41
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:53,526
when everything comes through.

42
00:02:55,596 --> 00:02:57,996
If you could cast me away,

43
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,966
it will become your greatest achievement...

44
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:04,536
among every achievement you make from this day on.

45
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:13,005
However, I have bad news.

46
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:21,216
You will no longer be able to use the sword you sharpened...

47
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:25,086
to point at me.

48
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:32,265
My sister and Kang Han Soo are in danger.

49
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:35,896
Ask Magistrate Yoo for help.

50
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:55,216
What are you doing here?

51
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:57,716
His Majesty sent an urgent message.

52
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:13,336
Grandmother, it is I, Yeon Joo.

53
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:19,604
What brings you here at this late hour?

54
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:21,006
My apologies, Grandmother.

55
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:22,776
It is about Kang Han Soo.

56
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:24,615
What did you do with him?

57
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:28,555
That is none of your concern.

58
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:41,995
If you wish to shut his mouth to keep Uncle's secret,

59
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:45,735
you will have to keep my mouth shut as well.

60
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,646
So the rumours were true.

61
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:56,715
What do you mean?

62
00:04:56,716 --> 00:05:00,386
That scandalous rumour of a princess who associates with an attorney.

63
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:04,586
How have you behaved out there...

64
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:07,026
to cause a vulgar rumour like this?

65
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:12,125
How can you taint the honour of the Royal Family?

66
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:13,365
Grandmother.

67
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:25,745
It is for your sake,

68
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:28,516
for the Royal Family's sake,

69
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:30,576
and for the sake of Joseon!

70
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:35,786
If you are trying to hurt him because of me,

71
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:37,716
please reconsider.

72
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:40,526
I will never meet that man again.

73
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:42,425
From now on,

74
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:45,026
I will never be involved with him again.

75
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:47,665
So please, Grandmother.

76
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:02,315
What does he mean to you...

77
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:05,045
for you to take things this far?

78
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:08,355
I have...

79
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:12,725
made a promise to keep him safe.

80
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:14,826
What?

81
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:17,725
It is a promise I made to myself.

82
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:21,665
I am...

83
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:23,435
a princess of this kingdom.

84
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:28,136
Please let me keep my promise.

85
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:48,425
I will let him live.

86
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,125
However,

87
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:53,925
I will not keep him by your side.

88
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:56,966
Do you understand?

89
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,706
It worked.

90
00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:12,946
Where am I?

91
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:15,586
Where...

92
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:34,165
(Attorney for Hire)

93
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,346
Let go!

94
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:53,925
Wait.

95
00:07:56,855 --> 00:07:58,625
I do not understand.

96
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:03,365
It cannot be true, So Won.

97
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:11,805
It is.

98
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,526
What a mess!

99
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:27,856
How dare you say that?

100
00:08:28,156 --> 00:08:29,996
What? How dare I say what?

101
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:31,695
How dare I say what?

102
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:01,455
This means...

103
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:05,496
Magistrate Yoo, you already knew everything.

104
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:16,736
Where are you going?

105
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:20,445
I thought you came to arrest me.

106
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:22,315
Take me away.

107
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,146
Well, Her Highness is here...

108
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:28,715
to be your witness in person.

109
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:30,256
Wait.

110
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:32,886
You will not arrest me...

111
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:35,795
just because the Princess has said a few words?

112
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:41,835
How do you know she is not lying?

113
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:43,496
She is only human.

114
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:46,506
Kang Han Soo.

115
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:48,335
And...

116
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:51,335
she is the worst liar...

117
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:56,715
among the people I know.

118
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:00,886
Have you lost your mind?

119
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:03,385
Whether you are guilty or not, once you are confined for murder,

120
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:04,756
you will still be interrogated.

121
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,226
You may be killed before you are exonerated.

122
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:08,425
Do you think...

123
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:12,825
that I do not know that as an attorney?

124
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:15,136
- Then, why? - Because...

125
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:18,434
I would rather be killed...

126
00:10:18,435 --> 00:10:20,565
before I let the Princess help me.

127
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:26,075
Now, let us go.

128
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:28,246
I am going,

129
00:10:29,315 --> 00:10:31,175
so clarify every single detail...

130
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:34,945
of how this bloodstained dagger ended up on my ship...

131
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:37,085
when I did not kill anyone!

135
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:35,345
I am glad to see you.

136
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:37,146
This must be our single log bridge.

137
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:41,185
I cannot believe that you are already reinstated.

138
00:11:41,856 --> 00:11:43,756
Congratulations, my lord.

139
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:47,786
Stop with your cunning tongue!

140
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:52,366
What made you think you could murder Lord Chu?

141
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:54,925
How dare you?

142
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:58,095
I did not murder him.

143
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:00,065
You even give false testimony now?

144
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:03,406
Are you not afraid of the divine punishment?

145
00:12:04,575 --> 00:12:06,675
- I did not kill him. - Then,

146
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:09,016
how do you explain...

147
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:12,585
this bloodstained dagger found at your place?

148
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,685
I do not know.

149
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:20,486
Is that right?

150
00:12:23,226 --> 00:12:25,496
Keep playing innocent. We will see...

151
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:28,636
how long you last.

152
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:51,256
Wait.

153
00:12:56,726 --> 00:13:00,226
I came inside to pack up and found these.

154
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:21,116
I am sorry I yelled at you.

155
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,116
In hindsight,

156
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,925
it was my fault.

157
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,036
I gave you a dagger for no good reason...

158
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:46,646
and ended up scaring you.

159
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:18,675
(These are...)

160
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:21,876
These are...

161

162

Do not worry.

(I will protect you.)

165
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:53,444
You should have handed it to the government office.

166
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:55,276
Of course, I did!

167
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:00,486

168
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:05,656
My apologies.

169
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:08,156
So, you do not know...

170

who or where Princess Yeon Joo is?

171
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:17,095
A woman of So Won's social status...

172
00:15:17,195 --> 00:15:20,505
working officially for the magistrate of Hanseongbu?

00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:24,505
as you have many connections.

175
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,106
But what about So Won?

176
00:15:44,996 --> 00:15:46,095
No.

177
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:50,136
I am sure I can help.

178
00:15:50,295 --> 00:15:52,065
That is why I returned to the palace.

179
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:53,506
I know that,

180
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:55,476
but not now, and not here.

181
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:58,205
Attorney Kang is the strongest here.

182
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,075
He will save himself.

183
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:06,845
You can do what you are capable of, Your Highness.

184
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:08,585
You must not provide a reason...

185
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:11,486
for the Royal Court or my father by acting so recklessly.

186
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:19,126
You are well-aware of what kind of person my father is.

187
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:30,776
Just a moment.

188
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:42,315
I want to help you by your side.

189
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:45,685
Please...

190
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:48,825
utilize me.

191
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:51,996
I will let him live. However,

192
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:54,626
I will not keep him by your side.

193
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:13,216
You asked me to use you last time.

194
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:17,456
May I do that?

195
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:29,766
Where...

196
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:33,904
There you are! Han Soo!

197
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:37,435
Dong Chi!

198
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:40,205
- Did it hurt? - It hurt so much.

199
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:42,516
Look at you. Your cheeks are sunken in.

200
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:47,686
You are crazy!

201
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:50,354
You should eat at a time like this.

202
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:52,115
Why are you skipping meals?

203
00:17:52,226 --> 00:17:54,054
I cannot trust them.

204
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:56,355
What? What do you mean?

205
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:04,365
Oh, goodness.

206
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:09,850
You should have let the Princess help you.

207
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,246
Why did you have to...

208
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:14,099
I will kill you when I get out.

209
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:20,615
So, did you find anything?

210
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:25,956
I could not help but think that it was Master Cho.

211
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:29,055
- Hang on. - Master Cho?

212
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:32,526
- This. - What is that?

213
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,165
This is...

214
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,466
the favourite snack of Cho's Guild.

215
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:43,936
Gosh.

216
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:51,176
What?

217
00:18:56,456 --> 00:18:58,084
They were always chewing this,

218
00:18:58,085 --> 00:19:00,655
and they spat it out to anyone and picked a fight.

219
00:19:25,585 --> 00:19:27,416
Did Master Cho get on Minister Yoo's side...

220
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:29,716
after Lord Chu died?

221
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:35,026
First, how about I find the guy that put the dagger in our office?

222
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:37,025
Maybe the nearby merchants saw them.

223
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:38,295
No.

224
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:41,226
They framed me intentionally.

225
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,365
They must have moved away from people's eyes.

226
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:54,105
It will be hard to find the real murderer of Lord Chu.

227
00:19:55,615 --> 00:19:56,946
Try a different approach.

228
00:19:57,615 --> 00:19:59,016
Like how?

229
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:00,345
Prove that...

230
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,885
I could not have killed Lord Chu...

231
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:06,655
that day.

232
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:15,095
My lady, Master Han Soo...

233
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:17,065
got arrested for murder.

234
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:19,436
My brother got arrested?

235
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:26,476
Dong Chi!

236
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:28,945
What did he say?

237
00:20:28,946 --> 00:20:31,216
Is there a way to get Master Cho's people?

238
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:36,354
He says the situation is dire.

239
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:37,885
What? Then...

240
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:40,186
Then,

241
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:41,986
is he just going to die like that?

242
00:20:43,095 --> 00:20:46,495
Stop sighing and say something, Dong Chi.

243
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,696
Hold on.

244
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:50,436
What is that?

245
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,476
To find witnesses or testifiers,

246
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:00,575
you will need money.

247
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:20,125
How much is all this?

248
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,895
Dong Chi, look.

249
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:26,706
- Gosh. - What...

250
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,246
- It is so pretty. - Look at this binyeo.

251
00:22:04,635 --> 00:22:09,776
(Sowongak)

252
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,716
I heard my brother was arrested for murder.

253
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:19,355
Is this true?

254
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:29,595
It seems...

255
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:32,335
the Grand Queen Dowager has made a move.

256
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:34,364
The Grand Queen Dowager?

257
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:36,175
The Princess cannot have...

258
00:22:36,176 --> 00:22:38,776
the life of a merchant house broker forever.

259
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:42,915
She may be dressed in lowly clothes and behave ignorantly,

260
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,375
but she is still a princess.

261
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:47,015
She even meddles with other people's lawsuits...

262
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:49,654
in league with a mere attorney.

263
00:22:49,655 --> 00:22:51,655
The Royal Family will not condone it, of course.

264
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:07,335
You will marry Magistrate Yoo?

265
00:23:08,036 --> 00:23:09,976
I will find a way to confront Executive Minister Yoo...

266
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:12,676
from his closest side.

267
00:23:13,845 --> 00:23:16,746
And I can better protect Kang Han Soo that way.

268
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:20,345
Executive Minister Yoo will not agree,

269
00:23:21,315 --> 00:23:23,385
but even if he does...

270
00:23:28,426 --> 00:23:29,555
Your Highness.

271
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:33,565
Marriage should not be used as a strategy.

272
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:36,335
What about your life as a woman?

273
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,506
How will you find happiness?

274
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:44,375
My happiness as a woman...

275
00:23:49,676 --> 00:23:51,176
is with So Won.

276
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:56,085
That is good enough.

277
00:24:24,315 --> 00:24:26,085
Keeping this up will only do you harm.

278
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:29,315
It is none of your business.

279
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:31,315
Well, yes.

280
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:34,625
What happens to you is none of my business.

281
00:24:35,085 --> 00:24:36,325
We are nothing to each other.

282
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:37,855
Yes, of course.

283
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:42,865
You and I would hardly be described as "we."

284
00:24:43,835 --> 00:24:45,965
Still, I came to pay a courtesy visit to you.

285
00:24:45,966 --> 00:24:47,436
Do not be too grateful.

286
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:49,905
Oh, I will not be.

287
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:52,536
Although I do not know what you are here to say.

288
00:24:53,506 --> 00:24:55,305
It is to say goodbye, of course.

289
00:25:02,345 --> 00:25:05,956
This might be the last time we meet in this life.

290
00:25:09,526 --> 00:25:13,166
You had all the fun out of fooling me,

291
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:15,696
so I should now leave this world?

292
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:19,835
Are you praying for my death or what?

293
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:25,706
Honestly speaking,

294
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:28,746
you have been way too lucky.

295
00:25:29,746 --> 00:25:30,976
Lucky? No.

296
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:33,545
It was thanks to my skills.

297
00:25:35,345 --> 00:25:37,415
And this time again, I will make sure...

298
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:40,026
to use those skills to leave this place alive.

299
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,585
Is that so?

300
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:44,325
Then I better invite you to my wedding.

301
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:47,426
How laid back you are, getting married.

302
00:25:47,895 --> 00:25:49,635
I am going to marry the Princess.

303
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:57,834
Make sure...

304
00:25:57,835 --> 00:25:59,706
you escape alive and congratulate us.

305
00:26:16,956 --> 00:26:19,325
Maybe you provoked him too much.

306
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,735
That way, he will not give up...

307
00:26:22,736 --> 00:26:25,266
and struggle to survive even more.

308
00:26:26,506 --> 00:26:28,036
Are you worried about him?

309
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:32,104
I am simply worried...

310
00:26:32,105 --> 00:26:33,476
Her Highness might be concerned because of him.

311
00:26:56,996 --> 00:26:58,435
I believe that two different people coming together...

312
00:26:58,436 --> 00:27:01,064
to work for one common goal is...

313
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:03,736
as important as a wedding.

314
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,446
My purpose in life.

315
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:09,516
I will set it to make you live a happy life.

316
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:13,145
So that you can be happy...

317
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:17,486
and that your life purpose could be to simply live on,

318
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:19,824
I will work hard and help.

319
00:27:19,825 --> 00:27:21,055
Whatever it takes,

320
00:27:22,426 --> 00:27:23,595
I will do it.

321
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:27,196
I am proposing...

322
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:29,166
to you.

323
00:27:30,196 --> 00:27:31,365
So,

324
00:27:32,905 --> 00:27:34,065
will you wait for me?

325
00:27:39,545 --> 00:27:40,605
Show your respect.

326
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:44,276
This is Princess Yeon Joo, the former king's daughter.

327
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:20,486
Have you seen Attorney Kang Han Soo?

328
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:21,946
No.

329
00:28:22,115 --> 00:28:23,216
He has not seen him?

330
00:28:24,155 --> 00:28:25,256
Hey, Choi.

331
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:27,685
Have you seen...

332
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:29,995
any thugs from Cho's guild enter our office...

333
00:28:29,996 --> 00:28:32,594
while we were away?

334
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:34,195
- No. - No?

335
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:35,624
Attorney Kang Han Soo.

336
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:36,865
I am not sure.

337
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:39,436
I do not know.

338
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:45,706
Just this once.

339
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:48,676
Hey. Choi.

340
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:51,875
Have you ever seen Attorney Kang and So Won...

341
00:28:57,055 --> 00:28:58,516
Take these.

342
00:28:58,855 --> 00:28:59,986
Just this once.

343
00:29:00,256 --> 00:29:01,325
I beg you.

344
00:29:38,996 --> 00:29:40,196
I will ask again.

345
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:42,395
Why did you kill him?

346
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:47,466
According to the Book of the Law,

347
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,834
when interrogating...

348
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:50,935
What?

349
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:54,574
One must hit the knee with the tip of the club...

350
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:57,115
but not press the shin.

351
00:29:58,145 --> 00:29:59,645
What are you mumbling?

352
00:30:00,286 --> 00:30:03,986
Fail to exceed 30 clubbings at a time...

353
00:30:04,155 --> 00:30:06,756
You are still out of your mind and spouting nonsense.

354
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:08,155
What are you waiting for?

355
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:14,365
I do not think punishing him more is a good idea.

356
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,666
Law, my foot.

357
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:24,006
Nobody abides by it.

358
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:26,746
Has he gone mad?

359
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:32,986
Stop this instant!

360
00:30:33,315 --> 00:30:34,315
My lord!

361
00:30:35,946 --> 00:30:38,786
Please stop the interrogation, my lord.

362
00:30:39,016 --> 00:30:41,685
I have brought the witness who will clear Kang Han Soo...

363
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:43,526
of his false charge.

364
00:30:45,726 --> 00:30:46,766
"Witness?"

365
00:30:47,895 --> 00:30:48,926
What witness?

366
00:30:51,996 --> 00:30:53,065
Come in!

367
00:31:12,115 --> 00:31:14,185
They are the witnesses...

368
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:16,256
who will testify he could not have killed Lord Chu.

369
00:31:20,726 --> 00:31:22,065
Try a different approach.

370
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:24,335
Like how?

371
00:31:24,336 --> 00:31:25,536
Prove that...

372
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:29,006
I could not have killed Lord Chu...

373
00:31:30,176 --> 00:31:31,835
that day.

374
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:38,875
My lord. Please listen to our story.

375
00:31:40,085 --> 00:31:41,584
I do not need the money.

376
00:31:41,585 --> 00:31:43,286
It is not like you are asking me to lie.

377
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:47,026
I do not need a reward for helping Attorney Kang.

378
00:31:47,256 --> 00:31:50,256
Lord Kang Han Soo is not the culprit.

379
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:51,756
Of course, I will go.

380
00:31:52,055 --> 00:31:53,865
Who will if I do not?

381
00:31:53,966 --> 00:31:56,666
He is not someone who would kill a person.

382
00:31:58,736 --> 00:32:02,036
Excuse me. Is there nothing I can do to help?

383
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:04,604
- Please consider it. - Please consider it.

384
00:32:04,605 --> 00:32:06,375
Please consider it.

385
00:32:08,575 --> 00:32:11,276
He sure brought a lot of people.

386
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:14,614
You must get punished for entering the interrogation hall...

387
00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:16,186
without permission first to testify.

388
00:32:17,756 --> 00:32:18,815
Ten clubbings.

389
00:32:19,615 --> 00:32:21,055
Will you still testify?

390
00:32:25,095 --> 00:32:27,395
Yes. I will.

391
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:34,405
I will testify.

392
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:35,804
Me too.

393
00:32:35,805 --> 00:32:37,435
No, I will testify.

394
00:32:37,436 --> 00:32:39,005
I will testify as well.

395
00:32:39,006 --> 00:32:40,604
I will testify.

396
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:42,445
- Please consider it. - Please.

397
00:32:42,446 --> 00:32:44,844
- Do not punish him anymore. - Please consider it.

398
00:32:44,845 --> 00:32:46,415
- I will testify. - I will testify.

399
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,945
- I will testify for Attorney Kang. - I will testify.

400
00:32:48,946 --> 00:32:51,585
- I will testify after. - I will testify.

401
00:32:51,815 --> 00:32:53,385
- It is ten clubbings. - My lord.

402
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,154
- I will testify. - My lord.

403
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:57,155
- Please do not kill him. - I will testify.

404
00:32:58,555 --> 00:33:00,196
What is it that you want to say?

405
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:02,696
One of you, speak as the representative.

406
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:04,835
All right.

407
00:33:09,776 --> 00:33:13,375
At the time of Lord Chu's death, Kang Han Soo...

408
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:17,176
was not at Mount Choan, where Lord Chu had died,

409
00:33:17,437 --> 00:33:19,268
but at Mapo Riverport.

410
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:24,956
It is delicious. It truly is delicious.

411
00:33:25,016 --> 00:33:26,255
- Dig in. - That is right.

412
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:29,285
That day, my family had dinner...

413
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:31,155
with Attorney Kang Han Soo.

414
00:33:34,026 --> 00:33:36,094
The money is in here, but it is not.

415
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:37,765
- Come now. - Can he guess it?

416
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,105
That day, Han Soo...

417
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:42,936
Where is it?

418
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:44,874
- This is absurd. - Give me a hint.

419
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,676
- Come on. Try it. - I have no money.

420
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:51,814
He guessed everything right...

421
00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:55,145
that the trickster made a huge loss.

422
00:33:55,716 --> 00:33:56,785
(Tavern)

423
00:33:56,786 --> 00:34:00,055
That night, Attorney Kang and his assistant So Won...

424
00:34:00,226 --> 00:34:02,856
came to my tavern and had plum wine.

425
00:34:10,735 --> 00:34:14,305
Attorney Kang Han Soo did not kill anyone.

426
00:34:15,106 --> 00:34:17,405
Please show him mercy, my lord.

427
00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:20,274
- Please consider it. - Please consider it.

428
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,875
- Please consider it. - Please consider it.

429
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:25,876
- I will testify. - Attorney Kang is not the man.

430
00:34:29,786 --> 00:34:31,786
I have understood the witnesses' stories.

431
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,956
But I hear that...

432
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:39,542
you are either friends of Kang Han Soo...

433
00:34:40,003 --> 00:34:42,204
or received help from him.

434
00:34:43,095 --> 00:34:44,166
That...

435
00:34:45,095 --> 00:34:48,836
That may be true, but we did not commit perjury.

436
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:51,575
Shut it. How dare you interrupt?

437
00:34:52,336 --> 00:34:53,845
- Punish him! - Understood.

438
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:00,646
You have me.

439
00:35:20,206 --> 00:35:22,566
I am in no way related to Kang Han Soo.

440
00:35:22,865 --> 00:35:25,336
Rather, we are not on good terms because our guild...

441
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,976
got involved in a dispute in the past.

442
00:35:30,876 --> 00:35:31,945
So what?

443
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:34,246
What is it that you want to say?

444
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:37,516
I can guarantee all of their testimonies...

445
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:39,456
are true.

446
00:35:40,126 --> 00:35:42,755
As I have tailed Kang Han Soo all day that day,

447
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:45,796
I know better than anyone else.

448
00:35:57,436 --> 00:36:00,004
(Tavern)

449
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:02,606
I followed him to teach him a lesson.

450
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:05,345
But he had company even at night,

451
00:36:06,246 --> 00:36:07,546
so I had given up.

452
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:09,686
In other words,

453
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,816
Kang Han Soo did not have the time to kill Lord Chu that day.

454
00:36:16,896 --> 00:36:18,695
If my words prove to be false,

455
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:20,825
I shall offer my head.

456
00:36:27,735 --> 00:36:29,865
Why is this happening right after my reinstatement?

457
00:36:36,345 --> 00:36:37,976
There should be no reason to make things worse.

458
00:36:39,146 --> 00:36:40,686
- Pardon? - What?

459
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:48,126
Kang Han Soo.

460
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:56,126
Release him!

461
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:08,606
- My lord. - My lord.

462
00:37:08,805 --> 00:37:12,345
- Help me untie him. - My lord, please wake up.

463
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:14,445
- My lord. - Be gentle.

464
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:49,586
Father.

465
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,686
I finally...

466
00:37:53,726 --> 00:37:55,925
found the answer.

467
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:10,175
- Father. - Yes?

468
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:12,575
Why are we poor?

469
00:38:14,646 --> 00:38:15,944
People told me...

470
00:38:15,945 --> 00:38:18,215
you were the most successful among the middle class.

471
00:38:18,316 --> 00:38:20,585
And at school, I was taught not just anyone could become you.

472
00:38:20,586 --> 00:38:22,416
Everyone admires you.

473
00:38:22,746 --> 00:38:25,715
But even with all the admiration, you cannot become rich?

474
00:38:29,763 --> 00:38:32,303
To become rich, you must be selfish.

475
00:38:33,465 --> 00:38:35,165
You must devote everything you have seen, heard,

476
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:36,865
and learned to collect wealth.

477
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,166
While turning a blind eye,

478
00:38:39,336 --> 00:38:41,666
you must focus solely on your desires.

479
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:46,634
But the law is for everyone...

480
00:38:46,635 --> 00:38:48,646
and should be fair to everyone.

481
00:38:50,215 --> 00:38:53,275
So it is impossible for me, who is dealing with law,

482
00:38:54,385 --> 00:38:55,485
to become rich.

483
00:38:56,445 --> 00:38:57,456
Then...

484
00:38:58,456 --> 00:39:00,985
I will quit studying law at once...

485
00:39:01,985 --> 00:39:03,456
and choose not to become a judicial officer.

486
00:39:03,726 --> 00:39:05,226
My goal is to become rich.

487
00:39:09,865 --> 00:39:10,936
I...

488
00:39:13,235 --> 00:39:14,606
achieved my dream.

489
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:19,135
I became rich.

490
00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:33,825
You were right, Magistrate Yoo.

491
00:39:34,086 --> 00:39:35,185
Yes.

492
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:36,726
I am greatly relieved.

493
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:41,195
There is one more thing...

494
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:43,566
I must take care of.

495
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:46,095
I will wait.

496
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:31,175
By any chance, are you the one...

497
00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:36,086
who left money and a note at our office last time?

498
00:40:38,215 --> 00:40:39,356
In that case,

499
00:40:39,885 --> 00:40:41,525
please listen up.

500
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:50,126
Thank you.

501
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:58,074
Thanks to the money you left, I got a bundle of tonic...

502
00:40:58,075 --> 00:41:02,706
with expensive ingredients such as deer antlers.

503
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:06,145
By the time Han Soo finishes this medicine,

504
00:41:06,146 --> 00:41:08,416
he will return to full health.

505
00:41:10,255 --> 00:41:13,255
Please come and see us when you face any kind of trouble.

506
00:41:13,856 --> 00:41:17,496
Han Soo and I will do our best to repay your kindness.

507
00:41:20,766 --> 00:41:21,925
Thank you!

508
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:36,606
Only we ended up with more work.

509
00:41:36,945 --> 00:41:39,045
The Princess will leave the palace as soon as she is married,

510
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:40,416
so why did she return?

511
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:42,445
Court Lady Hong makes such a big deal out of this too.

512
00:41:42,885 --> 00:41:44,984
Why does she want to cook herself?

513
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:46,286
Tell me about it.

514
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:54,125
She may leave the palace soon,

515
00:41:54,126 --> 00:41:56,166
but she is still the former king's daughter.

516
00:41:57,465 --> 00:41:59,594
If you dare to speak so rashly again,

517
00:41:59,595 --> 00:42:01,666
you will not survive another day.

518
00:42:02,365 --> 00:42:03,976
- Yes, my lady. - Yes, my lady.

519
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:06,635
Go get more water.

520
00:42:06,805 --> 00:42:07,945
- Yes. - Yes.

521
00:42:25,896 --> 00:42:27,066
Show your respect.

522
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:29,996
This is Princess Yeon Joo, the daughter of the former King.

523
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:32,194
I cannot believe this.

524
00:42:32,195 --> 00:42:34,206
How dare you say that?

525
00:42:34,905 --> 00:42:36,805
What? How dare I say what?

526
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:40,976
Even I feel this way,

527
00:42:42,246 --> 00:42:43,976
so Her Highness must be distressed.

528
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:48,215
Even I feel this way.

529
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:52,416
Han Soo must be distressed.

530
00:44:28,286 --> 00:44:30,956
I brought this case here.

531
00:44:31,655 --> 00:44:33,086
Attorney Kang!

532
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:36,686
Is it not an attorney's job to help those who are wronged?

533
00:44:41,226 --> 00:44:42,694
You are so adorable.

534
00:44:42,695 --> 00:44:44,166
Look how adorable you are.

535
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,496
We shall win.

536
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,536
Was this nothing...

537
00:44:55,706 --> 00:44:57,916
but a playground for you?

538
00:45:29,246 --> 00:45:30,575
I have something to say to you.

539
00:45:38,615 --> 00:45:40,456
Please do not be polite with me.

540
00:45:42,286 --> 00:45:44,325
I fear someone may be listening.

541
00:45:45,726 --> 00:45:47,464
We are here alone.

542
00:45:47,465 --> 00:45:48,525
Hence,

543
00:45:50,226 --> 00:45:52,566
you wish to toy me around just as you have?

544
00:45:54,005 --> 00:45:55,235
Or...

545
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:57,205
do you wish to spend...

546
00:45:57,206 --> 00:45:59,804
some intimate time together because we are alone?

547
00:45:59,805 --> 00:46:01,546
Are you seducing me?

548
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:09,885
How much longer will you be sarcastic?

549
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:12,456
Did you come to see me without thinking...

550
00:46:13,586 --> 00:46:15,155
you will suffer from such ridicule?

551
00:46:17,496 --> 00:46:19,524
You had fun deceiving me all along,

552
00:46:19,525 --> 00:46:21,626
so you must pay for the consequence.

553
00:46:21,996 --> 00:46:23,825
I did not expect this to happen.

554
00:46:24,496 --> 00:46:26,796
I did not expect to meet you in my life as So Won...

555
00:46:30,876 --> 00:46:33,135
or for us to become closer than we should have.

556
00:46:33,976 --> 00:46:36,805
Then you should have told me before we became closer...

557
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:39,574
than we should have,

558
00:46:39,575 --> 00:46:41,845
or you should have stayed away from me.

559
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:45,016
I needed you.

560
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:08,146
This is what you have been looking for.

561
00:47:10,505 --> 00:47:11,674
(Officer Kang Eon Jik)

562
00:47:11,675 --> 00:47:13,445
The truth behind the incident from seven years ago.

563
00:47:17,655 --> 00:47:19,115
Only the envelope remains.

564
00:47:23,226 --> 00:47:26,095
As soon as Executive Minister Yoo saw this letter, he ran over...

565
00:47:26,525 --> 00:47:28,066
and protested to my father.

566
00:47:29,626 --> 00:47:32,536
And they quarrelled for a long time over the matter.

567
00:47:35,566 --> 00:47:38,805
My father could not handle the anger at that time, collapsed,

568
00:47:40,376 --> 00:47:41,706
then passed away soon after.

569
00:47:46,345 --> 00:47:48,844
The tragedy upon your family around that time...

570
00:47:48,845 --> 00:47:51,915
and my father's death were caused by Executive Minister Yoo.

571
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:53,456
He is a mortal enemy to both of us.

572
00:47:56,555 --> 00:47:57,626
So...

573
00:48:01,396 --> 00:48:02,595
you did everything...

574
00:48:05,066 --> 00:48:06,796
to get your revenge?

575
00:48:10,405 --> 00:48:12,505
You approached me...

576
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:15,876
and deceived me...

577
00:48:17,246 --> 00:48:18,476
for that reason?

578
00:48:20,046 --> 00:48:22,945
I thought we would be able to help each other,

579
00:48:23,016 --> 00:48:24,516
and I still think so.

580
00:48:24,956 --> 00:48:26,114
If we work together...

581
00:48:26,115 --> 00:48:27,555
No.

582
00:48:34,626 --> 00:48:36,425
Are you sure...

583
00:48:39,095 --> 00:48:41,505
the former king is not responsible in any way...

584
00:48:42,706 --> 00:48:43,805
for my father's death?

585
00:48:45,305 --> 00:48:46,376
What?

586
00:48:50,505 --> 00:48:52,775
His Majesty could have destroyed this.

587
00:48:52,976 --> 00:48:54,016
No.

588
00:48:55,086 --> 00:48:58,754
He could have blamed my father for everything.

589
00:48:58,755 --> 00:49:00,255
No, even if...

590
00:49:00,786 --> 00:49:03,155
Even if I shed a positive light on this matter,

591
00:49:04,496 --> 00:49:06,226
if anything, he could have...

592
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:11,365
spared my father's life before he passed away.

593
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:19,376
You said that...

594
00:49:21,405 --> 00:49:23,606
we are not indebted to each other because we were meant to have met.

595
00:49:27,686 --> 00:49:30,286
And I called you a miracle.

596
00:49:35,025 --> 00:49:36,525
But we were both wrong.

597
00:49:39,996 --> 00:49:42,965
You are not my miracle but a curse.

598
00:49:45,695 --> 00:49:47,066
And our fate is ill.

599
00:49:51,036 --> 00:49:53,706
So, we will never do anything together...

600
00:49:56,275 --> 00:49:57,746
for the rest of our lives.

601
00:50:14,896 --> 00:50:18,436
(Sowongak)

602
00:50:42,226 --> 00:50:45,155
At last, my old,

603
00:50:47,925 --> 00:50:50,325
karma-like problem has been solved.

604
00:51:21,425 --> 00:51:22,465
Your Majesty,

605
00:51:22,695 --> 00:51:25,436
these are the agendas from the Minister Committee.

606
00:51:25,695 --> 00:51:27,436
Please have a look.

607
00:51:31,405 --> 00:51:34,175
Your Majesty!

608
00:51:36,905 --> 00:51:40,746
I ask for an audience, Your Majesty!

609
00:51:41,945 --> 00:51:43,844
Your Majesty,

610
00:51:43,845 --> 00:51:46,755
I am here!

611
00:51:47,286 --> 00:51:48,925
Your Majesty!

612
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:02,036
Your Majesty.

613
00:52:10,046 --> 00:52:13,175
I have brought you a gift.

614
00:52:16,845 --> 00:52:18,456
Who are you?

615
00:52:19,115 --> 00:52:21,755
Who do you think you are to cause a scene here?

616
00:52:22,086 --> 00:52:23,956
Get out of here right this instant!

617
00:52:29,325 --> 00:52:30,766
How on earth did you come this far?

618
00:52:37,575 --> 00:52:39,376
(Pass)

619
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,005
I thought this pass was for such moments.

620
00:52:45,945 --> 00:52:47,416
You will be in huge trouble.

621
00:52:48,146 --> 00:52:49,845
Stop making a scene and leave.

622
00:52:50,885 --> 00:52:51,956
I make a living...

623
00:52:52,715 --> 00:52:55,485
as an attorney on the outskirts of the city.

624
00:52:55,885 --> 00:52:57,726
My name is Kang Han Soo.

625
00:52:57,755 --> 00:52:58,755
I am also...

626
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:02,396
the friend of the king of this kingdom,

627
00:53:03,796 --> 00:53:05,166
Your Majesty.

628
00:53:11,075 --> 00:53:12,075
Your Majesty.

629
00:53:12,476 --> 00:53:16,546
I have come to share a good bottle of liquor.

630
00:53:17,615 --> 00:53:19,146
How ludicrous!

631
00:53:19,516 --> 00:53:21,816
How dare you call yourself His Majesty's friend?

632
00:53:36,465 --> 00:53:37,496
It is true.

633
00:53:46,536 --> 00:53:49,876
He is a friend of mine. Return your swords and make way.

634
00:53:58,155 --> 00:54:01,226
Thank you for your boundless generosity.

635
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:19,075
This is such a superb view.

636
00:54:19,606 --> 00:54:20,905
It is a palace, after all.

637
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:25,015
Every part of this pavilion is...

638
00:54:25,016 --> 00:54:26,675
large, sturdy, and elegant.

639
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:29,344
The trees, flowers, and even the rocks...

640
00:54:29,345 --> 00:54:31,356
look as expensive as gold.

641
00:54:34,356 --> 00:54:36,356
And the wind.

642
00:54:37,025 --> 00:54:39,324
Compared to the river breeze at Mapo Riverport,

643
00:54:39,325 --> 00:54:41,425
it even smells different.

644
00:54:42,425 --> 00:54:45,095
It is not even a smell. This is fragrance.

645
00:54:47,836 --> 00:54:49,266
Was it Park that used to sell plum wine?

646
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:52,075
How is his business going?

647
00:54:54,575 --> 00:54:55,606
Are you...

648
00:54:57,476 --> 00:54:59,376
curious about that after all this time?

649
00:55:03,586 --> 00:55:04,715
You are a bit late...

650
00:55:05,586 --> 00:55:08,226
in caring about your people.

651
00:55:10,956 --> 00:55:13,395
I understand. You must be...

652
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:15,924
preoccupied with the thought of taking back...

653
00:55:15,925 --> 00:55:18,536
your royal authority from the minister.

654
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:21,936
After handling Lord Kwon's case so poorly,

655
00:55:22,905 --> 00:55:25,005
how did you have the nerve to come to the palace?

656
00:55:26,405 --> 00:55:28,106
Do you wish to die?

657
00:55:29,905 --> 00:55:31,275
Why would I die?

658
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:35,746
You will protect me with all your heart.

659
00:55:36,215 --> 00:55:37,445
I will protect you?

660
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:39,655
Why do you think that?

661
00:55:40,816 --> 00:55:42,956
Has the Princess not told you yet?

662
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,626
About who I am.

663
00:55:56,365 --> 00:55:57,405
I get it.

664
00:56:00,476 --> 00:56:02,575
Do not tell the Princess.

665
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:04,546
- Yes, my lady. - Tell me what?

666
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:07,345
Well...

667
00:56:21,195 --> 00:56:22,425
Princess Yeon Joo!

668
00:56:23,266 --> 00:56:26,296
Why did you come to the palace?

669
00:56:28,066 --> 00:56:29,066
So,

670
00:56:29,836 --> 00:56:31,876
my father owed your father,

671
00:56:32,275 --> 00:56:33,675
and you want me to clear off his debts?

672
00:56:34,376 --> 00:56:35,775
Are you here to demand that?

673
00:56:36,845 --> 00:56:40,674
I could charge you thousands of coins...

674
00:56:40,675 --> 00:56:43,186
by including the interest.

675
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,985
Yet, I cannot bring my parents back to life.

676
00:56:54,766 --> 00:56:57,566
I merely wanted to see it for myself.

677
00:56:58,751 --> 00:57:01,112
To see how much you own...

678
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:04,805
and what you benefit from...

679
00:57:05,436 --> 00:57:08,646
that makes you look down on other people's lives.

680
00:57:10,505 --> 00:57:12,945
Well, it is a fancy place.

681
00:57:15,186 --> 00:57:16,516
So, I have...

682
00:57:19,086 --> 00:57:20,456
one favour to ask you...

683
00:57:21,485 --> 00:57:23,325
as a friend of yours.

684
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:27,496
Please prove...

685
00:57:28,996 --> 00:57:31,595
that you are capable of protecting...

686
00:57:32,766 --> 00:57:34,166
the people of your kingdom.

687
00:57:53,856 --> 00:57:56,055
Everyone has been asking me to prove myself.

688
00:57:57,325 --> 00:57:58,325
Pardon?

689
00:57:58,525 --> 00:58:01,796
Your Majesty, Magistrate Yoo has arrived.

690
00:58:04,066 --> 00:58:06,036
I am Magistrate Yoo Ji Sun of Hanseongbu.

691
00:58:06,365 --> 00:58:07,936
I officially greet you, Your Majesty.

692
00:58:08,635 --> 00:58:09,905
Welcome, Magistrate Yoo.

693
00:58:35,365 --> 00:58:36,694
What are you doing here?

694
00:58:36,695 --> 00:58:40,194
Are you asking me why I am here, or how I am alive?

695
00:58:40,195 --> 00:58:41,365
Let us make it both.

696
00:58:41,735 --> 00:58:43,904
I have a feeling that you are dissatisfied with both.

697
00:58:43,905 --> 00:58:46,234
I only ask as you seem extremely lucky.

698
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:48,075
It was not luck. It was competence.

699
00:58:49,246 --> 00:58:52,015
Also, you are quite lucky yourself.

700
00:58:52,016 --> 00:58:54,985
You were practically born in a cradle of gold.

701
00:58:55,215 --> 00:58:56,246
What did you say?

702
00:58:59,686 --> 00:59:02,155
We will say that my grandmother invited Magistrate Yoo,

703
00:59:03,025 --> 00:59:05,296
and I invited you, Attorney Kang.

704
00:59:07,695 --> 00:59:09,496
What is the special occasion?

705
00:59:09,825 --> 00:59:11,666
Today is Princess Yeon Joo's birthday.

706
00:59:13,336 --> 00:59:16,036
So, please celebrate it with us while you are here.

707
00:59:19,675 --> 00:59:21,036
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

708
00:59:21,976 --> 00:59:24,375
I do not think it is my place to join.

709
00:59:24,376 --> 00:59:26,046
Let me be excused.

710
00:59:41,226 --> 00:59:43,566
As if he has ever cared where to join or not.

711
00:59:55,546 --> 00:59:56,606
Birthday?

712
00:59:57,175 --> 00:59:58,345
It is my birthday.

713
00:59:58,646 --> 00:59:59,745
It is the Ghost Festival day.

714
00:59:59,746 --> 01:00:01,444
The birthday of every labourer.

715
01:00:01,445 --> 01:00:04,115
No, really. It is also my birthday.

716
01:00:04,546 --> 01:00:05,686
Here is my birthday gift for you.

717
01:00:11,055 --> 01:00:12,396
What a liar.

718
01:00:15,965 --> 01:00:17,066
Your Highness!

719
01:00:18,336 --> 01:00:19,396
Your Highness!

720
01:00:19,965 --> 01:00:21,165
Your Highness.

721
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:22,336
Let go.

722
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:23,965
Are you all right?

723
01:00:25,505 --> 01:00:26,635
What are you waiting for?

724
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:35,086
These shoes are not what I usually wear.

725
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:39,655
I threw them out.

726
01:00:40,016 --> 01:00:41,016
What?

727
01:00:41,017 --> 01:00:42,885
Those do not belong to you.

728
01:00:44,186 --> 01:00:45,525
They belong to So Won.

729
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:50,395
Whatever choice you make,

730
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,336
I will follow.

731
01:00:53,365 --> 01:00:57,106
But I cannot watch you in confusion like this.

732
01:01:06,115 --> 01:01:07,175
Your Highness...

733
01:02:15,146 --> 01:02:16,286
Magistrate Yoo.

734
01:02:18,016 --> 01:02:19,516
Help yourself.

735
01:02:21,586 --> 01:02:23,956
Thank you for your generosity, Your Highness.

736
01:03:23,516 --> 01:03:24,956
Once,

737
01:03:25,856 --> 01:03:28,885
I put shoes on you and wished...

738
01:03:32,296 --> 01:03:34,996
that you would go anywhere you wanted,

739
01:03:35,595 --> 01:03:37,566
go over any kinds of humps,

740
01:03:38,195 --> 01:03:40,396
and go to a better place, a more precious place.

741
01:03:43,706 --> 01:03:44,865
It was...

742
01:03:45,936 --> 01:03:48,005
such a presumptuous wish.

743
01:03:54,345 --> 01:03:55,385
Thus,

744
01:03:56,952 --> 01:03:59,093
I earnestly wish again...

745
01:04:01,186 --> 01:04:02,755
that you do not...

746
01:04:04,155 --> 01:04:05,856
head to where I am.

747
01:04:21,336 --> 01:04:23,075
Happy birthday,

748
01:04:25,546 --> 01:04:26,816
Your Highness.

749
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:09,856
I got a new assignment.

750
01:05:18,635 --> 01:05:20,066
Are you okay?

751
01:05:23,036 --> 01:05:25,005
I cannot go to your side,

752
01:05:26,575 --> 01:05:27,735
but I will...

753
01:05:28,546 --> 01:05:30,876
find a way for us to fight together.

754
01:06:02,305 --> 01:06:04,405
What, he bought plum wine?

755
01:06:04,445 --> 01:06:07,115
Yes, Park told me so.

756
01:06:07,175 --> 01:06:10,915
Han Soo was off to meet a friend who lives in a huge house.

757
01:06:10,916 --> 01:06:12,785
He could not go empty-handed,

758
01:06:12,786 --> 01:06:16,155
so he bought a bottle of plum wine that has aged the most.

759
01:06:21,595 --> 01:06:22,766
The palace.

760
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:23,965
Pardon?

761
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:28,405
This lunatic went to the palace!

762
01:06:28,536 --> 01:06:30,365
He went to meet His Majesty!

763
01:06:32,135 --> 01:06:33,476
No way.

764
01:06:34,275 --> 01:06:36,305
It is not just any place.

765
01:06:37,405 --> 01:06:39,545
To enter a government office,

766
01:06:39,546 --> 01:06:41,785
he had to sacrifice his buttocks.

767
01:06:41,786 --> 01:06:43,316
Now the palace?

768
01:06:43,686 --> 01:06:46,186
To enter the palace, he at least...

769
01:06:46,485 --> 01:06:48,315
Needs to sacrifice his life.

770
01:06:48,316 --> 01:06:50,286
- Exactly. - Exactly.

771
01:06:52,956 --> 01:06:53,996
Wait.

772
01:06:56,396 --> 01:06:57,525
What?

773
01:07:01,496 --> 01:07:03,135
Do you hear this sound?

774
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:06,235
- Sound? - Yes.

775
01:07:06,505 --> 01:07:07,606
I hear it.

776
01:07:29,396 --> 01:07:31,996
- Han Soo? - My lord!

777
01:07:32,195 --> 01:07:33,496
Hi, there.

778
01:07:36,036 --> 01:07:38,036
Ta-Da. Say hi.

779
01:07:38,305 --> 01:07:40,876
He is our new client.

780
01:07:41,905 --> 01:07:43,106
A client?

781
01:07:45,106 --> 01:07:46,516
I am going to make...

782
01:07:47,275 --> 01:07:51,115
this baby the true owner of Joseon.

783
01:07:56,985 --> 01:07:58,456
There, there.

784
01:08:01,595 --> 01:08:04,066
Do not worry, baby client.

785
01:08:20,145 --> 01:08:23,546
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

786
01:08:29,926 --> 01:08:31,655
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

787
01:08:32,956 --> 01:08:34,126
A land lawsuit?

788
01:08:34,825 --> 01:08:36,365
Is there anything we can help with?

789
01:08:38,195 --> 01:08:39,536
Just choose one.

790
01:08:39,966 --> 01:08:41,036
Hypocrisy...

791
01:08:42,765 --> 01:08:43,865
or breaking our promise.

792
01:08:46,506 --> 01:08:49,075
This lawsuit is not just my fight alone.

793
01:08:50,145 --> 01:08:51,346
Most of all,

794
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:54,216
Kang Han Soo is defending the other party.

795
01:08:56,815 --> 01:09:01,256
Are you that famous attorney, Kang Han Soo?

796
01:09:03,485 --> 01:09:04,825
Welcome.
