1
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:17,524
What are you doing over there? 
  Salt

2
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:19,554
Sir.

3
00:01:21,544 --> 00:01:22,884
It is you, Your Excellency.

4
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:24,974
It is you.

5
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:31,734
You two are going around together now.

6
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:35,704
Well, I was making a request of him.

7
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:39,494
I heard he is going to investigate Late Kwon's case tomorrow.

8
00:01:39,494 --> 00:01:40,944
I wanted him to take me with him.

9
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:43,464
Make such a request to me in person.

10
00:01:43,464 --> 00:01:46,294
She must have felt uneasy for her to ask that of me.

11
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:49,404
I mean, that is...

12
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:53,114
So I am just letting her know that she does not have to do that.

13
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:56,354
I am telling her it is quite all right with me.

14
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:02,604
How about you go around with me instead?

15
00:02:02,604 --> 00:02:04,114
Pardon?

16
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:09,624
Would it not be better to be the Hanseongbu official's attendant than an attorney's assistant?

17
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:11,554
If she wishes to die early.

18
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:12,924
- What? 
 - Excuse me?

19
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,134
Considering So Won's status and as a woman,

20
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:18,714
how could she accompany Hanseongbu's official?

21
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:22,634
If the royal court found out, it would be okay for you since you have firm connections

22
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:24,214
but what would happen to So Won?

23
00:02:24,214 --> 00:02:27,054
Yes. She will die.

24
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:31,994
So if she must walk through the mud and on the cliff's edge,

25
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:38,084
I am sure So Won would feel at ease walking alongside me.

26
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:41,164
Is that not so?

27
00:02:47,624 --> 00:02:51,054
Yes. I cannot possibly...

28
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:54,454
cause trouble for Mayor.

29
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:57,864
Yes. She cannot possibly do so.

30
00:02:57,864 --> 00:03:02,064
Then I will take this troublemaker with me.

31
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:12,630

32
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,164
Did you wait for me?

33
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:43,574
I was worried because you left so suddenly.

34
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:47,254
I wondered if something was the matter, by chance.

35
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:02,364
Wait here.

36
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:21,774
♫  Love you forever  ♫

37
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:25,994

 Episode 10: Secret Exposed

46
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:23,364
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

47
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,994
 Are you sure the aebi* was the last one who came out of the annex that night? 
 (A female servant the master cherishes.)

48
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,554
Did you see anything suspicious at all?

49
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:30,594
No, I did not.

50
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:32,514
Was the steward really away from the house?

51
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:35,524
I believe he was running an errand.

52
00:05:36,784 --> 00:05:40,424
Do I have to know all the details of his daily schedule?

53
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:45,234
He said he was going a long distance that day, so I made him some rice balls.

54
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:49,804
But your master is someone else. Why did you pack rice balls for the steward?

55
00:05:49,804 --> 00:05:52,584
- I'm only a slave. I should do what I'm told. 
 - Gosh, no...

56
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:57,784
You may be a slave, but you were an aebi who was cherished by the master.

57
00:05:57,784 --> 00:06:01,904
Just because I am cherished, does that change my status as a slave?

58
00:06:04,354 --> 00:06:07,334
Cheong Soon does often misspeak like that.

59
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,044
Did she speak like that with the master as well?

60
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:11,974
Gosh, no! How could she dare?

61
00:06:11,974 --> 00:06:14,884
But she did say that often to the steward.

62
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:17,214
Arguing and complaining back and forth.

63
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:21,074
Steward. Arguing back and forth.

64
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:27,844
She is a rude child. I did speak to her to scold her.

65
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:30,054
Did you know the aebi from the start?

66
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:34,724
If you say start, do you mean when she first arrived at this household?

67
00:06:34,724 --> 00:06:37,764
I guess she did not always live here as a slave.

68
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,304
Whether she did or not,

69
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:43,424
she's a servant wench who has nothing to do with me.

70
00:06:45,144 --> 00:06:49,834
We brought the aebi from my hyeongnim's friend's house about three months ago.

71
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:55,094
Do you mean that house in the upper village you sent the steward to run an errand to?

72
00:06:56,094 --> 00:06:59,504
Did you narrow down the suspects?

73
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:06,964
As of now, you are the most suspicious one, Sir.

74
00:07:06,964 --> 00:07:08,254
How could that be?

75
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:11,354
You were the last person who was with him, Sir.

76
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:15,664
And no one has seen you leave the room.

77
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:20,744
I did not kill my hyeongnim!

78
00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:22,444
Do not worry.

79
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:26,354
I will prove your innocence, Sir.

80
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:31,990
Please confirm this interrogation report is correct and sign off on it.

81
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,360
 Interrogation – questioning regarding crimes

82
00:07:44,274 --> 00:07:47,294
 Someone came from the government office.

83
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:49,474
This way, please.

84
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:57,954
He is the Mayor of Hanseongbu.

85
00:07:57,954 --> 00:07:59,784
Pardon?

86
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:02,824
W-Well, we greet you, Your Excellency.

87
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:05,134
Greetings, Your Excellency.

88
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:08,634
I will reexamine the corpse first.

89
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:11,994
Since Attorney Kang's people are here, I guess I will not need anymore examiners.

90
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:14,494
The more people we bring in here, the more rumors will spread.

91
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,174
Yes. If you would do so, I'd be grateful.

92
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:21,224
I will assist you wholeheartedly.

93
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:23,244
Where is the deceased?

94
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:25,654
Please come this way.

95
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:47,304
From the shape and depth of the stab wound on his neck,

96
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:49,064
he did not get stabbed multiple times.

97
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:53,004
His artery was cut in one deep stab, so he died instantly.

98
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:55,434
The length of the cut...

99
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,794
indicates that he used a dagger about this big.

100
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:03,084
Any trace of him fighting back?

101
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,164
Almost none.

102
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:08,424
Perhaps he could not fight back since he was drunk.

103
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:13,624
In that case, the last person he was with would be the prime suspect.

104
00:09:14,374 --> 00:09:16,184
Did you get the family members' testimonies?

105
00:09:16,184 --> 00:09:17,724
Yes.

106
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:22,004
Let us continue our conversation elsewhere.

107
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:23,554
Let us find the weapon first.

108
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:26,914
Collect all the knives that are about 15cm in this house.

109
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:28,534
Yes, Sir.

110
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:46,554
Let us go.

111
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:55,034
Over there.

112
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:39,104
Since he subdued Late Kwon and cut his artery in one swipe,

113
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:42,704
the culprit is likely a man.

114
00:10:43,554 --> 00:10:48,504
Then it is narrowed down to Sir Kwon Myeong Wu, the servant, the steward. The tree.

115
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:53,464
If he was drunk and asleep, there is no reason a woman could not have done it.

116
00:10:53,464 --> 00:10:57,244
Someone who could have approached his bed is either the aebi or his wife.

117
00:10:57,244 --> 00:11:00,554
No, no. These two have weak motives.

118
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:03,144
For the wife, if she did it out of jealousy,

119
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:06,644
it would be more natural for her to kill this aebi than Late Kwon.

120
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:11,934
On top of that, it is worse to live as a widow in Joseon than to be a slave.

121
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:15,374
How about the aebi?

122
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:27,384
If she was sad about being a slave, she should have run away instead.

123
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:31,414
If her crime were discovered, she would be facing death by dismemberment.

124
00:11:31,414 --> 00:11:32,804
It would be too great of a risk.

125
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:33,844
Yes.

126
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:38,894
On top of that, why would she do such a foolish thing right before her wedding?

127
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:41,044
As for the servant Jang Dol, too.

128
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:45,114
Also, for Sir Kwon Myeong Wu, he has no reason to bring shame upon his household before his appointment.

129
00:11:45,114 --> 00:11:47,194
Then...

130
00:11:47,194 --> 00:11:48,894
Yes.

131
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:55,094
As of now, the steward is the most suspicious one.

132
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:56,964
And the reason?

133
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:01,184
Yes, I looked into it,

134
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:05,494
and this steward fell into gambling and has a huge debt.

135
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:08,624
 How come three bags of rice are missing?

136
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:12,444
 Do you think I put you in charge of our family storage shed so that you can gamble it all away?

137
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:17,650
 Also, some people witnessed him being yelled at by Late Kwon a few days before the incident.

138
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:23,434
Do you not see the big picture?

139
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:25,044
Completely.

140
00:12:25,684 --> 00:12:29,004
Do you think the steward got caught stealing away this family's property?

141
00:12:29,004 --> 00:12:30,824
That is why he felt vengeful and...

142
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:35,084
But did you not say he was not in the house on the day of the murder?

143
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,770
 Late Kwon sent him to a relative in the upper village. ...the steward often gambles...

144
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,734
Yes. You said he was running an errand to the upper village.

145
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:45,264
Well, yes. That is the only variable.

146
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,814
A variable, huh?

147
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:50,674
By chance, did you check with the Late Kwon's friend who lives in the upper village?

148
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:53,924
Perhaps he remembers it wrong or gave false testimony.

149
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:56,714
Then the steward once again becomes the prime suspect.

150
00:12:56,714 --> 00:13:00,504
That is it! I think so as well.

151
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:04,694
But why would Late Kwon's friend help out the steward?

152
00:13:06,204 --> 00:13:09,154
I think so as well.

153
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:33,314
You can never... tell them about that person.

154
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:34,744
By "that person," you mean...

155
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:39,044
The fact that he came by here a few days before the murder.

156
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:40,744
And...

157
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:45,604
Oh, that?

158
00:13:45,604 --> 00:13:47,554
Yes. Of course, not.

159
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:50,514
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

160
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,134
 Your Excellency, I found the weapon!

161
00:13:58,134 --> 00:14:00,184
Come in.

162
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:09,074
It is Aebi Cheong Soon's dagger.

163
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:22,014
Let me see it.

164
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:51,734
Why?

165
00:14:53,884 --> 00:14:55,784
It is nothing.

166
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:04,644
What? It wasn't me! Don't accuse an innocent person!

167
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:07,044
Why would I kill the master?

168
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:09,854
Do you think I am crazy? Please let go of me!

169
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:11,244
Tie her up.

170
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,684
We'll transport her to Hanseongbu in the morning.

171
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:19,504
Your Excellency! Your Excellency... I... I did not do it!

172
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:22,334
Please spare me.

173
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:25,214
I did not do it! This is not fair!

174
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:28,644
I did not do it!

175
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:32,764
Please, spare me.

176
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:36,244
Your Excellency! This is unjust!

177
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,154
The aebi is not the killer.

178
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:36,854
She would not have given me this dagger so easily if she were the culprit.

179
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:41,054
She would have hidden it or thrown it out. One of the two. Like Minister Chu's case.

180
00:16:41,054 --> 00:16:44,614
She could have thought she would not get caught since the dagger was washed.

181
00:16:44,614 --> 00:16:47,274
It is a valuable object. I am sure she did not want to waste it by throwing it away.

182
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:50,244
Do you think she would have valued it more than her life?

183
00:16:51,784 --> 00:16:53,384
And if you are wrong?

184
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:54,594
I will take the blame for it.

185
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:55,844
How do you mean?

186
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:58,234
How would you like me to take the blame?

187
00:17:02,884 --> 00:17:06,234
Do not drag So Won into your work.

188
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,974
I also am not happy about So Won spending time with you.

189
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:14,394
The reason being... I am sure you know full well.

190
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:58,244
You would never know it if someone took you away.

191
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,710
How did it go?

192
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:04,724
I barely managed to get one more day.

193
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:08,004
I will catch the culprit tomorrow for sure.

194
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,164
You sure like catching culprits.

195
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:13,514
But I like you.

196
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:29,094
I am asking you this because I have some time.

197
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:33,584
Well, it is not all that important or anything.

198
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:39,374
You and the mayor seem pretty close.

199
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:44,114
Was there something big that happened between you two that I am not aware of?

200
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:45,984
Pardon?

201
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:50,644
Oh, no. W-Well, i-it is just...

202
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:56,164
I have told you about it before.

203
00:18:56,164 --> 00:18:59,744
- That some people support our inn. 
 - Yeah.

204
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:02,904
He is one of the supporters.

205
00:19:02,904 --> 00:19:07,244
I see. He is one of the three major sponsors?

206
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:09,394
Yes.

207
00:19:09,394 --> 00:19:12,284
Since when? No, never mind.

208
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,424
How do you become one of the sponsors?

209
00:19:15,424 --> 00:19:19,994
Every month? Every year? Or send rice and food every season?

210
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:22,114
Why? Do you want to do the same?

211
00:19:22,114 --> 00:19:25,074
I mean, if Mayor could do it, why could I not do it?

212
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:27,184
Even though I am in this state...

213
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:34,444
I am one of the most successful commoners among all commoners.

214
00:19:35,714 --> 00:19:37,994
If you solve this case well,

215
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:40,934
you will become the most successful one of the commoners.

216
00:19:40,934 --> 00:19:42,714
Why not start sponsoring us starting then?

217
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,394
Sounds good.

218
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:47,674
Then promise me, too.

219
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:48,904
Promise you what?

220
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:52,144
If I sponsor you with lots of goods,

221
00:19:52,144 --> 00:19:56,004
you will no longer receive Mayor's help.

222
00:19:58,254 --> 00:20:01,284
I do not like to see you getting hurt.

223
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:09,044
Whether you are by my side or by Mayor's side,

224
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:12,444
Minister Yu will not view you kindly.

225
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,104
So promise me.

226
00:20:15,104 --> 00:20:22,484
Whoever it may be, you will be with the one who will keep you safe.

227
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:30,054
You have become a scaredy-cat.

228
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:31,734
What?

229
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:39,004
In the beginning, you were so reckless, as if you had no tomorrow.

230
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:42,604
But I am still happy.

231
00:20:42,604 --> 00:20:47,864
The fact that you have more fear means you have come to treasure something.

232
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:51,634
And it also means you have tomorrow to look forward to.

233
00:20:52,564 --> 00:20:56,664
Do not worry. Nothing is going to happen.

234
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:03,254
What you just said means I do not have to misunderstand you, right?

235
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:06,394
Mayor and you. I do not have to misunderstand, right?

236
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:11,594
Yes!

237
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:13,594
Then I am good.

238
00:21:13,594 --> 00:21:19,004
♫  Wipe away the tears that flow white  ♫

239
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:22,524
♫  Traversing memories  ♫

240
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:27,034
♫   Affectionately calling your name  ♫

241
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:30,524
 Were you worried over such a minor thing?

242
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:35,934
♫  I want to go back to that time  ♫

243
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:39,700
 That is no worry at all.

244
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,350
♫  ...and meet you just once more  ♫

245
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:56,294
The aebi is the culprit?

246
00:21:56,294 --> 00:21:57,584
Yes.

247
00:21:57,584 --> 00:22:00,734
The blood was found on her silver dagger.

248
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:03,964
She also confessed to the crime.

249
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:05,234
How could she...

250
00:22:05,234 --> 00:22:09,214
There is no way. How could Cheong Soon commit murder?

251
00:22:09,214 --> 00:22:12,194
This sly bitch! How could she kill her master?

252
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:14,204
However!

253
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:19,684
I hear there is an accomplice.

254
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:22,464
An accomplice?

255
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,744
We are continuing the interrogation with her locked up in the shed.

256
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,544
But she will not talk at all.

257
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:30,594
Mayor also wants to capture the accomplice,

258
00:22:30,594 --> 00:22:32,894
so he is increasing the intensity of the interrogation.

259
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:37,444
I am sure the aebi will not last very long, either.

260
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:43,694
I think tonight will probably be crucial.

261
00:22:58,284 --> 00:23:00,624
Watch them carefully.

262
00:23:00,624 --> 00:23:04,174
You make sure to do a good job, Hyungnim. Do not make mistakes.

263
00:23:46,244 --> 00:23:48,424
- What are you looking at?
 - Geez, you scared me!

264
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:49,904
You.

265
00:23:49,904 --> 00:23:53,344
Huh? My goodness! Where did he go?

266
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,904
Geez! Jang Dol! I ought to!

267
00:23:56,904 --> 00:23:59,364
They said the aebi did it!

268
00:23:59,364 --> 00:24:03,104
How could you send someone like her to our house?

269
00:24:03,104 --> 00:24:06,044
So you would not be caught up in a scandal,

270
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:09,924
I made sure my family would not talk!

271
00:24:12,154 --> 00:24:15,584
Please calm down and speak.

272
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:17,804
The aebi did what?

273
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:21,614
The aebi killed my hyeongnim!

274
00:24:21,614 --> 00:24:23,024
What?

275
00:24:23,024 --> 00:24:25,764
They found blood on her silver dagger.

276
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,514
They even found the weapon. How could she deny it?

277
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:33,774
I hear there is even an accomplice.

278
00:24:33,774 --> 00:24:35,864
An accomplice?

279
00:24:35,864 --> 00:24:37,614
Yes!

280
00:24:39,374 --> 00:24:41,794
That cannot be.

281
00:24:43,544 --> 00:24:46,074
Where is the aebi right now?

282
00:24:51,634 --> 00:24:54,144
Spare me!

283
00:25:04,674 --> 00:25:07,034
Please spare me!

284
00:26:08,674 --> 00:26:12,064
Wait... who are you?

285
00:26:12,794 --> 00:26:15,524
Who are you?

286
00:26:19,854 --> 00:26:23,424
 It was not the steward.

287
00:26:29,074 --> 00:26:32,204
Aigoo, Your Excellency, what brings you here at this late hour?

288
00:26:32,204 --> 00:26:35,834
I heard you caught the killer, so I came running.

289
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:41,264
But... who is this horrendously odd person?

290
00:26:41,264 --> 00:26:45,444
Who is it that he is being so rude toward me?

291
00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:48,294
So who are you, Your Excellency?

292
00:26:48,294 --> 00:26:52,004
I mean, who are you that you went straight to the shed as soon as you arrived?

293
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:53,514
Please explain yourself.

294
00:26:53,514 --> 00:26:55,174
Come on, you are being insolent.

295
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:57,914
Do you know who this is?

296
00:26:57,914 --> 00:27:03,964
Your Excellency, this is Kang Han Su—an attorney who is taking on this case.

297
00:27:03,964 --> 00:27:06,374
An attorney?

298
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,434
He is His Excellency Prince Choong Un. His Majesty's uncle.

299
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:11,354
What?

300
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:13,164
His Majesty...

301
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:22,214
Greetings, Your Excellency. I am Attorney Kang Han Su.

302
00:27:22,214 --> 00:27:24,544
I am Dong Chi.

303
00:27:28,394 --> 00:27:30,644
Prince Choong Un?

304
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:40,254
Yes. Uncle is infamous for his possessiveness and jealousy.

305
00:27:40,254 --> 00:27:44,884
He always puts an engraving on his objects.

306
00:27:46,354 --> 00:27:51,184
At one point, he said he lost the throne to my father in his drunken state.

307
00:27:51,184 --> 00:27:58,424
If he had become the king, Joseon would have prospered more.

308
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:03,994
If Prince Choong Un was connected to this case...

309
00:28:06,474 --> 00:28:08,664
We must stop it.

310
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:21,174
Of all people, we had to be involved in a case with such a huge figure.

311
00:28:21,174 --> 00:28:24,354
We are so unlucky!

312
00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:30,254
 But why would Late Kwon's friend help out the steward?

313
00:28:30,254 --> 00:28:35,944
 We brought the aebi from my hyeongnim's friend's house about three months ago.

314
00:28:35,944 --> 00:28:38,184
It is not about luck.

315
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:44,334
It was planned.

316
00:28:45,214 --> 00:28:47,814
Who? What?

317
00:28:47,814 --> 00:28:51,884
Minister... Yu Je Se.

318
00:28:53,514 --> 00:28:57,344
He is trying to pressure the royal family with this case.

319
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:21,144
Are you saying...

320
00:29:21,144 --> 00:29:26,754
we are being played in a game that Minister Yu set up to screw the King?

321
00:29:28,194 --> 00:29:31,214
Let us quit this right away.

322
00:29:31,214 --> 00:29:36,874
If we dig deeper, we are only doing a favor for Minister Yu.

323
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:50,044
Hyeongnim! Wait... Hyeongnim! Han Su!

324
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:12,074
Is there no news from Kang Han Su?

325
00:30:12,074 --> 00:30:14,544
No, Your Majesty.

326
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:23,374
Will you continue to investigate this matter?

327
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:25,914
What do you mean?

328
00:30:25,914 --> 00:30:29,284
Did you not already catch the culprit?

329
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:34,764
The real culprit... is someone else.

330
00:30:35,654 --> 00:30:36,944
What did you say?

331
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:38,914
However, if I reveal the real culprit,

332
00:30:38,914 --> 00:30:43,094
you will lose your chance at the office you had obtained with difficulty

333
00:30:43,094 --> 00:30:48,374
and may go through even more difficult situations.

334
00:30:51,234 --> 00:30:56,004
Are you saying... the one who killed my hyeongnim is...

335
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:58,504
by chance...

336
00:31:00,214 --> 00:31:01,764
Yes.

337
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:14,234
Would you like to bury this as is, or... do you want to reveal the truth?

338
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,964
 He is a scholar who highly values honor.

339
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:25,224
He will try to catch his brother's killer and find out the truth no matter what.

340
00:31:25,224 --> 00:31:30,334
And that will stimulate my brother's ambition.

341
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:36,914
And Princess Yeon Ju will try to cover up that case for the sake of my son. Right?

342
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:44,384
I guess it will be quite entertaining to watch the two fight.

343
00:31:48,744 --> 00:31:50,414
The culprit is...

344
00:31:51,714 --> 00:31:53,574
Aebi Cheong Soon.

345
00:31:53,574 --> 00:31:56,084
I will report that to my higher-ups.

346
00:32:01,494 --> 00:32:03,454
No, you cannot!

347
00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:18,674
You said you would give me time until I find the real culprit.

348
00:32:19,474 --> 00:32:21,764
Aebi already confessed to the crime.

349
00:32:21,764 --> 00:32:22,654
Pardon?

350
00:32:22,654 --> 00:32:25,484
If she was not the culprit, why would she run away?

351
00:32:25,484 --> 00:32:29,084
Wait, Aebi ran away?

352
00:32:37,184 --> 00:32:40,684
- Tie her up. 
 - W-Wait...

353
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:42,984
Please don't!

354
00:32:45,874 --> 00:32:50,814
I confirmed that she packed up all her things and disappeared.

355
00:32:51,544 --> 00:32:54,804
I count running away as the same as telling a confession. So–

356
00:32:54,804 --> 00:32:58,374
No. Even if the suspect runs away in a murder case,

357
00:32:58,374 --> 00:33:02,864
until you capture the killer and get the confession, you cannot close the case.

358
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:05,244
You know this already!

359
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:14,374
What is with the two of you?

360
00:33:15,404 --> 00:33:17,294
What now?

361
00:33:17,294 --> 00:33:18,934
What is going on?

362
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:22,154
I heard Prince Choong Un is connected to this.

363
00:33:22,154 --> 00:33:24,554
Was that it? So what?

364
00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:28,034
You want to close the case before the blame lands on Prince Choong Un?

365
00:33:28,034 --> 00:33:31,834
You want to toss away the truth and not care about what happens to the aebi?

366
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:34,084
The runaway aebi is also responsible.

367
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:38,664
Also, the King is the one who asked us to solve this case. So—

368
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:43,434
No wonder she ran away! No wonder!

369
00:33:43,434 --> 00:33:47,064
She had no faith in the system! Because she does not trust it!

370
00:33:47,064 --> 00:33:51,134
Because look what a judge on the case is willing to do here!

371
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:53,114
And you.

372
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,404
Follow me.

373
00:33:56,404 --> 00:33:58,324
That–

374
00:34:07,384 --> 00:34:12,584
I get that you want to do anything to protect me for my sake, but enough is enough.

375
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,504
Why do you do something I did not ask you to do?

376
00:34:14,504 --> 00:34:17,614
The reason I came to see the mayor is that—

377
00:34:17,614 --> 00:34:20,494
I am telling you not to compromise your convictions.

378
00:34:20,494 --> 00:34:26,364
Do not give up on what you believe is right and the values you want to protect!

379
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:31,554
Fine. Right. So if the King hired us to work on this case,

380
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:34,234
do we then look away from an innocent person?

381
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:36,824
Do we cover up the truth?

382
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,194
Even if I do, you should not do that.

383
00:34:39,194 --> 00:34:42,274
If His Majesty is shaken by this, Minister Yu will become even more powerful!

384
00:34:42,274 --> 00:34:44,394
All the work he has done could be for nothing!

385
00:34:44,394 --> 00:34:46,544
That is what I mean!

386
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:53,904
So why are you worried about something that smells of blood?

387
00:34:54,904 --> 00:34:56,984
It upsets me...

388
00:35:16,104 --> 00:35:19,294
Whether it is revenge or whatnot, I will do it.

389
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:26,904
Only I will do the bad deed where I have to get blood on my hands.

390
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:31,484
So Won, you just live as So Won.

391
00:35:32,284 --> 00:35:34,504
Do not become broken over this.

392
00:35:46,414 --> 00:35:49,174
Kang Han Su seems to have changed a lot.

393
00:35:49,174 --> 00:35:54,394
And Princess seems to have become more political.

394
00:35:57,184 --> 00:36:00,184
  In Mourning

395
00:36:28,594 --> 00:36:36,964
 Would you like to bury this as is or... do you want to reveal the truth?

396
00:36:43,264 --> 00:36:45,604
- Relax and drink. 
 - My gosh!

397
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:47,304
Here.

398
00:36:55,204 --> 00:36:59,794
You were born a legal officer's son, so you were familiar with law books.

399
00:36:59,794 --> 00:37:03,084
- That is why you became an attorney? 
 - Yes.

400
00:37:03,084 --> 00:37:05,234
That is strange, though.

401
00:37:05,234 --> 00:37:08,184
- How come you did not become a legal officer? 
 - Gosh...

402
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:12,694
How can I desire to become a government official with my meager talent?

403
00:37:14,494 --> 00:37:19,414
Seeing you solve this case shows me you are more than talented!

404
00:37:19,414 --> 00:37:21,694
You flatter me, Your Excellency.

405
00:37:21,694 --> 00:37:23,314
Here.

406
00:37:25,484 --> 00:37:27,994
Let me pour you a glass.

407
00:37:33,804 --> 00:37:38,594
So... why do you believe that Aebi is the culprit

408
00:37:38,594 --> 00:37:41,484
because of that one silver dagger?

409
00:37:42,184 --> 00:37:45,244
It seems you do not believe that, Your Excellency.

410
00:37:45,244 --> 00:37:47,634
She does not have a motive.

411
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:50,804
I heard that motive is the most crucial thing in a murder case.

412
00:37:50,804 --> 00:37:55,904
Yes. So, I suspected the steward.

413
00:37:55,904 --> 00:37:59,644
I mean, I still have uneasy feelings about him even now.

414
00:38:00,914 --> 00:38:03,734
So I was wondering,

415
00:38:03,734 --> 00:38:09,924
did the steward truly spend the night at your house that night?

416
00:38:23,464 --> 00:38:27,294
And what is your reason for suspecting the steward?

417
00:38:28,094 --> 00:38:32,554
He has a good reputation because he is generous with people around him.

418
00:38:32,554 --> 00:38:36,164
However, he loves to gamble.

419
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:40,124
And someone like that was in charge of Late Kwon's housekeeping matters.

420
00:38:40,124 --> 00:38:45,304
That is right! So he stole Late Kwon's property!

421
00:38:45,304 --> 00:38:49,574
Moreover... he has pride.

422
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:51,414
Pride?

423
00:38:51,414 --> 00:38:56,164
He was humiliated by being scolded by Late Kwon in front of the low servants.

424
00:38:56,164 --> 00:39:00,414
I am sure he was furious and lost sleep at night.

425
00:39:00,414 --> 00:39:04,304
He had to get payback his hurt feelings, and his debt also disappeared!

426
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:08,414
He would have much to gain from Late Kwon's death!

427
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:10,424
That's just it!

428
00:39:11,194 --> 00:39:12,684
This is so entertaining.

429
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,244
- Here you go! 
 - Yes.

430
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,624
- Here. 
 - Oh, yes.

431
00:39:25,204 --> 00:39:33,244
Now then, how will you explain the aebi's silver dagger?

432
00:39:35,534 --> 00:39:38,614
My hunch says the steward is the one,

433
00:39:38,614 --> 00:39:41,424
but the evidence points to the Aebi.

434
00:39:41,424 --> 00:39:45,924
So my answer to that... is this.

435
00:39:45,924 --> 00:39:47,434
What is that?

436
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:52,564
It means those two were lovers.

437
00:39:54,654 --> 00:39:56,474
How so?

438
00:39:56,474 --> 00:40:00,324
Aebi gave me that silver dagger without hesitation.

439
00:40:00,324 --> 00:40:04,704
That proves she did not know it was used for murder.

440
00:40:04,704 --> 00:40:09,024
And that silver dagger had fancy gems attached to it.

441
00:40:09,024 --> 00:40:12,994
I am sure the generous steward had bought it for her.

442
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,944
If the silver dagger that was used as the murder weapon was used without her knowledge,

443
00:40:16,944 --> 00:40:22,414
and if it went back to its place without her knowing, it means those two were extremely close—

444
00:40:22,414 --> 00:40:23,994
No, no...

445
00:40:23,994 --> 00:40:29,624
 Would it not mean they were extremely secretive in their relationship?

446
00:40:33,754 --> 00:40:38,784
As expected, you are quite entertaining.

447
00:40:38,784 --> 00:40:40,364
- Here. 
 - Yes.

448
00:40:40,364 --> 00:40:41,754
Take one more glass.

449
00:40:41,754 --> 00:40:43,944
Oh, yes.

450
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:51,624
I cannot believe you take care of such a lowlife like myself.

451
00:40:51,624 --> 00:40:53,954
I shall never forget your kind—

452
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:01,574
Forget your kindness.

453
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:04,784
But I do have...

454
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:09,994
one question that I couldn't solve from the beginning.

455
00:41:10,674 --> 00:41:12,794
What is that?

456
00:41:13,964 --> 00:41:20,714
I mean, Cheong Soon only moved into this place a few months ago,

457
00:41:20,714 --> 00:41:24,564
yet everyone calls her the aebi.

458
00:41:24,564 --> 00:41:28,504
I mean, she could not have been the aebi of the Late Kwon.

459
00:41:28,504 --> 00:41:30,384
Then...

460
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,624
whose aebi...

461
00:41:34,924 --> 00:41:39,934
could... the aebi be?

462
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:03,664
 There! There!

463
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:22,454
 Aebi! Come and serve some drinks for me!

464
00:42:22,454 --> 00:42:24,714
 Aebi?

465
00:42:28,874 --> 00:42:32,104
 How could she be your aebi?

466
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:41,714
 How dare you take away my aebi!

467
00:42:43,484 --> 00:42:48,484
 Do you think I put you in charge of our family storage shed so that you can gamble it all away?

468
00:43:08,284 --> 00:43:12,324
He made you suffer like this over a mere inkstone?

469
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:14,824
Kwon is so heartless.

470
00:43:14,824 --> 00:43:18,194
No, Your Excellency. He had me bring it since it is valuable.

471
00:43:18,194 --> 00:43:20,864
Goodness. No.

472
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,974
I know how to read people.

473
00:43:22,974 --> 00:43:25,774
He may seem generous on the outside, taking care of his neighbors.

474
00:43:25,774 --> 00:43:30,194
But he sure is a cheapskate on the inside.

475
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:32,814
 Do you think I put you in charge of our family storage shed?

476
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:38,594
He does have that side to him a bit...

477
00:43:39,634 --> 00:43:45,054
Let me see. I want to run over now and surprise him.

478
00:43:45,054 --> 00:43:48,404
Do you know a way I can sneak into that house?

479
00:43:48,404 --> 00:43:51,594
Of course. There is no path I do not know of in that house.

480
00:43:51,594 --> 00:43:53,354
Good.

481
00:43:57,374 --> 00:43:59,634
What a shame!

482
00:43:59,634 --> 00:44:06,874
Even if I take off now, he will already be drunk by the time I arrive.

483
00:44:06,874 --> 00:44:10,184
He would never know if you carried him away on your back.

484
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:13,484
Is that not so?

485
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:16,104
Pardon?

486
00:44:16,974 --> 00:44:24,634
I am saying everyone will remember you being here at my house tonight.

487
00:44:25,334 --> 00:44:29,014
Do you get my drift?

488
00:45:26,514 --> 00:45:30,324
 I thought she become Kwon's woman.

489
00:45:32,754 --> 00:45:34,894
You wretch!

490
00:45:35,764 --> 00:45:38,714
How dare you!

491
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:44,354
How dare you steal what was mine!

492
00:45:45,804 --> 00:45:48,074
How dare you!

493
00:45:54,124 --> 00:45:56,394
How dare you...

494
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:08,974
What are you doing?

495
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,324
He killed Kwon!

496
00:46:11,324 --> 00:46:13,434
Catch him!

497
00:46:14,714 --> 00:46:17,384
I only did it because you told me to!

498
00:46:17,384 --> 00:46:21,434
You are the one who told me to kill Late Kwon!

499
00:46:21,434 --> 00:46:24,744
What did you say? You wretch!

500
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:29,044
Please stop this.

501
00:46:50,094 --> 00:46:51,984
Father...

502
00:46:55,224 --> 00:46:57,164
He is a royal family member.

503
00:46:57,164 --> 00:46:59,534
I will take care of him.

504
00:47:01,594 --> 00:47:04,214
What are you all doing? Hurry up and escort him.

505
00:47:08,744 --> 00:47:11,124
Good work.

506
00:47:11,124 --> 00:47:12,934
Let us go.

507
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,230
  Serene Hall

508
00:47:40,514 --> 00:47:44,444
Do you want to save Prince Choong Un?

509
00:47:45,244 --> 00:47:50,714
Is that... a matter of my choice?

510
00:47:50,714 --> 00:47:55,244
It is a matter of choice for me.

511
00:47:55,244 --> 00:48:00,944
Prince Choong Un's crime of provoking another person to commit murder is quite grave.

512
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:04,684
But the funny thing is that in the law books of Joseon,

513
00:48:04,684 --> 00:48:10,704
there is no title or punishment for such a crime.

514
00:48:14,344 --> 00:48:18,724
As far as the punishment, when his crime is not specifically listed,

515
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:23,744
a new order is to be carried out based on the king's judgment.

516
00:48:23,744 --> 00:48:29,894
Of course, public opinion will have a great influence on that judgment.

517
00:48:30,594 --> 00:48:35,424
Just like when Your Majesty sentenced Chu Dae Seong, Chu Yeong Wu's son, to death,

518
00:48:35,424 --> 00:48:39,924
you had Sarim and Confucious scholars' support behind you.

519
00:48:40,624 --> 00:48:44,734
The moment this case is openly discussed,

520
00:48:44,734 --> 00:48:51,014
they will pressure you for Prince Choong Un's punishment, including Hungu.

521
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:53,954
And I will make it so.

522
00:48:53,954 --> 00:48:58,334
Whether he is guilty or innocent, you are saying it is up to you. Is that right?

523
00:48:58,334 --> 00:49:04,044
Everything in this country of Joseon is up to me, Sire.

524
00:49:13,324 --> 00:49:16,024
What do I need to do?

525
00:49:17,314 --> 00:49:20,374
Withdraw Kwon Myeong Wu's appointment

526
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:25,274
and do not ever bring up abolishing the Ministers' Committee.

527
00:49:25,274 --> 00:49:29,644
How is it his responsibility that his family member was murdered?

528
00:49:29,644 --> 00:49:33,424
You mean Kwon Myeong Wu has no blame for this? Not at all.

529
00:49:33,424 --> 00:49:40,914
It is Kwon Myeong Wu's fault that Prince Choong Un thought of killing Late Kwon.

530
00:49:40,914 --> 00:49:45,144
The reason Prince Choong Un barged into Late Kwon's house

531
00:49:45,144 --> 00:49:50,024
was because he flipped out upon hearing about the aebi's upcoming wedding.

532
00:49:50,724 --> 00:49:53,164
As soon as Kwon Myeong Wu held a public post,

533
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:58,354
he started hanging around with Sarim Party scholars and discussing his family matters.

534
00:49:58,354 --> 00:50:04,104
And in the end, that news reached Prince Choong Un.

535
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:15,604
Do you truly mean to appoint such a rash person to an important post, Your Majesty?

536
00:50:26,954 --> 00:50:30,044
Oh, also...

537
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:34,444
Do you have more to say?

538
00:50:34,444 --> 00:50:41,614
Grand Queen Dowager, please carry out your duty as the eldest person in the royal family.

539
00:50:41,614 --> 00:50:47,834
Teaching your grandson and granddaughter, running around recklessly without fearing heaven,

540
00:50:47,834 --> 00:50:51,194
is also your responsibility, Queen Dowager.

541
00:50:52,134 --> 00:50:56,714
Who do you mean?

542
00:50:56,714 --> 00:51:02,984
The princess you cherish the most. I am speaking of Princess Yeon Ju.

543
00:51:02,984 --> 00:51:05,114
What about my sister?

544
00:51:05,904 --> 00:51:09,634
Do you even know what kind of people Princess Yeon Ju meets

545
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:14,964
and what she is up to these days, Your Highness?

546
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:25,394
Do as Ministry Yu wants, King.

547
00:51:25,394 --> 00:51:27,344
Grandmother...

548
00:51:27,344 --> 00:51:31,604
It is not for Prince Choong Un's sake. It is for your sake.

549
00:51:31,604 --> 00:51:34,174
Prince Choong Un's shame equals the royal family's shame.

550
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:38,704
It is obvious it will affect your authority and power.

551
00:51:41,044 --> 00:51:44,624
Do not provoke Minister Yu further, King.

552
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:50,204
It is still not time yet.

553
00:52:51,734 --> 00:52:54,954
So,  the aebi did not run away?

554
00:52:55,624 --> 00:52:57,584
No.

555
00:52:57,584 --> 00:53:00,614
By chance, did you hide her away and lie, saying she ran away

556
00:53:00,614 --> 00:53:04,674
to frame the Aebi for everything and close the case?

557
00:53:04,674 --> 00:53:07,924
I did not want to be played by Minister Yu.

558
00:53:08,784 --> 00:53:13,904
I mean, others who hear you would think that Minister Yu is your enemy, not mine.

559
00:53:13,904 --> 00:53:16,634
You asked me to become a handkerchief for suffering people.

560
00:53:16,634 --> 00:53:18,864
You said you want to wipe their tears. So why?

561
00:53:18,864 --> 00:53:23,734
Because that was before I fell in love with you.

562
00:53:25,734 --> 00:53:31,574
But now, protecting you from Minister Yu comes first.

563
00:53:31,574 --> 00:53:33,614
I do not regret it.

564
00:53:41,394 --> 00:53:47,264
The steward who killed Kwon. Jo's punishment was carried out today. 
  Harmonize Family

565
00:53:50,034 --> 00:53:54,470
  Offense of sins

566
00:54:06,524 --> 00:54:11,684
 Instead of receiving punishment from the royal family, Prince Choong Un was sent to convalesce.

567
00:54:17,294 --> 00:54:24,044
Thus, I realized that you can kill someone without dirtying your hands if you have power.

568
00:54:24,044 --> 00:54:28,604
The steward also could have done such a reckless deed because

569
00:54:28,604 --> 00:54:31,754
someone like Prince Choong Un was watching his back.

570
00:54:31,754 --> 00:54:35,084
That is correct. That is what power is.

571
00:54:35,084 --> 00:54:39,964
Thus, I started desiring to practice that power.

572
00:54:42,314 --> 00:54:45,184
I will marry Princess Yeon Ju.

573
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,840
   Harmonize Family

574
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:07,434
The reason the late King wanted you to marry Princess Yeon Ju

575
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:10,604
was because he wanted to keep my power in check.

576
00:55:10,604 --> 00:55:17,874
That is why I broke off the engagement between you and the Princess.

577
00:55:17,874 --> 00:55:22,244
And now you are volunteering to be the Princess's husband?

578
00:55:25,734 --> 00:55:28,264
You will throw away the wealth and honor,

579
00:55:28,264 --> 00:55:31,524
and all the duty you must carry out for this nation, Joseon,

580
00:55:31,524 --> 00:55:34,674
and you will live merely as a princess's husband?

581
00:55:34,674 --> 00:55:38,404
You said I could do anything I wanted.

582
00:55:38,404 --> 00:55:44,434
If I cannot have one woman I love, what good is it being your son?

583
00:55:52,684 --> 00:55:54,724
Fine.

584
00:55:54,724 --> 00:55:57,794
Do so if you really desire it.

585
00:55:58,864 --> 00:56:01,454
I will just change the law

586
00:56:01,454 --> 00:56:04,214
so that the princess's husband could also hold office.

587
00:56:04,214 --> 00:56:07,004
I guess that would be faster.

588
00:56:42,424 --> 00:56:45,664
You two seem different yet so similar.

589
00:56:45,664 --> 00:56:49,664
You carry Joseon in your heart,

590
00:56:49,664 --> 00:56:53,824
and Young Master Ji Seon carries a woman in his heart.

591
00:56:54,524 --> 00:56:57,024
What a fool.

592
00:56:57,024 --> 00:57:01,764
How about you consider it a scholar's conviction?

593
00:57:01,764 --> 00:57:06,594
He is still keeping the promise of his young love.

594
00:57:06,594 --> 00:57:12,984
A scholar is only used and abandoned by politicians. Just like your father!

595
00:57:14,044 --> 00:57:19,754
That is why I would rather have Ji Seon live as a politician than a scholar.

596
00:57:21,434 --> 00:57:23,944
I will also help you.

597
00:57:23,944 --> 00:57:29,674
Whatever that may be if it helps you and Young Master.

598
00:57:38,854 --> 00:57:42,914
I took care of it as you commanded.

599
00:57:42,914 --> 00:57:46,194
Please tell me when the time comes.

600
00:57:56,714 --> 00:57:58,324
It is the palace supply rights.

601
00:57:58,324 --> 00:58:01,144
 Palace Supply Rights

602
00:58:01,884 --> 00:58:05,774
Your subject does not deserve such grace, Minister Yu!

603
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:19,780
  Grand Hall

604
00:58:34,494 --> 00:58:36,844
I received a reply from Princess.

605
00:58:36,844 --> 00:58:40,914
She said to meet her at Wongaksa Temple on the fifteenth of the month.

01:01:15,694 --> 01:01:19,164
Do as you wish, Your Highness.

642
01:01:19,164 --> 01:01:20,674
I will help you.

643
01:01:20,674 --> 01:01:29,174
♫  And meet you just once more  ♫

644
01:03:02,094 --> 01:03:03,874
Your Excellency, what brings you here?

645
01:03:03,874 --> 01:03:07,044
His Majesty sent me a hurried message.

646
01:03:27,774 --> 01:03:29,624
What is going on?

647
01:03:40,594 --> 01:03:42,244
Let's go.

648
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,290
This...

649
01:04:03,294 --> 01:04:05,004
Where am I?

650
01:04:05,004 --> 01:04:07,024
What is this?

651
01:04:25,074 --> 01:04:26,114
What's going on?

652
01:04:26,114 --> 01:04:29,104
That guy over there is Kang Han Su.

653
01:04:29,774 --> 01:04:30,794
Arrest him.

654
01:04:30,794 --> 01:04:32,684
Yes, sir.

655
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:35,414
Wait.

656
01:04:36,734 --> 01:04:42,984
Kang Han Su, you are under arrest for murdering former Associate Right Minister Chu Yeong Wu.

657
01:04:42,984 --> 01:04:46,334
What in the world are you talking about? Who murdered whom?

658
01:04:46,334 --> 01:04:50,844
The witness said he saw a man wearing a light blue outer coat

659
01:04:50,844 --> 01:04:54,954
and a black hat hanging around near the crime scene.

660
01:04:54,954 --> 01:04:58,474
And we even found the murder weapon on your ship.

661
01:04:58,474 --> 01:05:01,064
Do not even think about denying it.

662
01:05:04,104 --> 01:05:06,724
He is not the murderer!

663
01:05:07,454 --> 01:05:09,274
So Won.

664
01:05:09,274 --> 01:05:12,534
He was with me on the day Minister Chu was murdered.

665
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,404
Step aside.

666
01:05:14,404 --> 01:05:17,374
How dare a woman step forward in this?

667
01:05:22,894 --> 01:05:28,254
If you protect a murderer, you may lose your head, bitch.

668
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:34,244
Let go!

669
01:05:35,144 --> 01:05:37,444
Step back!

670
01:05:37,444 --> 01:05:39,444
Your Excellency the Mayor.

671
01:05:55,924 --> 01:05:57,934
Princess.

672
01:06:01,484 --> 01:06:03,244
Mind your proper manners.

673
01:06:03,244 --> 01:06:07,144
This is Princess Yeon Ju, the daughter of the late King.

674
01:06:27,744 --> 01:06:30,014
Greetings to Your Highness, the Princess.

675
01:06:30,014 --> 01:06:32,844
 Greetings to Your Highness, the Princess.

676
01:06:55,054 --> 01:06:57,404
Princess?

677
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:22,600

678
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:27,050
♫  Love you forever  ♫

679
01:07:27,894 --> 01:07:33,910
♫  Even if it hurts like crazy &nbsp;♫ 
♫  I will forever &nbsp;♫

680
01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:37,904
♫  Stay by your side  ♫

681
01:07:37,904 --> 01:07:42,044
♫  Even if the cold wind blows  ♫

682
01:07:42,044 --> 01:07:43,974
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

683
01:07:43,974 --> 01:07:48,554
 Who in the world is he that you are behaving this way?

684
01:07:48,554 --> 01:07:55,154
 I have... promised him that I would protect him.

685
01:07:58,064 --> 01:08:00,934
 I will marry the Princess.

686
01:08:02,464 --> 01:08:04,934
 You said I could use you in the past, Your Excellency.

687
01:08:04,934 --> 01:08:07,594
 Will it be okay if I do so?

688
01:08:09,714 --> 01:08:11,564
 I have something to say to you!

689
01:08:11,564 --> 01:08:15,014
 Are you saying you will continue to play me?

690
01:08:15,714 --> 01:08:19,754
 You are not a miracle to me but a curse.

691
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:22,774
 We are ill-fated.

692
01:08:22,774 --> 01:08:26,620
♫  You are that person to me  ♫
