(Characters, incidents, and period depicted are purely fictional.)

2
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:12,742
There was a time when I was poor yet happy.

3
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:21,522
My mother felt sorry for our insufficient meals.

4
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:26,121
She cut off her precious hair she got from her parents...

5
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:28,061
in exchange for dried fish.

6
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:29,121
You should eat some too.

7
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:33,591
My father felt sorry for his wife.

8
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:35,701
Here.

9
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:39,572
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

10
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:41,701
He sold his cherished books...

11
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:48,612
to buy Mother a present. Those were the days.

12
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:51,011
Father.

13
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:52,852
Hello, Han Soo.

14
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:55,422
What is this?

15
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:57,021
You mean, this?

16
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,122
Take it.

17
00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:02,092
Tell her that you bought it for her.

18
00:01:37,892 --> 00:01:39,092
What is this?

19
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:41,401
Oh, my.

20
00:01:41,862 --> 00:01:43,232
This is silk.

21
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:45,972
Did you buy this?

22
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:48,241
Well, I would never steal.

23
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,512
Why did you pay for something we cannot even eat?

24
00:01:56,142 --> 00:01:57,282
By the way,

25
00:01:57,782 --> 00:01:58,952
what is this?

26
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:01,151
What am I thinking?

27
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:05,151
Someone wanted to use the toilet, and she left it there for a moment.

28
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,561
Cut it out. That belongs to someone else.

29
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,292
We need to see what it is...

30
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,461
to know if someone forgot this or threw this out.

31
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,531
Goodness.

32
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:21,102
What is this?

33
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:23,442
My goodness.

34
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,512
This is...

35
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:28,681
Arrest all of his family...

36
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:31,012
and search every nook and cranny!

37
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:32,311
- Yes! - Yes!

38
00:02:34,982 --> 00:02:36,781
No, Han Soo!

39
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:37,991
What are you doing?

40
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:40,251
- We did not do anything! - What are you doing?

41
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,792
Han Soo, no!

42
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:44,961
No! Stop it!

43
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:53,572
Back then,

44
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,542
I realized anger, hatred,

45
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,512
grief, bitterness, and pain...

46
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:01,142
all come together...

47
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,042
to form resentment.

48
00:03:04,341 --> 00:03:06,151
Han Soo!

49
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:09,822
- I will get my revenge. - Mother!

50
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:12,292
My deep-rooted resentment and pain...

51
00:03:12,952 --> 00:03:15,021
shall be made known to the world.

52
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:20,392
That is...

53
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:23,501
why I became an attorney.

54
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:28,072
(Episode 2: A Prelude to Revenge)

55
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:33,042
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

56
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:47,521
How about a deal with me?

57
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:49,162
We can work together.

58
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,362
I am saying I will spare your life.

59
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:54,262
A deal is something you make...

60
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:57,031
when both parties have something for each other.

61
00:03:57,162 --> 00:04:00,471
What can a mere attorney offer to a guild master like me?

62
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:12,252
All right.

63
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,481
Well...

64
00:04:13,981 --> 00:04:15,382
You recently failed...

65
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:18,052
to secure a supply deal with the palace.

66
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:22,091
That supply deal with the palace...

67
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,062
you failed to get.

68
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:26,762
I will make it happen.

69
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,031
There is no way you can do that.

70
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,341
Hey.

71
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,351
Wait!

72
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:09,171
You little...

73
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:19,312
Hey!

74
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:22,122
Wait!

75
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,721
Give me a moment.

76
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:25,591
Well...

77
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:28,861
The officer in charge is looking everywhere for a painting, right?

78
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:30,961
I will get that for you.

79
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:32,531
I searched the entire country as a guild master...

80
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,062
and still could not find it.

81
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,231
How can you get it?

82
00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:39,202
Come on out.

83
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:42,901
I know...

84
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,211
that man, Pyo,

85
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,872
who owns the painting.

86
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:53,252
(About a month ago)

87
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:58,921
There are so many of them.

88
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:06,861
All right.

89
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:09,832
Come for some Taffy!

90
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:11,361
I want one!

91
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:13,202
- Have some Taffy. - Please give me one.

92
00:06:13,202 --> 00:06:14,601
- I would like one. - I want one.

93
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,471
- Eat more. - This is sweet.

94
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,841
- Eat up. - Okay.

95
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,642
This is delicious.

96
00:06:27,182 --> 00:06:28,521
I do not know what is happening,

97
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,781
but he is locked up in prison in Hanseongbu.

98
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:32,992
I will use my talent as an attorney to free that man,

99
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:36,122
then take the painting instead of my legal fees.

100
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:37,822
What do you think?

101
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:40,192
Will you trust me and do this with me?

102
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:45,132
Do you expect me to trust you over one trial you won...

103
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:46,432
with some wordplay you made?

104
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:49,671
- Not a chance. - Well, it is...

105
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:51,971
That sounds more than reasonable.

106
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:53,041
What?

107
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,651
So instead of looking for that non existent trust,

108
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:04,052
you should establish security.

109
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:05,692
What? This is...

110
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,791
She must be half-asleep.

111
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,132
In that case...

112
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:18,771
Hey, who is that girl?

113
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:20,372
You brought her for nothing!

114
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:22,442
Either put a gag on her or get rid of her!

115
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:24,171
Three hundred nyang.

116
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:29,981
Does 300 nyang sound enough...

117
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:31,611
as security?

118
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:35,952
That attorney has suspiciously much information on us.

119
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,692
Do not let him go for such money.

120
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:41,861
Fine.

121
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:44,791
However,

122
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:46,892
I will decide on the security.

123
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,791
Once we polish her up,

124
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,552
she should be quite useful.

125
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:16,822
She is definitely worth 300 nyang.

126
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,132
Do not say...

127
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:24,162
she will be worth 300 nyang, because I do not see it...

128
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:28,471
You should find another security...

129
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:29,902
Fine.

130
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:33,971
She is fine with it.

131
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:38,381
Will you give us a moment of privacy?

132
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:43,251
It will only take a moment.

133
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:02,902
Do not look away, and keep a watch at all times.

134
00:09:02,902 --> 00:09:04,101
Yes, Master Jang.

135
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:16,422
What were you...

136
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,491
Thinking? No, I was not thinking.

137
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,052
My head did not make that decision,

138
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:21,721
but my heart did.

139
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:23,792
I wanted to give you my trust.

140
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:26,131
Wait, why?

141
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:28,032
I do not remember giving you that trust.

142
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:30,001
But you did make me curious.

143
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,442
I became curious to find out...

144
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:42,312
what you were about to do and what you were capable of doing.

145
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:45,582
But I cannot tell him that.

146
00:09:47,582 --> 00:09:48,652
What are you talking about?

147
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:50,981
You need to tell me so that I can understand!

148
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:54,121
Well, you know. This is it.

149
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:55,162
Yes?

150
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,022
- It is... - Yes?

151
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:00,761
- It is... - What?

152
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:02,361
I fell in love at first sight with you.

153
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:06,131
I wanted to go this far to pay you back...

154
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:08,371
and help you.

155
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:11,042
That would be the proper attitude...

156
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:13,711
of someone in love, would it not?

157
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,182
What?

158
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:17,412
So, I hope you achieve your goal.

159
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:18,912
I will buy you some time.

160
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,522
- You are out of your mind. - Yes.

161
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,782
Wait. Pardon?

162
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,621
You can still be sick without a fever.

163
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:29,861
You are ill.

164
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:33,062
So, forget about everything that happened and be on your way.

165
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:35,032
Wait. I am not that disloyal.

166
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:36,402
I am a woman of my word.

167
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,501
I do not like to owe.

168
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:39,032
You are not owing me. It is love.

169
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:40,932
This is how it starts.

170
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:42,542
I hate that even more.

171
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,672
I am only helpful when there is a lawsuit.

172
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:47,172
I am nothing but trouble in one's everyday life.

173
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:48,611
I will be the judge of that.

174
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:50,782
They say that you are the last person to know yourself.

175
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:51,812
Give a shot...

176
00:10:53,582 --> 00:10:54,881
at my judge of character.

177
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:03,662
But...

178
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:09,261
Are ten days long enough?

179
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:12,101
Eleven days?

180
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:15,001
Twelve?

181
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:17,741
Then...

182
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:22,881
thirteen days?

183
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,412
I will finish it in five days.

184
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:26,452
Great!

185
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:32,652
Go on.

186
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,361
Gosh.

187
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:46,072
How can she possibly have feelings for you?

188
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:47,172
What?

189
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:52,611
You should have been more strict.

190
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:55,682
"I have my own plans, so get out of here!"

191
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,282
"Do you not have a life?"

192
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:00,452
Judging from her character, she would have asked...

193
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:03,152
even more follow-up questions and exhausted me.

194
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:10,461
Figures. She is into you, so she is clearly abnormal.

195
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:11,461
Right.

196
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,761
She has guts, tenacity, and a bit of lunacy.

197
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:20,032
I could sense her experience that she has cultivated...

198
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:23,702
from dealing with all those sailors at the merchant house.

199
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:25,711
However,

200
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:30,841
she did not smell fishy at all.

201
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:34,251
I smell something unfamiliar from her.

202
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:44,692
Is it hemp cloth, perhaps?

203
00:12:47,062 --> 00:12:48,162
She is not...

204
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:51,402
the one who is into you. You are into her.

205
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:56,841
That was my first time.

206
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,442
Your first time?

207
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:02,912
I am sorry.

208
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:05,981
Having someone apologize to me.

209
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:10,121
Every time, it was, "I am sorry, spare my life, or please let me go."

210
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:12,792
People have only begged me.

211
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:15,822
It is my first apology in life.

212
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:19,292
Because no one had ever sincerely apologized...

213
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:21,532
to me.

214
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:27,702
Whatever!

215
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:29,841
You have never apologized to me either.

216
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:31,871
Gosh.

217
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:35,442
Let us have a drink.

218
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:37,582
(Sowongak)

219
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:43,351
Search the streets,

220
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:45,822
and you two can check out the dock.

221
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,522
You will get us caught.

222
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:51,391
We ought to tell them where she is, though.

223
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:52,461
You know, show mercy.

224
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:54,832
It is obvious what they will do to us, then.

225
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:56,361
Use your instincts.

226
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,231
Come on.

227
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:02,702
Gosh.

228
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:05,871
It has been such a long night.

229
00:14:09,442 --> 00:14:11,611
So, what is your plan?

230
00:14:12,782 --> 00:14:15,111
What do you think it is? We must release Pyo.

231
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:17,322
I can get a painting in return instead of legal fees.

232
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:18,922
What? You jerk!

233
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,322
Then, why did you lock up Pyo in the first place?

234
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,731
They were looking for Pyo to find the painting,

235
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,961
so I searched every nook and cranny of the city...

236
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:30,062
for a month to find him!

237
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:31,302
And you will release him?

238
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:33,032
A criminal, of all people?

239
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:36,042
I get it. Calm yourself.

240
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:38,501
Calm it.

241
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:42,542
He is something else, though.

242
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:45,412
A thief who ran away from Ming for stealing a painting...

243
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:48,511
had the nerve to traffick children in a foreign country.

244
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:53,221
Thanks to him, I have bait to throw at Master Jang.

245
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:54,721
He is precious to me now.

246
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:57,822
So,

247
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:02,332
how would you lure Master Jang with that bait of yours?

248
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:05,471
I will give him exactly what my father had gotten.

249
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:08,072
Yes. So how?

250
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:10,702
How are Pyo and Master Jang related?

251
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:19,111
There is something between them.

252
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:22,182
What?

253
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:29,491
You would have me acquitted?

254
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,591
In Joseon,

255
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:34,631
once you are imprisoned due to a false charge,

256
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:36,062
your life is practically over.

257
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,601
You are either tortured to death during an interrogation,

258
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:40,772
or you die in a lockup, waiting for the verdict.

259
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:42,741
Either way, you end up dying.

260
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:46,471
That is why you need an attorney, such as myself.

261
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:49,312
Attorney Kang Han Soo...

262
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:51,741
has an undefeated record.

263
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:53,052
But I have no money.

264
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,652
You have other things.

265
00:15:59,552 --> 00:16:01,621
A valuable item that crossed the sea.

266
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:09,932
So, you know who I am.

267
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,871
Yes. Very well.

268
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:17,871
Please hurry, then.

269
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:20,572
The kids must be hungry.

270
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:23,741
- Help! - Help!

271
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:27,312
I could not even bring them water as I was arrested out of the blue.

272
00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:36,192
I will need a new ship...

273
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:39,631
that will safely get me out of Joseon.

274
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:41,832
Han Soo...

275
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:46,332
I must be getting old, seeing how I got arrested.

276
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,572
I feel lazy to bring all of them.

277
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:51,272
You can buy the children.

278
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,241
I will sell them at a low price.

279
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:54,611
A hundred nyang.

280
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:56,242
A hundred?

281
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,651
Han Soo, come and talk to me.

282
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:07,421
It is not that I think it is too expensive.

283
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:09,722
But look at his attitude.

284
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:13,562
Who knows what else he will do if you let him go?

285
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:24,572
You want to borrow a ship?

286
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:27,042
Yes, that was one of Pyo's terms.

287
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:29,212
I promised to buy the children that he abducted.

288
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,841
Is that all?

289
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:33,181
One more thing.

290
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:37,151
I will need you to stand as a witness.

291
00:17:39,722 --> 00:17:41,552
You must testify...

292
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:44,861
that you were with him on the night of the abduction.

293
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:46,992
I must testify as well?

294
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,232
It sounds like you want false testimony.

295
00:17:50,232 --> 00:17:52,032
- I can do that. - It has to be...

296
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,131
Master Jang.

297
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:56,901
How so?

298
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,641
The judge might think...

299
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:00,841
that I have bribed the witness to give false testimony.

300
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:04,242
However, you and I have an uncomfortable relationship...

301
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:06,512
of fighting against each other during a lawsuit.

302
00:18:06,512 --> 00:18:08,151
You are the last person...

303
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:09,921
to be bribed to give false testimony.

304
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:13,621
How would we trust him and risk such a thing?

305
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:28,941
If one false testimony...

306
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,972
can get me a contract with the palace...

307
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:43,451
Master Jang, this seems wrong.

308
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,552
Master Jang!

309
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,222
There is no other way!

310
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:51,992
Otherwise, all these might go to waste.

311
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:55,191
But he has caused us a loss once before.

312
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:56,562
He is unpredictable.

313
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:58,832
And?

314
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:03,502
I will find out if he has an ulterior motive.

315
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,272
Please give me a chance.

316
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:16,552
How could you do this? You promised me more time.

317
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:20,722
Attorney Kang is going to defend a child kidnapper at the court.

318
00:19:20,752 --> 00:19:21,951
Did you not know?

319
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:23,822
He plans to defend a criminal?

320
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,631
Release me now. I will go and stop him this instant.

321
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:27,992
I ought to teach him a lesson.

322
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:31,232
So,

323
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:35,302
you volunteered to be a hostage...

324
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:37,371
without the slightest idea of his plans?

325
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:39,841
I believed that he would do something about it.

326
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,171
I had no clue about what he would do.

327
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,651
You expect me to believe that?

328
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:50,482
Would you like to cut my heart out and find out?

329
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:02,861
Then, you may go and stop him.

330
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,201
Or teach him a lesson, as you said.

331
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:13,272
So you will use me to distract Attorney Kang...

332
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,141
and pry into him, will you not?

333
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,712
You are unnecessarily quick-witted.

334
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:23,921
I make a living by working at a merchant house.

335
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,292
I cannot afford to be dense.

336
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:28,522
Then,

337
00:20:28,522 --> 00:20:30,462
I can just drag time?

338
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:33,091
Promise you will release me in exchange.

339
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,431
Fine.

340
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:36,701
You are free to go.

341
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:38,532
All right.

342
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,851
You have to make an appearance at the perfect timing.

343
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,462
If it is too soon, they may run away.

344
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,762
If it is too late, there may be a variable.

345
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:08,292
Are you sure we could...

346
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:10,062
make money out of this if things go well?

347
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:11,802
Getting revenge is the priority,

348
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:12,901
and money is guaranteed.

349
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:17,871
Great.

350
00:21:17,871 --> 00:21:19,611
Let us get ourselves...

351
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,042
something much better than Jang's ship.

352
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:23,812
Good. Let us go.

353
00:21:24,111 --> 00:21:25,242
Shall we?

354
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:28,681
What...

355
00:21:42,062 --> 00:21:44,062
What are you trying to pull?

356
00:21:44,062 --> 00:21:45,101
How did you come out?

357
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:46,772
That is not important.

358
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,272
Then what is?

359
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:49,641
I suggest...

360
00:21:50,871 --> 00:21:53,141
- we make a bet. - A bet?

361
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:54,972
If you win, you can take the lawsuit.

362
00:21:54,972 --> 00:21:56,242
But if you lose,

363
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,111
give up on defending that vicious criminal.

364
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,212
Is that what this is about?

365
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:02,621
- Deal? - What if I decline?

366
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,052
I will stop being your hostage.

367
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:06,222
Then,

368
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,421
you will be dragged to the warehouse instead of me.

369
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:14,792
Either way,

370
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,631
I have to give up on the lawsuit if I lose the bet.

371
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:19,871
If you are unsure, you can give up now.

372
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,302
Give up?

373
00:22:23,871 --> 00:22:25,742
You better not give up yourself.

374
00:22:26,371 --> 00:22:28,941
It will be boring if it is too easy.

375
00:22:29,072 --> 00:22:30,212
Then...

376
00:22:30,712 --> 00:22:31,982
from now on,

377
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:34,651
the two will start drinking.

378
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:35,921
Drink?

379
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,191
Quiet down.

380
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:46,931
Whoever gets drunk first will be the loser.

381
00:22:47,562 --> 00:22:48,732
Bring in the booze.

382
00:22:56,671 --> 00:22:59,272
So I will have a drinking feast for free today.

383
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:04,341
I wonder if you know I was once called...

384
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,752
the Boozer from Inferno in courtesan houses.

385
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:09,982
Do you know where this place is?

386
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:12,891
Everyone good at drinking...

387
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,022
visits this merchant house at least once.

388
00:23:15,522 --> 00:23:17,292
Those people call me...

389
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,532
the Celestial Drinker.

390
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:21,391
Because when they drink over a bet with me,

391
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:22,562
they experience what a paradise is like.

392
00:23:38,512 --> 00:23:40,681
All right. The first glass!

393
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:55,332
You left a little in your glass. How shameless.

394
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:57,802
And you spill more than you drink.

395
00:23:57,962 --> 00:23:59,631
All right. The second glass.

396
00:24:12,212 --> 00:24:13,951
About Pyo's case.

397
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,651
Can you show me the case record?

398
00:24:22,992 --> 00:24:24,361
That is no big deal.

399
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:26,431
Follow me.

400
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:39,371
The 12th glass.

401
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:54,851
Do you really have to defend...

402
00:24:55,052 --> 00:25:00,062
that scumbag who sold off children by going this far?

403
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,332
To win Master Jang's favour, at that!

404
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,611
The case was first reported...

405
00:25:14,611 --> 00:25:17,381
by a wench named Oh Wol who lives in Aneumgol.

406
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:18,982
She is a courtesan.

407
00:25:20,582 --> 00:25:21,911
Oh Wol...

408
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:23,052
Hey!

409
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,881
- Where were you? - I went to eat.

410
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:27,951
- You went to eat? - Yes.

411
00:25:28,351 --> 00:25:30,492
- I waited for you... - That wench.

412
00:25:32,562 --> 00:25:34,091
Are you okay?

413
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,361
I wish I could take the beating on your behalf.

414
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:37,901
You are better than Dong Chi.

415
00:25:39,232 --> 00:25:41,931
Kang Han Soo, that punk...

416
00:25:55,982 --> 00:25:57,252
The 20th glass.

417
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:17,072
Gosh.

418
00:26:17,572 --> 00:26:19,472
This jar...

419
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:21,371
can hold...

420
00:26:22,242 --> 00:26:23,542
as much as 20 glasses.

421
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:26,212
If you catch up with me,

422
00:26:27,151 --> 00:26:28,911
we will resume, then.

423
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:31,022
I need to go to the toilet.

424
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,451
- Dong Chi, let us go. - Gosh, okay.

425
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:35,022
- Gosh. - You might throw up if you go now.

426
00:26:39,762 --> 00:26:40,861
Search the place.

427
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:47,901
Search everywhere.

428
00:26:48,002 --> 00:26:49,101
- Yes, master. - Yes, master.

429
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:01,451
Kang Han Soo, that darn...

430
00:27:03,282 --> 00:27:04,881
- Han Soo! - Goodness.

431
00:27:04,881 --> 00:27:05,921
Come on!

432
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:08,522
Han Soo!

433
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:12,691
So Won.

434
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:14,262
Is it a tie?

435
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:16,601
I thought she was called the Celestial Drinker.

436
00:27:18,861 --> 00:27:20,832
I gave her that nickname...

437
00:27:20,832 --> 00:27:22,502
because she goes to paradise every time she drinks.

438
00:27:25,972 --> 00:27:27,512
Move. Darn it.

439
00:27:35,451 --> 00:27:36,851
(Sowongak)

440
00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:39,252
This is why...

441
00:27:39,322 --> 00:27:43,661
I told you to practice drinking when you had time.

442
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:46,762
You cannot even hold your liquor, and you drank in broad daylight.

443
00:27:46,992 --> 00:27:49,292
What a humiliation.

444
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:50,631
Goodness.

445
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:52,601
- Stay still. - Gosh.

446
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:13,151
Just what are you scheming?

447
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,151
I am not sure what it is about,

448
00:28:15,252 --> 00:28:17,022
but if you want to keep it hidden,

449
00:28:17,522 --> 00:28:18,992
drink from the left jar.

450
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:36,982
I said I hated to be indebted.

451
00:28:37,012 --> 00:28:39,282
And I said it was love, not a debt.

452
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:40,351
So,

453
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,351
you will help me release that vicious criminal?

454
00:28:42,351 --> 00:28:43,822
There must be a reason you are releasing him.

455
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,322
I told you. I want to trust you this time.

456
00:28:49,121 --> 00:28:51,562
What you said was true.

457
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:52,992
That young lady...

458
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,332
must like you for real.

459
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:56,802
We have no time. Let us hurry.

460
00:28:57,962 --> 00:28:59,131
Okay.

461
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,641
Where is the wench?

462
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:10,341
The people at the merchant house stopped me from taking her.

463
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,042
What about Master Jang?

464
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,812
It seems he went to the government office.

465
00:29:14,411 --> 00:29:15,881
Darn it.

466
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:26,732
- I know, right? - It is about...

467
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:30,861
I will find out if he has an ulterior motive.

468
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:32,931
Please give me a chance.

469
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:35,572
Did something happen on the way?

470
00:29:36,032 --> 00:29:37,502
What is taking him so long?

471
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:50,222
It is him.

472
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,582
I am certain that I saw him that night.

473
00:29:52,782 --> 00:29:54,091
Me too.

474
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:56,921
I am sure he climbed over the wall.

475
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:01,131
Just what were you doing outside that night?

476
00:30:01,431 --> 00:30:03,361
Well, we...

477
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:04,601
Are you sure...

478
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:07,171
that Pyo took the child that night?

479
00:30:07,732 --> 00:30:09,032
I did see him, but...

480
00:30:09,201 --> 00:30:10,841
You must have obviously become dead drunk...

481
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:12,941
from drinking until late at night.

482
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:14,742
So how can you be that sure?

483
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:16,542
- Well... - The thing is...

484
00:30:19,212 --> 00:30:20,252
Magistrate.

485
00:30:20,812 --> 00:30:22,851
As far as I know, Kim and Choi...

486
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:24,921
can only drink up to one jar of makgeolli.

487
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:27,022
They are light drinkers who get drunk easily.

488
00:30:27,151 --> 00:30:29,351
So if they had drunk until that hour after work,

489
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:30,621
they would not have been able...

490
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,062
to distinguish up, down, left, and right...

491
00:30:32,062 --> 00:30:33,492
nor the faces of their ancestors.

492
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:36,361
Therefore, for their testimonies to be valid,

493
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:37,832
they must prove that they drank...

494
00:30:38,032 --> 00:30:39,871
but were sober enough to see...

495
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,401
and make a sound judgement...

496
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:42,931
to recognize the person during that night...

497
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:46,002
and that they have a high alcohol tolerance.

498
00:30:48,212 --> 00:30:49,312
Even so,

499
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:53,111
that cannot prove that Pyo is innocent.

500
00:30:54,712 --> 00:30:56,252
I will bring forth a witness.

501
00:30:57,421 --> 00:30:59,222
- "A witness?" - Yes.

502
00:30:59,552 --> 00:31:02,391
There was another person who saw Pyo that night.

503
00:31:02,752 --> 00:31:05,591
Pyo was somewhere else with someone else.

504
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:07,032
You little...

505
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:10,931
Is there not a possibility that...

506
00:31:11,062 --> 00:31:13,931
you bribed that person to stand witness?

507
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:16,742
You will see that...

508
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:19,341
this man cannot be bribed by me.

509
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,282
Tell him to come in.

510
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:26,381
Allow him inside.

511
00:31:32,451 --> 00:31:33,822
Here he comes. Who is it?

512
00:31:33,822 --> 00:31:36,222
- What? Master Jang? - Is he not Master Jang?

513
00:31:36,722 --> 00:31:38,861
- Why is he, Master Jang, here? - Who?

514
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:41,332
- Goodness. - I cannot believe this.

515
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:48,732
I am Jang, the master...

516
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:50,472
of the guild I run.

517
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:53,512
Right.

518
00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:57,282
Were you with Pyo over there...

519
00:31:58,282 --> 00:31:59,812
that day?

520
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:04,552
Yes. I was, Magistrate.

521
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:11,022
On that day, where and what were you doing with Pyo?

522
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:13,931
If the two of your statements are the same,

523
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:17,032
the testimony that you were with him will be accepted.

524
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:18,802
I do not know this man.

525
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,302
What did you say?

526
00:32:22,772 --> 00:32:24,072
I do not know him.

527
00:32:24,472 --> 00:32:27,171
That day, I was sleeping alone in a hut.

528
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:29,611
Witness.

529
00:32:30,512 --> 00:32:32,712
Are you sure you were with Pyo that day?

530
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:36,552
Well...

531
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:40,591
Yes, I am sure.

532
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:43,591
But you, Pyo, were all alone.

533
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:46,161
That is right.

534
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:48,262
Listen, Pyo.

535
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:51,161
Master Jang is trying to help you.

536
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:53,332
Think carefully.

537
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:56,941
That man is the real culprit.

538
00:32:58,171 --> 00:32:59,742
Only the real culprit...

539
00:32:59,742 --> 00:33:02,212
would know that I am not the culprit.

540
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:04,841
But why would this man go out of his way to help me?

541
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:09,082
I do not know, either.

542
00:33:11,482 --> 00:33:14,421
- What? Is that possible? - Does that even make sense?

543
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:16,921
- So is he the real culprit? - Oh, goodness.

544
00:33:17,022 --> 00:33:18,492
- Yes. - It seems like it.

545
00:33:20,062 --> 00:33:23,232
"The real culprit?" Me? Why would I be the real culprit?

546
00:33:24,232 --> 00:33:26,302
This is utterly unreasonable, Magistrate.

547
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:30,371
I am in no way connected to the abduction of the children.

548
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:31,941
Good grief.

549
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:36,212
Then why did you testify that you were with Pyo?

550
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:37,641
Because...

551
00:33:39,712 --> 00:33:41,982
That man told me to do it.

552
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:44,851
It was in return for a painting.

553
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:46,381
"A painting?"

554
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,891
A false testimony for a painting?

555
00:33:55,962 --> 00:33:57,062
He could be...

556
00:33:58,101 --> 00:33:59,402
the real culprit.

557
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:04,741
Right. I was with Merchant Cho that day.

558
00:34:06,371 --> 00:34:08,812
You cannot believe the words of the man who has already lied.

559
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:10,982
Fooled by him, I made a false testimony.

560
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,442
I feel wronged, Magistrate.

561
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,652
Fortunately, Merchant Cho, who will testify about...

562
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:17,181
my whereabouts, is right here.

563
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:19,922
Merchant Cho's testimony is not reliable.

564
00:34:19,922 --> 00:34:21,551
These two men work together...

565
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:22,621
That just proves...

566
00:34:24,422 --> 00:34:25,991
we spend a lot of time together.

567
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:29,132
Merchant Cho knows about my whereabouts more than anyone else.

568
00:34:29,531 --> 00:34:32,301
What is more, we did not have time to get our stories straight.

569
00:34:32,632 --> 00:34:35,172
So Magistrate, please make a wise judgement.

570
00:34:35,402 --> 00:34:36,502
But Magistrate...

571
00:34:38,002 --> 00:34:39,672
Merchant Cho, step forward.

572
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:49,011
I am Cho, the merchant of Jang's guild.

573
00:34:49,382 --> 00:34:50,382
Right.

574
00:34:51,152 --> 00:34:55,252
Is it true that you were with Master Jang that day?

575
00:34:55,692 --> 00:34:56,761
Yes, it is true.

576
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:03,232
Attorney Kang is right. The real culprit of this case...

577
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:06,002
is Master Jang.

578
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:09,402
- What was that? - How is this possible?

579
00:35:09,402 --> 00:35:11,701
What? What did you just say?

580
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:13,312
- Goodness. - What is going on?

581
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:16,511
- Oh, dear. - What a scumbag.

582
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:17,882
- He is the culprit. - Yes.

583
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:23,752
I only became aware of this fact just now...

584
00:35:23,752 --> 00:35:25,281
while inspecting the guild's ships.

585
00:35:25,382 --> 00:35:26,551
There were...

586
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:30,761
about 15 unknown children locked up on our ship.

587
00:35:34,661 --> 00:35:37,902
Come on, Merchant Cho. You even did a background check on me?

588
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,071
Why are you so full of doubts?

589
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:47,812
But that must be how ambitious you are, right?

590
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:50,681
Who on earth are you?

591
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:54,712
Do you know what the easiest way is...

592
00:35:54,712 --> 00:35:56,821
to bring a person down?

593
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:20,141
It is to pin the blame on them.

594
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:24,712
Would you like to sink together with Master Jang?

595
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:29,051
Or would you like to become the new owner of Jang's guild?

596
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:35,351
What? Who are they?

597
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:38,721
They are the children we rescued from Jang's guild's ship.

598
00:36:39,522 --> 00:36:40,531
I see.

599
00:36:42,862 --> 00:36:44,601
Gosh, poor children.

600
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:45,801
How dare you!

601
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:47,971
You must be framing me to obtain my position.

602
00:36:47,971 --> 00:36:51,402
You two planned it all and set me up, did you not?

603
00:36:52,672 --> 00:36:55,011
Magistrate. I am an attorney.

604
00:36:55,011 --> 00:36:56,741
I help those who feel wronged,

605
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:59,612
not frame someone for no reason.

606
00:36:59,612 --> 00:37:01,982
Please try to stand in my shoes...

607
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:05,051
as I am defying the superior I have served...

608
00:37:05,051 --> 00:37:07,321
and courageously telling the truth.

609
00:37:09,422 --> 00:37:13,161
Magistrate. Merchant Cho is currently telling you a lie.

610
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:14,962
I feel wronged, Magistrate.

611
00:37:15,092 --> 00:37:18,301
Then tell us clearly what and where you were that day.

612
00:37:18,562 --> 00:37:21,071
Either bring forth another witness or circumstantial evidence.

613
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:23,031
Only then can you prove your innocence.

614
00:37:23,471 --> 00:37:25,502
Yes. That is right.

615
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:28,911
Give me quite a detail of where you were,

616
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:31,312
who you were with, what, how, and why you did...

617
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:33,451
such a thing that day.

618
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,351
Of course.

619
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:37,221
That day, I...

620
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,621
Commissioner, what do you think?

621
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:46,761
It is a drug a smuggler from Ming brought in.

622
00:37:55,431 --> 00:37:56,502
That day, I...

623
00:37:58,842 --> 00:37:59,902
That day...

624
00:38:02,442 --> 00:38:03,681
That day, we...

625
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:09,551
My goodness. Look at the colour of the jade.

626
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:13,821
Oh, my.

627
00:38:17,391 --> 00:38:18,391
"That day?"

628
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:24,562
That...

629
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:29,071
That day...

630
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:32,871
You see, I went to...

631
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:36,612
You should not say it.

632
00:38:36,612 --> 00:38:39,641
Open your mouth, and it will be the end of you.

633
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:41,152
Well...

634
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:44,181
I cannot remember.

635
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,422
- What? - That is absurd.

636
00:38:47,422 --> 00:38:49,192
- What is he getting at? - He is ridiculous.

637
00:38:49,192 --> 00:38:50,962
- How can he not remember? - What?

638
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:53,692
But I did not do such a thing.

639
00:38:54,092 --> 00:38:55,732
I feel wronged, Magistrate.

640
00:38:58,101 --> 00:38:59,132
Fine.

641
00:38:59,761 --> 00:39:03,471
Now that I have studied your face, Master Jang,

642
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:06,272
you do look quite wronged.

643
00:39:06,502 --> 00:39:09,141
Then we will continue this lawsuit...

644
00:39:09,442 --> 00:39:11,241
once you remember.

645
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:15,011
Until then, you are a suspect.

646
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:16,922
Over here!

647
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,692
For now, put Jang behind bars.

648
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,661
What? Magistrate!

649
00:39:24,092 --> 00:39:27,792
I can suddenly recall it! I can!

650
00:39:29,431 --> 00:39:31,402
I will not overlook this!

651
00:39:31,832 --> 00:39:33,002
How dare you!

652
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:47,212
Goodness. To release me for a piece of painting?

653
00:39:47,212 --> 00:39:49,482
I can tell you are not sound people.

654
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:54,391
But how did you know they would not be able to disclose...

655
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:56,292
their whereabouts on that day?

656
00:39:57,692 --> 00:39:59,922
You see, we watch every move of...

657
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,201
That is none of your business. Hand over the painting.

658
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:09,801
Right, of course.

659
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:12,571
Here you go.

660
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:14,741
I left it at the first merchant house...

661
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:17,181
you will see when you arrive in Hanyang.

662
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:19,181
I believe it was called Sowongak.

663
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:20,451
(Receipt of Storage, Sowongak)

664
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,882
Darn it. It was right under our noses.

665
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:24,951
Let us go.

666
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:27,321
Thank you! Thank you so much!

667
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:39,661
(Royal Academy of Painting)

668
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:54,851
The executive minister made the request himself,

669
00:40:55,382 --> 00:40:57,451
so I promised him I would have the painting here...

670
00:40:57,582 --> 00:41:01,221
by the time the envoy from Ming had to return to his country!

671
00:41:01,551 --> 00:41:03,491
But you still have not found one simple painting?

672
00:41:04,321 --> 00:41:06,261
You are all useless.

673
00:41:06,261 --> 00:41:07,592
Our apologies, Commissioner.

674
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:09,391
We shall conduct one more search.

675
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:11,132
Commissioner!

676
00:41:12,862 --> 00:41:14,772
You have a visitor. He says this is an urgent matter.

677
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:20,272
Goodness.

678
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:22,371
What brings you here?

679
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:25,712
Master Jang is in a scandal, so I came on his behalf.

680
00:41:29,851 --> 00:41:33,221
This is the painting you have been looking for.

681
00:41:46,201 --> 00:41:47,301
Goodness.

682
00:41:47,531 --> 00:41:48,701
How did you find this?

683
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:50,701
There is a long story.

684
00:41:51,002 --> 00:41:52,842
But you should take care of this urgent matter first.

685
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:55,871
I should.

686
00:41:59,112 --> 00:42:00,482
You should come with me.

687
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:11,121
Commissioner.

688
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:13,062
What does this concern?

689
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:15,962
Commissioner, you must come with us.

690
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:18,661
Jang, a man who was arrested for abducting children,

691
00:42:18,761 --> 00:42:20,672
requested you as his witness.

692
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:21,801
What?

693
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:28,442
My lord.

694
00:42:30,011 --> 00:42:31,942
Why do you fail to keep your subordinate under control?

695
00:42:32,741 --> 00:42:36,351
I will go right now and make sure there is no further trouble.

696
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:40,351
You, bring the painting and follow me.

697
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,252
Yes, my lord.

698
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:54,531
Good grief.

699
00:42:56,232 --> 00:42:58,042
Let me go see him.

700
00:43:23,062 --> 00:43:24,531
Commissioner.

701
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:26,161
Please help me.

702
00:43:26,661 --> 00:43:29,601
What did you do to drag me all the way here?

703
00:43:29,701 --> 00:43:30,942
- Open up. - Yes.

704
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,141
Hurry.

705
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,442
You have committed this crime.

706
00:43:39,442 --> 00:43:41,152
Why are you asking me for help?

707
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,812
You cannot say that to me!

708
00:43:42,812 --> 00:43:44,051
I did not do this!

709
00:43:44,051 --> 00:43:45,851
What about the evidence found on your ship?

710
00:43:45,851 --> 00:43:48,792
Everything was set up by Merchant Cho.

711
00:43:48,851 --> 00:43:50,522
He forged the evidence...

712
00:43:50,522 --> 00:43:53,792
with an attorney named Kang Han Soo to put me in this danger!

713
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,962
You know where I was and what I did on that day...

714
00:43:56,962 --> 00:43:58,761
even better than I do!

715
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:01,902
Think about it.

716
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,542
Something like this has happened before.

717
00:44:05,201 --> 00:44:08,411
You said the easiest way of putting a good man in deep trouble...

718
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:09,511
is framing him,

719
00:44:09,911 --> 00:44:11,942
that you can find an adequate reason and forge the evidence...

720
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:14,112
to frame a man to end the situation.

721
00:44:14,382 --> 00:44:15,812
That is what you said!

722
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:24,821
Arrest all of his family...

723
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,991
and search every nook and cranny!

724
00:44:27,062 --> 00:44:28,192
- Yes! - Yes!

725
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:31,431
Are you asking for your death?

726
00:44:32,362 --> 00:44:34,701
How dare you bring up that incident?

727
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:37,101
I cannot go down alone!

728
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:40,042
You idiot!

729
00:44:40,101 --> 00:44:41,312
Take this!

730
00:44:43,772 --> 00:44:47,281
You remembered the means of putting a man in trouble,

731
00:44:47,882 --> 00:44:50,882
but you must have forgotten why that judicial officer...

732
00:44:50,882 --> 00:44:52,082
had to fall in trouble.

733
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,292
Commissioner.

734
00:44:54,351 --> 00:44:55,491
Please help me.

735
00:44:55,922 --> 00:44:57,221
Please help me.

736
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:01,391
If you did not bring up that incident,

737
00:45:02,362 --> 00:45:04,902
I would have saved your life.

738
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,062
Commissioner.

739
00:45:07,902 --> 00:45:09,531
Let me ask you.

740
00:45:10,071 --> 00:45:11,201
He died.

741
00:45:11,871 --> 00:45:13,002
So...

742
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:15,411
why should I spare you?

743
00:45:15,741 --> 00:45:18,382
Please spare me.

744
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,582
You dared...

745
00:45:19,582 --> 00:45:22,752
to covet something you must have never coveted...

746
00:45:25,582 --> 00:45:28,592
and challenged something you should have never challenged.

747
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,862
This is how the ending is for the likes of you.

748
00:45:30,922 --> 00:45:32,161
Back then...

749
00:45:32,261 --> 00:45:33,362
and even now.

750
00:45:33,891 --> 00:45:35,261
Do you understand?

751
00:45:48,942 --> 00:45:51,042
If any of you speak of this,

752
00:45:51,942 --> 00:45:54,212
you two will also not live to see another day.

753
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,911
- Yes, Commissioner. - Yes.

754
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:01,491
I will summon the commander.

755
00:46:01,991 --> 00:46:04,092
- You can keep watch. - Yes.

756
00:46:12,232 --> 00:46:15,371
I cannot believe I get to see this painting in real life!

757
00:46:16,132 --> 00:46:18,071
This is quite a masterpiece.

758
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:23,812
Executive Minister, I heard you can make anything happen in Joseon,

759
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:26,042
and I finally see that it is true.

760
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:31,781
I hope it becomes a delightful gift for the second prince.

761
00:46:34,451 --> 00:46:35,951
Do not worry.

762
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,391
The second prince was devastated ever since it was stolen from him,

763
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:40,761
which he cherished quite dearly.

764
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:43,792
If I give this painting back to him,

765
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:47,902
the second prince will be very delighted.

766
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,342
Cheers.

767
00:46:52,942 --> 00:46:54,971
Cheers.

768
00:47:13,592 --> 00:47:16,391
You should have just taken the blame.

769
00:47:16,562 --> 00:47:19,931
Why did you provoke his wrath in an attempt to save yourself?

770
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:21,732
Kang...

771
00:47:22,832 --> 00:47:24,071
Kang Han Soo?

772
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,071
Yes.

773
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:28,241
It is I, Kang Han Soo.

774
00:47:29,511 --> 00:47:32,342
I am the son of Officer Kang, whom you killed seven years ago.

775
00:47:32,511 --> 00:47:33,612
You are...

776
00:47:35,982 --> 00:47:37,382
Who are you again?

777
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,252
Do you finally understand...

778
00:47:43,491 --> 00:47:44,991
how my father must have felt?

779
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:47,362
You are...

780
00:47:47,862 --> 00:47:49,891
Officer Kang's son,

781
00:47:50,962 --> 00:47:52,531
that boy who jumped in without hesitating?

782
00:47:52,902 --> 00:47:53,962
Yes.

783
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:57,641
So tell me.

784
00:47:58,701 --> 00:48:01,342
Why did you kill my father? Who put you up for this?

785
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:04,011
Park Jae Soo?

786
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:05,641
Chu Young Woo?

787
00:48:13,382 --> 00:48:15,451
They were no different from us.

788
00:48:16,051 --> 00:48:17,362
We only do...

789
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:20,592
as we are told.

790
00:48:22,491 --> 00:48:24,761
It was an order we could not decline,

791
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:27,632
an order from the very top.

792
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:30,601
The very top?

793
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:33,641
The King...

794
00:48:36,411 --> 00:48:37,942
Why did His Majesty kill my father?

795
00:48:39,781 --> 00:48:41,051
That is why...

796
00:48:41,482 --> 00:48:44,221
he should have lived his life with whatever was given to him.

797
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,922
How dare he try to change something?

798
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,252
He was just a commoner...

799
00:48:50,252 --> 00:48:54,261
who took care of noblemen's affairs.

800
00:48:57,531 --> 00:48:58,801
Although...

801
00:48:59,661 --> 00:49:02,031
I was a man of low birth,

802
00:49:03,002 --> 00:49:05,371
I chose to sell off your father...

803
00:49:06,801 --> 00:49:08,371
in exchange for a good life,

804
00:49:08,371 --> 00:49:10,112
raking in money with my business...

805
00:49:10,312 --> 00:49:12,382
and travelling all over the country.

806
00:49:13,542 --> 00:49:15,252
But you commoners...

807
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:17,051
have a face to save,

808
00:49:17,882 --> 00:49:19,522
so you cannot start a business...

809
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:20,951
or begin farming.

810
00:49:21,351 --> 00:49:22,491
On top of that,

811
00:49:22,621 --> 00:49:24,391
you cannot even rise to noble status.

812
00:49:25,321 --> 00:49:28,991
He must have wanted to change the law in your favour.

813
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:31,661
Nonsense!

814
00:49:33,801 --> 00:49:37,101
The world is not that easy.

815
00:49:38,801 --> 00:49:40,502
If you hope for change,

816
00:49:40,502 --> 00:49:42,511
you will be trampled down.

817
00:49:43,011 --> 00:49:44,241
Do you understand,

818
00:49:44,842 --> 00:49:46,181
little kid?

819
00:49:50,652 --> 00:49:53,181
You cannot afford to laugh like that right now.

820
00:49:55,051 --> 00:49:57,621
I cannot help it.

821
00:49:57,621 --> 00:49:59,062
Jang!

822
00:49:59,362 --> 00:50:01,161
Your foolish father...

823
00:50:01,692 --> 00:50:03,632
brought his death upon himself,

824
00:50:03,832 --> 00:50:04,931
but...

825
00:50:05,431 --> 00:50:07,571
I understand why I must die.

826
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,842
I have dodged the worst.

827
00:51:00,522 --> 00:51:02,321
Will you still remain silent?

828
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:12,701
Father!

829
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:14,002
Wait.

830
00:51:15,301 --> 00:51:16,301
Honey.

831
00:51:25,542 --> 00:51:28,181
That is certainly the bundle of coins...

832
00:51:29,051 --> 00:51:31,922
to ask him to cover up the lawsuit.

833
00:51:33,422 --> 00:51:36,721
Lord Park, how could you?

834
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:41,692
It matches the information that I got...

835
00:51:41,862 --> 00:51:42,962
from monitoring Jang.

836
00:51:42,962 --> 00:51:44,301
Look here, Jang.

837
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:47,431
No, that is not true.

838
00:51:48,031 --> 00:51:49,871
My only sin was to reject the offer.

839
00:51:50,871 --> 00:51:52,801
We have a clear witness and evidence.

840
00:51:52,801 --> 00:51:54,511
Yet, you still try to get out of it.

841
00:51:54,871 --> 00:51:57,542
Magistrate, it is my fault.

842
00:51:57,641 --> 00:51:59,382
I have accepted the bundle,

843
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,851
so please spare my husband's life.

844
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:04,522
No, Magistrate!

845
00:52:06,551 --> 00:52:09,152
My family has done nothing wrong.

846
00:52:10,022 --> 00:52:12,962
Are you admitting...

847
00:52:13,692 --> 00:52:14,792
to your fault?

848
00:52:32,612 --> 00:52:34,781
I know. I have seen her.

849
00:52:36,451 --> 00:52:39,022
Yes, I knew the son of a judicial officer would be honest.

850
00:52:39,181 --> 00:52:40,821
I have clearly seen the face of the person...

851
00:52:40,821 --> 00:52:42,451
who left the bundle at our house.

852
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:45,462
She left the bundle at our house as she pleased.

853
00:52:45,592 --> 00:52:47,121
We did not accept it.

854
00:52:47,991 --> 00:52:49,732
I know what she looks like, so I will find her.

855
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:53,031
I only ask for a couple of hours.

856
00:53:26,132 --> 00:53:27,161
Father.

857
00:53:27,161 --> 00:53:29,002
- Honey. - Father.

858
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:32,571
Father!

859
00:53:38,482 --> 00:53:39,482
Father.

860
00:53:40,612 --> 00:53:41,681
Father.

861
00:53:53,491 --> 00:53:55,832
Father!

862
00:53:57,092 --> 00:53:58,462
Father!

863
00:53:59,962 --> 00:54:01,031
Honey.

864
00:54:05,471 --> 00:54:06,741
Honey!

865
00:54:07,842 --> 00:54:10,212
How did this happen to us?

866
00:54:19,451 --> 00:54:21,851
(In Mourning)

867
00:54:34,701 --> 00:54:35,732
Mother!

868
00:54:37,502 --> 00:54:38,542
Mother!

869
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:41,212
Mother.

870
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:44,272
No, Mother!

871
00:54:47,882 --> 00:54:50,112
Mother, do not leave me.

872
00:54:50,112 --> 00:54:51,652
Mother! No!

873
00:54:51,982 --> 00:54:53,522
Stay, Mother.

874
00:54:55,351 --> 00:54:57,621
Mother.

875
00:54:59,022 --> 00:55:01,332
- No! - I am here.

876
00:55:01,562 --> 00:55:03,962
It is okay.

877
00:55:03,962 --> 00:55:06,132
It was a dream.

878
00:55:07,132 --> 00:55:08,971
It was only a nightmare.

879
00:55:16,612 --> 00:55:17,612
Han Soo.

880
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:42,132
Have you come to your senses?

881
00:55:46,201 --> 00:55:47,342
What happened?

882
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:51,342
- The drinking bet was a tie. - Not that.

883
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:54,511
- The bill was 20 nyang. - Not that.

884
00:55:54,882 --> 00:55:56,152
For exactly four hours...

885
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,922
No, not that!

886
00:55:57,922 --> 00:55:59,922
I meant Kang Han Soo. What happened to him?

887
00:56:00,681 --> 00:56:03,051
- Oh, you meant him. - Yes.

888
00:56:10,891 --> 00:56:13,002
Oh, gosh.

889
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:18,672
You have come a long way.

890
00:56:19,172 --> 00:56:22,772
We hope you return safely to your home.

891
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:25,641
I appreciate your welcome, Executive Minister.

892
00:56:26,212 --> 00:56:29,482
I have enjoyed my stay for a few days here.

893
00:56:30,612 --> 00:56:33,721
See you next time.

894
00:56:50,832 --> 00:56:56,011
(Human trafficker)

895
00:57:09,891 --> 00:57:10,922
Who are you?

896
00:57:10,922 --> 00:57:14,931
No, who are you? You are on my ship.

897
00:57:16,592 --> 00:57:18,632
(Human trafficker)

898
00:57:19,101 --> 00:57:23,132
You are that thief that stole our prince's painting!

899
00:57:29,342 --> 00:57:31,312
How am I back in Joseon?

900
00:57:32,781 --> 00:57:34,851
I clearly remember leaving Joseon!

901
00:57:35,882 --> 00:57:37,051
Why am I back here?

902
00:57:37,712 --> 00:57:38,851
Why am I in Joseon?

903
00:57:39,681 --> 00:57:41,051
Release me!

904
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,592
Do you know who I am?

905
00:57:44,792 --> 00:57:46,761
You do not!

906
00:57:47,621 --> 00:57:50,632
Release me this instant!

907
00:57:56,301 --> 00:57:57,672
I knew it.

908
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:59,801
You had a plan all along.

909
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:01,842
You startled me.

910
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:04,411
Why did you release him in the first place?

911
00:58:05,442 --> 00:58:06,982
What else could I have done?

912
00:58:07,382 --> 00:58:10,051
The children were locked up somewhere without a glass of water.

913
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:14,821
My baby!

914
00:58:14,951 --> 00:58:16,121
Mom!

915
00:58:19,491 --> 00:58:21,462
I had to find them first.

916
00:58:23,362 --> 00:58:26,462
People's lives come before that criminal's punishment.

917
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:30,272
If you had let the magistrate handle it,

918
00:58:30,272 --> 00:58:31,471
he would have interrogated him to...

919
00:58:31,471 --> 00:58:32,701
Would he have told them?

920
00:58:33,201 --> 00:58:35,241
When telling where the children were would mean...

921
00:58:35,241 --> 00:58:37,241
that he was confessing to his crimes?

922
00:58:39,812 --> 00:58:41,681
He would not have said a word...

923
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:43,511
until the children died there.

924
00:58:47,321 --> 00:58:48,652
Okay, then.

925
00:58:49,022 --> 00:58:51,152
What about the first deal that you made with Master Jang?

926
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:53,161
Was that off the top of your head to escape?

927
00:58:54,661 --> 00:58:56,261
What did you do to imprison Master Jang?

928
00:59:18,152 --> 00:59:19,181
You...

929
00:59:20,022 --> 00:59:21,652
must be really into me.

930
00:59:22,922 --> 00:59:23,951
Sorry?

931
00:59:23,951 --> 00:59:26,062
So you hope that I am a good guy.

932
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,661
As you do not want to be disappointed in me.

933
00:59:30,761 --> 00:59:31,832
Do not worry.

934
00:59:32,632 --> 00:59:33,962
I do not think you are so bad either.

935
00:59:34,661 --> 00:59:36,772
I watched you volunteer to be taken hostage for me.

936
00:59:36,772 --> 00:59:38,042
How could I not fall in love?

937
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:39,772
I do have a heart, after all.

938
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:44,071
However,

939
00:59:44,942 --> 00:59:47,842
do not interrupt me with my work from now on.

940
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:49,951
I will not look past it next time.

941
00:59:54,121 --> 00:59:56,551
I cannot promise you either.

942
00:59:57,851 --> 01:00:00,891
Because you have not answered my questions.

943
01:00:01,991 --> 01:00:03,062
Well, then.

944
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:23,681
(Cho's Guild)

945
01:00:23,681 --> 01:00:26,051
Be careful with that.

946
01:00:31,592 --> 01:00:33,962
The commissioner has been dismissed.

947
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,462
Well, someone has to be responsible for all this.

948
01:00:39,601 --> 01:00:40,862
Be honest with me.

949
01:00:40,862 --> 01:00:42,371
Between Commissioner Park and Master Jang,

950
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:44,332
who did you hold a grudge against?

951
01:00:47,672 --> 01:00:50,471
It is me who earned their grudge.

952
01:00:51,442 --> 01:00:53,542
The moment I was kidnapped by Master Jang, I thought,

953
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:55,652
"Oh, gosh. Master Jang has great influence over Hanyang,"

954
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,482
"but now that I have lost his favour,"

955
01:00:57,482 --> 01:01:00,482
"I might be kicked out of Hanyang when it took me a lot to come here."

956
01:01:00,482 --> 01:01:01,752
"What should I do?"

957
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:02,851
"That is right."

958
01:01:03,351 --> 01:01:04,991
"If I cannot catch his fancy,"

959
01:01:04,991 --> 01:01:07,491
"I might just change the owner of Jang's guild."

960
01:01:07,592 --> 01:01:09,332
And so I did as I decided.

961
01:01:14,732 --> 01:01:17,132
That decision sounds way too reckless and serious...

962
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:18,741
for a mere attorney to make.

963
01:01:18,772 --> 01:01:20,371
I have...

964
01:01:20,371 --> 01:01:21,942
a little too big of a dream.

965
01:01:21,942 --> 01:01:23,212
I am going to have...

966
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,911
my name, Kang Han Soo,

967
01:01:24,911 --> 01:01:26,411
known as the best attorney in Joseon...

968
01:01:26,411 --> 01:01:29,482
all around the country very far and properly.

969
01:01:30,712 --> 01:01:31,851
Then,

970
01:01:32,051 --> 01:01:34,022
will you have me gone too...

971
01:01:34,022 --> 01:01:35,451
if I attempt to get in your way?

972
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:39,562
You are...

973
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:41,732
part of my big dream.

974
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:43,931
The greatest guild in Joseon...

975
01:01:43,931 --> 01:01:46,431
needs the top attorney in Joseon.

976
01:01:49,601 --> 01:01:50,701
Is that right?

977
01:01:54,701 --> 01:01:55,842
Then,

978
01:01:56,241 --> 01:02:00,181
this will be the down payment of our future together.

979
01:02:00,942 --> 01:02:02,382
It is more than I promised.

980
01:02:10,991 --> 01:02:13,221
You certainly are different from Master Jang.

981
01:02:13,292 --> 01:02:15,761
I certainly am a good judge of character.

982
01:02:24,672 --> 01:02:26,672
Kang Han Soo...

983
01:02:27,971 --> 01:02:29,942
That punk is something.

984
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:33,011
Playing with people's emotions is not enough...

985
01:02:33,011 --> 01:02:35,882
that he can even have control over people's lives.

986
01:02:36,982 --> 01:02:38,252
He is like an executioner.

987
01:02:38,652 --> 01:02:40,851
Should I dig into his background and past...

988
01:02:41,221 --> 01:02:42,422
more deeply?

989
01:02:43,621 --> 01:02:46,062
Do it discreetly, but make sure it is thoroughly done.

990
01:02:46,422 --> 01:02:48,862
I need to get him on my side, and if I cannot,

991
01:02:49,661 --> 01:02:51,761
I need to destroy him before it it is late.

992
01:03:04,542 --> 01:03:08,112
I should have bought a bigger one. Too bad.

993
01:03:16,321 --> 01:03:17,922
I told you.

994
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:23,931
It was because of money.

995
01:03:26,101 --> 01:03:28,371
He acted like he was helping Master Jang,

996
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:30,502
but he ended up doing Merchant Cho good.

997
01:03:31,942 --> 01:03:33,971
Look at the signboard.

998
01:03:33,971 --> 01:03:35,241
It changed...

999
01:03:35,241 --> 01:03:36,942
to "Cho's Guild..."

1000
01:03:36,942 --> 01:03:38,382
from Jang's Guild.

1001
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:41,911
The owner got changed...

1002
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:44,612
in the capital's biggest and most influential guild?

1003
01:03:48,022 --> 01:03:51,152
(Cho's Guild)

1004
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,402
(Peddler Lady)

1005
01:04:58,562 --> 01:05:00,362
You are next.

1006
01:05:47,342 --> 01:05:49,542
Are you back from the palace, Father?

1007
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:50,612
Yes.

1008
01:05:50,612 --> 01:05:53,042
I heard you went through a lot during your secret trip.

1009
01:05:53,612 --> 01:05:55,411
Did you relieve your fatigue?

1010
01:05:56,082 --> 01:05:58,621
There is no need because I am not exhausted.

1011
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:00,721
That is good.

1012
01:06:00,882 --> 01:06:02,821
You will get busier from now on.

1013
01:06:12,132 --> 01:06:13,531
He is still so busy.

1014
01:06:14,062 --> 01:06:15,101
That is right.

1015
01:06:15,332 --> 01:06:17,502
He works for the country day and night.

1016
01:06:18,571 --> 01:06:19,942
He is such a loyal official.

1017
01:06:21,942 --> 01:06:23,112
Loyal...

1018
01:06:26,212 --> 01:06:29,011
Commissioner Park cut Master Jang off?

1019
01:06:29,451 --> 01:06:30,551
Yes.

1020
01:06:30,652 --> 01:06:33,422
He was done with his use, and he even ran his mouth,

1021
01:06:33,582 --> 01:06:35,252
so he had to be dead.

1022
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:38,391
Is Commissioner Park trustworthy enough?

1023
01:06:38,922 --> 01:06:39,991
Pardon?

1024
01:06:40,221 --> 01:06:42,362
I am asking if it is okay for us...

1025
01:06:42,362 --> 01:06:44,732
to let him take charge of Hungu's finance.

1026
01:06:44,732 --> 01:06:45,761
(Hungu: A group of high officials dominating the political power)

1027
01:06:45,862 --> 01:06:47,031
Well...

1028
01:06:47,031 --> 01:06:49,371
We have no one to replace him at the moment.

1029
01:06:54,502 --> 01:06:56,812
It is no big deal to have a few executed...

1030
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,442
during a governmental lawsuit.

1031
01:06:58,911 --> 01:07:00,042
However,

1032
01:07:00,312 --> 01:07:03,951
one of our people lost a mere personal lawsuit.

1033
01:07:04,911 --> 01:07:06,582
That is a big deal.

1034
01:07:07,121 --> 01:07:08,891
The thing is,

1035
01:07:09,321 --> 01:07:13,221
the other side's attorney was a very skilled one.

1036
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:16,592
Talking about the statute published by the former kings and whatnot,

1037
01:07:16,592 --> 01:07:19,601
he cornered the judge quite impressively.

1038
01:07:20,701 --> 01:07:21,871
The statute?

1039
01:07:24,672 --> 01:07:26,371
The statute...

1040
01:07:31,772 --> 01:07:33,141
Come to think of it,

1041
01:07:33,741 --> 01:07:37,982
I have not heard from Princess Yeon Joo for a while.

1042
01:07:39,652 --> 01:07:40,851
I will look into her.

1043
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:47,721
(Sowongak)

1044
01:07:47,721 --> 01:07:49,092
Hello.

1045
01:07:57,801 --> 01:08:00,371
She must have come to her senses after that much trouble.

1046
01:08:41,981 --> 01:08:43,552
Attorney Kang!

1047
01:08:47,821 --> 01:08:48,951
How do I look?

1048
01:08:49,252 --> 01:08:52,092
Do you not feel my determination from the way I am dressed?

1049
01:08:52,592 --> 01:08:54,991
- What determination? - You see,

1050
01:08:54,991 --> 01:08:57,262
I am going to work under you from today.

1051
01:08:57,332 --> 01:08:58,361
What?

1052
01:08:58,491 --> 01:09:01,731
Hire me as an assistant of your law office.

1053
01:09:01,901 --> 01:09:03,901
I will be...

1054
01:09:03,901 --> 01:09:05,571
your personal secretary.

1055
01:09:17,151 --> 01:09:18,281
Your Majesty.

1056
01:09:18,281 --> 01:09:19,422
(Four hours ago)

1057
01:09:19,981 --> 01:09:23,491
I would like to tame Kang Han Soo to be one of my people.

1058
01:09:24,222 --> 01:09:25,491
Speaking of which, Your Majesty...

1059
01:09:26,861 --> 01:09:28,832
Go on.

1060
01:09:29,392 --> 01:09:30,592
Give me...

1061
01:09:33,762 --> 01:09:36,172
some money.

1062
01:09:52,781 --> 01:09:56,292
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

1063
01:09:57,222 --> 01:09:58,962
(Special thanks to Lee Jun Hyeok and Yang Hyun Min...)

1064
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:00,661
(for their guest appearances)

1065
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:07,061
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

1066
01:10:07,231 --> 01:10:09,472
Your Highness, he got the best of you.

1067
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:11,201
You cannot take back your words.

1068
01:10:11,201 --> 01:10:13,371
What do you mean you will not hire me as an assistant?

1069
01:10:13,571 --> 01:10:15,002
Please? But my lord...

1070
01:10:15,071 --> 01:10:16,642
Please, my lord.

1071
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:18,741
You're quite persistent. I acknowledge that.

1072
01:10:19,611 --> 01:10:20,911
Yoo Ji Sun is assigned...

1073
01:10:21,411 --> 01:10:24,552
as a level-two magistrate of Hanseongbu.

1074
01:10:24,752 --> 01:10:27,821
Thank you for your generosity, Your Majesty.

1075
01:10:31,321 --> 01:10:32,491
Park Jae Soo...

1076
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:34,821
He has jumped...

1077
01:10:34,821 --> 01:10:36,392
on the most expensive wagon in Joseon.

1078
01:10:37,462 --> 01:10:38,561
Ji Sun.

1079
01:10:39,132 --> 01:10:40,231
Enjoy the moment.

1080
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,871
That is what you seize power for.
