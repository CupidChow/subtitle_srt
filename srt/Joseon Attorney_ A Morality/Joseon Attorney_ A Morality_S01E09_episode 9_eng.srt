1
00:00:37,524 --> 00:00:39,824
Did you hear that?

2
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:46,834
Why? Did you have another nightmare?

3
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:50,264
No. Do you not hear that?

4
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,604
Over there!

5
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:10,194
I was wondering who was talking so much.

6
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:11,204
Sir.

7
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,884
Yes?

8
00:01:12,884 --> 00:01:16,484
His Excellency Chu passed away.

9
00:01:17,374 --> 00:01:19,544
He was murdered.

10
00:01:23,274 --> 00:01:27,234
His Majesty enters!

11
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:36,700

12
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:50,054
Tell me what happened, exactly.

13
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:52,324
Bribed personnel appointments?

14
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:58,754
Bribed personnel appointments are against national law.

15
00:01:58,754 --> 00:02:04,274
 As soon as the Ministers' Committee has an opening, the minister's home is full of guests?

16
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:10,644
- Whoa, wh-what is this? 
 - What is this?

17
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:12,204
Hey!

18
00:02:12,204 --> 00:02:16,324
 They said more than twenty people were arrested today alone.

19
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:18,844
Appointing officials this way is why

20
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:24,224
the unprecedented event of firing both associate ministers for corruption occurred.

21
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:27,514
Therefore, I...

22
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:31,184
request the abolition of the Ministers' Committee.

23
00:02:36,694 --> 00:02:39,474
Your Majesty, the Ministers' Committee isâ€”

24
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:42,474
You should go ahead, Your Majesty.

25
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:55,314
Since the Grand Queen Dowager also said she would end her regency

26
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:58,134
due to her failing health,

27
00:02:58,134 --> 00:03:04,364
this humble one also thinks it is proper to step down from my position as a minister.

28
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:11,864
Your Majesty, please allow this humble one to resign.

29
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,184
You cannot allow it, Your Majesty!

30
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:27,794
Please withdraw your order!

31
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:31,124
 Please withdraw!

32
00:03:35,294 --> 00:03:41,044
This humble one, as Left State Minister and a member of the Ministers' Committee,

33
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:46,654
feels responsible for the demotion of Associate Left Minister and the dismissal of Associate Right Minister.

34
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:50,564
However, I think Minister Yoo's resignation and abolition of Ministers' Committee

35
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:55,214
should not be so recklessly discussed.

36
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:59,534
The Prohibition of Bribery Act is the law that forbade private relationships between officials.

37
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:03,564
Therefore, it was hard to identify other officials' corruption, and

38
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:09,154
the recent case of Associate Right Minister's son was handled behind Minister Yu's back.

39
00:04:09,154 --> 00:04:10,954
Yes, Your Majesty!

40
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:16,694
Would it not be a sign that there was nothing between Minister Yu and

41
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:21,834
Associate Right Minister, if Minister Yu did not intervene even when things were this grave?

42
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:28,214
It would be too harsh to ask Minister Yu and the Ministers' Committee to take responsibility.

43
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:32,144
There is no cause for Minister Yu to resign!

44
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:35,064
Please reconsider your decision!

45
00:04:35,064 --> 00:04:38,864
 Please reconsider your decision!

46
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:45,814
 They used to flock together like twins,

47
00:04:45,814 --> 00:04:49,094
 but they do not have a private relationship now?

48
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:10,004
His Majesty was hasty this time.

49
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:13,074
He basically declared war with no gain.

50
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:17,814
How about you support His Majesty, Left State Minister?

51
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:23,834
Even my father respects you, at least, does he not?

52
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:31,654
Well, that is because I have never gone against Minister Yu's will so far.

53
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:57,774
I even withdrew from the regency, faking an illness.

54
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,984
His Majesty must be quite disheartened.

55
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:06,274
It is not a mountain if you can overcome it right away.

56
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:10,974
It is only a hill or a dune.

57
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,674
He is quite the clever one.

58
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:32,044
What I struggled to do, he managed to do in a few months.

59
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:36,024
Are you talking about the lawyer whom the Princess recommended?

60
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:38,804
His name is Kang Han Su.

61
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:42,514
Make sure to remember. He is one of my people now.

62
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:44,584
Yes, Your Majesty.

63
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:47,524
By the way...

64
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:50,664
Worried I was disheartened by what happened today?

65
00:06:51,364 --> 00:06:54,624
I did not expect to defeat Minister Yu in one fell swoop.

66
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:58,384
I was only trying to start the flow.

67
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:06,954
So far, no one has even dared to think about abolishing the Ministers' Committee,

68
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:09,644
but it has been discussed officially.

69
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:18,434
By now,

70
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:26,074
everyone must have realized Minister Yu's power is not permanent.

71
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:31,304
Therefore, what we need now is a cause to drive Minister Yu out.

72
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:37,824
If Minister Yu gives me that cause himself, that will be even better.

73
00:08:04,904 --> 00:08:06,634
My Lady.

74
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:09,914
The officials from the Office of the Inspector General are here.

75
00:08:27,994 --> 00:08:30,134
A-Are you okay?

76
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,794
I am sorry, Sir.

77
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:38,614
I meant to quietly leave the drink table.

78
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:39,954
It is okay.

79
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:41,654
Take my hand.

80
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:48,194
I heard the owner of this place was like a heavenly maiden. It was true.

81
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,124
My, goodness! Should you be saying that to an injured person?

82
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:53,134
Please sit here.

83
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:08,484
 So would you like to meet him or do what you ought to do as first promised?

84
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:12,574
 Then and now, my answer is still the same.

85
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:14,254
 How dare you, you filthy blood!

86
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,764
 Whose household are you trying to ruin?

87
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,944
 Mother...

88
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:20,874
 Hiding for years how your family was ruined because

89
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:22,694
 your parents died after committing a crime.

90
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:25,124
 You vicious bitch.

91
00:09:25,124 --> 00:09:27,974
 Get lost! Right now!

92
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:30,104
 What are you doing?

93
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:18,234
 What are you doing to me?

94
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:20,404
 Let go of me!

95
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:55,894
 Put a bit in her mouth so she cannot bite her own tongue and die.

96
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:06,124
 I do not need one.

97
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:08,844
 Because I will not die.

98
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:13,474
 A young wench has eyes filed with venom, huh?

99
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:17,814
 It is full of sorrow, not venom.

100
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:20,604
 Venom can be just removed,

101
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:26,534
 but how shall I get rid of this deep sorrow engraved on my bones?

102
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:28,774
 What happened to you?

103
00:11:36,464 --> 00:11:39,914
 It is shameless for me to ask, but please take me to Hanyang.

104
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:46,594
 I must meet the most powerful person in Hanyang and appeal to him about my sorrow.

105
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:48,884
 He is His Excellency the Prime Minister.

106
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:51,754
 He is the highest man in Joseon.

107
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,094
 Your Excellency,

108
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:13,654
 please help me so I can avenge my parents' death.

109
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:18,114
 Please help me.

110
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:21,114
 Please help...

111
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:41,234
 Can you really do anything for your revenge?

112
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:54,064
 You will even have to endure shameful acts as a woman.

113
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:03,784
 It is only my body that is getting dirtied,

114
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:06,154
 not me.

115
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:13,460
 My heart has become...

116
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,080
 as hard as a rock.

117
00:13:19,774 --> 00:13:26,764
 I will engrave your grace in this rock as well, Your Excellency.

118
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:35,704
 Episode 9: Twisted Fate

119
00:13:35,704 --> 00:13:38,804
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

120
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:41,284
 Restricted Area

121
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:49,044
The corpse will start to rot so install the parasols.

122
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:51,234
Yes, Sir.

123
00:13:58,694 --> 00:14:00,514
He seemed to have been killed last night.

124
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:03,144
The Ministry of Justice is investigating.

125
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:10,004
Hyeongnim...

126
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:11,594
Hey, g-go take a look.

127
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:13,474
O-Okay.

128
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:22,524
Where were you last night?

129
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:28,254
Could it be you are suspecting me right now?

130
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:33,014
You clashed with His Excellency Chu the most recently.

131
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:38,284
If it is regarding Young Master Chu, I should be the one lying down there.

132
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:43,004
You should look at those who are closer to him and higher than me.

133
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:45,994
Who are you talking about right now?

134
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:50,124
I mean, I am not trying to specify a specific person.

135
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:54,314
If he can manage to murder His Excellency Chu, he must be quite a great person.

136
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:59,784
Also, people like him must be closer to you than me.

137
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:08,524
The corpse had stab wounds.

138
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:10,234
- Stab wounds? 
 - Yes.

139
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:13,254
However, the murder weapon disappeared.

140
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:16,114
I think the culprit took it.

141
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:19,114
Wait, why bother with such inconvenience

142
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:21,664
unless the murder weapon has his name on it?

143
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:23,894
That is my question.

144
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:31,984
Too reckless. That was way too reckless.

145
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:34,294
About what? Who was?

146
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:36,204
I was.

147
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:38,274
Reckless about what?

148
00:15:42,314 --> 00:15:45,004
Tell me if you need something.

149
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:57,524
Wait, why do you need a dagger now?

150
00:16:00,604 --> 00:16:03,074
Are you going to investigate His Excellency Chu's case personally?

151
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:05,324
Nope.

152
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:08,174
- I am going to prepare. 
 - Huh?

153
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:10,644
Pay for this.

154
00:16:16,484 --> 00:16:17,684
We meet again.

155
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:21,014
Yes. Did you come to look into a dagger used to stab His Excellency Chu?

156
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,064
I wanted to ask you this from the beginning.

157
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:24,514
Please ask away.

158
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:26,674
Your ship seemed to have been completely fixed.

159
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:30,304
How long do you plan to freeload at Wishes Inn?

160
00:16:39,914 --> 00:16:43,414
Accidents and incidents seem to follow you around.

161
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:49,524
I am worried the innocent people at Wishes Inn will be harmed.

162
00:16:50,914 --> 00:16:53,414
Are you talking about So Won?

163
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:58,984
What exactly is your relationship with So Won, Mayor?

164
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,544
Did So Won never tell you?

165
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:03,774
I guess you are not that close to her.

166
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:08,064
She must have thought you two were close enough to tell me.

167
00:17:19,534 --> 00:17:23,334
What does he care? Huh? Darn it!

168
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:27,644
Gosh, why me!

169
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:55,924
 Wishes Inn

170
00:18:02,154 --> 00:18:05,534
 Accidents and incidents seem to follow you around.

171
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,844
 I am worried.

172
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:11,454
So Won...

173
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:33,494
Mother?

174
00:18:33,494 --> 00:18:35,464
So Won!

175
00:18:53,094 --> 00:18:54,854
Sir?

176
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,704
I am so glad.

177
00:19:04,424 --> 00:19:06,284
I thought...

178
00:19:21,144 --> 00:19:23,424
Oh, yes. What, huh? What is going on?

179
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:25,204
Where did everyone go? Why is the place empty?

180
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:28,764
Because the soldiers are on patrol, and the entire city seems ominous.

181
00:19:28,764 --> 00:19:30,304
We are taking the day off.

182
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:32,914
Everyone probably went back home.

183
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:35,184
To their home?

184
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:38,074
Since everyone has a home and a family.

185
00:19:38,074 --> 00:19:39,324
What about you?

186
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:41,534
I...

187
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:43,864
- I... 
 - Yes.

188
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:46,674
have you, Sir.

189
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:56,284
Right. What about Dong Chi?

190
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,374
Well...

191
00:19:59,374 --> 00:20:02,884
he went to take a look at the ship.

192
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:05,314
We need to prepare to go back.

193
00:20:05,314 --> 00:20:09,384
Why? Is the inn uncomfortable for you?

194
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:13,944
If I stay here, I keep having dreams

195
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:16,204
when it still is not over...

196
00:20:16,204 --> 00:20:18,124
What is?

197
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:24,654
The revenge?

198
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,514
Here.

199
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:35,674
Payment for what I owe you.

200
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:44,644
It is a dagger, huh?

201
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:48,784
You shall quit being an attorney's assistant.

202
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:50,314
I am firing you.

203
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:52,144
If you are worried about meâ€”

204
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:54,674
It is because you are in the way.

205
00:20:57,194 --> 00:20:58,754
Why are you giving me this dagger then?

206
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:01,724
I am telling you to protect yourself.

207
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:06,234
Because I cannot protect you.

208
00:21:52,484 --> 00:21:55,284
What the heck? You were blocking the door, Hyeongnim?

209
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:58,164
Yes, I thought you were So Won.

210
00:21:58,164 --> 00:21:59,664
What is wrong with that?

211
00:21:59,664 --> 00:22:01,334
Have you not seen So Won?

212
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:04,094
Oh? I have not.

213
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:06,134
Gosh, that is weird.

214
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:10,094
She is not someone who would willingly accept being fired.

215
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:11,514
Could it be...

216
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:13,844
Did you really fire her?

217
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:17,464
Yes.

218
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:35,734
I-Is that why she did not cling to you?

219
00:22:38,634 --> 00:22:41,144
Look, you are just going to go?

220
00:22:41,144 --> 00:22:43,204
A-Are you not going to talk to So Won?

221
00:22:43,204 --> 00:22:45,734
It is fine. She will come to me if she feels it is unfair.

222
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:48,034
We have a lot to do, so forget her. Let us go.

223
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,694
Hyeongnim, are you really going to leave?

224
00:22:50,694 --> 00:22:55,094
Leave the paradise where we get fed and housed?

225
00:22:55,094 --> 00:22:56,734
Yes.

226
00:22:56,734 --> 00:23:01,604
In that case, could I just stay here instead?

227
00:23:01,604 --> 00:23:04,804
Why not? You can stay. Go ahead.

228
00:23:04,804 --> 00:23:07,584
If you want to stay as a corpse.

229
00:23:22,524 --> 00:23:28,054
Do you realize now the man you are going up against?

230
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:30,244
Why are you so sensitive?

231
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:33,774
And how could you be so okay about it?

232
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:38,834
The man who deserved to die ended up dead.

233
00:23:42,474 --> 00:23:45,594
You intend to see the end of this.

234
00:23:45,594 --> 00:23:48,824
Then you should also make up your mind, Princess.

235
00:23:54,254 --> 00:23:56,324
It is what I promised Kang Han Su.

236
00:23:56,324 --> 00:24:00,884
I told him I would help him deliver a letter to you after this case is over.

237
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:03,244
Please give him a reply.

238
00:24:10,604 --> 00:24:14,294
â™«  Turning back time  â™«

239
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:19,624
â™«  As I see you getting further away  â™«

240
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:24,714
â™«  I will run and call out your painful name  â™«

241
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:31,994
â™«  Wiping away the tears that flow white  â™«

242
00:24:31,994 --> 00:24:35,424
â™«  Traversing memories  â™«

243
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:40,704
â™«  Affectionately calling your name &nbsp;â™«

244
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:45,984
â™«  Saying I love you for no reason &nbsp;â™«

245
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,224
â™«  I want to go back to that time â™«

246
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:56,354
â™« And meet you just once more â™«

247
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:07,024
Your wound has healed a lot.

248
00:25:07,024 --> 00:25:10,064
It is all thanks to you, Hostess Hong.

249
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:13,544
You cannot live as a courtesan for life.

250
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:15,824
Unless you intend to become an old man's concubine,

251
00:25:15,824 --> 00:25:19,894
should you not find a way to make a living on your own?

252
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:24,214
I heard Eonni Myeong Wol's shop is doing really well.

253
00:25:24,214 --> 00:25:27,844
If you would like, I will let you work at the inn.

254
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:32,434
You can also learn how to cook or run the business.

255
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:36,534
- At the palace, I was also... 
 - "The palace"?

256
00:25:37,564 --> 00:25:41,734
I-I mean, at a place near the palace.

257
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:46,634
Well, I had run a small saloon.

258
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:51,324
Whoa. We never even got to be near the palace.

259
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:54,814
By the way, Sirs Han Su and Dong Chi are returning to their ship.

260
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:59,574
So we are not sure if we are allowed to stay here.

261
00:26:01,754 --> 00:26:04,394
Are you going back to the ship?

262
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:10,844
You can call it a type of self-distancing.

263
00:26:15,034 --> 00:26:18,534
Why? Are you sad?

264
00:26:19,304 --> 00:26:22,164
In that case, you can try holding me back.

265
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:26,674
If you get lucky, I might let you hold me back.

266
00:26:27,944 --> 00:26:30,124
It is for the better.

267
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:32,694
Those feelings should have been severed sooner.

268
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:36,184
W-Wait, why sever them?

269
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:39,474
The world will not allow such a relationship.

270
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:40,634
Also, with a great difference.

271
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:44,554
Why does age matter? It is not like the heart ages.

272
00:26:44,554 --> 00:26:47,124
I will allow it! I will!

273
00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:49,544
What are you talking about right now?

274
00:26:49,544 --> 00:26:54,244
What else could it be? It is that you, Hostess Hong, are my...

275
00:26:55,724 --> 00:26:57,684
Anyhow,

276
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:02,954
even if my body follows Hyeongnim, my heart will be left here.

277
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,024
So remember that.

278
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:10,664
Wait, what the heck is he saying?

279
00:27:10,664 --> 00:27:12,764
Why would he leave his heart...

280
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,724
Go tend to your businesses.

281
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:24,644
- Yes. 
 - Understood.

282
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:45,470
Your Majesty, Kim Yeong Jae, Jipyeong (5th senior rank) of the Office of Inspector General greets you.

283
00:27:47,684 --> 00:27:50,434
What does the Office of the Inspector General need from me?

284
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:53,284
I have something to report in confidence.

285
00:27:56,644 --> 00:27:59,964
 Hey, so the water is now...

286
00:27:59,964 --> 00:28:02,054
- There is no leak. 
 - No.

287
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:04,054
Take a seat.

288
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:09,214
We are now going to find a nemesis who can oppose Minister Yu.

289
00:28:09,214 --> 00:28:12,644
Come on. Who could possibly rival Minister Yu?

290
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:14,144
There is

291
00:28:14,144 --> 00:28:17,024
one and only one person.

292
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,324
Gosh. Have you gone crazy?

293
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,434
How can we meet His Majesty?

294
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,304
If we attempt it, we will get kicked out at the palace gates.

295
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:30,884
There is only one way for mere regular folks like us to meet His Majesty.

296
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:33,484
No way.

297
00:28:34,594 --> 00:28:36,654
Gyeokjaeng*? /  (Public appeal while striking a gong/drum in front of the palace or during a king's procession.)

298
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:44,394
 Your Majesty! This is unjust, Your Majesty!

299
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:48,054
 Please relieve me of my sorrowâ€”

300
00:28:59,544 --> 00:29:03,304
Gosh! You had a weird thought again, did you not?

301
00:29:04,504 --> 00:29:06,154
Anyhow, listen carefully.

302
00:29:06,154 --> 00:29:10,584
Among clients who come to me, there will be at least one

303
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:15,344
very grave case that I cannot resolve with my power alone.

304
00:29:15,344 --> 00:29:18,564
- And then? 
 - The moment we have such a cause,

305
00:29:18,564 --> 00:29:20,384
we will call a gyeokjaeng right away.

306
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:24,534
After we get a chance to talk to His Majesty alone...

307
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:26,714
After that?

308
00:29:26,714 --> 00:29:28,124
After that...

309
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:30,584
After that?

310
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:33,214
I will skip the rest of the explanations.

311
00:29:33,214 --> 00:29:37,024
All right. Start.

312
00:29:37,024 --> 00:29:38,434
Start what?

313
00:29:38,434 --> 00:29:39,954
That will be one nyang. 
  Jo's Mercantile

314
00:29:39,954 --> 00:29:41,394
Here is five nyang.

315
00:29:41,394 --> 00:29:44,104
Five nyang? You can enter right away. 
  Attorney for Hire

316
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:47,364
Everyone, the consultation fee is one nyang!

317
00:29:47,364 --> 00:29:52,514
And urgent matters can be addressed right away for five nyang.

318
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:54,594
- Nothing is free in this world. 
 - Just once.

319
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:57,334
No, no. Bring me the money, okay?

320
00:29:57,334 --> 00:29:59,604
All right. Please stand in line. 
  Jo's Mercantile

321
00:29:59,604 --> 00:30:01,084
There you go.

322
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:02,794
- Just once, please. 
 - Bring the money, okay?

323
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:05,574
Next in line!

324
00:30:05,574 --> 00:30:08,144
Why is So Won not going there?

325
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:10,224
Five nyang! You can enter.

326
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:12,054
What is the matter?

327
00:30:12,054 --> 00:30:14,464
I was fired.

328
00:30:18,994 --> 00:30:21,474
Read the air, for goodness' sakes.

329
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:26,694
Aigoo, so dense! I'm so dense!

330
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,704
Hostess, thank you for the food.

331
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,254
 Advance Payment Welcome

332
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:54,734
So you are saying you gave all your wealth to the shaman over here,

333
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:56,734
including your land registry certificate?

334
00:30:56,734 --> 00:31:01,064
Says the person who was thankful when my child god

335
00:31:01,064 --> 00:31:03,494
had granted you a son.

336
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,024
People are angels in borrowing and devils in repaying.

337
00:31:06,024 --> 00:31:08,694
I did not know things would end up this way back then!

338
00:31:08,694 --> 00:31:11,814
After I gave even the land registry certificate to the child god,

339
00:31:11,814 --> 00:31:16,734
I went broke like this, and my wife and daughters died.

340
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:19,014
How would I have known that?

341
00:31:19,924 --> 00:31:21,354
What the shaman is saying is right.

342
00:31:21,354 --> 00:31:23,054
If you gave it to her, then it is hers.

343
00:31:23,054 --> 00:31:25,104
You cannot take it back unless you are mocking her.

344
00:31:25,104 --> 00:31:26,384
Definitely.

345
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,134
However...

346
00:31:29,774 --> 00:31:33,964
when this guy sacrificed his land certificate, he was seeking fortune.

347
00:31:33,964 --> 00:31:36,684
But his wife and daughters died, and he is sick, too.

348
00:31:36,684 --> 00:31:40,294
And his only son is now going around begging like this shows

349
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:43,564
that the child god has no power.

350
00:31:43,564 --> 00:31:46,194
Or you can still prove the child god's power

351
00:31:46,194 --> 00:31:49,244
by granting him and his family great fortune.

352
00:31:49,244 --> 00:31:53,194
Otherwise, you should give him his land back.

353
00:31:55,134 --> 00:31:56,994
Next!

354
00:31:56,994 --> 00:31:59,104
You left to start a new family with another woman!

355
00:31:59,104 --> 00:32:01,744
How dare a woman even talk of divorce?

356
00:32:01,744 --> 00:32:03,704
In that case,

357
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:08,254
what do you think about living with me for a month, as well, Madam?

358
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:12,844
Next!

359
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:14,934
During the last food shortage, he borrowed rice from me.

360
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,704
So he is now a slave of my house!

361
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:20,084
I just need to pay you back!

362
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:22,354
Hey, hey, hey!

363
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:24,684
If they find out you placed a regular person on a slave contract,

364
00:32:24,684 --> 00:32:27,844
you will receive a great punishment. Okay?

365
00:32:27,844 --> 00:32:29,344
Next!

366
00:32:29,344 --> 00:32:31,004
Next.

367
00:32:31,004 --> 00:32:33,034
Next.

368
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,654
Next...

369
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:40,384
Take a seat.

370
00:32:42,014 --> 00:32:43,914
- Huh? 
 - It is me.

371
00:32:43,914 --> 00:32:45,654
Aigoo, I am tired.

372
00:32:45,654 --> 00:32:47,504
You said you were looking for a gyeokjaeng case.

373
00:32:47,504 --> 00:32:49,264
What are you doing right now?

374
00:32:49,264 --> 00:32:51,904
Gosh, I am also losing it.

375
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:55,034
The moment I hear the case, my head just lights up.

376
00:32:55,034 --> 00:32:57,794
The solution is clear as day.

377
00:32:57,794 --> 00:33:01,154
I am too talented. What do I do?

378
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:05,124
What can you possibly do other than look for more?

379
00:33:05,124 --> 00:33:08,094
Did you think it was easy to meet the King?

380
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:11,714
Gosh, you are right. It is true.

381
00:33:11,714 --> 00:33:14,574
And make some money while we are at it.

382
00:33:15,224 --> 00:33:16,354
What?

383
00:33:16,354 --> 00:33:19,164
What do you mean, what?

384
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,464
Th-The...

385
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:23,004
 Sir!

386
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:24,774
Sir!

387
00:33:24,774 --> 00:33:26,914
- It is 10 nyang. 
 - What is?

388
00:33:26,914 --> 00:33:29,114
The cost of rice soup for the clients.

389
00:33:29,114 --> 00:33:30,184
Why is that?

390
00:33:30,184 --> 00:33:33,244
We were also buying them food, were we not?

391
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:38,464
It is free!

392
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:39,924
Help yourselves.

393
00:33:39,924 --> 00:33:42,684
I even gave back all the consultation fees.

394
00:33:42,684 --> 00:33:44,604
What?

395
00:33:44,604 --> 00:33:46,224
Hey!

396
00:33:47,184 --> 00:33:48,774
You!

397
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:54,794
You only cause trouble!

398
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:58,450
You said we needed lots and lots of clients! Did you not?

399
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,070
Why?

400
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:02,714
Stop right there!

401
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:22,064
What?

402
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,904
Are you Attorney Kang Han Su?

403
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:39,174
Yes. A-And?

404
00:34:39,174 --> 00:34:41,484
Nice to meet you, Kang Han Su.

405
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:44,584
I heard you have been wanting to meet gwain*?
 (Elevated form of "me" a king uses to refer to himself.)

406
00:34:45,244 --> 00:34:47,044
Gwain?

407
00:35:04,744 --> 00:35:10,204
Your Majesty! I apology for not recognizing you! Forâ€“ I mean, please forgive me!

408
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:13,984
Do not worry about it.

409
00:35:13,984 --> 00:35:17,274
It is my fault for coming to you without warning.

410
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:24,734
How about we become close enough not to be concerned with customs or formalities?

411
00:35:37,874 --> 00:35:40,224
Let us become friends, Kang Han Su.

412
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:46,724
You are older in age, but I am higher in status.

413
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:49,514
So I do not think either of us would consider it a loss.

414
00:36:11,174 --> 00:36:13,394
"Advance Payment Welcome."

415
00:36:23,524 --> 00:36:25,314
My friend.

416
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:27,594
Have a seat.

417
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:29,334
Y-Yes.

418
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:35,774
Of course, you are intelligent. You have recognized it.

419
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:36,984
What do you mean?

420
00:36:36,984 --> 00:36:41,524
That I am an outstanding individual who would relieve your itch like a backscratcher.

421
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:44,114
A backscratcher?

422
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:49,214
True. You did already alleviate some issues that have been causing me some irritation.

423
00:36:50,384 --> 00:36:53,434
Would it be possible this time around as well?

424
00:36:53,434 --> 00:36:56,714
Are you faced with a difficult issue?

425
00:37:03,714 --> 00:37:06,134
It is going according to plan.

426
00:37:06,134 --> 00:37:11,314
You must hire a competent lawyer and have him dig into the case properly.

427
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:14,284
I am sure he will use your brother.

428
00:37:14,284 --> 00:37:20,484
Kang Han Su is the most successful attorney in Hanyang at the moment.

429
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:25,464
I am sure my brother will be able to pull it off.

430
00:37:25,464 --> 00:37:28,904
Thus I am even more upset about it.

431
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:33,564
My brother has no idea what the royal family has done to my family

432
00:37:33,564 --> 00:37:38,674
and will be on their side and do his best in what he is told to do.

433
00:37:39,644 --> 00:37:42,114
Endure just a little longer.

434
00:37:42,114 --> 00:37:48,184
There will come a day you will be able to reveal the truth to your brother as well.

435
00:37:49,754 --> 00:37:51,304
Yes.

436
00:37:55,614 --> 00:38:01,414
Actually, an official from the Office of Inspector General came to see me today.

437
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:07,534
He asked me to hold off on appointing Kwon Myeong Wu as the new chief advisor.

438
00:38:07,534 --> 00:38:11,264
He said that a disgraceful incident occurred in his household.

439
00:38:11,264 --> 00:38:14,724
A disgraceful incident?

440
00:38:14,724 --> 00:38:18,814
His older brother was murdered.

441
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:23,764
And his younger brother Kwon Myeong Wu happens to be the prime suspect in the murder.

442
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:30,484
If that is true, your dignity for appointing such a man will be negatively affected.

443
00:38:31,234 --> 00:38:34,454
It is not simply a matter of my dignity.

444
00:38:34,454 --> 00:38:37,794
Kwon Myeong Wu is part of Sarim Party.

445
00:38:37,794 --> 00:38:42,714
During this crucial time that I am trying to balance the powers between Hungu and Sarim,

446
00:38:42,714 --> 00:38:44,754
such an incident had to have happened.

447
00:38:44,754 --> 00:38:50,684
By chance, could it possibly be that someone was aiming for such an inopportune timing?

448
00:38:51,984 --> 00:38:55,334
Late Kwon did not have the ambition to become successful.

449
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:58,744
He was a bookworm who only knew about teaching pupils in a school.

450
00:38:58,744 --> 00:39:02,544
He did not go out a lot or have much interaction with outsiders.

451
00:39:02,544 --> 00:39:05,374
His family members were the only people he came in contact with on the day of his death.

452
00:39:05,374 --> 00:39:11,174
It is too far-fetched to suspect anyone behind the incident or any political motive.

453
00:39:11,174 --> 00:39:14,884
Everything just happened coincidentally?

454
00:39:19,814 --> 00:39:22,754
Okay. I understand it all.

455
00:39:22,754 --> 00:39:29,110
In any case, the culprit of this case must never be Kwon Myeong Wu.

456
00:39:30,084 --> 00:39:35,794
I will desperately wish and wait for the fact that that is true.

457
00:39:35,794 --> 00:39:40,564
It sounds to me like you are asking me to be your secret investigator rather than an attorney.

458
00:39:40,564 --> 00:39:44,064
I am giving you the liberty to do what you want in your own way...

459
00:39:44,064 --> 00:39:45,334
as you have always done.

460
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:49,024
Yes. As always.

461
00:39:53,514 --> 00:39:54,994
Here is a military pass.

462
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:58,574
 Busin: A pass issued by the Ministry of Defense

463
00:39:58,574 --> 00:40:05,314
I will be sure to visit you with the answer you desire, Your Majesty.

464
00:40:09,554 --> 00:40:14,344
I felt more assured having met Kang Han Su in person. 
  Jo's Mercantile

465
00:40:15,764 --> 00:40:19,944
I am not hoping for you to rely on him.

466
00:40:20,744 --> 00:40:23,464
I want you to protect him.

467
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:25,164
Protect him?

468
00:40:25,164 --> 00:40:31,524
Yes. Is he not one of your people fighting a difficult fight on your behalf?

469
00:40:33,804 --> 00:40:35,814
You are right.

470
00:40:37,684 --> 00:40:41,594
I am indebted to him.

471
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,874
Therefore, you must put  Minister Yu's power to rest this time.

472
00:40:46,874 --> 00:40:52,254
That is the only way you will become the king who will protect your people.

473
00:40:54,844 --> 00:40:57,104
There is no question about it.

474
00:41:12,714 --> 00:41:16,914
Whoa, I thought I was going to pass out.

475
00:41:16,914 --> 00:41:22,294
That pale, baby-faced lad is our king?

476
00:41:22,294 --> 00:41:26,494
Whether he is our king or someone else's remains to be seen.

477
00:41:26,494 --> 00:41:28,684
So particular.

478
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:35,184
But how did he know that you wished to meet the King?

479
00:41:35,184 --> 00:41:39,724
So Won could not possibly tell the King.

480
00:41:41,444 --> 00:41:44,504
Is Mayor Yu close to the King?

481
00:41:44,504 --> 00:41:47,004
So did he hear it from So Wonâ€”

482
00:41:49,114 --> 00:41:54,954
Are So Won and Mayor Yu that close?

483
00:42:13,394 --> 00:42:17,734
 Please meet me at Wongaksa Temple on the fifteenth of the month.

484
00:42:18,434 --> 00:42:22,244
You said if you told him everything, you did not think you could see Attorney Kang again

485
00:42:22,244 --> 00:42:25,554
and that you cannot muster the courage.

486
00:42:26,364 --> 00:42:31,424
That is how I tried to coax him. I should not have done so.

487
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:36,070
Nanny, I will become someone who can protect others,

488
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,790
not someone to be protected.

489
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,104
Are you done writing it?

490
00:42:46,034 --> 00:42:53,290
 I wish to meet you, Princess. When you receive this letter...

491
00:42:55,244 --> 00:42:57,084
You have a letter from him.

492
00:42:57,084 --> 00:42:58,864
The Elder?

493
00:43:01,264 --> 00:43:03,894
 While listening to the clear sound of ocean waves...

494
00:43:03,894 --> 00:43:07,834
 I wish to meet you, Princess. When you receive this letter...

495
00:43:10,544 --> 00:43:12,284
Why?

496
00:43:16,654 --> 00:43:20,194
H-How come the writing is...

497
00:43:30,864 --> 00:43:35,394
 Mayor Yu was the Elder.

498
00:43:41,314 --> 00:43:43,404
 So Won

499
00:44:20,964 --> 00:44:23,064
Do as I have commanded.

500
00:44:23,064 --> 00:44:25,824
Yes, Your Excellency.

501
00:44:50,584 --> 00:44:52,664
Is it this house?

502
00:44:56,134 --> 00:44:59,304
Are you Attorney Kang Han Su?

503
00:44:59,304 --> 00:45:01,734
Are you Chief Advisor?

504
00:45:02,394 --> 00:45:03,904
Yes, I am.

505
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:09,304
But I have not been officially appointed yet, so do not call me by the title.

506
00:45:09,304 --> 00:45:12,874
- Then... 
 - Just address me as "Sir."

507
00:45:12,874 --> 00:45:14,964
Please come this way.

508
00:45:15,664 --> 00:45:18,274
Yes, Sir.

509
00:45:20,624 --> 00:45:23,774
He seems to be a stickler and very uptight.

510
00:45:23,774 --> 00:45:25,694
He seems pretty stubborn.

511
00:45:25,694 --> 00:45:29,674
So he is the prime suspect, right?

512
00:45:29,674 --> 00:45:34,274
He must never be the culprit for our sake.

513
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:38,214
So you look for another prime suspect as soon as you go in there.

514
00:45:38,214 --> 00:45:39,254
I got it.

515
00:45:39,254 --> 00:45:41,044
Let us go.

516
00:46:22,974 --> 00:46:25,344
Geez! You only look like you could eat a dead body!

517
00:46:25,344 --> 00:46:28,414
M-My back... hit my back...

518
00:46:29,264 --> 00:46:32,314
Brother-in-law, what in the world is this bizarre happening?

519
00:46:32,314 --> 00:46:36,124
How could you bring an attorney into our house amid such a horrendous incident?

520
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:38,254
I should do whatever I can, Sister-in-law.

521
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,844
Hyeongnim ended up like that,

522
00:46:40,844 --> 00:46:44,234
and we cannot even have a proper funeral for him yet.

523
00:46:44,874 --> 00:46:47,484
But what could a mere attorney do?

524
00:46:47,484 --> 00:46:51,684
That is yet to be revealed.

525
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:55,734
If you would like to resolve this case quietly and swiftly,

526
00:46:55,734 --> 00:46:59,214
it would be best for you to cooperate with me.

527
00:46:59,214 --> 00:47:00,844
Yes.

528
00:47:00,844 --> 00:47:05,804
Eunuch Go, who serves His Majesty closely, introduced me to him.

529
00:47:05,804 --> 00:47:08,334
You must mind your manners and formality.

530
00:47:11,224 --> 00:47:14,164
Please take good care of this for us.

531
00:47:19,424 --> 00:47:22,474
 Suspect 1: Madam, Late Kwon's wife

532
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:29,234
Madam, how could you be so calm?

533
00:47:29,234 --> 00:47:30,264
What did you say?

534
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:34,644
I mean, after what happened to your husband, you should be the most distressed.

535
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:37,324
Yet you seem so strong. I was wondering what your secret isâ€”

536
00:47:37,324 --> 00:47:39,174
Shut up, you wretch!

537
00:47:39,174 --> 00:47:41,974
How dare you? You are nothing but an attorney...

538
00:47:41,974 --> 00:47:44,674
Then, on the day your husband was killed,

539
00:47:44,674 --> 00:47:48,074
do you know when he stopped drinking?

540
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:50,054
Ask that Aebi* such a question.
  (A female servant the master cherishes.)

541
00:47:50,054 --> 00:47:52,574
She was with him until his last moment.

542
00:47:52,574 --> 00:47:55,064
Madam!

543
00:47:55,064 --> 00:47:57,504
 Suspect 2: Cheong Soon, Aebi, a female servant

544
00:47:57,504 --> 00:47:59,164
If you say Aebi...

545
00:47:59,164 --> 00:48:03,414
It means he cherished her greatly as a servant.

546
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:06,914
I only served him alcohol that night.

547
00:48:16,274 --> 00:48:19,674
You saw it yourself, Madam!

548
00:48:33,134 --> 00:48:35,314
 She is right.

549
00:48:35,314 --> 00:48:39,264
 Madam had been out that night for a moment.

550
00:48:41,114 --> 00:48:44,034
I had come out for a moment to use the outhouse.

551
00:48:44,034 --> 00:48:47,694
How would I know if that bitch went back into the annex after I left?

552
00:48:47,694 --> 00:48:53,314
No, Madam. Cheong Soon went into her room to sleep right away.

553
00:48:54,254 --> 00:48:56,454
I told you I would let you marry Aebi.

554
00:48:56,454 --> 00:48:59,124
You are already looking out for her, thinking she is your wife?

555
00:48:59,124 --> 00:49:02,074
Oh, your betrothed?

556
00:49:02,074 --> 00:49:04,824
Is that why you stayed there so late?

557
00:49:04,824 --> 00:49:07,664
No, Sir. I am a servant,

558
00:49:07,664 --> 00:49:12,364
so it is my duty to take care of the master until he falls asleep.

559
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:19,164
Then you had to watch Aebi as she served the master alcohol until late at night.

560
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,954
You must have been very much upset.

561
00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:23,544
Excuse me?

562
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:28,664
 Suspect 3: Jang Dol, servant

563
00:49:32,184 --> 00:49:34,164
 Why don't you hurry up and go to sleep?

564
00:49:34,164 --> 00:49:36,314
 The sun set a long time ago!

565
00:49:36,314 --> 00:49:37,604
 Give me a break.

566
00:49:37,604 --> 00:49:41,054
 Does a servant wench become a noble when the sun sets?

567
00:49:42,694 --> 00:49:46,534
 Then you talk to the master and ask him to leave me alone!

568
00:49:53,914 --> 00:49:58,084
I have never had such an awful thought, Sir!

569
00:50:06,624 --> 00:50:09,024
Then who is preparing for his funeral?

570
00:50:09,024 --> 00:50:11,504
 Madam, this is Jo.

571
00:50:11,504 --> 00:50:13,494
Come in.

572
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:26,384
Including the funeral, that steward is in charge of all the housekeeping matters.

573
00:50:26,384 --> 00:50:30,204
I see. Housekeeping matters, huh?

574
00:50:30,204 --> 00:50:33,144
I see... housekeeping...

575
00:50:33,144 --> 00:50:36,174
Madam, I have obtained twenty rolls of burlap cloth.

576
00:50:36,174 --> 00:50:39,054
I have reserved the ladies who will make food for the funeral.

577
00:50:39,054 --> 00:50:40,564
Good work.

578
00:50:40,564 --> 00:50:43,074
Yes, Ma'am.

579
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:45,894
W-Wait. Where do you think you are going?

580
00:50:46,694 --> 00:50:50,264
I am investigating a murder case. Please sit down for a moment.

581
00:50:51,374 --> 00:50:54,944
But I have nothing to do with that case.

582
00:50:54,944 --> 00:50:56,294
How so?

583
00:50:56,294 --> 00:51:00,244
I was in the upper village on the night of the incident, running an errand for the master.

584
00:51:00,244 --> 00:51:01,584
That is true.

585
00:51:01,584 --> 00:51:07,334
Hyeongnim sent his friend, who lives in the upper village, a set of inkstones.

586
00:51:08,634 --> 00:51:12,220
 Suspect 4: Jo-something, steward

587
00:51:19,364 --> 00:51:21,514
Is that so?

588
00:51:21,514 --> 00:51:25,404
Hyeongnim had arranged for us to have drinks that night

589
00:51:25,404 --> 00:51:28,064
to celebrate having obtained valuable inkstones.

590
00:51:31,144 --> 00:51:34,014
-  I will pour you a glass, Hyeongnim. 
 - Sure.

591
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:42,034
Then the one who was drinking with your hyeongnim was...

592
00:51:46,494 --> 00:51:50,820
 Suspect 5: Kwon Myeong Wu, Late Kwon's younger brother

593
00:51:56,804 --> 00:51:59,334
I will vote for the steward.

594
00:51:59,334 --> 00:52:03,274
He went off to somewhere as soon as he was finished.

595
00:52:03,274 --> 00:52:05,664
I am sure he is hiding something.

596
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:08,884
Aigoo, of all people to pick.

597
00:52:09,554 --> 00:52:12,264
Why? What about it?

598
00:52:13,504 --> 00:52:18,064
He was not at home on the night of the incident, you idiot.

599
00:52:19,864 --> 00:52:22,294
There is no way, though...

600
00:52:22,294 --> 00:52:25,994
That is what my gut feeling said.

601
00:52:25,994 --> 00:52:27,334
What gut feeling?

602
00:52:27,334 --> 00:52:28,764
- I mean... 
 - Yes?

603
00:52:28,764 --> 00:52:33,024
- I can smell the stench of tobacco next to him. 
 - And?

604
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:36,074
- But he said he does not smoke. 
 - So?

605
00:52:36,074 --> 00:52:42,494
Then there is only one place where his clothes would trap the stench of tobacco.

606
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:45,994
A gambling house. Do you not think so?

607
00:52:45,994 --> 00:52:48,894
 Tavern

608
00:52:48,894 --> 00:52:55,414
 A man who likes to gamble is in charge of the housekeeping at Late Kwon's, known to be rich.

609
00:52:55,414 --> 00:52:57,424
 Try to win.

610
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:06,554
 I'll stop here.

611
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:16,844
You said so yourself. The clearest motive for murder

612
00:53:16,844 --> 00:53:18,764
is money.

613
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:42,994
 I am sure it is about money.

614
00:53:42,994 --> 00:53:46,214
 But he was not at the scene on the day of?

615
00:53:54,544 --> 00:53:59,454
Again, again! You will ruin the brush and your teeth, too.

616
00:54:12,914 --> 00:54:15,584
Should I have brought her with me?

617
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:21,024
 I have... a confession as well.

618
00:54:30,124 --> 00:54:40,230
  Wishes Inn

619
00:54:44,604 --> 00:54:48,614
Princess, you should close the window before you go to bed.

620
00:54:52,344 --> 00:54:54,364
Princess?

621
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:57,464
Prinâ€“

622
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,704
Princess!

623
00:55:02,704 --> 00:55:04,564
Princess!

624
00:55:06,654 --> 00:55:08,604
Princess!

625
00:55:17,924 --> 00:55:19,754
Have you been waiting long?

626
00:55:19,754 --> 00:55:21,764
No, Sir.

627
00:55:53,574 --> 00:55:54,854
This is...

628
00:55:54,854 --> 00:55:57,674
I finally found out.

629
00:55:58,274 --> 00:56:00,564
I was extremely confused.

630
00:56:00,564 --> 00:56:05,434
I wondered, "What was he thinking? To do this for so long..."

631
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:09,814
"Was he trying to repay for his father's sins in his place?"

632
00:56:09,814 --> 00:56:13,204
- Princess. 
 - And the conclusion I reached was...

633
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:16,104
Whatever your true intentions were,

634
00:56:16,104 --> 00:56:19,514
I do not want to worry about anything.

635
00:56:19,514 --> 00:56:21,534
That was it.

636
00:56:22,414 --> 00:56:27,604
Whether it was you or the Elder, I have no room in my heart for other concerns.

637
00:56:27,604 --> 00:56:33,274
Thus... you do not need to do this any longer.

638
00:56:33,274 --> 00:56:35,614
Please do not try so hard.

639
00:57:30,664 --> 00:57:32,644
Young Master!

640
00:57:38,974 --> 00:57:40,834
Who are you?

641
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:50,014
I am the owner of this saloon.

642
00:57:50,014 --> 00:57:51,654
Also...

643
00:57:52,324 --> 00:57:55,084
I am your woman, Young Master.

644
00:57:58,644 --> 00:58:02,774
Do you remember me?

645
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:17,374
Are you all right?

646
00:58:19,094 --> 00:58:21,664
Yes, Young Master.

647
00:58:22,684 --> 00:58:25,824
Young Master, I...

648
00:58:25,824 --> 00:58:27,844
It is all right.

649
00:59:22,514 --> 00:59:24,424
Young Master.

650
00:59:25,994 --> 00:59:27,924
Here.

651
00:59:29,684 --> 00:59:31,584
Thank you.

652
00:59:51,644 --> 00:59:53,634
Young Master!

653
01:00:09,424 --> 01:00:11,314
Let us go.

654
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:34,444
I have shown you a side of me I should not have shown you after all these years.

655
01:00:34,444 --> 01:00:40,274
Had we met at happier times, I would have been more glad to have met you again.

656
01:00:47,634 --> 01:00:50,244
I like it better this way...

657
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:55,554
since I can do something for you, Young Master.

658
01:00:55,554 --> 01:01:00,304
I can comfort your hurting heart this way.

659
01:01:31,174 --> 01:01:36,404
And I can even be your drinking friend like this.

660
01:01:38,634 --> 01:01:42,824
I have been waiting for so long to meet you again, Young Master.

661
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:50,024
You seem just like me.

662
01:01:57,754 --> 01:02:03,064
I must be... just like you.

663
01:02:16,314 --> 01:02:18,134
Hi.

664
01:02:18,894 --> 01:02:21,384
Hey, Kim!

665
01:02:21,384 --> 01:02:23,244
How is it going? Did you sell a lot today?

666
01:02:23,244 --> 01:02:25,364
I barely made enough for a drink.

667
01:02:25,364 --> 01:02:28,484
Enough for two glasses of rice wine and a plate of cabbage pancakes.

668
01:02:28,484 --> 01:02:33,684
No way. Not just a plate. I think you made enough for ten plates of cabbage pancakes.

669
01:02:33,684 --> 01:02:35,484
You are psychic.

670
01:02:35,484 --> 01:02:38,124
But where is So Won?

671
01:02:38,124 --> 01:02:41,244
I am on my way to meet her anyway.

672
01:02:41,244 --> 01:02:43,734
- Bye now! 
 - Bye!

673
01:03:01,384 --> 01:03:04,614
Did you say you do not want to concern yourself in any way?

674
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:07,894
And you have no feelings to waste on me?

675
01:03:07,894 --> 01:03:10,374
Then do not waste them on me.

676
01:03:10,374 --> 01:03:13,504
Ignore the fact that I was the Elder.

677
01:03:13,504 --> 01:03:17,924
- Your Excellency. 
 - Just treat me as Minister Yu's son as you have been.

678
01:03:17,924 --> 01:03:24,994
You may use my power and ability as a Hanseongbu official to bring down my father.

679
01:03:24,994 --> 01:03:28,504
Use me as your shield to protect your life and earn time.

680
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:31,034
Please let me do something.

681
01:03:32,344 --> 01:03:35,924
Please let me be whatever you need by your side.

682
01:03:37,114 --> 01:03:42,214
Please... use me.

683
01:03:44,374 --> 01:03:50,624
Who am I... that you are going to this extent?

684
01:03:53,014 --> 01:03:55,734
You smiled at me.

685
01:04:02,794 --> 01:04:07,004
It felt as though I had gained the whole world only with that smile.

686
01:04:07,004 --> 01:04:10,794
If I could see that smile one more time,

687
01:04:10,794 --> 01:04:14,884
I would be all right, even if I became a nameless flower on the side of the road.

688
01:04:16,084 --> 01:04:22,674
If you broke off that flower, I would be so happy.

689
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,544
You got hurt.

690
01:04:44,704 --> 01:04:51,244
You... finally see me.

691
01:04:54,670 --> 01:05:01,630

692
01:05:04,904 --> 01:05:09,244
â™«  Always be with you  â™«

693
01:05:11,924 --> 01:05:16,264
â™«  On the day we held hands  â™«

694
01:05:18,924 --> 01:05:23,644
â™«  I always remember  â™«

695
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:30,674
â™«  The moment I first saw you  â™«

696
01:05:33,034 --> 01:05:44,534
â™«  I knew &nbsp;â™« 
â™«  That our time exists in the same space &nbsp;â™«

697
01:05:47,154 --> 01:05:50,004
â™«  Love you forever  â™«

698
01:05:51,204 --> 01:05:55,924
â™«  Even if it hurts like crazy &nbsp;â™« 
â™«  I will forever &nbsp;â™«

699
01:05:55,924 --> 01:06:01,064
 I have... a confession as well.

700
01:06:01,064 --> 01:06:05,674
â™«  Even if the cold wind blows  â™«

701
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:11,114
â™«  I will protect you in the midst of it  â™«

702
01:06:14,594 --> 01:06:22,174
â™«  Can't you come one step closer to me?  â™«

703
01:06:22,174 --> 01:06:29,964
â™«  I'm waiting for you right here  â™«

704
01:06:29,964 --> 01:06:33,064
â™«  Hold my hand  â™«

705
01:06:33,064 --> 01:06:36,674
â™«  Embrace me tightly  â™«

706
01:06:40,174 --> 01:06:44,574
â™«  I always remember  â™«

707
01:06:46,034 --> 01:06:51,500
 We worked with animal experts for scenes involving animals for their safety

708
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,464
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

709
01:06:58,464 --> 01:07:01,024
 Mayor and you...

710
01:07:01,024 --> 01:07:04,194
 You mean I do not need to misunderstand your relationship, right?

711
01:07:05,394 --> 01:07:08,164
 Did you not hear from Kang Han Su yet?

712
01:07:09,304 --> 01:07:15,254
 Everything in this country of Joseon... is up to me, Sire.

713
01:07:16,984 --> 01:07:22,234
 I want to live as So Won all my life.

714
01:07:24,484 --> 01:07:27,194
 Mind proper manners.

715
01:07:27,194 --> 01:07:31,270
 This is Princess Yeon Ju, the late King's daughter.

716
01:07:34,044 --> 01:07:38,300
â™«  Can't you come one step closer to me?  â™«
