(All people, incidents, and periods in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,311
How dare you...

3
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:07,811
use my son...

4
00:00:08,912 --> 00:00:10,782
to trap me?

5
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:21,822
That is your expertise, no?

6
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:25,631
What will you do?

7
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:29,001
Will you give in and come clean?

8
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:30,162
Or...

9
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:33,402
will you put all the blame on your son?

10
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:35,501
How dare you...

11
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:56,222
Of course, you will not do that.

12
00:00:57,862 --> 00:01:00,392
I already have something on you.

13
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:03,901
Your son.

14
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:09,772
That your son, Yoo Ji Sun,

15
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:11,612
is...

16
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:13,612
such an honourable man.

17
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:20,851
This court...

18
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,022
does not distinguish between truth and falsehood...

19
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:24,651
based on status.

20
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,991
Do this thing you want to do...

21
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:29,862
through me.

22
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:42,642
That means you could not have raised a son like him...

23
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:46,241
with fake love.

24
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:51,981
Executive Minister Yoo would never confess.

25
00:01:54,052 --> 00:01:56,821
He would think it would be much faster...

26
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:59,621
to blame you for everything, then pull you out later...

27
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:01,591
by using his power.

28
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:03,621
Frankly, do you not agree?

29
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,661
Hey, you are his son. Say something.

30
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,961
Good grief.

31
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:12,501
Goodness. He will never change.

32
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:41,132
Yes, Your Majesty.

33
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,132
That letter was...

34
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:47,001
written by me.

35
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:48,302
However,

36
00:02:48,572 --> 00:02:51,001
I was simply sharing my opinion with other subjects...

37
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:53,012
who were also enraged after seeing Officer Kang's letter.

38
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:56,211
I have never instigated any illegal acts.

39
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,251
Also,

40
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:02,082
I especially cannot acknowledge this absurd suspicion...

41
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,552
that I have hurt Princess Yeon Joo.

42
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,022
Her Highness is...

43
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:10,091
putting on an act right now.

44
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:16,961
Did you call this an act?

45
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:18,371
How dare you treat Her Highness...

46
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:22,901
Do not hold Her Highness in disdain.

47
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:24,441
Therefore,

48
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:27,572
all we have to do is...

49
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:28,911
clearly show everyone...

50
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:32,582
if Her Highness is truly ill or if she is only putting on an act.

51
00:03:38,922 --> 00:03:40,191
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:42,461
Please allow me to take a royal physician...

53
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:45,931
and confirm Her Highness's condition.

54
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:47,961
That is against customs.

55
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,461
However, this is a necessity in the criminal law.

56
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:53,232
We must confirm the evidence.

57
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:04,811
You must take responsibility...

58
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,481
for your request.

59
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:39,351
I truly apologize for these words, Your Majesty,

60
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:41,481
Your Highness.

61
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:45,392
The Princess is quite ill.

62
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,952
Her Highness...

63
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,622
may not make it.

64
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:14,012
Is anybody there?

65
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,221
Arrest Executive Minister Yoo!

66
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:18,421
Your Majesty.

67
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:20,091
This is a conspiracy!

68
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,892
A conspiracy!

69
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:09,101
The moment she saw this muffler,

70
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:12,242
she must have prepared herself...

71
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:15,582
to take things this far.

72
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,122
Do you wish to let him live?

73
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:53,182
Executive Minister Yoo...

74
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:57,051
will not fall for fake acting.

75
00:06:58,082 --> 00:06:59,291
Somebody...

76
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,392
has to take...

77
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:05,531
the real risk.

78
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:09,262
This is...

79
00:07:09,932 --> 00:07:11,531
our last chance.

80
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:19,072
Even if the worst happens to me,

81
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:21,711
please do not blame anybody.

82
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:27,682
This was wholly my choice.

83
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,262
I am sorry.

84
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:50,471
I am sorry for everything.

85
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:07,651
This is my way.

86
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:10,361
Attorney Kang,

87
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:12,432
you can live true to yourself,

88
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:16,432
as Kang Han Soo.

89
00:09:00,112 --> 00:09:06,012
(Episode 16: My Wish)

90
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:11,051
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

91
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:14,222
I will find a way to save my sister,

92
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:16,392
so do not worry.

93
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:18,732
How dare he try to hurt the Princess?

94
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:20,732
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

95
00:09:23,002 --> 00:09:24,232
Her Highness...

96
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:29,972
has taken poison herself.

97
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:31,612
What are you...

98
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:35,712
talking about right now?

99
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,441
Did she really...

100
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:39,281
Yes.

101
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:42,722
She went to that extent...

102
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:46,622
to bring down Executive Minister Yoo.

103
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:58,401
Then...

104
00:09:59,472 --> 00:10:01,701
Executive Minister Yoo must be severely punished.

105
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:05,142
I cannot let my sister's sacrifice go to waste.

106
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,472
If you punish him for such a reason,

107
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:10,281
it will be left in history.

108
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:13,352
Would that not be a dishonour to Her Highness?

109
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:15,551
Even so,

110
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:17,852
Executive Minister Yoo...

111
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:20,921
has committed many crimes worthy of the death penalty.

112
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:23,862
His life is as good as dead already.

113
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,191
And so...

114
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:27,362
that life.

115
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:31,462
I am trying to save it.

116
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:34,671
What did you say?

117
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,071
Let me decide...

118
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:41,441
on how Executive Minister Yoo should be punished.

119
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:47,181
Kang Eon Jik...

120
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,421
is to be promoted within the Criminal Jurisprudence...

121
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:50,882
he served during his lifetime.

122
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,852
And proper compensation is to be given to the bereaved family...

123
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,362
who suffered from his death.

124
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,061
Especially...

125
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:01,331
to his son Kang Han Soo.

126
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:03,262
He will be given back the qualification...

127
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,602
to take the state exam.

128
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:06,372
If he passes,

129
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:10,102
he will be granted the official position of his choice.

130
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:42,102
Thank you.

131
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:43,972
And...

132
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,872
I am sorry.

133
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,212
Your sister's incident.

134
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:54,382
I will engrave it in my heart...

135
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:56,482
and atone for it my entire life.

136
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:17,801
I am deeply grateful, Your Majesty.

137
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:30,651
From now on, we will discuss Yoo Je Se's crimes...

138
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:32,392
and punishment.

139
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:33,791
Vassals, start the discussion.

140
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,392
Why did you do it?

141
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:42,232
Did you not admire me, your father?

142
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:45,002
Did you not want to follow in my footsteps...

143
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:46,931
to the point you copied my handwriting?

144
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:52,242
But why did you not follow my wishes and go astray?

145
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:02,122
Because...

146
00:13:04,622 --> 00:13:06,122
I love you, Father.

147
00:13:09,592 --> 00:13:11,191
Born into a poor and low-class family,

148
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:15,132
you became successful with your abilities alone.

149
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:18,531
You even advanced to a government official.

150
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:21,272
I admired you greatly.

151
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:24,002
Just like you,

152
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,342
I, too,

153
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:29,612
wanted to help the nation and people with my strength.

154
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:32,882
But Father, you told me...

155
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,022
to enjoy everything as is...

156
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:38,551
and what was succeeded to me.

157
00:13:39,592 --> 00:13:41,092
I did not want to live such a life.

158
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:46,161
I wanted to achieve something like you did.

159
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:49,102
Thus,

160
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:53,401
I found and did what I could do.

161
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,212
The King was overthrown overnight.

162
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:09,122
There were family quarrels.

163
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:12,752
And I witnessed loyal subjects getting killed one after another.

164
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:17,522
It felt as if the line between right and wrong was falling apart.

165
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,962
What was important...

166
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:23,161
was not values and principles...

167
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:26,901
but not losing power.

168
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:31,401
Being at the center of all politics...

169
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:34,612
and a world of my own where nothing could be possible...

170
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:36,181
without me.

171
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:37,612
Achieving that...

172
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:42,222
was my goal that was more important than my life.

173
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:48,821
To be honest,

174
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:53,092
I was terrified.

175
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:57,002
That was what drove me to become stronger.

176
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:00,272
I wanted to leave...

177
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,372
a safe and peaceful life to my son...

178
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:06,712
despite all the nasty fights over power.

179
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,411
I...

180
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,212
What I wanted from you...

181
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,482
was not power.

182
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:20,551
It was self-respect.

183
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:34,301
You were wrong, Father.

184
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:32,831
Yoo Je Se...

185
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:34,732
committed libel...

186
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:36,862
by framing Yoo Je Se, which led him to death,

187
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:40,301
incited murder by disguising Park Jae Soo's murder...

188
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:42,071
as suicide,

189
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,742
in other words, premeditated murder,

190
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:47,712
and committed man-slaughter by killing Chu Young Woo himself.

191
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:50,982
Due to the names and duties on Officer Kang's letter...

192
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:52,512
and testimonies from Minister Park of the Board of Personnel,

193
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,882
Second Minister Lee Man Gap of the Ministry of Rites,

194
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:56,551
and Grand Queen Dowager,

195
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,391
he is guilty even without his confession.

196
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:02,922
We also have a testimony from Cho Chul Ju,

197
00:17:03,162 --> 00:17:04,891
the master of Cho's guild, who witnessed...

198
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:05,992
Yoo Je Se killing Chu Young Woo.

199
00:17:06,462 --> 00:17:09,101
If needed, he was willing to testify.

200
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:18,242
All that has been revealed until now would get him beheaded.

201
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:22,482
Kang Han Soo.

202
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,781
What do you think?

203
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:34,051
As Your Majesty has asked,

204
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:37,821
I will answer despite being discourteous.

205
00:17:39,932 --> 00:17:41,331
It is only proper...

206
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:44,031
to sentence Yoo Je Se to death.

207
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,472
But he has contributed the most to Joseon...

208
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:51,202
and is the executive minister. Those must be considered.

209
00:18:02,752 --> 00:18:04,551
He is right, Your Majesty.

210
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:09,462
After enthroning King Se Jo, Yoo Je Se's name...

211
00:18:09,992 --> 00:18:13,962
has been elected vassal of merit four times until now.

212
00:18:13,962 --> 00:18:15,662
He is the major contributor.

213
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:17,202
(A vassal who made a contribution)

214
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:19,071
King Se Jo said...

215
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:20,932
the major contributor...

216
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:24,601
shared happiness and sadness with the country.

217
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:27,641
So it was only fair that...

218
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:30,841
the people considered him as one with the country.

219
00:18:30,982 --> 00:18:33,551
In practice, the vassals of merit and their children...

220
00:18:33,682 --> 00:18:37,422
were given reduced sentences even if they committed a crime.

221
00:18:39,722 --> 00:18:42,791
That is true. And among them, the major contributor...

222
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:46,492
was mostly criticized but was not punished for his sins.

223
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:49,962
Reduce Yoo Je Se's sentence...

224
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,732
one grade lower from the death penalty...

225
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:54,932
to 100 clubbings...

226
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:57,272
and exile him 3,000 Ri away.

227
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,242
Save his life?

228
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,311
Were you not getting revenge on him?

229
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:08,412
Taking away a toothless tiger's life...

230
00:19:08,412 --> 00:19:10,482
is not great revenge, is it?

231
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,891
It will only be in favour of Your Majesty.

232
00:19:14,692 --> 00:19:15,962
If Executive Minister Yoo dies,

233
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:18,422
Hungu will also collapse.

234
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:20,531
The Royal Court will be taken over by Sarim.

235
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:23,131
Then Sarim will flatter over Your Majesty...

236
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:24,902
who has preferred them.

237
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,301
The Royal Court may have a new name,

238
00:19:28,472 --> 00:19:31,702
but it will be dictated by a particular party again.

239
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,482
Are you keeping Executive Minister Yoo alive...

240
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:39,452
to hold Sarim and me in check?

241
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:41,412
Yes.

242
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:44,281
Being alive,

243
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:47,222
he will be the pivot of Hungu's survival.

244
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,492
And he will...

245
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:51,891
keep you alert.

246
00:19:55,492 --> 00:19:56,631
Your Majesty.

247
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:00,002
Death is not the true meaning of punishment...

248
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:01,902
to Executive Minister Yoo.

249
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,071
It is to watch the young King,

250
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:10,781
whom he attempted to make his puppet,

251
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:15,551
save the nation and its people and become the great King himself.

252
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:19,422
Thus,

253
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:22,762
the day Joseon reaches the times of peace,

254
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:29,131
my revenge...

255
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,801
will be...

256
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:35,101
finally complete.

257
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:41,571
Kang Han Soo is right.

258
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:52,992
Dismiss Yoo Je Se from his position...

259
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:55,992
and exile him to another region that is 3,000 Ri away.

260
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:02,162
- Gosh. - Serves him right.

261
00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:08,772
It turned out he murdered so many innocent people...

262
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:11,571
and committed all kinds of deeds in his high position.

263
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,851
You probably came out of concern,

264
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:28,512
but there is no need to feel sorry.

265
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,022
Okay.

266
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:32,182
I will not feel sorry.

267
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:34,821
Instead,

268
00:22:37,662 --> 00:22:40,091
you may resent me.

269
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:44,762
I did the same.

270
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:03,051
She cannot be treated anymore?

271
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:04,452
What do you mean by that?

272
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,291
Using any more medicine...

273
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:10,262
will not guarantee her future well-being.

274
00:23:10,762 --> 00:23:11,962
Are you saying...

275
00:23:13,262 --> 00:23:15,391
she may be disabled?

276
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:16,561
Yes, Your Highness.

277
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:18,762
These medicinal herbs are so strong...

278
00:23:19,002 --> 00:23:22,272
that they will highly likely damage her organs.

279
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,371
She could...

280
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:26,912
become barren, at the least.

281
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:28,712
She could go blind or deaf.

282
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,281
If more serious,

283
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:34,712
she could become a quadriplegic unable to move and walk.

284
00:23:36,051 --> 00:23:37,281
Just save her.

285
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,422
Your Highness.

286
00:23:40,492 --> 00:23:43,662
She sacrificed herself for Joseon and its people.

287
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:45,492
You must not give up on her!

288
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:48,192
Your Highness, if you save her life,

289
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:53,672
I will serve her all my life as her eyes and ears.

290
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:01,111
Your Highness.

291
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:02,611
Yeon Joo.

292
00:24:10,522 --> 00:24:11,722
Grandmother.

293
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:13,551
How are you feeling?

294
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:16,791
I am sorry...

295
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:20,591
I made you worry.

296
00:24:23,702 --> 00:24:24,962
Please...

297
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:27,702
punish me.

298
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:32,141
Your Highness.

299
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,781
I thought of deposing you...

300
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:42,152
and erasing your name from the royal family tree.

301
00:24:42,152 --> 00:24:43,881
But that is not enough.

302
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,621
Thus,

303
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,391
I am going to kill you.

304
00:24:55,932 --> 00:24:57,962
I will not put effort into saving your life.

305
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:05,442
Make up your mind, Your Majesty.

306
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:08,512
If the Princess dies,

307
00:25:09,912 --> 00:25:12,581
I will leave the palace and become a monk.

308
00:25:13,252 --> 00:25:16,482
I will live the rest of my life praying with repentance.

309
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,922
Grandmother.

310
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:21,291
Then in the palace,

311
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:23,561
neither humiliation...

312
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:26,262
nor flaws will be left.

313
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,232
I made this decision only for the future...

314
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:33,472
of the Royal Court, the Royal Family, and the King.

315
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:36,942
So please comply.

316
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,482
Do as you please, Grandmother.

317
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:10,702
Master Cho got the medicinal herbs...

318
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,341
as soon as he recovered.

319
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:16,412
It must have cost so much.

320
00:26:18,111 --> 00:26:20,581
Guilds are impressive indeed.

321
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,881
Right.

322
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:25,051
Had I stepped forward to testify sooner,

323
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:29,291
the Princess would not have taken that far.

324
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:35,291
I am sorry.

325
00:26:39,002 --> 00:26:40,172
Thanks.

326
00:26:41,272 --> 00:26:43,202
- All right. Let us take them. - Okay.

327
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,152
What? It is quiet.

328
00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:55,982
The guards watched this place tightly until yesterday.

329
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,791
- Let us go. - Go where?

330
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:10,762
Step aside.

331
00:27:11,402 --> 00:27:13,031
No, you cannot go.

332
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:15,301
If you want to go, step on me.

333
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:17,101
Are you kidding me? Move.

334
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:19,371
Or...

335
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,942
get on my back.

336
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:22,242
- What? - Here.

337
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:23,982
That is better for me. Fine, let us go.

338
00:27:23,982 --> 00:27:25,442
- Come on. - What...

339
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:26,482
- My lord. - Go!

340
00:27:26,482 --> 00:27:28,381
- My lord. - And what is your problem?

341
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:30,422
I will just hand her the medicine.

342
00:27:30,422 --> 00:27:31,621
Lady Hong.

343
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:33,422
- Let go of me. - Oh, please.

344
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:34,551
Lady Hong.

345
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,091
Please stop Han Soo.

346
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:38,861
He is trying to barge into the palace again.

347
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:40,061
- He... - Well...

348
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:42,162
How is the Princess?

349
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:46,601
If I cannot meet her, please deliver this.

350
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,682
Her Highness...

351
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:08,952
has passed away.

352
00:28:15,891 --> 00:28:17,101
It is true.

353
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:21,071
Lady Hong was deprived and forced out of the palace just now.

354
00:28:38,222 --> 00:28:41,351
- Your Highness... - Your Highness.

355
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:43,662
- Oh, no. - Your Highness.

356
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:37,381
Get away!

357
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,452
No matter what I was like in the past,

358
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:17,482
every act and choice I make from this day on...

359
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:21,652
will be for your sake.

360
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:13,811
Who is there?

361
00:31:23,022 --> 00:31:24,522
Who is out there?

362
00:31:32,662 --> 00:31:35,131
Goodness, Lord Chu.

363
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:37,331
Why are you here?

364
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:39,262
Lord Chu, why are you here?

365
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,172
Lord Yoon.

366
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:46,002
Officer Kang, you are...

367
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:49,141
No, spare me!

368
00:31:51,982 --> 00:31:53,452
Please spare me!

369
00:31:54,252 --> 00:31:55,682
Please spare my life...

370
00:32:17,472 --> 00:32:19,272
I have spared your life...

371
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:21,841
to show you the kind of King I become...

372
00:32:22,742 --> 00:32:25,811
and how I shall go down in history.

373
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:28,781
Watch closely...

374
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,621
as Joseon writes...

375
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:35,192
the most brilliant history without you.

376
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:54,672
Ministers are here as eyes and ears...

377
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,242
for a king.

378
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,281
Even if our words sound unpleasant to your ears,

379
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:01,152
you must embrace them generously...

380
00:33:01,351 --> 00:33:04,452
to handle numerous officers efficiently.

381
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:10,291
I will...

382
00:33:10,962 --> 00:33:12,662
always remain vigilant...

383
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,861
to stay as an independent king...

384
00:33:17,202 --> 00:33:18,662
who is never autocratic.

385
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,581
Please eat.

386
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:41,621
You too.

387
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,361
Thank you for the food.

388
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:23,032
Goodness.

389
00:34:23,431 --> 00:34:27,201
Why are you showing tears in front of the table?

390
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:29,672
My goodness.

391
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:32,402
I am fine.

392
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:34,371
I should not have cried.

393
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,612
What is your name?

394
00:34:50,192 --> 00:34:51,462
"Ji" means will.

395
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:53,862
"Ji" means will.

396
00:34:53,862 --> 00:34:57,002
Precisely. You are correct.

397
00:34:57,701 --> 00:35:00,201
Do you want to try writing this?

398
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:02,701
(Ji Sun)

399
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:09,641
Great job.

400
00:35:10,382 --> 00:35:12,782
- "Sun" means kindness. - "Sun" means kindness.

401
00:35:12,782 --> 00:35:15,081
- "Sun" means kindness. - "Sun" means kindness.

402
00:35:15,081 --> 00:35:16,982
Good job.

403
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:23,761
My name is Yoo Ji Sun.

404
00:35:27,132 --> 00:35:30,561
My father named me to live with the will to do kindness.

405
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:34,572
I see. That is a wonderful name.

406
00:35:35,632 --> 00:35:37,002
Are you married?

407
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,072
Not yet.

408
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:42,411
Goodness, you should hurry up and get married first.

409
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,811
Anyway,

410
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:48,411
how can we live only eating food like this?

411
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:52,152
I agree.

412
00:35:53,522 --> 00:35:56,522
The King should govern with goodness...

413
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:59,391
to let the people marry...

414
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:02,462
and have lots of children with ease of mind.

415
00:36:07,302 --> 00:36:09,371
So how is everything in the outside world?

416
00:36:09,802 --> 00:36:11,172
Is everything well?

417
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:14,212
Yes.

418
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:18,442
Joseon is in an unprecedented reign of peace right now.

419
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:22,652
Even people in the capital can hear praises of His Majesty...

420
00:36:22,652 --> 00:36:24,221
coming from the furthest towns.

421
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:25,982
I see.

422
00:36:27,522 --> 00:36:29,291
This old man finally got to see...

423
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:32,522
a world like that before I passed.

424
00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:36,632
Young man.

425
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:42,502
That is the kind of world I have always dreamed of.

426
00:36:51,882 --> 00:36:53,112
Is that so?

427
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:54,681
Yes.

428
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:58,982
Please, let us eat.

429
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:04,221
Goodness.

430
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,871
("Book of the Law, 1474 Revision," "About Autopsy," "Trial Precedents")

431
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:18,272
("Book of the Law")

432
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:23,072
Your Majesty.

433
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:26,241
The new governor of Cheongsan is here.

434
00:37:27,382 --> 00:37:28,451
Let him in.

435
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:46,772
Have you been well, Your Majesty?

436
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:50,002
It has been a while, Kang Han...

437
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,601
No, Governor Kang.

438
00:37:54,112 --> 00:37:55,471
You look wonderful.

439
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:59,181
I owe everything to you, Your Majesty.

440
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:04,221
You gave out such an easy question for the state exam.

441
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:07,351
I just could not fail.

442
00:38:08,822 --> 00:38:10,121
Stop joking.

443
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:13,261
Even scholars of Sungkyunkwan complained that it was hard.

444
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:14,732
- Goodness. - My gosh.

445
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:18,132
So why did you choose to go to Cheongsan?

446
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:21,272
There are districts such as Naju or Gongju,

447
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,772
larger places that are more convenient for you to live in.

448
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,942
There is a reason why we say, "Never forget your roots."

449
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,241
I must save my hometown first.

450
00:38:31,482 --> 00:38:32,911
I know that you will do well.

451
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:37,922
Anyway, are you not married yet?

452
00:38:40,822 --> 00:38:42,192
I do not wish to get married.

453
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:44,592
What if I arranged a match for you?

454
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:48,661
- You? - Do you not trust my judgement?

455
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:51,532
Eunuch Ko.

456
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:00,471
She is from my queen's family.

457
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:03,811
She is on her way back after visiting the Queen.

458
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:06,282
Please escort her home safely.

459
00:39:07,482 --> 00:39:10,882
Goodness. Oh, right! I have to be somewhere.

460
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:12,022
This is a royal order.

461
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:15,752
We are friends. Friends do not give orders.

462
00:39:15,922 --> 00:39:17,092
It is a royal order.

463
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:23,061
Gosh.

464
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:38,541
- My lord. - Oh, gosh.

465
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:41,612
Good grief. Well...

466
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:44,721
What is it?

467
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:46,621
It is this way.

468
00:39:48,991 --> 00:39:50,121
I see.

469
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,732
You seem to know the direction well.

470
00:39:53,962 --> 00:39:55,032
Of course.

471
00:39:55,032 --> 00:39:56,561
It is the path I take every day.

472
00:39:57,502 --> 00:39:58,532
Then...

473
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,902
you can go alone, yes?

474
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:03,902
Excuse me?

475
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,002
Be careful on your way.

476
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,592
The drawings look flat.

477
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:26,761
They are too simple.

478
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:29,092
Can you not draw diverse hairstyles?

479
00:40:29,132 --> 00:40:30,431
A hair bun or braided.

480
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:31,902
Even put a wig on her.

481
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:33,831
How about...

482
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:36,371
drawing a plump version of her?

483
00:40:37,172 --> 00:40:38,272
Shall we?

484
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:40,641
Yes.

485
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:43,782
It has already been three years. She could have gained weight.

486
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:50,951
Good idea.

487
00:40:52,621 --> 00:40:54,391
Three years have already passed.

488
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:57,261
When will you promote me to a merchant?

489
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:00,462
Back then,

490
00:41:00,462 --> 00:41:01,692
I even saved your life...

491
00:41:01,991 --> 00:41:03,601
in the heart of a mountain.

492
00:41:11,942 --> 00:41:13,442
How is that important right now?

493
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:18,241
Let us travel all the way to Gyeongsang Province this time.

494
00:41:18,982 --> 00:41:20,311
The business is important,

495
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:23,282
but the promise I made with Attorney Kang is more important.

496
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,081
- Yes. - Yes.

497
00:41:25,552 --> 00:41:26,951
Always coming up with excuses.

498
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:28,991
I better get back to farming.

499
00:41:30,022 --> 00:41:31,962
Not everyone can farm.

500
00:41:43,741 --> 00:41:46,741
(Reward: 300 nyang, Notify Cho's guild)

501
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:52,982
Hey, Jung Chu Soo.

502
00:41:53,951 --> 00:41:55,112
My lord.

503
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,661
We are looking high and low for her.

504
00:42:05,362 --> 00:42:08,761
Well, finding her cannot possibly be easy.

505
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:10,331
After all, she is dead,

506
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,431
not alive.

507
00:42:13,061 --> 00:42:14,601
Dead, my foot.

508
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:16,371
But...

509
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:20,041
the royal palace even held her funeral.

510
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:29,511
I did not see the body.

511
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:33,891
I only believe what I see with my own eyes.

512
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:52,541
(Tavern)

513
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,221
Those people call me the Celestial Drinker.

514
00:43:09,592 --> 00:43:10,891
Because when they drink over a bet with me,

515
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:12,161
they experience what a paradise is like.

516
00:44:05,782 --> 00:44:07,011
Am I dreaming?

517
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:17,761
How nice.

518
00:44:20,732 --> 00:44:21,831
Drink up.

519
00:44:27,002 --> 00:44:29,402
I am afraid Your Highness...

520
00:44:29,632 --> 00:44:31,942
cannot get pregnant.

521
00:44:33,911 --> 00:44:35,511
Even if you survive, only dishonour...

522
00:44:35,511 --> 00:44:37,011
and the fiery pit await you.

523
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:41,181
Your marriage ended even before the wedding ceremony.

524
00:44:41,282 --> 00:44:43,382
So did your life as a woman.

525
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:46,252
Will you be able to handle all of this?

526
00:44:47,621 --> 00:44:50,022
Grand Queen Dowager.

527
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,991
Please give her a chance, Your Highness.

528
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:57,462
So I will declare you dead to the world...

529
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,061
and have you leave the palace.

530
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:07,811
Then you can no longer live as Princess Yeon Joo.

531
00:45:09,072 --> 00:45:12,081
Nor will you get protection from the Royal Family.

532
00:45:12,482 --> 00:45:14,081
You must lead a tough life...

533
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:15,811
like any other woman,

534
00:45:15,811 --> 00:45:18,152
experiencing severe hardships in this world.

535
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:24,261
For a long time,

536
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:26,822
I have always...

537
00:45:28,261 --> 00:45:31,002
wanted and dreamed of such a life.

538
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:34,272
Your kindness.

539
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:37,032
I will never forget it, even in my death.

540
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:42,342
You saved yourself.

541
00:45:43,712 --> 00:45:45,041
Your desperation...

542
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:48,752
led you to the life of your dreams.

543
00:45:54,851 --> 00:45:56,322
My poor girl.

544
00:45:58,161 --> 00:45:59,922
Forgive me...

545
00:46:01,431 --> 00:46:04,732
for this is the only way I can atone for the sins I committed.

546
00:46:23,482 --> 00:46:24,922
By the way,

547
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:29,451
what did this lady do to earn herself a reward of 300 nyang?

548
00:46:29,752 --> 00:46:31,261
- Three hundred nyang? - Yes.

549
00:46:31,891 --> 00:46:32,991
Take a look.

550
00:46:33,022 --> 00:46:34,592
(Reward: 300 nyang, Notify Cho's guild)

551
00:46:38,732 --> 00:46:40,002
What is it?

552
00:46:40,302 --> 00:46:41,601
Would you like to look at it?

553
00:46:43,532 --> 00:46:44,601
Wait.

554
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:47,212
- What? - I will buy it.

555
00:46:48,011 --> 00:46:49,411
What? He...

556
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:56,581
- Good gracious. - We are in luck.

557
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:59,922
(Reward: 300 nyang, Notify Cho's guild)

558
00:47:09,061 --> 00:47:11,161
(Sowongak)

559
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:18,002
Everything is over now.

560
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,911
You should live your life, my lord.

561
00:47:22,942 --> 00:47:24,641
An ordinary life like the others.

562
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:26,842
Get married.

563
00:47:27,951 --> 00:47:29,282
Have children.

564
00:47:29,911 --> 00:47:31,451
Do what others do.

565
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:44,201
My lord.

566
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:53,002
I made it myself.

567
00:47:53,172 --> 00:47:55,741
Your current muffler looked quite old.

568
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:58,212
I see.

569
00:48:00,241 --> 00:48:01,951
Thank you for the gesture,

570
00:48:01,951 --> 00:48:04,052
but this keeps me warm enough.

571
00:48:07,081 --> 00:48:09,491
The same goes for the woman in my heart.

572
00:48:10,862 --> 00:48:12,391
My heart will never change.

573
00:48:32,712 --> 00:48:35,411
(Cheongsan)

574
00:48:42,692 --> 00:48:45,192
- He looks familiar. - Where have I seen him?

575
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:54,302
He really is incredible.

576
00:48:54,971 --> 00:48:59,541
To return home in glory after becoming a governor.

577
00:49:00,272 --> 00:49:01,572
Why is he crying?

578
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:13,181
My lord.

579
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:16,252
It is such an honour to be able to serve you.

580
00:49:16,592 --> 00:49:19,092
We have devoted our hearts to making this feast.

581
00:49:19,092 --> 00:49:21,192
Please feel free to enjoy it.

582
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:23,391
You did not have to go this far.

583
00:49:24,532 --> 00:49:28,371
Then let me grease my organs.

584
00:49:35,212 --> 00:49:37,541
Do you see that man with a harpoon over there?

585
00:49:40,612 --> 00:49:41,782
I see no one.

586
00:49:42,451 --> 00:49:43,612
- Really? - Yes.

587
00:49:48,991 --> 00:49:51,092
Oh, dear Almighty.

588
00:49:51,561 --> 00:49:53,221
Goodness, my lord.

589
00:49:53,221 --> 00:49:56,761
Please stop this nonsense.

590
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:02,002
What is going on?

591
00:50:16,411 --> 00:50:18,721
Oh, my lord!

592
00:50:19,081 --> 00:50:21,692
Just what is wrong with you?

593
00:50:21,692 --> 00:50:23,092
Is there any problem with the food?

594
00:50:23,951 --> 00:50:24,991
This is...

595
00:50:25,761 --> 00:50:27,121
not food.

596
00:50:28,331 --> 00:50:30,132
This is Fisherman Kang.

597
00:50:30,132 --> 00:50:32,302
This is the chief monk of Pyeongan Temple.

598
00:50:32,302 --> 00:50:34,831
And this is Commoner Yang.

599
00:50:35,471 --> 00:50:38,272
These dishes show their resentful grudges.

600
00:50:40,942 --> 00:50:42,241
How dare you...

601
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:46,181
serve me a feast with extorted food?

602
00:50:46,482 --> 00:50:48,152
Are you not afraid of the skies?

603
00:50:48,252 --> 00:50:51,081
I apologize, my lord. This will never happen again.

604
00:50:51,322 --> 00:50:52,721
- Forgive us. - Forgive us.

605
00:50:52,721 --> 00:50:53,782
Fine.

606
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,752
I will believe you.

607
00:50:59,621 --> 00:51:02,632
A nation cannot be fully governed by one person.

608
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:04,732
Thus, each village has a local governor.

609
00:51:05,431 --> 00:51:07,402
I am here to help this village,

610
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:09,502
not to steal and take.

611
00:51:12,442 --> 00:51:16,072
Do not make me a thief.

612
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:21,511
- We will keep that in mind. - We will keep that in mind.

613
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:28,092
Here. It is for the fish I took the other day.

614
00:51:28,092 --> 00:51:30,192
Oh, goodness.

615
00:51:30,192 --> 00:51:32,561
Thank you so much.

616
00:51:38,561 --> 00:51:40,002
Thank you, master.

617
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:41,701
Thank you.

618
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:47,101
I would like us to change this part.

619
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:48,411
The difference between taking his family and not...

620
00:51:48,411 --> 00:51:50,511
when a local governor is appointed to a village.

621
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:52,282
No, before the appointment,

622
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:55,112
the recommendation process must be done thoroughly.

623
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,681
If a recommended person commits injustice,

624
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:58,782
his recommender must be punished with him.

625
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,552
What about those who become corrupt later on?

626
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:03,991
If not certain, one must not make a recommendation.

627
00:52:05,261 --> 00:52:07,161
Forget that.

628
00:52:07,732 --> 00:52:09,791
All right. Whether officials or the royalty,

629
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:11,502
whoever commits a crime should be the same criminal.

630
00:52:11,502 --> 00:52:15,101
Is it not unfair to decide on a sentence based on status?

631
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:16,632
Without that much privilege,

632
00:52:16,632 --> 00:52:18,942
no one would devote themselves to the nation.

633
00:52:19,502 --> 00:52:22,212
But they probably have a lot of rake-offs other than that.

634
00:52:22,212 --> 00:52:23,811
Rake-offs?

635
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:26,681
You are a governor now.

636
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:28,811
Refrain from using imprudent words.

637
00:52:28,882 --> 00:52:30,181
- Imprudent? - Imprudent.

638
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:31,621
Did you just call me imprudent?

639
00:52:31,621 --> 00:52:34,621
- Imprudent. - Again?

640
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:36,291
- Imprudent? - I can say that countless times.

641
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:37,291
- Imprudent. - How could you?

642
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:38,391
Look.

643
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:41,132
Just when will you stop?

644
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:44,362
I called you over to review the materials...

645
00:52:44,362 --> 00:52:46,302
sent from Gamgyochung, and what...

646
00:52:46,302 --> 00:52:48,272
(A temporary organization made to revise "Grand National Code")

647
00:52:49,201 --> 00:52:51,541
So Your Majesty, why do you not...

648
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:54,072
just send Governor Kang back to Cheongsan?

649
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,112
Not a chance.

650
00:53:02,152 --> 00:53:03,652
I am not going anywhere...

651
00:53:03,652 --> 00:53:05,982
leaving this important business to the two of you...

652
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,052
born with power and privilege.

653
00:53:07,382 --> 00:53:08,891
I will make sure...

654
00:53:08,891 --> 00:53:11,092
to reflect the people's voices on this revised version.

655
00:53:14,632 --> 00:53:17,962
You keep saying that I was born with privilege,

656
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:20,201
but it is prejudiced to think I would not understand the people...

657
00:53:20,201 --> 00:53:21,601
just because I was born in a cradle of gold.

658
00:53:21,672 --> 00:53:22,701
He is right.

659
00:53:25,772 --> 00:53:26,902
Gosh.

660
00:53:27,442 --> 00:53:28,971
Like draws like.

661
00:53:28,971 --> 00:53:30,411
Peas in a pod.

662
00:53:30,411 --> 00:53:33,612
I see you two haves get along pretty well.

663
00:53:37,652 --> 00:53:40,181
I apologize.

664
00:53:56,931 --> 00:53:58,601
(Yisan, Cheongsan)

665
00:53:58,601 --> 00:54:00,141
I hear in Yisan, the neighbouring village,

666
00:54:00,141 --> 00:54:03,072
a competent and popular attorney lives.

667
00:54:04,011 --> 00:54:05,641
Try visiting him if you have time.

668
00:54:06,141 --> 00:54:07,241
An attorney...

669
00:54:30,371 --> 00:54:31,471
Gosh.

670
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:35,411
(I make your wish come true.)

671
00:54:37,811 --> 00:54:39,081
This brings back old memories.

672
00:54:43,552 --> 00:54:46,552
(Lee So Won)

673
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:54,991
If you are wronged or resentful, just let me know.

674
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,331
I will make you win your trial.

675
00:54:56,331 --> 00:54:58,862
If you are wronged or resentful, just let me know.

676
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,331
I will make you win your trial.

677
00:55:01,201 --> 00:55:03,672
If you are wronged or resentful, just let me know.

678
00:55:03,672 --> 00:55:05,141
- I will make you win your trial. - No, thanks.

679
00:55:05,442 --> 00:55:08,442
If you are wronged or resentful, just let me know.

680
00:55:08,442 --> 00:55:10,342
I will make you win your trial.

681
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:12,641
Who in the world...

682
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:35,471
What is with you?

683
00:55:42,011 --> 00:55:43,272
What are you doing?

684
00:55:44,411 --> 00:55:46,041
You were alive, so why...

685
00:56:07,232 --> 00:56:08,572
I missed you...

686
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:11,902
so much.

687
00:56:15,741 --> 00:56:18,942
I missed you to death.

688
00:56:37,692 --> 00:56:38,802
Me too.

689
00:57:09,891 --> 00:57:12,302
This is how you make a match, Your Majesty.

690
00:57:14,971 --> 00:57:16,272
I appreciate the lesson.

691
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:29,451
Let me see.

692
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:31,681
Are you all better now?

693
00:57:32,451 --> 00:57:33,482
Almost.

694
00:57:33,482 --> 00:57:35,652
Just why were you in hiding for years?

695
00:57:36,752 --> 00:57:39,121
- The thing is... - When did you become an attorney?

696
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:41,862
Oh, that is...

697
00:57:42,061 --> 00:57:44,601
Do you even know how much I spent on looking for you?

698
00:57:44,601 --> 00:57:46,161
No, that is not the issue here.

699
00:57:46,462 --> 00:57:49,072
I can draw your face even with my eyes closed.

700
00:57:50,371 --> 00:57:51,672
I mean, honestly speaking,

701
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:54,371
you could have sent me a letter, at least.

702
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:57,641
- That is... - Do not tell me...

703
00:57:59,581 --> 00:58:01,882
- you got another man. - What?

704
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:04,252
For whose sake did you become so much prettier?

705
00:58:04,252 --> 00:58:07,282
Gosh, enough with the questions.

706
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:10,391
- What? - I mean,

707
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:12,362
that is not important right now.

708
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:15,592
Then,

709
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:17,791
what is?

710
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:47,022
We can save...

711
00:58:50,692 --> 00:58:52,802
that kind of conversation for later.

712
00:59:01,072 --> 00:59:02,072
You think?

713
00:59:33,971 --> 00:59:35,672
I did not want to be a burden.

714
00:59:37,272 --> 00:59:38,942
I did not think I could be part...

715
00:59:40,282 --> 00:59:42,252
of the life you dreamed of.

716
00:59:44,311 --> 00:59:46,752
I will always choose you.

717
00:59:47,382 --> 00:59:49,752
You are my dream and life itself.

718
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:52,121
So...

719
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:55,192
do not ever think like that...

720
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:57,491
and stay next to me.

721
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:37,232
I am sorry, Lady Hong.

722
01:00:38,442 --> 01:00:39,701
About what?

723
01:00:40,672 --> 01:00:41,741
I...

724
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:46,541
want to stay next to you,

725
01:00:48,181 --> 01:00:50,152
but after what happened with So Won,

726
01:00:50,882 --> 01:00:53,922
Han Soo is left...

727
01:00:54,552 --> 01:00:57,752
with no one but me.

728
01:00:57,752 --> 01:00:59,022
That is true.

729
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:02,192
Only if So Won were with us,

730
01:01:02,991 --> 01:01:04,462
I would have ditched...

731
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:07,561
that rude rascal...

732
01:01:08,632 --> 01:01:11,172
and stayed next to you...

733
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:13,802
for the rest of my life.

734

735
01:01:24,482 --> 01:01:25,851
You will...

736
01:01:26,422 --> 01:01:29,522
get to stay with me for the rest of your life one day.

737
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:33,061
When?

738
01:01:34,561 --> 01:01:35,831
Someday.

739
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,661
After I die?

740
01:01:41,132 --> 01:01:42,471
In the afterlife?

741
01:01:43,101 --> 01:01:44,272
No.

742
01:01:44,532 --> 01:01:45,802
In this life.

743
01:01:46,701 --> 01:01:47,971
In this life?

744
01:01:53,081 --> 01:01:54,681

Yes, what about the Princess?

Goodness.

749
01:02:47,402 --> 01:02:50,732
Why did they drink when they cannot even handle alcohol?

750
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:53,041
Gosh.

751
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:00,442
How ridiculous.

752
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:03,382
Unbelievable.

753
01:03:04,382 --> 01:03:05,681
When will I clean up all these?

What is Article Five of Sowongak Hospitality Rules?

757
01:04:22,962 --> 01:04:24,692
Keep the promise you made with the guest at all costs.

758
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:27,261
Pass.

Your nails.

how will you handle it?

763
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,282
I will follow and catch them.

764
01:04:40,112 --> 01:04:42,782
And I will pack extra serving and give them.

765
01:04:43,382 --> 01:04:44,882
So they can share it with their family.

766
01:04:46,882 --> 01:04:47,951

can be the moon of a dark night...
