(Characters, incidents, and period depicted are purely fictional.)

2
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:07,881
You will fire me? Are you out of your mind?

3
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,381
No, my mind is clearer than ever.

4
00:00:09,382 --> 00:00:12,323
Do you think there is anybody else who can put an end to this matter?

5
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:15,392
Fine, even if you find someone, it will take a long time,

6
00:00:15,393 --> 00:00:17,393
and the lady will suffer in that while.

7
00:00:17,522 --> 00:00:19,791
Do not pretend like you are worried about her.

8
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,533
Is that your idea of an alternative?

9
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:24,092
Even if she wins against Commissioner Park,

10
00:00:24,093 --> 00:00:26,201
how can she feel truly happy and relieved?

11
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:28,333
And what if you fail even after taking things that far?

12
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:29,771
I will not fail.

13
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:32,742
Just because it worked once, it does not mean it will work twice.

14
00:00:33,403 --> 00:00:34,742
At the very least,

15
00:00:34,943 --> 00:00:37,672
I am the type of a person who believes justice will prevail.

16
00:00:39,443 --> 00:00:41,583
In other words, we will do this the lawful way.

17
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:43,913
I will find the witnesses and evidence we need...

18
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,452
and prove Lady Yeon's innocence.

19
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:48,892
In your dreams.

20
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:52,623
Now.

21
00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:54,891
In this system called marriage,

22
00:00:54,892 --> 00:00:56,962
the responsibilities and duties of a husband and a wife...

23
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:58,432
already come in a lopsided manner.

24
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,762
A man may abandon his wife,

25
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:01,331
but a woman may not abandon her husband.

26
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:02,531
A man may report his wife,

27
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:04,132
but a woman may not report her husband.

28
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,641
The law of this kingdom says...

29
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:07,142
there is a bad wife but never a bad husband.

30
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:09,272
The field is already unlevel.

31
00:01:09,273 --> 00:01:10,812
What now? The lawful way?

32
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:15,153
Okay, then. Good luck.

33
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:17,682
If you successfully save Lady Yeon by your way,

34
00:01:17,683 --> 00:01:20,123
that is the day I will honour you as my master.

35
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:23,251
Do you mean that?

36
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:24,522
Promise me.

37
00:01:24,523 --> 00:01:25,593
I do.

38
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:27,392
Let me see.

39
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:29,392
Here is my promise.

40
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:33,002
What was that?

41
00:01:33,202 --> 00:01:34,332
A promise.

42
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:43,573
Okay, then. Find out what you can.

43
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:45,512
In order to win a divorce suit,

44
00:01:45,513 --> 00:01:47,441
you need to know everything about Commissioner Park.

45
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:48,712
What are his drunken habits?

46
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:51,421
Does he snore or grind his teeth in sleep?

47
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:54,652
You need to reveal every shade of his true colour!

48
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:56,492
And you are going to do that alone?

49
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:57,963
Without me? All by yourself?

50
00:01:58,023 --> 00:01:59,562
Can you really do it?

51
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:07,101
But if you divorce him,

52
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:10,403
you will be able to keep your inheritance.

53
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:15,041
Your husband is after this fortune,

54
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:16,672
so you must stop him from seizing it...

55
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:18,743
to take good revenge on him.

56
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:21,713
(Land Deed, House Deed)

57
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:24,482
All good.

58
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:27,522
You have to risk one of your legs, at least,

59
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,453
in order to win this trial.

60
00:02:30,453 --> 00:02:32,363
Standard tactics.

61
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:36,131
I will reveal the fact that he framed Lady Yeon,

62
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:38,833
make him pay the price, and get her the divorce she wants.

I am going to go look for a new attorney.

69
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,032
There is something I need you to do while I do that.

70
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,602
Your wish is my command.

71
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:18,143
In order to win a divorce suit,

72
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:21,811
we must find out who Commissioner Park really is...

73
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:23,713
and what he did to Lady Yeon.

74
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:25,881
You need to know everything about Commissioner Park.

75
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:27,811
What are his drunken habits?

76
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:30,352
Does he snore or grind his teeth in sleep?

77
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:33,623
You need to reveal every shade of his true colour!

78
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:37,523
I hear it is important to reveal every detail of who he really is.

79
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:39,993
You heard this?

80
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:44,662
I mean, it is important, right?

81
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:47,062
- It is. - Yes.

82
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:48,403
- Yes. - It is important.

83
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,532
Here is the thing.

84
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:54,342
Yoon, keep your eyes on everything that he does...

85
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:56,512
and find every smallest fault you can.

86
00:03:57,942 --> 00:03:59,941
Meet with everyone who is involved with him,

87
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:02,452
and nitpick over everything, everything they own...

88
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:03,683
and use in everyday life.

89
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:21,703
Lady Hong, find people who will testify for Lady Yeon...

90
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:23,971
and receive petitions to let her live.

91
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,272
(Petition: A document signed by two or more people)

92
00:04:25,273 --> 00:04:27,101
Lady Baek, make sure Lady Yeon does not lose her energy.

93
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:29,042
Bring her food every meal to revitalize her.

94
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:32,112
Lady Yeon, you must eat well and keep up your energy.

95
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:41,622
You told her everything she needed to do.

96
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:43,323
She will manage without you.

97
00:04:43,922 --> 00:04:45,492
Never. Impossible.

98
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:47,991
I gave her a hint,

99
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:50,193
so she will manage to imitate my ways.

100
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,503
But that is it.

101
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,402
One day, she will come back for me,

102
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:57,003
and she will realize my way was the right way.

103
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:00,003
You are right.

104
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:02,312
There is no other attorney who would be up for this job.

105
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:03,513
Of course.

106
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:05,682
The world is not such an easy place.

107
00:05:07,213 --> 00:05:09,152
Whoa.

108
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:10,282
(Wolharu)

109
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:15,153
Why are we here?

110
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,153
The trial will resume,

111
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:19,662
so I must find a weapon too.

112
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:21,932
Tie it down and follow me.

113
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:25,362
All right. I need to find a tavern.

114
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:28,372
So how is everything going?

115
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:29,902
Well,

116
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:32,541
I did accuse her of committing 1 of the 7 bad behaviours.

117
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:33,942
But that brazen woman...

118
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:37,343
turned in a request for divorce to Hanseongbu.

119
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,942
But I have enough time to dissolve my assets,

120
00:05:39,943 --> 00:05:42,282
so do not worry about me.

121
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:44,782
You must win the trial as well.

122
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:49,193
Executive Minister Yoo cannot find out about your trickery,

123
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:52,063
so I will find a good attorney for you.

124
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:54,792
Are you there?

125
00:05:54,862 --> 00:05:55,963
Yes.

126
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:02,633
Let him tail your wife.

127
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:04,232

By any chance, do you take divorce suits?

134
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,922
A divorce suit? No way!

135
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,462
By any chance,

136
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:33,902
do you take divorce suits?

137
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:35,372
No, find someone else.

138
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:38,741
Excuse me, attorneys. Do you take divorce suits?

139
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:40,502
- Goodness, that is nonsense. - That is impossible.

140
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:42,143
No, find someone else.

141

(Hanseongbu)

142
00:06:58,422 --> 00:07:00,422
You need to give up now.

143
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:04,862
I am already on Commissioner Park's side.

144
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:07,802
What is so good about siding with him?

145
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:11,403
He is a man who can kick out his wife of 20 years.

146
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:13,842
That depends on who the woman is.

147
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:15,242
I am different.

148
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:17,073
That is not going to happen to me.

149
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:21,213
Are you completely certain?

150
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:26,383
Let me bring you some food.

151
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:31,153
I do not need food. Myung Wol.

152
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:32,992
Myung Wol!

153
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,492
How many times has it been?

154
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:39,063
Why does she keep coming in and going out?

155
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:41,232
It looks like...

156
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,903
her mind is somewhere else.

157
00:07:47,203 --> 00:07:48,342
My lord.

158
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,773
Did I keep you waiting?

159
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:55,112
I am a little late.

160
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:58,852
Let me pour you a drink.

161
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,292
I can smell something.

162
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:09,362
It smells fishy.

163
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:12,661
This familiar...

164
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:14,703
yet strange smell.

165
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:22,773
I do not know about the smell,

166
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:24,443
but I can hear the sound.

167
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,443
That sweet...

168
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:29,152
yet vigorous laughter.

169
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:31,112
This is...

170
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:35,522
Myung Wol received two guests at once!

171
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:37,651
Two guests at once?

172
00:08:37,652 --> 00:08:40,793
I even paid you twice as much today!

173
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:44,862
What are you going to do?

174
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:46,632
Myung Wol, how dare you?

175
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:49,002
There are ethics you must keep even at a courtesan house!

176
00:08:49,173 --> 00:08:51,843
There are! There...

177
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,713
Where are your manners?

178
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:05,323
I cannot believe you did this.

179
00:09:12,522 --> 00:09:14,423
Hey, not so bad.

180
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:17,132
And you look awful.

181
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,033
Are you two...

182
00:09:20,402 --> 00:09:21,972
acquainted?

183
00:09:22,372 --> 00:09:23,703
- No way. - Not at all.

184
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:36,982
You are a woman.

185
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:40,452
I am sorry.

186
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:42,852
I had no other choice in order to come in.

187
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:44,693
Well, I do not mind.

188
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:47,423
Because what matters more than the gender is...

189
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:50,963
the gesture.

190
00:09:54,663 --> 00:09:55,902
Then, Myung Wol,

191
00:09:57,703 --> 00:09:59,372
will you accept my gesture of goodwill?

192
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:02,072
Thinking about you becoming Commissioner Park's concubine...

193
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:05,082
genuinely makes my heart break,

194
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,943
yet I will wish you happiness.

195
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:11,612
This is a gift.

196
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:16,522
- A gift? - Yes.

197
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:20,293
Live a happy life.

198
00:10:20,992 --> 00:10:22,762
You will have to excuse me.

199
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:37,242
And this is my gift.

200
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:02,732
Impressive.

201
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:05,172
You saw through Myung Wol...

202
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:06,672
and realized that she was a key witness.

203
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:10,112
Gosh. Did you think I was so stupid that I could not see through that?

204
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:12,783
So, did you convince her?

205
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:14,242
I am in the process.

206
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:17,611
If Myung Wol changes her mind,

207
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:19,252
it must be because of me.

208
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:23,352
So, how about you hire me back?

209
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,892
I have already found a new attorney.

210
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:32,632
What?

211
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:36,303
No way. That cannot be true.

212
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:38,842
I have been in a fix as no attorney would...

213
00:11:38,843 --> 00:11:40,543
take my case.

214
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:43,413
Thank you for willingly accepting my offer.

215
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:47,242
It is an attorney's job to stand with the weak.

216
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:50,481
These are petitions from Lady Yeon's friends and neighbours...

217
00:11:50,482 --> 00:11:52,323
vouching for her good behaviour.

218
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,923
You must have gone through a lot. Let me see.

219
00:11:56,022 --> 00:11:57,751
These are Commissioner Park's recent whereabouts...

220
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:59,093
and courtesan house records.

221
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:01,391
There are also anonymous testimonies...

222
00:12:01,392 --> 00:12:03,033
from those who cannot testify in the court.

223
00:12:08,203 --> 00:12:10,772
What is so entertaining to look at?

224
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:14,101
I am watching a foolish attorney who plans to file a lawsuit...

225
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:16,272
against a noble family.

226
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:27,752
My lord, I have brought him.

227
00:12:35,392 --> 00:12:36,832
Let me introduce myself for the first time.

228
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,063
My name is Kang Han Soo.

229
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:40,232
"For the first time?"

230
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:43,073
Are you certain about that?

231
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:47,902
Where will the like of myself meet a commissioner?

232
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:55,282
Be honest.

233
00:12:55,283 --> 00:12:58,683
Against whom do Commissioner Park and Master Jang hold grudges?

234
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:01,583
They have been suspecting me all along.

235
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:03,892
That means...

236
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:06,093
this is a trap.

237
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:07,793
Take a seat.

238
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:09,663
And drink.

239
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,703
Sure.

240
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:24,573
A few days ago,

241
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:27,083
someone disguised himself...

242
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:34,323
and snuck into the banquet that I planned.

243
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:47,463
I apologize, my lord.

244
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:50,232
To be truthful,

245
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:54,802
I was going to defend Lady Yeon in her divorce suit.

246
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:57,772
Hence, I snuck into it trying to find fault with...

247
00:13:57,872 --> 00:14:00,213
But not anymore. I have quit.

248
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,852
I would not dare to get on a commissioner's bad side.

249
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:11,652
I see. I knew it.

250
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,933
Then, you must know...

251
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:22,573
how to win this lawsuit.

252
00:14:23,073 --> 00:14:24,173
I would like to win.

253
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:27,703
Tell me.

254
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:30,012
If you were my attorney,

255
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:31,813
what advice would you give me?

256
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:40,651
For free?

257
00:14:40,652 --> 00:14:42,122
How dare you?

258
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:47,293
Look at this guy.

259
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:49,563
Or...

260
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:53,361
I can tell you a few key tips...

261
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:54,632
and charge you...

262
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:57,602
free booze for legal advice.

263
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,042
Had our family not had a legal servant in charge,

264
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:01,803
I would have hired you.

265
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:06,012
So, tell me.

266
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:08,213
The value of your advice...

267
00:15:08,343 --> 00:15:11,053
will decide the quality of your drinks and snacks.

268
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:16,351
You must adhere to your original position...

269
00:15:16,352 --> 00:15:19,722
and clearly prove that it is her fault.

270
00:15:20,892 --> 00:15:22,332
If you could get your friends...

271
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,592
to honestly testify what they had seen...

272
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:27,731
from your relationship without any omissions...

273
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:30,303
No. That will not happen.

274
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:32,673
I agree with you.

275
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:36,142
Lady Yeon is too elegant.

276
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:39,943
Okay. Then...

277
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:43,953
Well, you need to tell me.

278
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:45,923
Me?

279
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:49,392
- Drink up! - Drink up.

280
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:53,662
Pour out your hearts and tell me about your wives...

281
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:55,793
in the worst way possible.

282
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:59,232
This country is doomed.

283
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:02,401
The noblemen who have the most important positions...

284
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:03,871
in the government...

285
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:05,442
are renting the whole courtesan house...

286
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:07,073
and drinking in the afternoon.

287
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,913
- All right. - Drink.

288
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:18,452
All right, my lords. Do you have any intenser stories?

289
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:20,582
These are not good enough.

290
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,851
Let me tell you a story.

291
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:24,922
I can confidently tell you...

292
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:27,563
that my wife is not human. She is made of stones.

293
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:29,693
It is like I live in a mason's workshop.

294
00:16:30,362 --> 00:16:33,602
She has no tolerance whatsoever,

295
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,532
so I naturally find peace at this courtesan house.

296
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:39,241
- That is true. - I hear you.

297
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:41,573
At least, stones do not spend money.

298
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:45,142
I do not even know what my wife is buying so much.

299
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,712
I am the one who makes money,

300
00:16:47,713 --> 00:16:49,083
and she is the one who spends it.

301
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:51,713
Listen, guys.

302
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,381
- My wife is paranoid. - What?

303
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,351
Not to mention...

304
00:16:57,352 --> 00:16:59,461
the endless, nitpicking questions,

305
00:16:59,462 --> 00:17:00,992
she even put a tail on me.

306
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:02,732
- Oh, boy. - Goodness.

307
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:04,092
She is the worst.

308
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:05,931
That is why you look so tense.

309
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:07,902
Tell me about it!

310
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:09,833
What do you think, Attorney Kang?

311
00:17:16,473 --> 00:17:17,872
That is better.

312
00:17:18,142 --> 00:17:21,583
All the stories that you have said here...

313
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:23,451
are not your stories anymore.

314
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:24,982
Those are what you have seen, heard, and experienced...

315
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:26,752
with Lady Yeon.

316
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:30,092
Go straight to the government office and tell those stories.

317
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:31,192
Are we clear?

318
00:17:40,063 --> 00:17:43,273
There are many paths in one's life.

319
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:46,102
Only the heart has closed doors.

320
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:49,942
Please be more direct.

321
00:17:56,753 --> 00:17:57,983
Open it.

322
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:08,462
This is...

323
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,962
Yes. The right of operation for a cosmetics store.

324
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:14,602
I hear your cosmetic products...

325
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:16,932
are quite popular among women.

326
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:21,503
What do you think about running your own cosmetics store?

327
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:30,513
What...

328
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,723
do you want from me?

329
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:36,593
Side with Lady Yeon, who has been framed...

330
00:18:37,223 --> 00:18:39,823
for causing a divorce and imprisoned.

331
00:18:41,063 --> 00:18:42,833
You can testify in court about what you have seen and heard...

332
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:44,632
at Commissioner Park's house.

333
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:55,611
I bought and gifted him a pile of yakgwa...

334
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:58,842
he was always craving.

335
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:01,412
When they cleaned his corpse, his face was...

336
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,652
as bright as flowers.

337
00:19:09,352 --> 00:19:10,692
That scumbag.

338
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:14,062
(Wolharu)

339
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:16,332
- My lord! - Welcome!

340
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,833
- More alcohol. - Bring more liquor.

341
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:20,432
- All right. - Bring more liquor.

342
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:24,632
I will bring you a new bottle.

343
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:27,003
Wait here.

344
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:41,523
Well...

345
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:44,253
The thing is...

346
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:54,402
Just what were you doing here?

347
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:57,302
At first, it was Myung Wol.

348
00:19:57,303 --> 00:19:59,342
This time, you were with Commissioner Park.

349
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:00,401
Well...

350
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:03,073
Do not tell me you jumped on his wagon after I fired you.

351
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:06,043
- The thing is... - You could not be...

352
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:10,483
telling him a winning strategy for the lawsuit, right?

353
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:21,293
I trusted you, nevertheless.

354
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:24,833
You acted like you were threatening or cajoling me,

355
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:27,461
but you gave me words about what I should do...

356
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:30,233
to save Lady Yeon, and I was grateful.

357
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:33,243
I thought you were trying to help me at least that way...

358
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:36,172
out of good intentions.

359
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:38,472
I meant it, and it has not changed. What I do is...

360
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:40,482
- all for you. - Yet your behaviour says otherwise.

361
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:41,612
That is...

362
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:47,782
The bigger and worse your obstacle is,

363
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:49,892
the more you will improve.

364
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:57,293
I guess...

365
00:20:58,493 --> 00:21:01,033
you do not understand the meaning of good intentions.

366
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:11,612
It was foolish of me to expect from you.

367
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,223
I hate doing this too.

368
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:22,922
You are getting me all wrong!

369
00:21:33,303 --> 00:21:34,462
I am sorry.

370
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:52,312
How did it go with Myung Wol?

371
00:21:52,313 --> 00:21:54,152
She agreed. Follow me, please.

372
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:01,962
You people are such poor drinkers.

373
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,932
Goodness.

374
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:07,632
Where have you been?

375
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:08,862
Come here.

376
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:10,732
- Let me pour you a drink. - Sure.

377
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:11,773
Here.

378
00:22:12,073 --> 00:22:13,171
Commissioner Park.

379
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:15,402
That bottle is empty. Pour this for me.

380
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:18,743
It is the best-selling liquor in Wolharu.

381
00:22:18,942 --> 00:22:21,612
Try smelling it.

382
00:22:28,823 --> 00:22:32,492
It smells like my Myung Wol.

383
00:22:32,493 --> 00:22:33,962
Oh, Myung Wol?

384
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:37,563
I miss her.

385
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,161
Go get her.

386
00:22:39,162 --> 00:22:40,763
Sure thing.

387
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:43,503
That is not difficult,

388
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:47,473
but are you sure she is trustworthy?

389
00:22:49,043 --> 00:22:50,142
How dare you!

390
00:22:52,743 --> 00:22:54,313
What do you mean by that?

391
00:22:54,813 --> 00:22:56,352
Well, the thing is...

392
00:22:57,952 --> 00:23:01,283
I saw her with your wife's attorney in secret.

393
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:05,752
What?

394
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:07,262
That is not all.

395
00:23:07,263 --> 00:23:08,992
She even took the bribe...

396
00:23:08,993 --> 00:23:10,992
I gave your wife when I was still her attorney.

397
00:23:10,993 --> 00:23:12,763
Myung Wol, this wench...

398
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:16,473
Commissioner Park?

399
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:17,871
- Commissioner Park! - Myung Wol!

400
00:23:17,872 --> 00:23:19,273
Commissioner Park!

401
00:23:19,543 --> 00:23:20,942
Commissioner Park!

402
00:23:21,043 --> 00:23:22,303
Commissioner Park!

403
00:23:28,983 --> 00:23:31,583
How dare you attempt to betray me?

404
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:33,922
Commissioner Park.

405
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:35,823
What are you talking about?

406
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:38,892
Then how will you explain this?

407
00:23:44,763 --> 00:23:45,962
It is a misunderstanding.

408
00:23:46,632 --> 00:23:47,661
Please hear me out.

409
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:51,672
I know you are in league...

410
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:54,702
with my wife's attorneys!

411
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,442
Gosh.

412
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,783
You heard why he is so mad.

413
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:04,651
If he spots us, things will get worse.

414
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,723
Still, I cannot just sit back.

415
00:24:07,622 --> 00:24:08,783
Oh, gosh.

416
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:14,622
You little...

417
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:18,432
Die.

418
00:24:28,473 --> 00:24:30,513
You despicable witch.

419
00:24:30,912 --> 00:24:32,742
I gave in to your whims,

420
00:24:32,743 --> 00:24:34,783
and you forgot your place.

421
00:25:05,073 --> 00:25:06,182
Is...

422
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:08,212
Is she dead?

423
00:25:08,682 --> 00:25:10,712
- I need to take her to a physician. - No.

424
00:25:11,813 --> 00:25:12,952
Just...

425
00:25:13,422 --> 00:25:14,652
leave her to die...

426
00:25:14,823 --> 00:25:16,122
so she will be silenced forever.

427
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:17,952
- But... - She killed herself.

428
00:25:19,593 --> 00:25:20,793
I will make it look like that.

429
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:23,632
I will make it look like that.

430
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:37,912
How so?

431
00:25:39,073 --> 00:25:40,382
It is simple.

432
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,952
Hang her with a silken cloth.

433
00:25:44,983 --> 00:25:46,553
Bribe a solicitor at the government office.

434
00:25:51,192 --> 00:25:53,662
Why can you not get it done alone?

435
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:04,402
There.

436
00:26:09,073 --> 00:26:13,083
And a few coins to a medical examiner too.

437
00:26:22,553 --> 00:26:23,793
Han Soo!

438
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:26,023
Let us hurry.

439
00:26:41,073 --> 00:26:42,372
What happened?

440
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:44,343
She needs to be taken to a physician.

441
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:46,912
- But... - Commissioner Park?

442
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:50,382
You look dreadful.

443
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:53,283
It is as if you saw a ghost.

444
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:57,152
Commissioner Park!

445
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:11,473
She killed herself.

446
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:14,843
I will make it look like that.

447
00:27:16,212 --> 00:27:17,612
I will make it look like that.

448
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,563
Master Cho?

449
00:27:40,462 --> 00:27:41,632
How is Myung Wol?

450
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,003
She is hopeless.

451
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:51,172
She may not be able to get through the night.

452
00:27:51,573 --> 00:27:53,783
Are you saying she could die?

453
00:27:56,912 --> 00:27:58,252
Just how...

454
00:27:58,253 --> 00:28:01,583
could a man like him live with power thus far?

455
00:28:01,823 --> 00:28:03,451
This must not be tolerated.

456
00:28:03,452 --> 00:28:04,992
Before he victimizes more,

457
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:06,891
we must make him pay the price.

458
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:08,023
So you...

459
00:28:17,702 --> 00:28:19,803
Maybe he got scared and ran off.

460
00:28:28,712 --> 00:28:30,513
(Sowongak)

461
00:28:33,382 --> 00:28:34,553
Sir!

462
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:50,003
He is gone.

463
00:28:51,632 --> 00:28:53,043
He disappeared with everything.

464
00:29:01,313 --> 00:29:03,182
Please help me, my lord.

465
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,182
I have...

466
00:29:05,712 --> 00:29:08,121
the evidence to prove my seven years of dedication...

467
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:09,283
to you and Hungu...

468
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,822
right here.

469
00:29:10,823 --> 00:29:13,493
You must not abandon me!

470
00:29:15,323 --> 00:29:16,462
Executive Minister Yoo.

471
00:29:16,662 --> 00:29:18,162
Attorney Kim is here.

472
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:26,003
I brought the evidence collected by the other side.

473
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:29,073
They must be stupefied by now.

474
00:29:29,243 --> 00:29:30,442
Good job.

475
00:29:30,612 --> 00:29:32,843
Go and enjoy travelling for about a month.

476
00:29:33,712 --> 00:29:34,942
Thank you, my lord.

477
00:29:41,652 --> 00:29:44,753
You must have forgotten that the executive minister...

478
00:29:44,892 --> 00:29:47,823
has been doing his best to help you physically and spiritually.

479
00:30:08,283 --> 00:30:11,682
Nothing will happen as long as you come to your senses...

480
00:30:12,753 --> 00:30:14,283
and close the lawsuit well.

481
00:30:15,452 --> 00:30:16,823
My apologies.

482
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:20,763
I must have lost it for a moment.

483
00:30:27,632 --> 00:30:29,563
Never will I forget your kindness!

484
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:31,733
Executive Minister Yoo!

485
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:35,402
Due to my useless expectation,

486
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:40,083
an innocent woman's life was cut short.

487
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:43,412
Attorney Kang was right.

488
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:46,382
It is my fault.

489
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:49,323
I was too dense.

490
00:30:51,993 --> 00:30:53,992
You have to risk one of your legs, at least,

491
00:30:53,993 --> 00:30:55,823
in order to win this trial.

492
00:30:58,932 --> 00:31:00,702
What is more, I was being stubborn.

493
00:31:01,763 --> 00:31:02,803
My lady?

494
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:04,872
My lady! No, please!

495
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,672
No, my lady!

496
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:12,672
I will bring back Attorney Kang one way or another.

497
00:31:13,243 --> 00:31:15,043
There must be another way.

498
00:31:15,243 --> 00:31:16,313
No, do not do it!

499
00:31:19,013 --> 00:31:20,023
Please stop.

500
00:31:21,523 --> 00:31:23,253
Please wait a little longer.

501
00:31:24,922 --> 00:31:26,093
I beg you.

502
00:31:48,013 --> 00:31:49,983
I thought you were too cynical about the world...

503
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:52,652
and awfully twisted inside.

504
00:31:54,753 --> 00:31:56,152
But now I know.

505
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:04,733
It was the world that was twisted. You were looking at it accurately.

506
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:10,432
So Kang Han Soo,

507
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,402
please.

508
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,072
What is going on?

509
00:32:44,073 --> 00:32:46,202
Why am I here? Just why?

510
00:32:51,912 --> 00:32:53,483
Here it goes again.

511
00:32:54,243 --> 00:32:57,412
Are you going to tell me this incident is also a coincidence?

512
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:01,382
Wait, Master Cho!

513
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:07,121
I do not know what plot you have in mind,

514
00:33:07,122 --> 00:33:09,563
but I can no longer let you do as you please.

515
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:13,563
Be good and stay here until the day of the lawsuit.

516
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:19,672
Darn it. This is driving me crazy.

517
00:33:20,642 --> 00:33:23,102
Was I not the one who helped him become the master?

518
00:33:30,053 --> 00:33:31,451
You must not know me well enough.

519
00:33:31,452 --> 00:33:34,723
Did you think I would not be able to escape if left alone?

520
00:33:35,483 --> 00:33:38,351
I cannot do anything alone or what? I can surely...

521
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:39,993
Dong Chi!

522
00:33:40,763 --> 00:33:43,661
Dong Chi!

523
00:33:43,662 --> 00:33:46,803
(Clinic)

524
00:33:51,303 --> 00:33:52,632
Please go to paradise.

525
00:34:10,823 --> 00:34:12,722
(Come back, Kang Han Soo. I am sorry.)

526
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:15,192
(Come back, Kang Han Soo. I am sorry.)

527
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:18,332
Come back, Kang Han Soo.

528
00:34:19,263 --> 00:34:20,562
I am sorry.

529
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:25,073
Please help me!

530
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:26,803
Over here!

531
00:34:28,272 --> 00:34:30,343
I am right here!

532
00:34:30,913 --> 00:34:33,612
I, Kang Han Soo, am here!

533
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:35,612
Help me!

534
00:34:39,252 --> 00:34:40,353
Darn it!

535
00:34:40,652 --> 00:34:43,723
I cannot burn this ship down, can I?

536
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:53,163
Please help me!

537
00:34:56,232 --> 00:34:58,033
We do not know how far he has gone.

538
00:34:58,803 --> 00:35:00,541
Will he be able to see those?

539
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:02,441
Thanks to the wind blowing toward the river,

540
00:35:02,442 --> 00:35:03,612
they are travelling well.

541
00:35:06,683 --> 00:35:08,282
Since the lanterns are blowing away fast,

542
00:35:08,283 --> 00:35:10,312
the ship must have too. Right?

543
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:14,882
It will take much longer...

544
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:17,453
for Attorney Kang to return.

545
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:25,832
Whatever. If I die, it is them that will suffer a loss.

546
00:35:26,603 --> 00:35:29,232
Yes. Let them try to live happily...

547
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:32,573
by themselves without me.

548
00:35:36,473 --> 00:35:37,473
The lawsuit?

549
00:35:38,812 --> 00:35:40,312
Who cares about the lawsuit?

550
00:35:40,982 --> 00:35:44,252
The new attorney they hired will take care of it well.

551
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:51,522
Though he will be nowhere near as good as me.

552
00:35:57,962 --> 00:35:59,263
I am exhausted.

553
00:36:03,132 --> 00:36:04,402
I will not do it.

554
00:36:05,103 --> 00:36:06,303
I will not return.

555
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,252
What are those?

556
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:34,732
Gosh. Good grief.

557
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:19,843
So what is it that you wanted to tell me so urgently?

558
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:21,782
I want to ask...

559
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:24,913
why you are concerned with a mere divorce lawsuit, Father.

560
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:29,422
The content of the lawsuit has nothing to do with it.

561
00:37:30,522 --> 00:37:32,323
You could say that...

562
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:34,993
one of my people involved in it is the problem.

563
00:37:35,723 --> 00:37:37,361
Are you saying you will cover up...

564
00:37:37,362 --> 00:37:39,462
his sin simply because he is your junior?

565
00:37:40,603 --> 00:37:43,062
I only showed some kindness to the man...

566
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:45,832
who has served me loyally until now.

567
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:48,502
The final ruling is up to you.

568
00:37:49,243 --> 00:37:51,172
Father, you committed a foul.

569
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:54,381
Commissioner Park's wife will have to fight...

570
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:55,783
an unfair lawsuit from the start.

571
00:37:56,112 --> 00:37:57,982
Anyone can guess what the outcome will be.

572
00:37:59,513 --> 00:38:02,552
There is nothing in this world that is fair.

573
00:38:02,553 --> 00:38:03,593
Father.

574
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:08,021
I heard the one helping Commissioner Park's wife...

575
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:11,163
was the lady of the merchant house you were sponsoring.

576
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:16,232
And from what I found out, Princess Yeon Joo was staying there.

577
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:20,032
If you do not want the whole city to know that...

578
00:38:20,033 --> 00:38:22,143
Princess Yeon Joo is involved in such a matter,

579
00:38:22,873 --> 00:38:24,672
end this conversation here and leave.

580
00:38:25,812 --> 00:38:29,783
The longer we talk, the one who will suffer damage...

581
00:38:30,382 --> 00:38:31,482
is not me but you.

582
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:10,553
Gosh, it burns.

583
00:39:11,692 --> 00:39:12,692
Darn it.

584
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:28,973
I must think.

585
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:30,772
Think.

586
00:39:31,143 --> 00:39:32,312
First off,

587
00:39:33,312 --> 00:39:35,143
my ship cannot set sail.

588
00:39:36,013 --> 00:39:37,913
So I must make a move.

589
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:43,993
No, not that.

590
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:45,853
No.

591
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,243
This is so wrong.

592
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:02,502
This is just wrong.

593
00:40:22,263 --> 00:40:23,862
Two.

594
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:26,392
Two.

595
00:40:26,393 --> 00:40:28,432
Two...

596
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:29,602
No, I cannot do this.

597
00:40:29,603 --> 00:40:31,033
No.

598
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:34,473
I cannot do this.

599
00:40:37,973 --> 00:40:39,612
Okay, fine.

600
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:47,882
All right.

601
00:40:49,922 --> 00:40:51,623
I must be insane.

602
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,672
(Hanseongbu)

603
00:41:25,993 --> 00:41:29,962
Of the seven bad behaviours, adultery is...

604
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:34,303
the most serious crime of them all, with a sentence of 80 floggings.

605
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:39,203
Dol Seok will testify that...

606
00:41:39,672 --> 00:41:41,402
he has spent the night with you.

607
00:41:41,973 --> 00:41:45,271
My friends are on their way to testify against you...

608
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:47,743
and speak of your debaucherous behaviours.

609
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:57,892
All you have to do now is drop your charges against me.

610
00:41:57,893 --> 00:42:00,222
I will forgive you...

611
00:42:00,223 --> 00:42:03,593
and ask the magistrate to show you mercy.

612
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:10,803
It looks like your attorney has also run away.

613
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:13,533
How will you fight me all alone?

614
00:42:15,502 --> 00:42:17,073
I am not here to win.

615
00:42:19,073 --> 00:42:21,042
I am here to relieve my resentment.

616
00:42:23,783 --> 00:42:26,283
Even if I die, I must leave all bitterness behind.

617
00:42:28,553 --> 00:42:29,922
If I die now,

618
00:42:30,453 --> 00:42:31,752
how will I face my parents...

619
00:42:32,723 --> 00:42:35,123
with this much shame in the other world?

620
00:42:49,343 --> 00:42:52,743
You are pushing your luck.

621
00:43:42,323 --> 00:43:43,421
What is this?

622
00:43:43,422 --> 00:43:44,533
What is wrong with this?

623
00:43:46,962 --> 00:43:48,232
What is this?

624
00:43:49,862 --> 00:43:50,873
No!

625
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:11,123
- Greetings, Magistrate Yoo. - Greetings, Magistrate Yoo.

626
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,832
Let us begin our day.

627
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:44,453
Father.

628
00:44:47,962 --> 00:44:49,163
Mother.

629
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,263
Please help me.

630
00:44:54,562 --> 00:44:56,002
This is not my time.

631
00:44:56,962 --> 00:44:58,132
Not yet.

632
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:05,473
I cannot leave this world yet.

633
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:03,632
Magistrate Yoo.

634
00:46:03,732 --> 00:46:06,203
The petitioner and the respondent are here.

635
00:46:15,612 --> 00:46:17,752
Petitioner, do you not have an attorney?

636
00:46:26,652 --> 00:46:28,362
Then let us begin the trial.

637
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:32,632
Petitioner, come out and turn in your complaint.

638
00:46:36,763 --> 00:46:38,902
He is a nobleman based in Pyongyang.

639
00:46:39,803 --> 00:46:41,803
And you wish to have him as the third deputy commander?

640
00:46:42,402 --> 00:46:43,643
Yes.

641
00:46:45,143 --> 00:46:46,812
And you will appoint Park Jae Soo, the former commissioner...

642
00:46:47,643 --> 00:46:49,183
of the Royal Academy of Painting, to Pyongyangbu?

643
00:46:49,612 --> 00:46:52,683
This was already decided among the executive ministers.

644
00:46:53,212 --> 00:46:56,183
Grand Queen Dowager also gave her approval.

645
00:47:01,493 --> 00:47:02,692
Go ahead.

646
00:47:17,573 --> 00:47:19,412
If I said the law can become a sword,

647
00:47:19,413 --> 00:47:20,981
would you believe me?

648
00:47:20,982 --> 00:47:22,913
("Book of the Law")

649
00:47:23,112 --> 00:47:25,752
The man who can wield this sword best...

650
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:27,683
is that attorney, Kang Han Soo.

651
00:47:29,553 --> 00:47:31,623
That sword Princess Yeon Joo mentioned.

652
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:36,022
Is that sword truly sharpened well?

653
00:47:45,272 --> 00:47:50,743
The petitioner and the respondent, tell him the reason for this trial.

654
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,743
One second!

655
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:08,093
The petitioner's attorney is here!

656
00:48:13,763 --> 00:48:15,433
- Oh, my. - Goodness.

657
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:20,303
I am the petitioner's attorney, Kang Han Soo.

658
00:48:20,632 --> 00:48:21,902
Nice to meet you.

659
00:48:22,843 --> 00:48:25,542
How did he get here?

660
00:48:25,573 --> 00:48:28,712
That man ended up coming?

661
00:48:33,683 --> 00:48:35,453
Settle down!

662
00:48:40,823 --> 00:48:42,322
This lawsuit was opened...

663
00:48:42,323 --> 00:48:43,492
by a woman who wanted to be found innocent...

664
00:48:43,493 --> 00:48:44,831
even after bringing disruption to her family...

665
00:48:44,832 --> 00:48:46,933
by committing 1 of the 7 bad behaviours.

666
00:48:47,402 --> 00:48:49,632
It is utterly scandalous.

667
00:48:50,362 --> 00:48:52,433
How dare she play around with the kingdom's law?

668
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:54,643
I am the petitioner's attorney, Kang Han Soo.

669
00:48:55,203 --> 00:48:56,343
Well...

670
00:48:56,843 --> 00:48:58,843
The one who broke the law is...

671
00:48:59,513 --> 00:49:01,881
Park Jae Soo, who framed his wife.

672
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:02,912
This is...

673
00:49:02,913 --> 00:49:05,052
a serious crime of calumny...

674
00:49:05,053 --> 00:49:07,053
and an abuse of the law which prevents a wife...

675
00:49:07,482 --> 00:49:09,323
from suing her husband.

676
00:49:10,152 --> 00:49:11,323
Magistrate Yoo.

677
00:49:11,692 --> 00:49:15,093
We have witnesses who will provide more information on their marriage.

678
00:49:21,232 --> 00:49:23,061
They are his friends.

679
00:49:23,062 --> 00:49:24,771
Their testimonies must be biased.

680
00:49:24,772 --> 00:49:26,702
They are from renowned noble families...

681
00:49:26,703 --> 00:49:29,472
and current public officials of crucial positions.

682
00:49:29,473 --> 00:49:31,812
Whose words are more just?

683
00:49:32,272 --> 00:49:35,081
A woman who is imprisoned for causing a divorce,

684
00:49:35,082 --> 00:49:38,152
or noblemen of high descent?

685
00:49:46,893 --> 00:49:47,962
This court...

686
00:49:48,593 --> 00:49:51,862
does not distinguish between truth and falsehood based on status.

687
00:50:04,343 --> 00:50:05,542
But Your Honour,

688
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:08,542
a nobleman's divorce is prohibited by the national law.

689
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:10,142
It is only natural...

690
00:50:10,143 --> 00:50:12,651
to grow old together once man and wife are united.

691
00:50:12,652 --> 00:50:13,652
However,

692
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:16,751
there is an exception.

693
00:50:16,752 --> 00:50:17,823
What is the exception?

694
00:50:20,053 --> 00:50:22,093
When one party betrays the other in conjugal relations,

695
00:50:22,593 --> 00:50:25,132
the authorities may forcefully divorce them.

696
00:50:25,462 --> 00:50:27,933
It is called at-fault divorce. For instance...

697
00:50:53,323 --> 00:50:56,562
When a spouse violates one's filial duty.

698
00:50:57,993 --> 00:51:01,303
Park Jae Soo was a son-in-law who lived with his wife's family,

699
00:51:01,663 --> 00:51:03,832
and he received a lot of help from his parents-in-law...

700
00:51:04,163 --> 00:51:06,672
until he passed the state examination to become...

701
00:51:07,073 --> 00:51:10,002
one of the most prestigious public officials.

702
00:51:10,772 --> 00:51:12,672
However, he repaid their kindness with evil.

703
00:51:13,243 --> 00:51:14,312
Your Honour.

704
00:51:14,982 --> 00:51:19,482
I have no idea what that attorney is saying.

705
00:51:19,853 --> 00:51:22,122
I have been taking care of her parents...

706
00:51:22,123 --> 00:51:25,192
with nothing but filial love.

707
00:51:25,953 --> 00:51:30,022
They also reciprocated that love and adored me.

708
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:33,962
This is evidence to prove it.

709
00:51:35,062 --> 00:51:36,831
My father-in-law...

710
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:39,672
wrote these words of blessing himself for me.

711
00:51:39,873 --> 00:51:42,243
He gave it to me as a present.

712
00:51:42,902 --> 00:51:45,172
And this outfit.

713
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:48,243
Not long before my mother-in-law passed away,

714
00:51:48,612 --> 00:51:51,513
she rubbed those dull eyes of hers...

715
00:51:51,982 --> 00:51:56,053
to stitch every thread just for me.

716
00:51:57,652 --> 00:51:59,592
If these...

717
00:51:59,593 --> 00:52:04,392
are not proof of how much they loved their son-in-law,

718
00:52:04,393 --> 00:52:07,532
what else can it be?

719
00:52:07,533 --> 00:52:09,262
- That is true. - He has a point.

720
00:52:09,263 --> 00:52:11,203
- That makes sense. - He makes a strong case.

721
00:52:16,973 --> 00:52:19,073
If they adored you so much,

722
00:52:22,243 --> 00:52:24,283
why did you repay them with death?

723
00:52:25,413 --> 00:52:26,453
What?

724
00:52:27,053 --> 00:52:29,452
- "Death?" - What?

725
00:52:29,453 --> 00:52:30,752
Did he say, "Death?"

726
00:52:31,053 --> 00:52:32,123
"Death?"

727
00:52:33,022 --> 00:52:34,993
Do you mean to say that he murdered them?

728
00:52:38,663 --> 00:52:40,163
That is true, Your Honour.

729
00:52:59,212 --> 00:53:01,422
I was promised to be Commissioner Park's concubine.

730
00:53:03,252 --> 00:53:05,123
I am Myung Wol, a courtesan.

731
00:53:14,362 --> 00:53:15,732
It is Myung Wol.

732
00:53:16,203 --> 00:53:18,033
What is happening right now?

733
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,373
How could you?

734
00:53:29,312 --> 00:53:31,413
How could you do this to me? Why?

735
00:53:32,283 --> 00:53:34,453
Let me go. Let go of me!

736
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:39,623
Come here!

737
00:53:40,692 --> 00:53:41,792
Get your hands off me!

738
00:53:42,792 --> 00:53:43,962
Your Honour.

739
00:53:44,533 --> 00:53:45,663
That girl...

740
00:53:46,792 --> 00:53:49,862
is not human. She is a ghost.

741
00:53:51,303 --> 00:53:53,671
She died and was buried underground.

742
00:53:53,672 --> 00:53:55,803
How could she testify?

743
00:53:56,672 --> 00:54:00,542
Please do not let that girl's words fool you.

744
00:54:00,712 --> 00:54:03,413
I almost became a ghost because of you.

745
00:54:04,082 --> 00:54:05,112
You witch!

746
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:09,323
Shut that wicked mouth this instant.

747
00:54:16,123 --> 00:54:18,692
It is true that Commissioner Park...

748
00:54:19,462 --> 00:54:20,593
caused his father-in-law's death.

749
00:54:21,103 --> 00:54:22,232
His father-in-law...

750
00:54:23,163 --> 00:54:25,832
had been suffering from diabetes for ten years.

751
00:54:27,073 --> 00:54:28,772
And Commissioner Park fed him this yakgwa.

752
00:54:29,873 --> 00:54:31,712
He had told me himself.

753
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:35,542
Your Honour.

754
00:54:36,343 --> 00:54:38,812
Please ask the physician next to you...

755
00:54:39,082 --> 00:54:40,353
what happens...

756
00:54:41,953 --> 00:54:43,953
when a diabetic patient eats yakgwa.

757
00:54:44,493 --> 00:54:46,623
It can be more lethal than poison.

758
00:54:46,752 --> 00:54:48,323
- It is lethal? - Is that true?

759
00:54:48,792 --> 00:54:50,691
- What? - How could he?

760
00:54:50,692 --> 00:54:53,393
- That was his father-in-law. - How gruesome.

761
00:54:54,502 --> 00:54:56,762
What a scumbag.

762
00:54:56,763 --> 00:54:59,272
- That was extremely evil. - How could he?

763
00:55:07,212 --> 00:55:08,413
All of these are...

764
00:55:09,283 --> 00:55:13,283
only distorted arguments from that attorney.

765
00:55:13,882 --> 00:55:16,582
I merely gave my father-in-law yakgwa...

766
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:20,453
to be a good son-in-law.

767
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,493
I had not the slightest clue...

768
00:55:23,593 --> 00:55:25,662
about the nature of his illness.

769
00:55:25,663 --> 00:55:26,732
Then,

770
00:55:27,493 --> 00:55:29,533
how do you explain taking...

771
00:55:29,902 --> 00:55:32,533
all the deeds to the house and land and meeting the brokers...

772
00:55:32,672 --> 00:55:35,343
while Lady Yeon was imprisoned?

773
00:55:42,212 --> 00:55:43,882
I am innocent!

774
00:55:44,683 --> 00:55:46,152
My only sin...

775
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:48,823
is making zealous efforts to be successful.

776
00:55:49,522 --> 00:55:50,723
I took what I needed...

777
00:55:51,692 --> 00:55:53,223
and eliminated what got in my way.

778
00:55:54,593 --> 00:55:56,222
Hold the hands of the rich,

779
00:55:56,223 --> 00:55:58,362
and shake off the hands of those who weigh me down.

780
00:55:59,062 --> 00:56:01,061
Is that not how we all live?

781
00:56:01,062 --> 00:56:02,062
What did you say?

782
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,803
My parents-in-law...

783
00:56:10,573 --> 00:56:13,473
sacrificed themselves to become the fertilizer...

784
00:56:13,712 --> 00:56:16,513
to have flowers bloom in their son-in-law's future!

785
00:56:18,312 --> 00:56:20,553
That is the only fair interpretation.

786
00:56:21,553 --> 00:56:23,123
Am I wrong?

787
00:56:26,993 --> 00:56:28,763
Am I wrong?

788
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:36,303
Am I wrong?

789
00:56:42,772 --> 00:56:43,942
Am I wrong?

790
00:56:46,942 --> 00:56:48,013
Oh, boy.

791
00:56:54,353 --> 00:56:57,752
This court's objective is not to determine the respondent's crimes.

792
00:56:58,993 --> 00:57:00,021
However,

793
00:57:00,022 --> 00:57:02,861
based on the testimonies and circumstances,

794
00:57:02,862 --> 00:57:05,862
it is clear that the respondent provided a reason for divorce.

795
00:57:05,933 --> 00:57:08,332
Framing his wife for causing a divorce...

796
00:57:08,732 --> 00:57:12,433
seems like a mere trick to take his wife's assets.

797
00:57:12,973 --> 00:57:14,002
Above all,

798
00:57:14,743 --> 00:57:16,242
there is clear circumstantial evidence...

799
00:57:16,243 --> 00:57:17,743
that he caused his father-in-law's death.

800
00:57:19,473 --> 00:57:21,073
Hence, he will be detained in the Bureau of Punishments.

801
00:57:21,442 --> 00:57:23,413
We will proceed with the lawsuit under due process...

802
00:57:23,643 --> 00:57:26,783
and eventually make him pay for committing a murder,

803
00:57:26,882 --> 00:57:28,252
a crime against humanity.

804
00:57:33,323 --> 00:57:36,223
- So that was what he did. - How awful.

805
00:57:38,962 --> 00:57:41,662
- What a terrible man. - How pathetic.

806
00:57:41,663 --> 00:57:43,732
- This is justice. - Indeed.

807
00:57:44,603 --> 00:57:47,073
I cannot believe what he had done.

808
00:57:50,703 --> 00:57:51,743
Wait!

809
00:57:53,913 --> 00:57:55,312
Please give me the clothes back.

810
00:57:58,053 --> 00:57:59,152
I cannot give him...

811
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:02,453
the precious clothes that my parents had made...

812
00:58:03,283 --> 00:58:05,123
to bring into the harsh environment of a prison.

813
00:58:15,062 --> 00:58:17,263
It seems like high-quality silk that is not appropriate for prison.

814
00:58:18,573 --> 00:58:19,632
Take them off.

815
00:58:29,743 --> 00:58:31,752
When you run into Master Jang in the underworld,

816
00:58:31,953 --> 00:58:33,482
tell him I said hi.

817
00:58:33,683 --> 00:58:35,823
You piece of scum.

818
00:58:36,623 --> 00:58:39,152
What have I done to make you my enemy?

819
00:58:39,823 --> 00:58:41,462
How come you torture me?

820
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:43,562
Why?

821
00:58:44,393 --> 00:58:45,533
Why on earth did you do that?

822
00:58:47,062 --> 00:58:48,962
Are you wondering who I am?

823
00:58:50,303 --> 00:58:51,502
I will come and visit soon.

824
00:58:52,073 --> 00:58:53,373
We can catch up then.

825
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:06,013
How sweet.

826
00:59:09,123 --> 00:59:10,723
Could you tell me what happened?

827
00:59:11,553 --> 00:59:13,623
I thought you were badly hurt.

828
00:59:14,623 --> 00:59:16,093
It was nothing.

829
00:59:17,192 --> 00:59:18,932
Just in case,

830
00:59:18,933 --> 00:59:21,192
I hid porcine blood in my wig,

831
00:59:21,362 --> 00:59:24,163
and it burst at the perfect timing.

832
00:59:39,953 --> 00:59:42,982
This old geezer actually attempted to kill me.

833
00:59:43,723 --> 00:59:46,393
Thank goodness, I tested him as Attorney Kang suggested.

834
00:59:47,022 --> 00:59:49,823
That darn despicable rotten...

835
00:59:52,362 --> 00:59:53,692
How should I bring him down?

836
00:59:56,232 --> 00:59:57,462
Pardon?

837
00:59:57,763 --> 00:59:59,933
Then all this...

838
01:00:02,343 --> 01:00:04,103
Attorney Kang told me.

839
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:06,972
That Commissioner Park...

840
01:00:06,973 --> 01:00:10,013
could be so sweet and dear to me,

841
01:00:10,683 --> 01:00:13,413
but the moment I became his wife,

842
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,722
I would end up...

843
01:00:15,723 --> 01:00:19,323
quite similar to Lady Yeon who was confined in prison.

844
01:00:20,752 --> 01:00:21,962
And around that time,

845
01:00:23,823 --> 01:00:25,791
you came to me...

846
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:28,832
and let me know that there could be another way of life.

847
01:00:30,562 --> 01:00:31,803
Then...

848
01:00:33,132 --> 01:00:34,401
That is right.

849
01:00:34,402 --> 01:00:36,843
The trigger of my decision...

850
01:00:37,272 --> 01:00:38,772
was your suggestion.

851
01:00:40,442 --> 01:00:43,442
"Instead of entrusting my life to an unreliable man,"

852
01:00:43,913 --> 01:00:45,953
"I should pave my own way of life."

853
01:00:47,152 --> 01:00:49,683
"It would not be bad to make use of my love for cosmetics..."

854
01:00:51,382 --> 01:00:53,723
"and start a business."

855
01:00:55,893 --> 01:00:57,692
Wonderful thinking.

856
01:00:58,263 --> 01:01:00,192
That is such a great decision.

857
01:01:15,643 --> 01:01:17,212
I apologize for what I did.

858
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:19,453
Please forgive me, my lady.

859
01:01:26,522 --> 01:01:28,323
What you owed me...

860
01:01:30,163 --> 01:01:33,263
was paid off when you came to testify today.

861
01:01:34,433 --> 01:01:35,703
From now on,

862
01:01:36,433 --> 01:01:38,772
do not get yourself involved in a misfortune like this.

863
01:01:39,772 --> 01:01:41,643
I wish you well.

864
01:01:56,752 --> 01:01:59,453
How can I repay you?

865
01:02:00,623 --> 01:02:02,122
I did not do anything.

866
01:02:02,123 --> 01:02:03,393
Attorney Kang did everything...

867
01:02:07,093 --> 01:02:08,962
Just pay him a hefty sum.

868
01:02:10,232 --> 01:02:12,132
Yes, of course.

869
01:02:13,232 --> 01:02:15,143
I will make sure to do that.

870
01:02:18,212 --> 01:02:19,442
My lady.

871
01:02:23,542 --> 01:02:24,982
Your divorce...

872
01:02:25,252 --> 01:02:27,053
is not something to be ashamed of.

873
01:02:28,353 --> 01:02:30,283
The country granted it.

874
01:02:31,723 --> 01:02:34,022
So keep your chin up,

875
01:02:34,893 --> 01:02:37,123
and do not avoid eye contact.

876
01:02:40,763 --> 01:02:42,462
For your own happiness,

877
01:02:42,862 --> 01:02:45,873
enjoy what you deserve with pride.

878
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:52,073
Thank you, I mean it.

879
01:03:04,522 --> 01:03:06,252
Thank goodness, it is spring.

880
01:03:07,053 --> 01:03:10,263
If it had been winter, you would have caught a cold.

881
01:03:10,893 --> 01:03:13,132
I am perfectly fine, and I am in a great mood too.

882
01:03:13,462 --> 01:03:16,163
I managed to save both Kang Han Soo and Lady Yeon.

883
01:03:17,332 --> 01:03:19,573
But you got me all startled.

884
01:03:21,473 --> 01:03:23,742
Who knew that night light...

885
01:03:23,743 --> 01:03:25,913
was a sign from Kang Han Soo?

886
01:03:27,442 --> 01:03:28,582
Han Soo!

887
01:03:29,183 --> 01:03:30,812
Where are you?

888
01:03:31,312 --> 01:03:32,882
Han Soo!

889
01:03:33,252 --> 01:03:35,323
Where did you go?

890
01:03:36,053 --> 01:03:37,283
Han Soo!

891
01:03:37,922 --> 01:03:40,053
Do you hear me?

892
01:03:40,652 --> 01:03:41,892
It is Dong Chi.

893
01:03:41,893 --> 01:03:43,462
- Maybe he did not leave. - Han Soo!

894
01:03:50,132 --> 01:03:51,433
Han Soo.

895
01:05:07,272 --> 01:05:08,482
Kang Han Soo!

896
01:05:11,683 --> 01:05:13,913
Kang Han Soo, wake up.

897
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:19,393
- Han Soo! - Attorney Kang!

898
01:05:25,533 --> 01:05:27,493
Were you that worried about me?

899
01:05:30,933 --> 01:05:32,703
As if.

900
01:05:34,172 --> 01:05:35,303
Then,

901
01:05:35,942 --> 01:05:37,442
what is this?

902
01:05:40,042 --> 01:05:42,111
That is just water.

903
01:05:42,112 --> 01:05:43,643
Water from the Han River.

904
01:05:45,752 --> 01:05:47,582
- Gosh. - Goodness.

905
01:06:30,323 --> 01:06:32,562
Now do you believe my good intentions?

906
01:06:49,183 --> 01:06:51,953
It is so fortunate.

907
01:06:54,013 --> 01:06:55,112
Right.

908
01:06:55,882 --> 01:06:58,053
I guess he is meant to live a long life.

909
01:07:29,752 --> 01:07:31,053
She killed herself.

910
01:07:50,343 --> 01:07:51,603
I will make it look like that.

911
01:07:52,542 --> 01:07:53,873
I will make it look like that.

912
01:07:58,982 --> 01:08:00,382
It ended up as you wanted.

913
01:08:22,672 --> 01:08:26,143
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

914
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:28,942
(Special thanks to Jo Hee Bong and Bae Hae Sun...)

915
01:08:28,943 --> 01:08:30,613
(for their guest appearances)

916
01:08:34,882 --> 01:08:36,622
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

917
01:08:37,082 --> 01:08:38,322
Ta-Da.

918
01:08:38,723 --> 01:08:42,363
If all that was in exchange for my father's death...

919
01:08:44,223 --> 01:08:45,492
Liquidation.

920
01:08:46,433 --> 01:08:47,863
Murder?

921
01:08:47,992 --> 01:08:50,233
How could someone get killed in our village?

922
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:52,072
Nothing changed a bit.

923
01:08:55,773 --> 01:08:57,502
Have you decided to be my assistant again?

924
01:08:58,403 --> 01:09:00,313
You saved my life,

925
01:09:00,742 --> 01:09:03,082
so I guess I can give you that much of a chance.
