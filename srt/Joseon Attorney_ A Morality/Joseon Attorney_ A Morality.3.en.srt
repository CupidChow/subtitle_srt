2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Father!

3
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:32,069
Father!

4
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,169
Father!

5
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,809
Court Lady Hong!

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,540
Father!

7
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,090
The King is dead!

8
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,560
The King is dead!

9
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,429
The King is dead!

10
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,709
Leave the room for a moment.

11
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,280
We were given the order to stay until everything is cleaned up.

12
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:19,550
And?

13
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,080
Do you intend to defy the Princess?

14
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,420
I understand.

15
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:44,369
What must you find urgently that you had to force yourself inside?

16
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,640
Why are you standing outside?

17
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:52,580
I said you must never leave the room.

18
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,950
- Her Royal Highness is here. - What?

19
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:04,089
Goodness, Your Royal Highness, what brings you here?

20
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:10,100
I understand that you are the Princess,

21
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,700
but please do not break the customs of the palace.

22
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:14,029
The customs?

23
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:18,009
It is the customs of the palace to record and preserve...

24
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,809
every single scroll and book left behind by the late King.

25
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,439
I just made a visit because I missed my father.

26
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:26,809
I do not want to meddle with the duties of the subjects.

27
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:28,850
Let us go.

28
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:34,619
Please wait a moment.

29
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,869
Goodness.

30
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:52,839
What is that book, and why are you hiding it?

31
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,339
It is a book my father gave me to read.

32
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,719
As I have made myself clear,

33
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,449
it is my role as his subject to record and preserve...

34
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,320
every scroll and book which belonged to His Majesty.

35
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,290
Then return it to me afterward.

36
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,279
Are you all right?

37
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,230
("Book of the Law")

38
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,479
My sister.

39
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,718
Do you really think...

40
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,120
we can bring down the influence of Yoo Je Se?

41
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:18,659
Envoys came from Ming,

42
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,990
but they only spent time with Executive Minister Yoo.

43
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:25,169
Last time, you asked me for a favor,

44
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,469
then the envoys came for me to entertain.

45
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,969
But there was nothing I could do.

46
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,339
It is quite shameful that I call myself a king.

47
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:41,620
Will things change...

48
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:43,950
once the regency ends?

49
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,320
Your Majesty.

50
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,419
Things will not end just because the regency ends.

51
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:52,330
You must increase your power.

52
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,959
Keep subjects who support you and give you power by your side,

53
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,500
and then establish a principle which you can depend on.

54
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:01,669
The law, correct?

55
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,609
If I said the law can become a sword,

56
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,779
would you believe me?

57
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,089
I believe there are vacant offices in the magistrate of Hanseongbu...

58
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,620
and the commissioner of the Royal Academy of Painting.

59
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,760
How did you know?

60
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,299
The commissioner of the Royal Academy of Painting...

61
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:32,969
resigned for personal reasons.

62
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:40,708
Your Majesty, my sin is too grave!

63
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:44,139
The magistrate of Hanseongbu took a bribe during a trial,

64
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,180
then made a misjudgment and freed a heinous criminal.

65
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,880
I reprimanded him severely.

66
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,750
Everything began...

67
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,320
from the tip of the tongue of an attorney named Kang Han Soo.

68
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:58,060
You should fill those vacancies with one of our own.

69
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,259
Someone who will help you reign,

70
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,459
someone who wishes to do good for our country and people.

71
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:04,968
I wish...

72
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:09,200
to cut out the rotten things of this world by using the law,

73
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:12,140
then sprout new life in return.

74
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,209
The man who can wield this sword best...

75
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,109
is that attorney, Kang Han Soo.

76
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,320
("Book of the Law")

77
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,859
I will make use of you for the sake of our country and people.

78
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,760
I hope your understanding of the law, your cleverness,

79
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:37,199
and eloquence with an edge...

80
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,000
can comfort the hearts of those who were wronged.

81
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,168
Which will take me...

82
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:45,940
a step closer to the world my father dreamed of.

83
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,609
That is my wish.

84
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,778
Goodness gracious.

85
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,320
If you say that, would he go,

86
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,279
"Oh, my, is that so?"

87
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,450
Do you think so?

88
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:03,620
He would not. Never.

89
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,958
He would not even believe me.

90
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,129
He will think I have gone completely insane.

91
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,529
You know that very well.

92
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:11,729
Let us go out now.

93
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,830
This place is...

94
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,399
leaking water.

95
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,599
- Then... - Goodness.

96
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,769
What do I do?

97
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,668
What do you mean? You must go out and think.

98
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:21,009
- What should I say? - Goodness.

99
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,408
You are much better at acting now.

100
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,440
Come on. Come out now.

101
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:27,279
Attorney Kang!

102
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,589
Allow me to work at Attorney for Hire.

103
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,620
What are you talking about?

104
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,788
I wish to work for you, Attorney Kang.

105
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,889
I can work as an investigator or an assistant.

106
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,929
It is not okay.

107
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,898
There are woman officers in the law agency called damo,

108
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:46,169
so I will become your one and only damo.

109
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:47,398
That job is not for everyone.

110
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,440
Then one day, you will ask me this.

111
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,000
"Are you in pain?"

112
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:52,440
"I am in pain too."

113
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,640
That is all I want.

114
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,349
You are...

115
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,979
surely unwell.

116
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,880
You are just unwell.

117
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,689
Therefore, I cannot let someone who is unwell work for me.

118
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,620
- Go! I must feed my horse carrots. - I...

119
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,288
- Han Soo! - What?

120
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:15,459
What?

121
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:18,398
- The ship is... - Yes?

122
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,298
sinking!

123
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,599
- What? - It continues to leak water!

124
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,970
Come quickly.

125
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:27,039
Take me in as your assistant.

126
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:28,538
Then I will provide your lodging,

127
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:32,279
as well as an office space free of river and rainwater.

128
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,109
I do not fall for such petty...

129
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,849
I will give you the biggest space...

130
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,949
in the merchant house.

131
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,789
Are you serious?

(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

134
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,079
This is our merchant house.

135
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,559
Hey.

136
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,428
And this is the best room here.

137
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:26,199
Is that the man the Princess... No.

138
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,699
The man So Won brought?

139
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:30,668
Yes.

140
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:32,069
He is that man.

141
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,710
He does not have the looks or the attire of an attorney.

142
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,778
What a pretty-looking man.

143
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,079
He must have the temper to go with his looks.

144
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,379
He is good-looking. Handsome.

145
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,850
Next, this is...

146
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:46,990
I am just saying. Never mind.

147
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,629
I used to live in my own house. Now I am freeloading...

148
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,100
at someone's merchant house.

149
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,299
Own house, my foot.

150
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,328
You would think that I kidnapped you...

151
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:02,140
when I provided you with food and a bed.

152
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:03,899
What are you complaining about?

153
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,640
Do you serve food as well?

154
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,649
Give it a taste.

155
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,890
It contributes to most of the sales of our merchant house.

156
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,090
All rice soup tastes the same, though.

157
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:26,829
What?

158
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:28,929
- Hooray! - Hooray!

159
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,630
- We love it! - We love it!

160
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,939
Let us just take her in.

161
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:48,919
This is pretty much a windfall.

162
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,149
No. I cannot help but consider the risk.

163
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,590
We cannot have an assistant who is not aware of our situation.

164
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,289
Then how about we make her a temporary assistant?

165
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,460
We will need to buy some time while we get the ship fixed.

166
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,169
That is how you end up in a trap.

167
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,110
You must be rational at times like these.

168
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,739
If you were so rational,

169
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,678
how did you pay so much for a broken used ship?

170
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,240
Look what you have got us into!

171
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,350
This is driving me insane.

172
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,520
I am already busy trying to find his fault.

173
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,929
No!

174
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,600
Just accept her!

175
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,199
What is happening?

176
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,269
(We give legal advice.)

177
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,640
(Attorney)

178
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:57,179
This is so boring.

179
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,620
I have brought you a client.

180
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,659
Have a seat.

181
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,360
So, what is your story?

182
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:13,668
Park owes me medical charges,

183
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:14,929
so I want to file a lawsuit.

184
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,739
He has suffered from a chronic disease...

185
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,840
for ten years now,

186
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:19,840
and I recently cured him.

187
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,209
Is it not fair that he pays me medical fees?

188
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,239
Right.

189
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,079
Actually, the doctor told me...

190
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,418
that eating beef would be my only cure.

191
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:33,819
He had given up on curing my disease.

192
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:37,490
But a few days ago, Lord Kim Se Won...

193
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,090
was grilling beef.

194
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,360
I wanted to at least get a sniff of beef,

195
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,000
so I was leaning against his wall.

196
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:50,939
Somehow, I was completely cured the next day.

197
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,370
I see.

198
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,409
But he did not even eat the beef.

199
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,340
There is no guarantee that he was cured by the beef.

200
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,149
You must pay him.

201
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,779
Excuse me?

202
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,850
See?

203
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:07,350
You are a famous attorney for a reason.

204
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,020
I paid 50 nyang for beef that time.

205
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,090
You can pay me half the price.

206
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,730
It will cost more when he files a lawsuit,

207
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,029
so I recommend you settle with 25 nyang.

208
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,500
I will take that.

209
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,299
Attorney Kang!

210
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,340
Here.

211
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,939
Good. Here you go.

212
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,049
Happy?

213
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,110
Wait. What are you doing?

214
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:38,119
Park's disease was cured after only smelling beef.

215
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,260
It is simply fair that you only listen to the compensation.

216
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,789
Right?

217
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,630
Here you go.

218
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:47,789
Thank you so much.

219
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,899
- You may go. - Gosh.

220
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,099
Hold on.

221
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,240
What do you want now?

222
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:00,210
You must pay for our legal advice.

223
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,480
- That will be five nyang. - What?

224
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,279
Do not tell me...

225
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,309
you are planning on jumping an attorney's bill.

226
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,528
You cannot reject me now.

227
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:28,569
Why will you not hire me as your assistant?

228
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,068
Enough. I told you that I would pay you...

229
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:33,140
five nyang a day for staying at your merchant house.

230
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:36,210
If you want to be so heartless, I will charge you properly.

231
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,739
You and Dong Chi...

232
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,178
both eat, sleep, and poop at our place.

233
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,979
Your donkey eats, sleeps, and poops at our stable.

234
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,818
Add them up, and ten nyang a day would not be enough.

235
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:46,519
So, may I write the other five nyang in our ledger every day,

236
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,889
including the interest?

237
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,159
Calm down.

238
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,509
You are tenacious. I will give you that.

239
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,579
You are quick at figures, so you will not be conned.

240
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,880
Fine. I will give you a chance.

241
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,479
I will test you to see if you are qualified...

242
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,750
to be my assistant.

243
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:20,220
How would you do that?

244
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
Here.

245
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,390
This is the reason I became an attorney.

246
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,100
So, make your own pouch.

247
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,470
You will also have to find what you want to put inside.

248
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,370
That is your first test.

249
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,480
Understood.

250
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,278
A coin pouch?

251
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,850
Yes! He said that was the reason he became an attorney.

252
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:53,250
At first, I thought it had to be money.

253
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:55,460
But I have a feeling that it is a trick.

254
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,520
I must look thoroughly into his background.

255
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,590
That way, I can convince him.

256
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:03,529
I get the feeling that this is one of his tactics.

257
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,270
- What? - There is nothing inside,

258
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,770
but he wants to make you think...

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,340
that there is something significant.

260
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,370
What?

261
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:15,039
Princess, he got the best of you.

262
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,239
- No, he did not! - He did.

263
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,710
- The best of me? - Yes.

264
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,079
Goodness.

265
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,789
What is this tangerine for?

266
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:27,620
Right.

267
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,419
He sent you another letter.

268
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,960
With these valuable fruits again.

269
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:34,990
- The lord? - Yes.

270
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:41,799
"By the time this letter reaches you,"

271
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,509
"I will also have arrived at Hanyang."

272
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,139
(It is a shame that I cannot also send you...)

273
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,538
(the clear sound of the waves.)

274
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:50,679
"I also send you these tangerines."

275
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,980
"I hope you put it to good use."

276
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,220
He is coming to Hanyang.

277
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:59,150
Last month, he was in Hamheung.

278
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,189
The month before that, he was in Buyeo.

279
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,990
What does he do for a living...

280
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,720
to be all over the nation?

281
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,829
I do not know what he does,

282
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,490
but I can sense what kind of man he is.

283
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,869
I am certain that he is a man of integrity and a good heart.

284
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,869
I can see it from his penmanship.

285
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:18,099
Of all those things,

286
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:21,038
judging from how he sends you precious gifts...

287
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,680
that are good enough for kings,

288
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:26,109
he is certainly a man of great wealth.

289
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,920
You should ask him to meet you to thank him for all the help.

290
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:35,819
He would have already been here if he had wanted to show himself.

291
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,490
He must want to help our merchant house anonymously.

292
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:41,358
I do not want to burden him.

293
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,059
Plus, I am pretty busy myself.

294
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,629
What do I do with Attorney Kang?

295
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:51,369
Still,

296
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,569
you must write him back.

297
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,639
Right. I must.

298
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,750
Kang Han Soo. How should I convince him?

299
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,549
Look here! Is anyone there?

300
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:10,160
I am a peddler!

301
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,559
Okay.

302
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,940
He is not the person to hide away for being demoted.

303
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:29,609
Lord.

304
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,650
Master Cho here...

305
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,549
will help you plan your inauguration celebration.

306
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Let me officially introduce myself.

307
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,520
I have recently become a master. My name is Cho Chul Ju.

308
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:46,490
I am glad that you are here.

309
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,629
Especially the fact that we have no mutual acquaintances...

310
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:53,799
or shared memories makes me satisfied.

311
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,770
Sharing a common past...

312
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,910
can be tiresome, at times.

313
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,150
Good luck.

314
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:19,960
Keep in mind...

315
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,029
that it will be crucial in the future for both you and me.

316
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:26,129
I will.

317
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,150
"Minor Inspector Yoo Ji Sun of Saheonbu..."

318
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,989
"traveled all around the country in secret for years..."

319
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,489
"and uncovered the corruption of officials..."

320
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,789
"to tighten the public sentiment from going astray..."

321
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,259
"and make other remarkable contributions."

322
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,269
"As a reward for what he has done,"

323
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:04,069
"he will be promoted to a higher-level position,"

324
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,240
"which is a level-two magistrate of Hanseongbu."

325
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,910
"With devotion, fulfill your duty granted by His Majesty."

326
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,920
Thank you for your generosity, Your Majesty.

327
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,609
Hurry up already.

328
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:44,879
Hurry up.

329
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:46,650
Move quickly.

330
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,049
Carry two at a time.

331
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,479
Oh, goodness.

332
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,119
There you go. Carry two bottles.

333
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,410
Jung Hyang, put your chin up.

334
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,980
The gaze.

335
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:24,119
The smile.

336
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,489
This place is where you come to have fun,

337
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,819
not to work.

338
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,789
Just how great of a person is coming that we are making all this fuss?

339
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,829
Whoever it is, they have my hatred.

340
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,900
(Sowongak)

341
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:45,299
My lady!

342
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,470
You came here yourself this year.

343
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,778
I am not here to make a donation today.

344
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:52,808
I know.

345
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:56,180
We still have not used up the rice and fabric you donated last time.

346
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:59,420
If you are out to take a breather, stay at our merchant house.

347
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,289
- Goodness. - Look at him.

348
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,930
They're doing so well.

349
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,819
You might even chase the incoming luck away.

350
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,548
That is exactly my point.

351
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,548
Making the pouch itself is...

352
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:10,990
harder than choosing what to put in.

353
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,089
I hated sewing even when I lived in the palace.

354
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,770
Hold on a second.

355
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,470
Your sewing seems just as bad.

356
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,940
Is this really necessary?

357
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:34,079
Attorney Kang is good-looking for nothing.

358
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,079
He does not look helpful at all.

359
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:41,149
You know my rough life in the palace...

360
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,388
got me to develop a discerning eye for people.

361
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:44,990
He certainly is wicked inside.

362
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:47,989
We cannot be sure how he will turn out until later.

363
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,628
If we cut him off already, it will stay unknown forever.

364
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,469
His ways may be wrong, but those can be fixed.

365
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,629
Yes, absolutely.

366
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:03,410
Will it work?

367
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,109
Should we just throw them out?

368
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,388
Why do we not ask for help from Lady Yeon...

369
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:15,150
staying in Gukhwa Room?

370
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,220
She has good sewing skills.

371
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,230
Maybe she can patch these up.

372
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:22,289
Great idea.

373
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,858
- Your Highness, be careful. - Let us hurry.

374
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:26,299
Please be careful.

375
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,700
My lady.

376
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,639
My lady.

377
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:43,220
I guess she stepped outside.

378
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:45,220
She was here just a while ago.

379
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,270
Gosh, that felt so good.

380
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,059
Goodness.

381
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,220
Nice job.

382
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,589
The weather is wonderful.

383
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,799
- Gosh. - Yes, right.

384
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,470
The weather is wonderful.

385
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:37,569
- Gosh. - Yes, right.

386
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:40,609
- Eat your fill. - All right.

387
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,210
I see you are having fun.

388
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,309
Pour more.

389
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,650
Fill it up.

390
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,819
Goodness.

391
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,450
- There you go. - They're doing so well.

392
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:13,470
- Gosh. - I need more too.

393
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,579
Let me pour you a glass.

394
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:26,149
I almost lost Executive Minister Yoo's trust...

395
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,650
with Master Jang's incident.

396
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,160
And you gave me a chance to make up for it. How should I repay you?

397
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,430
It is enough that you know.

398
00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:35,960
Thank you.

399
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:15,469
- Oh, no. - Executive Minister Yoo!

400
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,900
Executive Minister Yoo!

401
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,839
Escort him now!

402
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:24,680
- What is going on? - Executive Minister Yoo!

403
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,450
Executive Minister Yoo!

404
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,879
Executive Minister Yoo!

405
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:36,789
What are you waiting for?

406
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,099
Right,

407
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,569
not like this.

408
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,750
I need to know why. The reason.

409
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,680
Just why my parents...

410
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:06,319
had to face such a devastating death.

411
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:08,389
The reason.

412
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,879
My lady.

413
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,359
Are you okay?

414
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,190
It is you, So Won.

415
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,690
What...

416
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,910
Executive Minister Yoo,

417
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:08,878
District Magistrate Song in Pyongyang requested the King...

418
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:12,650
to grant him from stepping down due to his chronic illness.

419
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,289
The district magistrate in Pyongyang?

420
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:17,318
He is only in his 40s.

421
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,588
Hungu does not have...

422
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:21,489
enough influence over Pyongyang yet.

423
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,598
Sarim's influence is stronger there.

424
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,000
Its district magistrate must be one of us.

425
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,910
His chronic disease must be an excuse.

426
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:37,778
When he got caught having an affair...

427
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:39,409
with the landed proprietor's daughter,

428
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,079
he settled it with the proprietor by stepping down and leaving.

429
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,578
So if we do not agree with this appeal,

430
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:46,250
the proprietor will not stay still.

431
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,049
Give the proprietor...

432
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,760
an office position and promote him to the central government office.

433
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,298
How about the 4th senior rank's 3rd deputy commander?

434
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:57,358
(3rd Deputy Commander: 1 of the top 5 posts in Joseon)

435
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,829
Are you not being too generous?

436
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,270
I am giving him such a position because he deserves it.

437
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,909
Only when we show him the power we have...

438
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,339
will he not come at us again.

439
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:13,510
And tell him...

440
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:17,319
if he messes with Hungu's government affairs again,

441
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,818
he will have to pay for it...

442
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,889
with his life, including this issue.

443
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:24,190
Understood, my lord.

444
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:30,129
I feel anxious with only District Magistrate Song.

445
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,270
It is best to plant another man from our side.

446
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,970
Yes. It is about time we change...

447
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,368
the fourth senior rank's deputy magistrate in Pyongyangbu.

448
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:42,409
(Deputy Magistrate: 4th senior rank officer...)

449
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,410
(supporting the magistrate and left 3rd magistrate)

450
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,569
It is my first time seeing the executive minister.

451
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,809
This place feels like the palace and not the banquet...

452
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:15,270
when he speaks.

453
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,210
Yes, you are on point.

454
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,449
The executive minister's eyes, gestures, and every word...

455
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,049
are all a part of politics.

456
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,619
That makes this place the Royal Office and the palace.

457
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,520
We only do...

458
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,789
as we are told.

459
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,930
It was an order we could not decline,

460
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:40,770
an order from the very top.

461
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:43,400
I see.

462
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,609
So it could not be the king.

463
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,980
- Pardon? - It is nothing.

464
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,980
By the way, who came up with this banquet?

465
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,450
The commissioner.

466
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:56,250
He used up all his fortune.

467
00:31:57,379 --> 00:32:00,089
I guess he went mad after being demoted out of the blue.

468
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,589
All of this is not cheap.

469
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,220
Park Jae Soo.

470
00:32:08,129 --> 00:32:09,189
He has jumped...

471
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,660
on the most expensive wagon in Joseon.

472
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:16,339
My lady.

473
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,819
My lady!

474
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,020
My lady.

475
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,260
That was the day...

476
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:13,789
Father's third anniversary of his death ended.

477
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,960
You are exquisite.

478
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,470
- Draw me beautifully. - Of course.

479
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:27,639
To be honest, I knew.

480
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:31,339
That my husband was visiting the courtesan house every day.

481
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:34,910
That he was not only sleeping with the same woman...

482
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,720
but also sharing feelings with her.

483
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,289
I knew about it all but covered my ears and eyes...

484
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,288
and endured it with great effort,

485
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:45,960
believing it was the wife's virtue.

486
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,028
- When will you... - But...

487
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:50,159
give me a room?

488
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,270
That depends on how you behave.

489
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,440
But I do not want this room.

490
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,069
How come?

491
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,569
Did you not tell me...

492
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,840
your father-in-law passed away in this room?

493
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:04,139
There is nothing to fear.

494
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,279
That man already got everything off his chest...

495
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,349
and crossed the river to the underworld.

496
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:12,420
I made his wish come true...

497
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,420
just before he died.

498
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:17,758
I bought and gifted him a pile of yakgwa...

499
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:19,590
he was always craving.

500
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,159
Was the lord not suffering from diabetes?

501
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:24,699
That was none of my concern.

502
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,710
Father.

503
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,210
Father!

504
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:42,210
Father.

505
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,619
Father.

506
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,190
What?

507
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:58,159
Why did you come back so early?

508
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:00,230
- Leave. - What?

509
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:02,299
No, do not. It is all right.

510
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,400
Leave at once!

511
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:09,270
Come on. She might catch a cold.

512
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:13,650
Good grief.

513
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,590
Was it you?

514
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,590
What do you mean?

515
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:26,860
My father passed away...

516
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:29,630
after his condition suddenly worsened.

517
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,530
Was it your doing?

518
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,099
What are you saying I did?

519
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:38,169
Out of filial affection to your father, I...

520
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,639
I will sue you.

521
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,570
What?

522
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:43,909
I will sue you to the government office,

523
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:47,050
reveal all your wrongdoings,

524
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,550
and have you receive proper punishment.

525
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,920
Never...

526
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,989
will I overlook this matter.

527
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,599
Have you gone crazy?

528
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,969
As you are a dim-wit, you must not know that...

529
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:15,570
there is no law in Joseon where a wife can sue his husband.

530
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,549
Had your mother been alive,

531
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,689
she would have sued me in your stead.

532
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,820
But too bad.

533
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,559
Both your mother and father died a long time ago.

534
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,929
If you want an ancestral rite to be held after you die,

535
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,800
keep your mouth shut...

536
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,440
and live quietly.

537
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,210
Understood?

538
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,320
All I could do back then...

539
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,059
was simply smash the jars that contained food...

540
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,869
I made for my husband every day.

541
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,679
Goodness, I will catch you. I surely will.

542
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:31,780
Magistrate.

543
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,150
What is this?

544
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,920
It is not anything grand.

545
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:38,719
But it is said that my wife...

546
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:42,789
is the best cook in this city.

547
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,029
This is my gift to the new magistrate.

548
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,170
Please do not refuse it.

549
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,139
- But I must refuse. - All right.

550
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,710
Excuse me?

551
00:37:56,909 --> 00:37:59,940
Gosh, you did not even open it.

552
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,249
Here.

553
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,479
- Oh, my. - Good grief.

554
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,980
- What? - Those are priceless.

555
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,989
It is filled with my wife's love.

556
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,590
At least have a taste of it.

557
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:16,360
Look at that.

558
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,230
Come on. Give it a taste.

559
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:24,000
He must have brought it since it must be divine.

560
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,000
Even the envoys of Ming...

561
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,809
praised the honeyed ginseng made by the commissioner's wife.

562
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:31,679
Have a bite.

563
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,199
Take it.

564
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,299
- Pardon? - Share it with the people...

565
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,869
who helped prepare this banquet.

566
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:03,780
You will need more strength than me.

567
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,880
That is fine, right?

568
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:08,448
Yes, of course.

569
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:10,679
It is your gift, so do as you please.

570
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:13,449
All right, then.

571
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,659
Hey! You!

572
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,388
Goodness, this is...

573
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,219
the precious blue and white pottery...

574
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:54,429
only used by the Royal Family.

575
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,960
Our patriotism...

576
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:01,599
for this country is not any less than them.

577
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:07,340
All we have to do now is prove that we are worthy of this.

578
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,039
You are right.

579
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,808
Now.

580
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:16,980
Cheers.

581
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,690
- Thank you, Lord Yoo. - Thank you, Lord Yoo.

582
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,449
Yes.

583
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,079
Move quickly.

584
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,889
Goodness, looking good.

585
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,920
You are here.

586
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:12,900
Kang Han Soo.

587
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:21,480
I do not understand.

588
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,690
I have trouble breathing as if my lungs are pierced,

589
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,590
and I cannot stop crying as if I am bleeding from a cut.

590
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:36,389
I pinch and hit my bruises...

591
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:40,099
to forget the pain of my heart with the pain of my body,

592
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,000
but everything is useless.

593
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,670
Must I continue to live like this?

594
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:55,149
Should I leave everything up to fate?

595
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,320
That is not a matter to leave to time or fate.

596
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,559
My lady, this is a matter that requires human intervention.

597
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:06,559
You must find an attorney.

598
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:08,690
What do you say?

599
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:14,928
It is a crime to break the basic moral disciplines.

600
00:42:14,929 --> 00:42:16,868
(Three principles and five moral disciplines in human relationships)

601
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:19,270
I will be shunned by society.

602
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,239
"That woman does not know the basic human moralities."

603
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:25,408
"That is why her husband did that to her."

604
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,550
They will take his side instead.

605
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,980
A divorcee is considered less of a human...

606
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:34,590
than the lowest of society.

607
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,889
Does this mean a woman should put up with everything?

608
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,519
No.

609
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,429
That is unreasonable.

610
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:43,658
I am sure there is another way...

611
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:45,599
we are not aware of at the moment.

612
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,750
Did you find anything at the Royal Academy of Painting?

613
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,279
No one held a personal grudge against the commissioner...

614
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,590
to the point of taking him to a trial.

615
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:08,920
- Really? - Yes.

616
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,488
But I did hear rumors say that Myung Wol will become...

617
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:13,389
Commissioner Park's concubine.

618
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:18,459
Han Soo, what about you?

619
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,929
Did you find anything?

620
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:22,500
I did.

621
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:25,039
But I did not.

622
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:27,170
What do you mean?

623
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:30,780
Commissioner Park...

624
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:33,210
seems to have made good connections.

625
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:37,149
The most powerful man of the Hungu, Chu Young Woo, is behind him.

626
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,218
And today, he went to see Executive Minister Yoo's son...

627
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:41,020
and left a strong impression with his flattery.

628
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,058
This means he will surely take the fourth senior rank...

629
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:46,389
in Pyongyangbu, the deputy magistrate's office.

630
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,959
Wait, Pyongyangbu is...

631
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,500
the next largest region to Hanseongbu.

632
00:43:50,659 --> 00:43:52,158
The deputy magistrate there is...

633
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:54,570
more influential than most third senior rank officers.

634
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:55,730
That is right.

635
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,099
We should report him for buying his office.

636
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,270
Try to say something that makes more sense.

637
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:05,178
There is no way they left any kind of hard evidence,

638
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:06,379
and they are the same spoiled bunch.

639
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,249
So who will come and testify?

640
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,809
Try to think, okay?

641
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,480
What about the new magistrate of Hanseongbu?

642
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,289
Executive Minister Yoo's son can only be as good as his father.

643
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,828
He is pretending to be uptight,

644
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:24,300
trying to look like an upright and incorruptible man.

645
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,030
In the end, men are all blind to their own causes.

646
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,130
That is why...

647
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,440
I am living this darned life.

648
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,539
We must find a muddy path.

649
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,480
A muddy path, I say.

650
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,449
A path that can trap him for good.

651
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,630
You are here, my lord, young master.

652
00:45:09,509 --> 00:45:10,780
Ji Sun.

653
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,980
Yes, Father.

654
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:14,509
Enjoy it.

655
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,520
You do not have to be so uptight already.

656
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,419
Do not doubt if you are worthy of the office,

657
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,650
and just enjoy it.

658
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,989
That is why we take power.

659
00:45:28,989 --> 00:45:30,230
You are...

660
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,099
my son,

661
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:34,329
the executive minister's son.

662
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,999
No matter what you want and what you take,

663
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,099
you can do everything as you wish.

664
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,440
Therefore,

665
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:45,440
think of the men who bowed their heads before you...

666
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:48,050
as your people.

667
00:45:49,409 --> 00:45:52,250
When those people face trouble,

668
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,119
show them...

669
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,750
a little more mercy than the others.

670
00:45:58,559 --> 00:45:59,789
If you do that,

671
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,329
your kingdom...

672
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:03,860
will operate on its own.

673
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,679
May I truly expect to receive the office?

674
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,989
Executive Minister Yoo laid his eyes on you,

675
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:30,449
which equals his answer.

676
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,519
The problem is...

677
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,530
if you can truly take root in that office.

678
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,300
Your foundation is in Hanyang.

679
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,099
Your home and land are all here.

680
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:43,729
On top of that,

681
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,099
you said the deeds are all under your wife's name.

682
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:50,340
Do not worry about that.

683
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,939
It will take quite a fortune...

684
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,279
for me to get a fresh start in Pyongyang.

685
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,178
I must sell all my assets, including moveables...

686
00:46:58,179 --> 00:47:00,949
and real estate property to find enough money to do that.

687
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:05,819
I also must show my gratitude to Executive Minister Yoo and others.

688
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,090
What about your wife?

689
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:15,730
That is why the law exists.

690
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,809
(Sowongak)

691
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,448
You must have failed to make the pouch.

692
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:38,320
You are trying to blind us with so much food.

693
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,000
The pouch is coming along fine.

694
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,999
This is for another case, so it is...

695
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,199
my bribe to you.

696
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:50,940
Bribe?

697
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,739
All right.

698
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,110
In that case, I will begin.

699
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,909
You two can take your time and have a talk.

700
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,880
Tell me quickly!

701
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,479
I am not sure if you have heard,

702
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,250
but there are three philanthropists who help this merchant house.

703
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:08,718
This will take a while.

704
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,949
Then I will eat first.

705
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:13,558
One of them is an anonymous helper,

706
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:15,359
who travel all around the nation...

707
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,629
and sends us specialties from every area.

708
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:20,300
We sell it here at a high price to help operate Sowongak.

709
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,698
Another one is a member of the Royal Family,

710
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,069
who is acquainted with Lady Hong.

711
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,638
That person sends us grains once every quarter.

712
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:27,639
- Are you listening? - What? Yes.

713
00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:28,908
Lastly,

714
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:30,779
there is a wife of a nobleman...

715
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,409
who is staying on the second floor, in the Gukhwa Room.

716
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,250
Does the Gukhwa Room lady need an attorney for her case?

717
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:36,609
Yes!

718
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:38,849
Why? Was she robbed?

719
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,749
Or did her servant run away?

720
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,689
Or is this a family affair...

721
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,218
over the gravesite in their mountain?

722
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:45,489
No.

723
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:47,429
She wants...

724
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,329
to sue her husband.

725
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:55,400
What?

726
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,440
The wife wants...

727
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:58,738
to sue her husband?

728
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:01,009
Come on. If she did,

729
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:03,808
she would be flogged instead.

730
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:05,238
That is why I am asking you.

731
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:06,979
I thought you might know another way.

732
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,780
Yes, I do!

733
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,079
However,

734
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,880
she should have talked to the deity of childbirth.

735
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,349
- The deity of childbirth? - Yes!

736
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,929
Because she will have to be reborn as a man.

737
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,828
So, she will have a better chance asking the deity.

738
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,259
Now...

739
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,499
Give me a spoon.

740
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,070
Let us eat.

741
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:46,149
Is it not the attorney's job...

742
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,119
to help those who were unfairly treated?

743
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:50,860
Attorney Kang!

744
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:53,690
Fine.

745
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:58,599
Does she have a witness who can testify for her?

746
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,669
- Testify? Of course! - Good.

747
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,529
Her farmhand...

748
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,669
and her husband's courtesan.

749
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,800
I see.

750
00:50:07,369 --> 00:50:10,269
A farmhand will be executed for testifying against the master.

751
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:11,610
Who will dare to testify?

752
00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:13,279
And the courtesan is directly involved,

753
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,780
so she will never testify against herself.

754
00:50:15,909 --> 00:50:18,320
But it is true.

755
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,980
Who says it is true?

756
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:21,219
Well...

757
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,549
The lady?

758
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,219
Perhaps she has a new man.

759
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,888
She is not that type of person. How dare you?

760
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:29,428
How can you be so sure?

761
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:31,730
One cannot even trust one's own spouse after 20 years.

762
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,800
Hastily trusting a person is poison for an attorney.

763
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:43,509
Then what would you have me do?

764
00:50:43,969 --> 00:50:45,679
I am telling you to give up.

765
00:50:48,509 --> 00:50:49,650
Kang Han Soo.

766
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:51,880
Kang Han Soo.

767
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,849
Kang Han Soo!

768
00:50:55,949 --> 00:50:57,020
Princess...

769
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,590
Hi, So Won.

770
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:03,759
Ta-da.

771
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:07,059
What do you think? Is this good enough?

772
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:11,170
It is lame... My lady.

773
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:13,070
I will give you the money.

774
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,008
I will pay you a generous legal fee.

775
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:16,340
How much do you want?

776
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,309
But...

777
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,949
I have a favor to ask, my lady.

778
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,219
What is it?

779
00:51:28,949 --> 00:51:30,690
Find fault with Han Soo.

780
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,758
He turned down coins, which were his favorite.

781
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:33,789
Can you believe it?

782
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,090
He said no to coins?

783
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:38,429
Just coins.

784
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,599
He said no to coins.

785
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,940
Money wasn't the thing that made him work.

786
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,869
I guessed wrong!

787
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,610
Then what was this for?

788
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,948
I told you that was lame.

789
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:59,420
Look at this!

790
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:04,758
We spin the bottle, and whoever it points at,

791
00:52:04,759 --> 00:52:06,489
that person must answer a question.

792
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,059
You must empty the glass if you cannot answer.

793
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:14,329
You see,

794
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,899
this merchant house has too much liquor to dispose of.

795
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,239
That's true. So much.

796
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:24,909
Free booze?

797
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,250
I love it.

798
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,079
I will play.

799
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:36,320
I will spin it.

800
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,270
Okay.

801
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:53,969
Oh, right.

802
00:52:56,509 --> 00:52:57,610
Where are you from?

803
00:52:59,909 --> 00:53:01,809
Why do you ask?

804
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,420
Well, we must know where you are from...

805
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:08,849
to get closer.

806
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:13,119
Is that right?

807
00:53:17,259 --> 00:53:20,130
Sorry, I drank it.

808
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,900
As the rules say, I will not answer.

809
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:25,639
I am stupid.

810
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,980
Shoot.

811
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,780
You used to love money. Why did you reject the offer?

812
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,288
Come on. You cannot be so direct.

813
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:43,719
All right.

814
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,190
Attorney Kang is only human. He must have a secret.

815
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:51,360
Hey, Lady Hong.

816
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:54,599
Fill up my glass.

817
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:02,210
This is nice!

818
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:09,808
It is not even a difficult question. Why do you refuse to answer?

819
00:54:09,809 --> 00:54:13,520
You said that I could only drink if I did not answer.

820
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:17,050
I took care of all your disposing alcohol.

821
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:18,920
If you want to thank me,

822
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,159
you can fill my glass again.

823
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:26,159
All right.

824
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,800
I feel great.

825
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,969
Return to your room safely.

826
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,039
That was a failure.

827
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:39,840
(Lavatory)

828
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:53,190
Who is there?

829
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:43,270
Lady Hong.

830
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:45,409
Where are you from?

831
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:47,780
Why do you want to know where I am from?

832
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,948
You said that one must know...

833
00:55:49,949 --> 00:55:51,750
where you are from to get more intimate.

834
00:56:00,759 --> 00:56:02,530
How did it go? Did you learn anything?

835
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,500
I learned...

836
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,630
that he was a heavy drinker.

837
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:16,409
How does it look?

838
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:25,820
How ridiculous.

839
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,288
The government should help those who were unfairly treated.

840
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:29,989
Why does she ask me?

841
00:56:38,259 --> 00:56:41,699
As you are a dim-wit, you must not know that...

842
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:47,340
there is no law in Joseon where a wife can sue his husband.

843
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,078
What is the matter with you?

844
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,190
What has gotten into you?

845
00:57:03,789 --> 00:57:06,789
Will you take a nap in my arms?

846
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,500
Oh, my. What are all these?

847
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:16,730
What do you think?

848
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:20,769
They are for you, Myung Wol. These mean my heart,

849
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,139
my tears,

850
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:24,639
and my bribe.

851
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:28,780
Just give me one. I only need your heart.

852
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,980
Tears make me awkward,

853
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:32,579
and bribes make me uncomfortable.

854
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:34,849
Will you only accept one, then?

855
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,920
Or will you accept my heart,

856
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:41,788
my tears,

857
00:57:41,789 --> 00:57:43,789
and my bribe?

858
00:57:48,329 --> 00:57:49,329
All of them, of course.

859
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:53,440
So, what is it that you want?

860
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:57,538
Rumor has it that you will soon be Commissioner Park's concubine.

861
00:57:57,539 --> 00:57:58,678
Is that true?

862
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:00,980
Do not even get me started.

863
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:02,849
It is all ruined.

864
00:58:02,909 --> 00:58:03,909
Why?

865
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,920
He is all spin and no substance.

866
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,149
The house, the land, the store...

867
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,389
were all owned by his wife's family.

868
00:58:12,759 --> 00:58:14,258
His mother-in-law died way back,

869
00:58:14,259 --> 00:58:16,530
and his father-in-law passed away three years ago,

870
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,659
so I thought he would get all the property.

871
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:24,900
Right! I heard you were an attorney.

872
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,340
Then you must be well informed.

873
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,739
Is there a way...

874
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,250
for the husband to take the wife's wealth?

875
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,949
Sure.

876
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,689
Commissioner Park is confident that there is a way...

877
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:47,059
and tells me not to worry.

878
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:50,730
But I cannot fully trust him anymore.

879
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,360
Does he need to get a divorce?

880
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:57,299
That is right.

881
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,400
What if Commissioner Park files a suit for divorce?

882
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,909
Have you seen Dong Chi?

883
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:09,079
He seems to have stepped out.

884
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:10,550
What is so urgent?

885
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,219
You can join us if you want.

886
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,288
Where did you...

887
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:22,630
get this food?

888
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,459
It is from the Gukhwa Room lady,

889
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,059
one of our benefactors we mentioned before.

890
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,069
Gukhwa Room?

891
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,899
There is a wife of a nobleman...

892
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,770
who is staying on the second floor, in the Gukhwa Room.

893
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:34,739
She wants...

894
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,039
to sue her husband.

895
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,710
Are you perhaps talking...

896
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:43,280
about the lady So Won asked me to defend?

897
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:45,980
That is right.

898
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,650
Why? You declined it. Did you have a change of heart?

899
00:59:53,059 --> 00:59:56,230
I could not see what was right under my nose.

900
00:59:57,259 --> 00:59:58,530
This is great.

901
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,928
Where is So Won?

902
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,158
She disappeared.

903
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:02,428
She is not in the room,

904
01:00:02,429 --> 01:00:03,929
and she is nowhere to be found.

905
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:14,809
She did not leave.

906
01:00:14,949 --> 01:00:17,750
Her pajamas are here, so she must be out for a bit.

907
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:22,750
We must find her.

908
01:00:28,989 --> 01:00:30,289
Be careful!

909
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,530
You startled me more.

910
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,569
You did not have to yell.

911
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,070
Because I was startled.

912
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,239
Why?

913
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:45,280
Right. I wonder why.

914
01:00:46,179 --> 01:00:48,809
What is with the rush? She did not leave for good.

915
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:51,479
She may be up to leaving this world itself.

916
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,118
She lives in the middle of Bukchon,

917
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,989
but she came all the way here. So she must have felt...

918
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:57,420
This place is...

919
01:00:57,949 --> 01:00:59,090
What about it?

920
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,759
It is close to the Han River.

921
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,270
- Speaking of which... - Wait.

922
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,138
If you are asking me again to take the lawsuit...

923
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:14,000
I am done making the pouch.

924
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:20,940
You call this a pouch?

925
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:24,210
I made it with Lady Yeon's ripped sleeve.

926
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,820
She must have...

927
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:31,020
wiped her tears with this so many times.

928
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:34,719
So I...

929
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:38,030
would like to put people's tears in this pouch.

930
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:41,670
I want to seal their tears in this...

931
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:44,670
and give them a smile in return.

932
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,900
After all, the law is...

933
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:52,079
like a handkerchief to those who are wronged, I believe.

934
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:56,579
Please be her handkerchief.

935
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,579
I beg you.

936
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:03,989
Find her in a rush.

937
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:05,960
You must escort her back safely.

938
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,590
- Yes, my lady. - Yes, my lady.

939
01:02:12,259 --> 01:02:14,359
- Do you know Lady Yeon? - No.

940
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,500
- I have not seen her. - No?

941
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:20,440
That way.

942
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:38,158
Have you seen Lady Yeon?

943
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:39,360
No.

944
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:42,959
Have you not seen a noble lady who is slim and beautiful?

945
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,989
No.

946
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:46,999
Han Soo! Lady So Won!

947
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,969
- Stop. Goodness. - Gosh.

948
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,670
Tell them what you said earlier.

949
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:04,880
(Bureau of Punishments)

950
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,219
My lady.

951
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:14,888
How did you come here?

952
01:03:14,889 --> 01:03:16,529
What happened?

953
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,059
You have committed 1 of the 7 bad behaviors?

954
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:20,199
You could not have.

955
01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:23,670
He probably did not have any other good excuses.

956
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:26,099
I demanded him to move out,

957
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,809
and he counterattacked.

958
01:03:36,809 --> 01:03:38,249
I apologize for the late introduction.

959
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:41,119
This is Attorney Kang Han Soo.

960
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,218
She is...

961
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:44,960
Commissioner Park's wife, I know.

962
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:47,159
How do you know me?

963
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,888
I heard of your story before coming here...

964
01:03:49,889 --> 01:03:51,329
to help you.

965
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:52,758
That is right.

966
01:03:52,759 --> 01:03:55,300
He is quite competent, you see.

967
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:58,840
He recently won a lawsuit against Jang's guild.

968
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,809
What an ill-fated connection.

969
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:10,079
My husband was so furious about that incident.

970
01:04:10,949 --> 01:04:13,980
He and Master Jang knew each other for a long time.

971
01:04:15,449 --> 01:04:16,650
Anyway,

972
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:19,489
how are you going to help me?

973
01:04:20,059 --> 01:04:22,130
Why do you not file for divorce?

974
01:04:24,429 --> 01:04:26,259
Divorce?

975
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,058
Yes,

976
01:04:28,059 --> 01:04:30,770
I am going to bring a divorce lawsuit to Hanseongbu.

977
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:32,999
As we fiercely defend each other,

978
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,868
everything will be revealed...

979
01:04:34,869 --> 01:04:37,368
to the point that your husband framed you to take your fortune.

980
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:39,940
Only then, you will get to leave this place.

981
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:41,480
But...

982
01:04:42,949 --> 01:04:44,210
the divorce will...

983
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:45,919
The moment I get divorced,

984
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,349
everyone will point their fingers at me.

985
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:52,519
They will think I did something to deserve it.

986
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,159
Then will you just die?

987
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:59,259
If you do not divorce him,

988
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:01,869
you will die anyway.

989
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,868
You will be publicly executed...

990
01:05:03,869 --> 01:05:06,439
in the worst disgrace...

991
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,270
of having an affair with a servant, at that.

992
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:10,308
But...

993
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:13,809
if you divorce him, you will be able to keep your inheritance.

994
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:15,979
Your husband is after this fortune,

995
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,779
so you must stop him from seizing it...

996
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,980
to take good revenge on him.

997
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:21,888
So you should...

998
01:05:21,889 --> 01:05:24,789
bear with the humiliation of being a divorcee.

999
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:29,030
You are right.

1000
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:30,960
- My lady. - But...

1001
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,329
will it be possible?

1002
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,469
There is a type of divorce called repudiation.

1003
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:41,709
If there is a cause of divorce between a married couple,

1004
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,569
one can divorce the other by force.

1005
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:46,138
For example, a son-in-law having an affair with his mother-in-law...

1006
01:05:46,139 --> 01:05:48,508
or a husband assaulting his wife's parents...

1007
01:05:48,509 --> 01:05:49,848
or grandparents like this case.

1008
01:05:49,849 --> 01:05:51,110
Thus,

1009
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:55,349
I will focus on proving his violence.

1010
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,759
Speaking of which,

1011
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:06,259
can you have your leg break?

1012
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,598
You mean...

1013
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:13,800
That is right.

1014
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:16,308
You have to risk one of your legs, at least,

1015
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:18,170
in order to win this trial.

1016
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:21,508
Goodness.

1017
01:06:21,509 --> 01:06:26,020
It would be great if you were in deadly condition.

1018
01:06:27,849 --> 01:06:29,590
Are you kidding me?

1019
01:06:29,989 --> 01:06:31,489
That is an absolute no.

1020
01:06:31,889 --> 01:06:34,389
She has suffered enough already.

1021
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:37,230
But you want her to bear with something worse?

1022
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,860
And you will resort to such a dangerous plan?

1023
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,469
You are not considerate of her at all.

1024
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:44,428
All you care about is winning.

1025
01:06:44,429 --> 01:06:45,900
Of course.

1026
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:47,868
If we lose, there will be no revenge.

1027
01:06:47,869 --> 01:06:50,309
What about the pain she has to go through?

1028
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,239
Who is this revenge for anyway?

1029
01:06:57,449 --> 01:06:59,320
Then what do you suggest?

1030
01:07:01,449 --> 01:07:03,190
Standard tactics.

1031
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,758
I will reveal the fact that he framed Lady Yeon,

1032
01:07:06,759 --> 01:07:09,129
make him pay the price, and get her the divorce she wants.

1033
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:10,329
I will...

1034
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:16,000
find an attorney who will take this divorce suit...

1035
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,368
based on due process and conscience.

1036
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:19,539
What?

1037
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:22,170
I do not understand.

1038
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:24,570
I am saying that I will take back...

1039
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:26,340
hiring you.

1040
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:28,079
What?

1041
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:29,848
Did you not hear?

1042
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:32,320
Then let me tell you again, Kang Han Soo.

1043
01:07:34,349 --> 01:07:35,989
I am firing you.

1044
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:37,789
You are...

1045
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:39,789
fired.

1046
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,690
(The animal scenes were filmed under protection and safety.)

1047
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:17,190
(Special thanks to Han Min for his guest appearance)

1048
01:08:21,799 --> 01:08:23,700
(Joseon Attorney: A Morality)

1049
01:08:24,929 --> 01:08:26,770
In order to win a divorce lawsuit,

1050
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,208
it is important to reveal the details of everything.

1051
01:08:30,209 --> 01:08:31,809
You have told her more than enough.

1052
01:08:32,009 --> 01:08:33,540
She might pull it off without you.

1053
01:08:34,379 --> 01:08:35,449
Lord Chu.

1054
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:38,109
My wife brazenly filed a divorce lawsuit...

1055
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:40,280
to Hanseongbu.

1056
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:44,150
She killed herself.

1057
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,719
I will make it look like that.

1058
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:49,929
I will make it look like that.

1059
01:08:52,459 --> 01:08:53,959
Come back, Kang Han Soo.

1060
01:08:54,999 --> 01:08:56,429
I am sorry.
