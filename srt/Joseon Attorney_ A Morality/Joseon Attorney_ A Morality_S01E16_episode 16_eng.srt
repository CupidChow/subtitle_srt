1
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:34,724
 The characters, events, and era of this drama are unrelated to historical facts and are fictitious.

2
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:43,070
How dare you use my son to entrap me?

3
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:53,654
It is your specialty.

4
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:57,214
So what will you do?

5
00:00:57,214 --> 00:01:01,644
Will you confess your crime and obey,

6
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,904
or will you place all the blame on your son?

7
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:07,744
How dare you!

8
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:19,690

9
00:01:25,304 --> 00:01:28,244
But of course, you will not.

10
00:01:28,974 --> 00:01:32,624
I have already got your weakness.

11
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:35,924
Your son.

12
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:45,694
Ultimately, your son Yu Ji Seon is such an amazing man.

13
00:01:50,584 --> 00:01:55,464
 I do not determine the truth based on one's high or low status.

14
00:01:55,464 --> 00:02:01,704
 Whatever you want to do... do it through me.

15
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:18,324
Then the love of the father who raised that son cannot be fake.

16
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:24,094
The high and mighty Minister Yu would confess and obey?

17
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:27,884
He would think that it would be easier

18
00:02:27,884 --> 00:02:32,754
to put all the blame on his son and use his power to get him out.

19
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:34,744
Honestly, is that not so?

20
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:38,274
Minister Yu's son, say something.

21
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:44,934
Aigoo, what else could he do?

22
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:13,244
Yes, Your Majesty.

23
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:18,064
I was the one who wrote the official judgment.

24
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:22,194
However, all I did was discuss it with other officials who were upset

25
00:03:22,194 --> 00:03:24,194
after reading Legal Officer Kang's letter.

26
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:28,244
I never had them do anything illegal.

27
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:33,024
Not only that, I cannot accept the ridiculous charge

28
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:36,644
that I harmed the princess!

29
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:42,094
Princess is acting right now.

30
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:47,984
Did you just say she is acting?

31
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:50,514
How dare you say the princess...

32
00:03:51,694 --> 00:03:54,314
Do not dare insult the princess.

33
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:56,444
I mean,

34
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,874
then will this not be solved by revealing

35
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:04,524
if the princess is really in critical condition or actually acting?

36
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:13,434
Your Majesty. Allow me to personally

37
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:17,174
bring a physician, and check the state of the princess.

38
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,874
That is against custom.

39
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:25,434
Not in criminal law... to check for corroborative evidence.

40
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:41,674
You will have to take responsibility for your request.

41
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:13,064
I am sorry, Your Majesty and Grand Queen Dowager.

42
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:16,764
The princess is in a very critical condition.

43
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:21,754
It may be difficult to save her.

44
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:48,144
Officers! Arrest Minister Yu!

45
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:51,374
Your Majesty! This is a conspiracy!

46
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:53,774
This is a conspiracy!

47
00:06:38,544 --> 00:06:41,074
It appears that the princess

48
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:47,644
was prepared to go this far as soon as she saw the scarf.

49
00:06:57,044 --> 00:07:00,084
 Do you want to save him?

50
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:29,034
I cannot fool Minister Yu by acting.

51
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:34,414
Someone must be willing to

52
00:07:35,234 --> 00:07:37,514
take on the real risk...

53
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:43,544
since this is our last opportunity.

54
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:53,794
Even if something bad happens to me, do not blame anyone.

55
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:59,784
This is solely my choice.

56
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:14,434
I am sorry...

57
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:22,444
I am sorry for everything.

58
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:39,584
 This is my way.

59
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:44,534
 You should live as yourself,

60
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:48,254
 like Kang Han Su would.

61
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,560
 Lady Lee Memorial Tablet  
  Kang Eun Su Memorial Tablet  
 Kang Eon Jik Memorial Tablet

62
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:38,734
 Final Episode - My Wish* Is... 
(So Won means "wish" in Korean.)

63
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:43,144
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

64
00:09:43,144 --> 00:09:47,704
I will save my sister no matter what, so do not worry.

65
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:50,174
How dare he try to even harm the princess!

66
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,824
I am sorry to say this, but

67
00:09:54,064 --> 00:10:01,444
it is true that the princess drank the poison herself.

68
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:03,324
What...

69
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:06,944
What are you saying?

70
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:09,064
Then are you saying my sister...

71
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:10,714
Yes.

72
00:10:12,574 --> 00:10:18,814
She wanted to bring down Minister Yu, even at that cost.

73
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:30,474
Then,

74
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:33,874
I must all the more lay a severe punishment on Minister Yu.

75
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:36,594
I cannot let my sister's sacrifice be in vain.

76
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:42,214
If you punish him for that, it will be remembered throughout history as such.

77
00:10:42,214 --> 00:10:45,444
So would that not be a dishonor for the princess as well?

78
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,864
Still,

79
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:53,424
Minister Yu has already committed many sins that are punishable by death.

80
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:55,184
He is to die anyway, so—

81
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:57,194
Thus,

82
00:10:57,194 --> 00:11:03,644
I wish to... save that life of his.

83
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:06,644
What did you say?

84
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:13,714
Please let me decide the punishment for Minister Yu.

85
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:22,464
Kang Eon Jik will be posthumously recognized for his lifetime service as a professor of law,

86
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:29,064
and his family, who suffered from his death, must be compensated.

87
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:36,184
In particular, his son, Kang Han Su, will be allowed to take the state exam once again,

88
00:11:36,184 --> 00:11:42,434
and I will grant him the choice of the office he wishes to take if he passes the exam.

89
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:15,854
Thank you. And...

90
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:19,854
I am sorry.

91
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:25,614
I will always remember what happened with your sister

92
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:28,674
and live a life of atonement.

93
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:50,124
Your Majesty's grace knows no bounds.

94
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:03,344
 Now, we will discuss the crime and punishment for Yu Je Se.

95
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:06,084
 Ministers should advise.

96
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:09,634
Why did you do it?

97
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:13,844
You said you revered me, your father.

98
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:16,124
You said you wanted so much to be like me

99
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:19,044
that you would even imitate my calligraphy!

100
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:24,454
So why did you not obey me and instead go against me?

101
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:38,434
Because... I love you, Father.

102
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,514
You were born of a lowly family,

103
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:47,384
but you became successful solely by your own power

104
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:50,684
and rose to a position of royal recognition.

105
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:53,574
So I revered you so much.

106
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:57,684
I, too, wanted to become someone who could serve

107
00:13:57,684 --> 00:14:02,144
my nation and people by my own power.

108
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:05,054
However, you told me to merely enjoy

109
00:14:05,754 --> 00:14:10,664
what was given and passed down to me.

110
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:13,244
I did not want to live that way.

111
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:18,254
I wanted to accomplish something like you, Father.

112
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:25,624
Thus, I found and did what I could.

113
00:14:33,514 --> 00:14:37,514
In a single day, a king was deposed,

114
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:41,224
and a blood feud broke out between the brothers,

115
00:14:41,224 --> 00:14:44,844
leading to many loyal servants being executed.

116
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:49,714
It seemed like the boundary between right and wrong was disappearing.

117
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:55,094
One's values or beliefs are not what is important.

118
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:59,164
Retaining power at all costs...

119
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:02,744
Being at the center of all politics,

120
00:15:02,744 --> 00:15:07,284
and making a world for myself where things do not run without me.

121
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:14,364
Achieving that goal was more important than my life.

122
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:20,724
Honestly,

123
00:15:22,974 --> 00:15:24,994
I was afraid.

124
00:15:25,964 --> 00:15:29,074
I wanted to become more powerful because I was afraid.

125
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:34,644
I wanted to make sure my son would have a stable and comfortable life

126
00:15:34,644 --> 00:15:38,974
even in the midst of tumultuous power struggles.

127
00:15:40,414 --> 00:15:42,234
What I...

128
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:49,524
What I wanted to inherit was not power

129
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,784
but pride.

130
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:06,474
You were wrong, Father.

131
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:05,734
Yu Je Se framed Legal Officer Kang

132
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,664
and caused his death. Thus, the crime of false charges.

133
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:11,984
He hired someone to kill Park Je Su and covered it up as a suicide.

134
00:17:11,984 --> 00:17:15,214
Thus, soliciting murder, the crime of premeditated murder.

135
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:20,054
He also directly killed Chu Yeong Wu, committing the crime of murder.

136
00:17:20,054 --> 00:17:22,264
Due to the official judgment written in Legal Officer Kang's letter,

137
00:17:22,264 --> 00:17:25,534
along with the testimonies of Minister of General Affairs Park Kang Wu, Junior Deputy Minister of Rites Lee Man Gap,

138
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:27,714
and Grand Queen Dowager,

139
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:31,254
his crimes are verified, even without his own confession.

140
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:34,194
We also secured the testimony of Grand Merchant Jo Cheol Ju,

141
00:17:34,194 --> 00:17:37,464
who witnessed Yu Je Se killing Chu Yeong Wu.

142
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:41,344
He said he would testify in court if needed.

143
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:50,464
He is deserving of death just from the crimes that were mentioned.

144
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:58,054
Kang Han Su. What are your thoughts?

145
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:10,074
Since you ask, I will answer at the risk of being disrespectful.

146
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:16,254
Yu Je Se's crimes are deserving of capital punishment,

147
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:19,190
but we must also think about how he is recognized for

148
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,470
his great contributions to Joseon and the Ministry.

149
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:36,544
That is true, Your Majesty.

150
00:18:36,544 --> 00:18:41,094
Since the time he helped establish the Great King Se Jo's throne,

151
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:47,824
he has been listed in the Book of Meritorious Subjects four times as a vassal of merit.

152
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:52,404
Great King Se Jo said a vassal of merit

153
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:55,874
goes through the joys and sorrows of the nation together,

154
00:18:55,874 --> 00:19:02,024
so people should think of him as one body with the nation.

155
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:04,834
And practically, such a recognized figure and his descendants

156
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:09,634
received a reduced penalty, even if they committed a crime.

157
00:19:10,804 --> 00:19:14,084
Yes. Even among them, those recognized as top contributors

158
00:19:14,084 --> 00:19:18,754
were often forced to resign without any additional punishments.

159
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:24,624
Please lower Yu Je Se's punishment by one level from capital punishment,

160
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:29,514
have him receive 100 floggings, and exile him 3,000 li away.

161
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:36,964
What do you mean you will save his life? Were you not trying to get revenge?

162
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:41,504
How could it be proper revenge to end the life of a tiger that has lost its fangs?

163
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:45,004
That would only be good for you, Your Majesty.

164
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:49,544
If Minister Yu dies, the Hungu Party will also fall.

165
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:51,634
That means Sarim Party will dominate the Court.

166
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:57,404
Then Sarim will never speak up against you since you helped them rise to power.

167
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,494
The Court will only change the name of the dominant party,

168
00:19:59,494 --> 00:20:03,864
but it will be dominated by a single party nonetheless.

169
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,784
Are you saying that you will keep Minister Yu alive

170
00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:11,404
so that you can keep Sarim Party and me in check?

171
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:13,414
Yes.

172
00:20:13,414 --> 00:20:15,314
By staying alive,

173
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,394
Minister Yu will provide the focal point around which the Hungu Party can survive

174
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:23,844
and will provide a check for you, Your Majesty.

175
00:20:26,534 --> 00:20:28,274
Your Majesty,

176
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:33,834
the true punishment for Minister Yu is not death.

177
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:39,374
It is to watch the young king that he tried to use

178
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:47,444
as his puppet save his nation and people with his own power and become a great king.

179
00:20:49,304 --> 00:20:54,894
Thus, on the day that Joseon becomes a flourishing nation under a benevolent king,

180
00:20:58,854 --> 00:21:03,714
my vengeance will finally be...

181
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:07,174
complete.

182
00:21:11,124 --> 00:21:13,664
Kang Han Su is right.

183
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:24,804
Take away Yu Je Se's government position,

184
00:21:24,804 --> 00:21:28,214
and send him off to exile 3,000 li away.

185
00:21:30,794 --> 00:21:33,214
 Who knew he would be like that!

186
00:21:33,214 --> 00:21:36,100
♫  Run away  ♫

187
00:21:37,544 --> 00:21:39,864
It turns out he killed a lot of innocent men.

188
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:43,814
I guess he abused his power for his gain in his high position.

189
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,084
♫  Run away  ♫

190
00:21:46,084 --> 00:21:52,344
♫  Burning in my heart  ♫ 
 ♫  A search for the light of justice  ♫

191
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:58,244
♫  Faster, higher &nbsp;♫ 
♫  I want to reach it &nbsp;♫

192
00:22:56,034 --> 00:22:59,834
It appears you came because you worried about me. You need not feel sorry.

193
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:04,634
Yes. I will not feel sorry.

194
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,474
In return,

195
00:23:08,774 --> 00:23:12,304
you may blame me, Mayor...

196
00:23:14,524 --> 00:23:16,794
since I did the same.

197
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:36,444
What do you mean you cannot treat her anymore?

198
00:23:36,444 --> 00:23:41,734
If I use any more medicinal herbs, I cannot guarantee her welfare in the future.

199
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:46,464
Are you saying she may end up with a disability?

200
00:23:46,464 --> 00:23:48,094
Yes.

201
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:54,254
These medicinal herbs are quite potent, so there is a high chance that they may damage her organs.

202
00:23:54,254 --> 00:23:59,864
With a slight case, she might become infertile or go blind or deaf.

203
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:07,094
In more severe cases, she could become completely paralyzed and unable to move around.

204
00:24:07,094 --> 00:24:09,344
Only save her!

205
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:14,634
Your Highness, Princess sacrificed herself for Joseon and its people.

206
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:16,814
You cannot give up like this, Your Highness!

207
00:24:16,814 --> 00:24:20,574
Your Highness, if you will just save her life, I will spend the rest of my life

208
00:24:20,574 --> 00:24:25,694
serving the princess, acting as her eyes and ears!

209
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,444
Princess! Princess!

210
00:24:32,444 --> 00:24:34,404
Princess!

211
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:43,124
Royal Grandmother.

212
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:46,094
Are you awake?

213
00:24:46,094 --> 00:24:52,644
I am sorry... that I caused you to worry.

214
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:59,734
Please punish me.

215
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:03,974
Princess!

216
00:25:08,304 --> 00:25:13,140
I considered removing your title and erasing your name from the royal family genealogy.

217
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,514
But that will not be enough.

218
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:21,514
Thus, I am planning to kill you.

219
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:30,064
I will not work to save you.

220
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,534
Make up your mind, King!

221
00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:40,884
If the princess dies,

222
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:44,254
I will also leave the palace and enter a Buddhist temple

223
00:25:44,254 --> 00:25:47,734
and live the rest of my life in penitence and Buddhist service.

224
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:49,794
Royal Grandmother...

225
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:53,294
Then there will no longer be

226
00:25:53,294 --> 00:25:58,264
any shame or faults left in the royal family.

227
00:26:00,344 --> 00:26:05,264
This is what your grandmother has decided in the best interests of the court,

228
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:09,034
the royal family, and your future, King, so do as I say.

229
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:20,704
Do as you wish, Royal Grandmother.

230
00:26:40,084 --> 00:26:44,564
The Grand Merchant bought these medicinal herbs as soon as he recovered.

231
00:26:44,564 --> 00:26:48,314
Wow, how much is all this?

232
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,774
The merchant guild is actually quite amazing.

233
00:26:51,774 --> 00:26:53,254
Yeah.

234
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:57,454
If I had said I would testify sooner,

235
00:26:57,454 --> 00:27:01,354
then the princess would not have gone to such an extent.

236
00:27:05,164 --> 00:27:07,274
I am sorry.

237
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:12,284
Thank you.

238
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:15,194
All right, let us put them in our bags.

239
00:27:21,994 --> 00:27:24,854
Wait, it is quiet.

240
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:27,694
The security was tight just yesterday.

241
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,114
- We should go! 
 - Where?

242
00:27:40,114 --> 00:27:42,414
Gosh, move!

243
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:44,014
No! You cannot go!

244
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:46,374
If you are going to go, then step over me!

245
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:49,304
Are you joking? Move!

246
00:27:49,304 --> 00:27:52,104
Or if you are going to go, ride my back!

247
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,984
What? Okay, even better! Let us go!

248
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:57,264
- Go, go! Go, go! 
- Sir, sir...

249
00:27:57,264 --> 00:27:59,424
- Come on, Sir! 
- And what is with you?

250
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:02,534
I am just going to give her the medicine! Just the medicine!

251
00:28:02,534 --> 00:28:04,404
- Hurry up and let me go! 
 - Sir, Sir, Sir!

252
00:28:04,404 --> 00:28:07,184
Innkeeper Hong, please dissuade my hyeongnim!

253
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:11,274
I mean, he is saying that he will go barge into the palace again!

254
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:14,214
H-How is the princess?

255
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:18,844
If I cannot see her, please at least give this to her.

256
00:28:31,464 --> 00:28:33,894
The princess...

257
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,184
has passed away.

258
00:28:46,954 --> 00:28:48,624
It is the truth.

259
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:53,134
Court Lady Hong has just been sent away from the Palace as well.

260
00:29:08,934 --> 00:29:16,300
 In Mourning

261
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,940
 Funeral parade for Princess Lee

262
00:30:42,794 --> 00:30:45,714
 Whatever I did in the past,

263
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:49,854
 everything I do and choose will be for you

264
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:53,924
 starting today, Sir.

265
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:13,214
No! So Won...

266
00:31:43,874 --> 00:31:45,894
Who is it?

267
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:56,554
I said, who is it?

268
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:06,534
Aigoo... Minister Chu!

269
00:32:06,534 --> 00:32:09,004
Minister Chu, how are you here...

270
00:32:09,004 --> 00:32:11,454
How are you here, Minister Chu!

271
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:14,314
Minister Im!

272
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,114
You will die!

273
00:32:18,974 --> 00:32:21,324
Save me!

274
00:32:23,154 --> 00:32:25,414
Save me!

275
00:32:25,414 --> 00:32:27,914
Please save me!

276
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:51,134
 The reason why I am letting you live

277
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:53,714
 is to show you what kind of king I become

278
00:32:53,714 --> 00:32:58,134
 and how I will be recorded in history.

279
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:00,694
 Watch closely...

280
00:33:01,494 --> 00:33:07,194
 how Joseon enters a brilliant age without you.

281
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:10,234
(Holding the letter upside down)

282
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:25,694
The court of ministers acts as the king's eyes and ears,

283
00:33:25,694 --> 00:33:27,754
and thus requires your attention.

284
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:32,444
Even if their words may bother you, you should accept them magnanimously

285
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:36,574
in order to watch over many officials.

286
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:44,404
 I will be careful and watch out so that I may become

287
00:33:44,404 --> 00:33:50,814
 an independent king without becoming a dictator.

288
00:34:00,644 --> 00:34:02,704
Please eat.

289
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,194
Eat.

290
00:34:13,194 --> 00:34:15,494
Thank you for the food.

291
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:58,854
Gosh, why are you crying in front of your food?

292
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,274
I am fine.

293
00:35:04,274 --> 00:35:06,334
I was just...

294
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:10,754
What is your name?

295
00:35:21,394 --> 00:35:23,814
Ji for intention.

296
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:27,234
 - Ji for intention! 
- Good! That was right.

297
00:35:27,234 --> 00:35:28,884
 That was right.

298
00:35:28,884 --> 00:35:32,504
 Then shall we try writing it out?

299
00:35:39,544 --> 00:35:41,394
 Nice!

300
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:43,914
 - Seon for kind. 
- Seon for kind!

301
00:35:43,914 --> 00:35:46,254
 - Seon for kind. 
- Seon for kind!

302
00:35:46,254 --> 00:35:48,394
 You did well.

303
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:55,904
My name is Yu Ji Seon.

304
00:35:58,264 --> 00:36:02,744
My father named me that so I will live with good intentions.

305
00:36:03,974 --> 00:36:06,724
That is a good name, yes.

306
00:36:06,724 --> 00:36:09,054
Did you get married?

307
00:36:09,054 --> 00:36:10,364
Not yet.

308
00:36:10,364 --> 00:36:14,784
Gosh, I guess you need to get married first.

309
00:36:14,784 --> 00:36:20,124
But goodness, how can a person live just eating things like this?

310
00:36:22,044 --> 00:36:24,574
You are right.

311
00:36:24,574 --> 00:36:27,624
Gosh, the king would need to rule justly

312
00:36:27,624 --> 00:36:30,644
for the people to marry without worries

313
00:36:30,644 --> 00:36:34,624
and bear children without problems.

314
00:36:38,454 --> 00:36:40,954
So how is the outside world?

315
00:36:40,954 --> 00:36:43,184
Is it a time of prosperity?

316
00:36:44,234 --> 00:36:46,004
Yes.

317
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:50,734
Right now, more than at any time, Joseon is a good place to live.

318
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:56,124
I heard that praise for the king from outlying districts is reaching even the city.

319
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:58,014
All right!

320
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:04,214
I finally get to see such a world as an old man before I die.

321
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:08,444
Look here, young man.

322
00:37:08,444 --> 00:37:13,844
I dreamed of such a world all my life.

323
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:26,354
- Did you? 
- Yeah.

324
00:37:28,764 --> 00:37:31,244
Eat. You should eat.

325
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,940
 Collection of Sentencing

326
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,680
 Great Collection of Laws

327
00:37:53,034 --> 00:37:58,554
 Your Majesty, the new Town Head of Cheonsan has come to see you.

328
00:37:58,554 --> 00:38:00,424
Have him come in.

329
00:38:15,764 --> 00:38:18,604
Have you been well, Your Majesty?

330
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:21,404
It has been a while, Kang Han—

331
00:38:21,404 --> 00:38:25,114
I mean, Town Head Kang.

332
00:38:25,114 --> 00:38:27,934
You look great.

333
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:31,344
This is all thanks to you, Your Majesty.

334
00:38:32,244 --> 00:38:35,474
I mean, you gave such easy questions for the state exam.

335
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:38,894
I could not fail the exam, even if I wanted to!

336
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:41,404
You are full of jokes, as usual.

337
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:44,314
Even the Sungkyunkwan scholars were all saying it was difficult.

338
00:38:44,314 --> 00:38:46,254
- Goodness. 
 - Unbelievable.

339
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:50,154
All right. What was the reason why you chose Cheongsan of all places?

340
00:38:50,154 --> 00:38:52,684
I mean, there are other villages to live in

341
00:38:52,684 --> 00:38:55,874
that are big and comfortable, like Naju or Gongju.

342
00:38:55,874 --> 00:38:59,544
Consider the saying about how even foxes point their heads toward their den when they die.

343
00:38:59,544 --> 00:39:02,574
I should save my hometown first before anything.

344
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:05,084
I believe you will succeed.

345
00:39:06,414 --> 00:39:10,044
But are you not getting married yet?

346
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,234
I am not interested.

347
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:16,634
Even if I were to introduce someone to you?

348
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:20,854
- You would, Your Majesty? 
- Are you doubting my eye?

349
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:23,514
Eunuch Ko.

350
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:33,044
She came from the queen's private residence.

351
00:39:33,044 --> 00:39:38,554
She is returning home after a visit, so please escort her home.

352
00:39:38,554 --> 00:39:41,974
Gosh! Oh, oh! There is a place I need to stop by, so—

353
00:39:41,974 --> 00:39:44,104
I am ordering you as your king.

354
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:47,024
The king's order? But we are friends.

355
00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:49,104
These are my orders as king.

356
00:40:08,494 --> 00:40:10,364
Sir.

357
00:40:11,884 --> 00:40:13,484
Well...

358
00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:16,374
What is it?

359
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:18,694
It is this way.

360
00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:24,994
You know your way around very well.

361
00:40:24,994 --> 00:40:28,574
Of course. I walk this road every day.

362
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:30,264
Then...

363
00:40:32,574 --> 00:40:34,794
- you can go by yourself, right? 
- Pardon?

364
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:37,114
Go safely now.

365
00:40:54,414 --> 00:40:57,804
Gosh, there's no dimensionality to her. They are too flat.

366
00:40:57,804 --> 00:41:00,254
Can we draw a variety of ways to show her hair?

367
00:41:00,254 --> 00:41:03,644
Hair in a bun, in a braid, and even a wig.

368
00:41:03,644 --> 00:41:08,174
Well, how about we draw one with some meat on her?

369
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,384
Shall we?

370
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:15,984
Yeah. It has been three years already. So she could have gained some weight.

371
00:41:23,744 --> 00:41:29,284
It has been three years already. When will you promote me to a merchant position?

372
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:35,544
Back then, on that forested mountain, I even saved your life, Grand Merchant.

373
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:45,554
That is not the issue here.

374
00:41:46,344 --> 00:41:50,014
This time, let us try going down to Gyeongsangdo.

375
00:41:50,014 --> 00:41:55,064
The business is important, but my promise to Attorney Kang is even more important.

376
00:41:55,064 --> 00:41:56,484
Yes.

377
00:41:56,484 --> 00:41:58,524
Always giving excuses...

378
00:41:58,524 --> 00:42:01,054
I wonder if I should go back to farming.

379
00:42:01,054 --> 00:42:04,044
Not just anyone is destined to farm.

380
00:42:14,794 --> 00:42:17,654
 Reward 300 nyang. Contact Grand Merchant Jo.

381
00:42:21,944 --> 00:42:24,934
Hey, Jeong Chu Su!

382
00:42:24,934 --> 00:42:26,964
Sir!

383
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:36,284
We are looking all over for her, but...

384
00:42:36,284 --> 00:42:39,754
Yeah, I know. I am sure it is not easy to find her.

385
00:42:39,754 --> 00:42:44,234
She is not even alive. She is dead.

386
00:42:44,234 --> 00:42:46,224
Who says she is dead?

387
00:42:46,224 --> 00:42:48,234
But still...

388
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:52,184
the palace even had a funeral for her.

389
00:42:58,074 --> 00:43:01,734
We did not see her corpse. Her corpse...

390
00:43:02,624 --> 00:43:05,964
Unless I see it with my own eyes, I do not believe it.

391
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,740
 Tavern

392
00:43:38,314 --> 00:43:40,564
 They call me "Heavenly Shot Glass."

393
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:44,284
 because if they play drinking games with me, they see heaven.

394
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:38,804
Is it a dream?

395
00:44:47,694 --> 00:44:51,824
Nice...

396
00:44:57,974 --> 00:45:03,924
 I am sorry, but you will not be able to bear children.

397
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:09,074
 Although you have survived, all that remains for you is shame and humiliation.

398
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:12,304
 Everything shattered even before the wedding ceremony.

399
00:45:12,304 --> 00:45:15,294
 So your life as a woman is over!

400
00:45:15,294 --> 00:45:18,604
 Would you be able to handle all this?

401
00:45:18,604 --> 00:45:21,524
 G-G-G-Great Royal Dowager Queen!

402
00:45:21,524 --> 00:45:25,324
 Please spare the princess! Your Highness!

403
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:31,334
 So I will let the world think that you are dead and let you leave the palace.

404
00:45:35,704 --> 00:45:40,114
 Then you will no longer be able to live as Princess Yeon Ju.

405
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:43,564
 You will no longer receive the protection of the royal family.

406
00:45:43,564 --> 00:45:46,824
 You will live like any other woman, enduring the storms of life

407
00:45:46,824 --> 00:45:50,424
 and going through hardships.

408
00:45:54,014 --> 00:45:59,244
 I have always longed for

409
00:45:59,244 --> 00:46:03,134
 and dreamed of such a life since long ago.

410
00:46:03,974 --> 00:46:09,024
 Royal Grandmother, I will never forget the grace you have granted me, even in death.

411
00:46:11,124 --> 00:46:14,714
 You have saved yourself.

412
00:46:14,714 --> 00:46:17,164
 Your desperate yearning

413
00:46:17,164 --> 00:46:20,794
 has led you to the life you have wanted.

414
00:46:25,904 --> 00:46:28,314
 My poor baby.

415
00:46:29,184 --> 00:46:32,484
 Please forgive me for having to pay for the sins

416
00:46:32,484 --> 00:46:36,924
 that I have committed in this way.

417
00:46:54,574 --> 00:46:58,524
But you know, what kind of crime did this young lady commit

418
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,904
that there is a reward for her that is worth 300 nyang?

419
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:03,024
- Three hundred nyang?
 - Yeah!

420
00:47:03,024 --> 00:47:04,610
Look.
  Reward 300 nyang. Contact Grand Merchant Jo.

421
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:05,810
 Reward 300 nyang. Contact Grand Merchant Jo.

422
00:47:09,834 --> 00:47:13,644
- Why?
 - Do you want to look at it?

423
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:19,374
I will buy your drinks!

424
00:47:25,734 --> 00:47:26,874
Aigoo, what in the world! 
  Reward 300 nyang. Contact Grand Merchant Jo.

425
00:47:26,874 --> 00:47:30,964
 Reward 300 nyang. Contact Grand Merchant Jo.

426
00:47:38,134 --> 00:47:42,940
♫  In the traces left by the setting sun &nbsp;♫

427
00:47:43,854 --> 00:47:47,504
♫  My heart also becomes empty &nbsp;♫

428
00:47:47,504 --> 00:47:52,864
 It is all over now. So please live your own life, Sir.

429
00:47:54,054 --> 00:47:56,694
 An ordinary life like other people.

430
00:47:56,694 --> 00:48:01,024
 Get married, have children,

431
00:48:01,024 --> 00:48:03,364
 and live like others do.

432
00:48:05,094 --> 00:48:14,134
♫  A piece of a forgotten memory &nbsp;♫ 
 ♫  Comes&nbsp;raining down &nbsp;♫

433
00:48:14,134 --> 00:48:15,914
Sir!

434
00:48:16,874 --> 00:48:20,624
♫  Turning back time &nbsp;♫

435
00:48:22,264 --> 00:48:24,224
I knitted this myself.

436
00:48:24,224 --> 00:48:31,244
The scarf you have on looks pretty worn out.

437
00:48:31,244 --> 00:48:37,994
Thank you for your thoughts, but I am warm enough with this one.

438
00:48:37,994 --> 00:48:41,954
As for the person in my heart as well.

439
00:48:41,954 --> 00:48:44,800
I will not change my mind.

440
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,030
♫  Affectionately calling your name  ♫

441
00:48:47,034 --> 00:48:52,334
♫  Saying I love you for no reason &nbsp;♫

442
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:55,394
♫  I want to go back to that time ♫

443
00:48:55,394 --> 00:49:02,234
♫ And meet you just once more ♫

444
00:49:03,784 --> 00:49:06,634
 Cheongsan

445
00:49:13,724 --> 00:49:17,464
- He looks familiar.
 - I know. Where did I see him?

446
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:26,054
You sure are outstanding.

447
00:49:26,054 --> 00:49:31,344
I cannot believe you are returning home in glory as a magistrate.

448
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:33,604
Why are you crying?

449
00:49:43,144 --> 00:49:47,574
Magistrate, it is my honor and glory to serve you, Sir!

450
00:49:47,574 --> 00:49:50,054
We have prepared this food for you with all our care.

451
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:52,214
Please enjoy without feeling any burden.

452
00:49:52,214 --> 00:49:55,544
Oh, my goodness! You did not have to!

453
00:49:55,544 --> 00:50:00,094
Then shall I grease my intestines today? It has been quite a while.

454
00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:09,644
Do you see that man with a harpoon?

455
00:50:11,734 --> 00:50:13,444
There is nothing there, though.

456
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,454
- Really? 
- Yes.

457
00:50:19,944 --> 00:50:22,624
Save us, merciful Buddha!

458
00:50:22,624 --> 00:50:24,444
Gosh, Magistrate!

459
00:50:24,444 --> 00:50:28,834
Why do you keep freaking out?

460
00:50:32,004 --> 00:50:33,734
What is this?

461
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,290
No, don't!

462
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:52,724
Why in the world are you doing this!

463
00:50:52,724 --> 00:50:55,024
Is something wrong with the food?

464
00:50:55,024 --> 00:50:59,444
This... is not food!

465
00:50:59,444 --> 00:51:01,184
This is the fisherman Kang's,

466
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:04,404
and this is the monk from the Pyeongahnsa Temple's, and this is

467
00:51:04,404 --> 00:51:10,044
from the villager Yang's vengeful spirit!

468
00:51:12,084 --> 00:51:14,164
Shame on you all!

469
00:51:14,164 --> 00:51:17,464
How dare you say you prepared it with care with the food you took away from the people?

470
00:51:17,464 --> 00:51:19,374
Are you not afraid of Heaven?

471
00:51:19,374 --> 00:51:22,364
My apologies, Magistrate! This will never happen again!

472
00:51:22,364 --> 00:51:25,794
 - Please forgive us.  
- Fine!

473
00:51:26,704 --> 00:51:28,834
I will try putting my trust in your words.

474
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:33,864
One person cannot rule over the earth,

475
00:51:33,864 --> 00:51:36,364
and that is why there is a magistrate in each village.

476
00:51:36,364 --> 00:51:41,734
Thus I am here to be of help and not act as a thief.

477
00:51:43,554 --> 00:51:48,254
Do not make me a thief.

478
00:51:49,284 --> 00:51:53,734
- We will surely keep that in mind, Sir. 
 - We'll keep that in mind, Sir.

479
00:51:56,594 --> 00:51:59,194
Here. It is the price of the fish that I did not get to pay you for last time.

480
00:51:59,194 --> 00:52:02,064
Oh! Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo!

481
00:52:02,064 --> 00:52:04,564
Aigoo, thank you!

482
00:52:09,744 --> 00:52:13,794
Aigoo, thank you, Sir! Thank you!

483
00:52:16,574 --> 00:52:18,304
I want to secure this area here.

484
00:52:18,304 --> 00:52:21,484
When you appoint a leader, the difference between having his family with him or not—

485
00:52:21,484 --> 00:52:24,314
No, no, before the appointment,

486
00:52:24,314 --> 00:52:26,264
you have to start by properly establishing the recommendation process.

487
00:52:26,264 --> 00:52:29,884
If one commits corruption, the one who recommended him should also be punished—

488
00:52:29,884 --> 00:52:32,844
How will you punish those who become corrupt later on, then?

489
00:52:32,844 --> 00:52:36,264
You should not recommend the person if you cannot vouch for him.

490
00:52:36,264 --> 00:52:38,844
Okay, that is that.

491
00:52:38,844 --> 00:52:42,544
Now, whether you are a vassal of merit or royal blood, you are a criminal if you commit a crime.

492
00:52:42,544 --> 00:52:46,204
The fact that the punishment differs depending on your status is so unfair! Is it not?

493
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:50,084
Without such benefit, who would want to devote themselves to the nation?

494
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,234
Ha! I am sure there are other means of gathering crumbs from off the table.

495
00:52:53,234 --> 00:52:56,024
Come on now! Crumbs?

496
00:52:56,024 --> 00:53:00,024
You are now a town magistrate. How could you speak so frivolously?

497
00:53:00,024 --> 00:53:01,174
- Frivolously? 
- Frivolously.

498
00:53:01,174 --> 00:53:02,634
Did you just say I was frivolous?

499
00:53:02,634 --> 00:53:05,314
- Frivolous. 
- Say it again.

500
00:53:05,314 --> 00:53:06,264
- Frivolous. 
- Frivolous?

501
00:53:06,264 --> 00:53:08,324
- I will say it a hundred, a thousand times. 
- He says I am frivolous—

502
00:53:08,324 --> 00:53:10,154
Both of you.

503
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,244
How long will you keep this up?

504
00:53:13,244 --> 00:53:17,344
I summoned you to edit documents from the Gamgyocheong, and what in the world?

505
00:53:17,344 --> 00:53:20,334
 Gamgyeochong: Interim group formed to correct and augment the Book of Law.

506
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:26,314
Therefore, Your Majesty, how about if we ask Magistrate Kang to return to Cheongsan?

507
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:31,224
I do not want to go.

508
00:53:33,274 --> 00:53:36,974
How can I go anywhere and leave such a vital task to the both of you who were born with a golden umbilical cord?

509
00:53:36,974 --> 00:53:38,424
I am not going anywhere.

510
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:43,244
I will definitely reflect the voice of the people for the next edition of the Book of Laws.

511
00:53:45,604 --> 00:53:48,984
You keep calling me a "golden umbilical cord."

512
00:53:48,984 --> 00:53:52,684
Abandon your bias, thinking that we would not know the hearts of the people due to our status.

513
00:53:52,684 --> 00:53:54,454
That is right.

514
00:53:58,514 --> 00:54:01,384
As they say, birds of a feather flock together. Same difference.

515
00:54:01,384 --> 00:54:05,934
Both of you born with golden umbilical cords sure are hitting it off.

516
00:54:10,554 --> 00:54:12,484
Eunuch Ko...

517
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:29,620
 Yisan 
 Cheongsan

518
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,194
In the next town over in Yisan, 
  Yisan 
 Cheongsan

519
00:54:31,194 --> 00:54:34,964
 I hear there is a pretty competent and popular attorney.

520
00:54:34,964 --> 00:54:37,204
 If you have some time, go ahead and meet the attorney.

521
00:54:37,204 --> 00:54:39,294
An attorney?

522
00:55:04,594 --> 00:55:07,504
 I will make your wish come true - Attorney Lee So Won*
 (Sowon means "wish" in Korean.)

523
00:55:08,914 --> 00:55:11,214
Reminds me of the good old days.

524
00:55:14,934 --> 00:55:19,010
 I will make your wish come true - Attorney Lee So Won

525
00:55:23,204 --> 00:55:26,094
Anything you feel is unfair or unjust, just tell me!

526
00:55:26,094 --> 00:55:27,444
I will take care of it for you!

527
00:55:27,444 --> 00:55:30,174
Anything you feel is unfair or unjust, just tell me!

528
00:55:30,174 --> 00:55:32,224
I will take care of it for you!

529
00:55:32,224 --> 00:55:34,724
Anything you feel is unfair or unjust, just tell me!

530
00:55:34,724 --> 00:55:36,464
- I will take care of it for you!
 - No, it's okay.

531
00:55:36,464 --> 00:55:39,574
Anything you feel is unfair or unjust, just tell me!

532
00:55:39,574 --> 00:55:42,664
I will take care of it for you!

533
00:55:42,664 --> 00:55:45,114
Who the heck?

534
00:55:45,114 --> 00:55:49,870
♫  I always remember  ♫

535
00:55:52,024 --> 00:55:56,550
♫  The moment I first saw you  ♫

536
00:55:59,204 --> 00:56:05,494
♫  I knew &nbsp;♫ 
♫  That our time exists in the same space &nbsp;♫

537
00:56:05,494 --> 00:56:07,744
What is with you?

538
00:56:07,744 --> 00:56:11,094
♫  I knew that our time exists in the same space  ♫

539
00:56:13,134 --> 00:56:15,454
What are you trying to do here?

540
00:56:15,454 --> 00:56:20,294
You were alive and well! So, why?

541
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:27,134
♫  I will forever &nbsp;♫ 
♫  Stay&nbsp;by your side &nbsp;♫

542
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:31,754

543
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:37,240
♫  I will protect you in the midst of it  ♫

544
00:56:38,374 --> 00:56:42,044
I missed you.

545
00:56:42,044 --> 00:56:46,784
Really.

546
00:56:46,784 --> 00:56:51,390
I thought I was going to die missing you.

547
00:56:52,164 --> 00:56:56,124
♫  I am waiting for you here  ♫

548
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:59,254
♫  Hold my hand  ♫

549

Me, too.

♫  Even if it hurts like crazy  ♫

553

555
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,950
 Legal Department

556
00:57:34,824 --> 00:57:40,944
♫  Can't you understand my heart? &nbsp;♫

557
00:57:40,944 --> 00:57:45,110
This is how you do the matchmaking, Your Majesty.

558
00:57:46,224 --> 00:57:50,174
I learned something new today.

559
00:57:50,174 --> 00:57:57,040
♫  Come back to me &nbsp;♫ 
♫  Embrace me tightly &nbsp;♫

560
00:57:58,554 --> 00:58:01,384
Okay. Let me see you!

561
00:58:01,384 --> 00:58:04,424
- Did you regain your health now?
 - Almost.

562
00:58:04,424 --> 00:58:07,854
So why did you live in hiding for years?

563
00:58:07,854 --> 00:58:08,804
Well, because—

564
00:58:08,804 --> 00:58:11,104
How long have you been working as an attorney?

565
00:58:11,104 --> 00:58:13,104
Oh, as for that...

566
00:58:13,104 --> 00:58:15,704
Do you even know how much money I spent to find you?

567
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:17,554
I mean, that's not the point here.

568
00:58:17,554 --> 00:58:21,474
I am at a point where I can draw your face with my eyes closed.

569
00:58:21,474 --> 00:58:26,304
You could have been humane and sent me a letter, at least.

570
00:58:26,304 --> 00:58:27,974
That is because...

571
00:58:27,974 --> 00:58:29,764
By chance...

572
00:58:30,794 --> 00:58:32,984
- did you find another man? 
- Excuse me?

573
00:58:32,984 --> 00:58:35,334
For whose sake did you become even prettier?

574
00:58:35,334 --> 00:58:39,194
Geez! How long will you question me?

575
00:58:40,044 --> 00:58:44,344
I mean, that is not what is important here.

576
00:58:45,824 --> 00:58:49,614
Then... what is?

577
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:09,010
♫  In the traces left by the setting sun &nbsp;♫

578
00:59:09,974 --> 00:59:14,280
♫  My heart also becomes empty  ♫

579
00:59:15,014 --> 00:59:16,764
♫  The time that burned brightly &nbsp;♫

580
00:59:16,764 --> 00:59:21,744
We could talk about...

581
00:59:21,744 --> 00:59:25,994
all those things eventually.

582
00:59:25,994 --> 00:59:32,114
♫  With the sound of the falling raindrops &nbsp;♫

583
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:33,594
Is that so?

584
00:59:33,594 --> 00:59:41,130
♫  A piece of a forgotten memory &nbsp;♫ 
 ♫  Comes&nbsp;raining down &nbsp;♫

585
00:59:43,034 --> 00:59:46,664
♫  Turning back time  ♫

586
00:59:46,664 --> 00:59:52,044
♫  As I see you going further away  ♫

587
00:59:52,044 --> 00:59:57,184
♫  I'll run and call your painful name &nbsp;♫

588
00:59:57,184 --> 01:00:04,904
♫  Wiping away the tears that flow white  ♫

589
01:00:04,904 --> 01:00:08,214
 I did not want to be a burden to you

590
01:00:08,214 --> 01:00:11,254
 because I did not think

591
01:00:11,254 --> 01:00:15,264
 I could live a life you dreamed of with you.

592
01:00:15,264 --> 01:00:18,444
 You are always my answer.

593
01:00:18,444 --> 01:00:21,984
 You are my dream and my life.

594
01:00:21,984 --> 01:00:27,314
 So do not ever think such thoughts

595
01:00:27,314 --> 01:00:29,660
 and stay by my side.

596
01:01:05,444 --> 01:01:09,414
I am sorry, Innkeeper Hong.

597
01:01:09,414 --> 01:01:11,714
What are you sorry about?

598
01:01:11,714 --> 01:01:13,514
I...

599
01:01:14,354 --> 01:01:18,534
want to stay by your side.

600
01:01:19,224 --> 01:01:21,954
but after what happened to So Won,

601
01:01:21,954 --> 01:01:25,674
for my hyeongnim,

602
01:01:25,674 --> 01:01:28,854
this Dong Chi is the only one he's got.

603
01:01:28,854 --> 01:01:30,494
That is true.

604
01:01:30,494 --> 01:01:34,084
If only So Won was still around.

605
01:01:34,084 --> 01:01:39,704
I could leave that rude bastard

606
01:01:39,704 --> 01:01:45,804
and permanently be by your side, Innkeeper Hong.

607
01:01:52,914 --> 01:01:55,534
Do not cry.

608
01:01:55,534 --> 01:02:01,604
You will someday be by my side forever.

609
01:02:02,964 --> 01:02:04,794
Someday when?

610
01:02:05,664 --> 01:02:07,874
Someday.

611
01:02:09,534 --> 01:02:11,494
After I die?

612
01:02:12,224 --> 01:02:14,134
In the afterlife?

613
01:02:14,134 --> 01:02:17,664
Nope. In this lifetime.

614
01:02:17,664 --> 01:02:19,784
In this lifetime?

615
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:26,684
To be honest...

616
01:02:35,174 --> 01:02:38,324
you know the princess?

617
01:02:38,324 --> 01:02:40,664
Yes, the princess?

618
01:02:51,704 --> 01:02:54,054
What about the princess?

619
01:03:17,304 --> 01:03:22,654
Aigoo, why do people who cannot even handle alcohol drink?

620
01:03:30,084 --> 01:03:32,504
Give me a break.

621
01:03:33,274 --> 01:03:35,504
What in the world?

622
01:03:35,504 --> 01:03:37,874
What to do...

623
01:04:01,934 --> 01:04:04,714
♫  Already, spring has come for both of us &nbsp;♫

624
01:04:04,714 --> 01:04:08,554
♫  For you and me, it's our first time &nbsp;♫
 ♫  Spring is blossoming &nbsp;♫

625
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:13,944
♫  Our love &nbsp;♫ 
 ♫  Will deepen in this spring &nbsp;♫

626
01:04:13,944 --> 01:04:19,994
♫  When I hold you &nbsp;♫ 
♫  Nothing could be better than this &nbsp;♫

627
01:04:19,994 --> 01:04:23,784
♫  We are experiencing spring like this again &nbsp;♫

628
01:04:32,104 --> 01:04:35,880
 Service Rules

629
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,390
 Immediate Payment Required

630
01:04:51,794 --> 01:04:53,964
What is No. 5 of the Wishes Inn service rules?

631
01:04:53,964 --> 01:04:57,194
You must keep the promise you make to your customer.

632
01:04:57,194 --> 01:04:59,614
Pass.

633
01:04:59,614 --> 01:05:02,784
Clean your nails.

634
01:05:05,254 --> 01:05:07,994
The customer ate soup and rice and ran off. What do you do?

635
01:05:07,994 --> 01:05:10,314
Run after him and stop him.

636
01:05:11,084 --> 01:05:14,414
And give him a bowl to go,

637
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:17,064
So he can share it with his family.

638
01:05:18,044 --> 01:05:19,864
Pass.

639
01:05:26,024 --> 01:05:27,194
All right.

640
01:05:27,194 --> 01:05:32,564
Then, as usual, shall we start business energetically?

641
01:05:32,564 --> 01:05:35,104

 Father, the Comprehensive Book of the Law that you have been aspiring to compile

654
01:07:11,434 --> 01:07:15,554
 has finally been completed through much discussion,

655
01:07:15,554 --> 01:07:18,084
 editing, and review.

656
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:20,974
 This law will touch every corner of the people's lives

657
01:07:20,974 --> 01:07:23,854
 just like the moon at night and rain during a drought.

658
01:07:23,854 --> 01:07:29,674
 I will work hard so that it will be fair to those who are affected by it.

659
01:07:29,674 --> 01:07:32,564
 I am sure it will take some time.

660
01:07:32,564 --> 01:07:37,514
 However, we will not stop our progress.

661
01:07:54,914 --> 01:08:04,450
 In the year 1485, under the reign of King Seongjong, the final Gyeongguk Daejeon (Great Collection of Laws) was published.

662
01:08:13,664 --> 01:08:16,070
♫  Run away  ♫

663
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:19,470
 We worked with animal experts for scenes involving animals for their safety.

664
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:22,530
♫  We got the liar  ♫

665
01:08:26,214 --> 01:08:27,974
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

666
01:08:27,974 --> 01:08:29,804
What are you talking about?

667
01:08:29,804 --> 01:08:34,000
What do you mean? I am saying I...

668
01:08:39,884 --> 01:08:44,034
Princess... Princess...

669
01:08:44,034 --> 01:08:46,314
Princess...

670
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,360
♫  Even if I’m trampled, I won’t stop &nbsp;♫

671
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,444
Gosh, seriously...

672
01:08:55,444 --> 01:08:58,344
Three hundred floggings!

673
01:08:58,344 --> 01:09:01,034
Yes! That is right!

674
01:09:03,364 --> 01:09:06,314
Okay, let us vote between the two ladies.

675
01:09:06,314 --> 01:09:10,314
See who is prettier. The three of us will vote.

676
01:09:10,314 --> 01:09:12,614
No? Yes? Let us try!

677
01:09:12,614 --> 01:09:15,734
One, two, three!

678
01:09:16,584 --> 01:09:19,514
Yes, this side is a bit prettier.

679
01:09:19,514 --> 01:09:21,250
You're right—

680
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:25,870
♫  Faster, higher &nbsp;♫ 
♫  I want to reach it &nbsp;♫

681
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,340
♫  Run Away &nbsp;♫

682
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:34,514
 Thank you for watching Joseon Attorney!

683
01:09:34,514 --> 01:09:36,440
Bye!

684
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:43,299
