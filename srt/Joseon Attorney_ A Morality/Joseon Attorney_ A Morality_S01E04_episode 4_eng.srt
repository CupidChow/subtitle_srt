1
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:38,764
Are you saying you will fire me? Are you sure you are thinking straight?

2
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:40,224
Yes, today more so than ever.

3
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:44,044
Do you think you could find someone who could resolve this situation aside from me?

4
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,414
Fine. Even if there were, it would take some time to find him,

5
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,474
and the lady's health will end up deteriorating.

6
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:50,684
Do not pretend to be concerned about the lady.

7
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:53,214
The mere solution you suggested was...

8
00:00:53,214 --> 00:00:54,974
And even if you defeat the chief advisor,

9
00:00:54,974 --> 00:00:57,114
would you be sincerely happy and relieved on her behalf?

10
00:00:57,114 --> 00:00:59,214
To be blunt, what if you fail after going to that extent?

11
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:00,594
I will not fail!

12
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:04,204
There is no guarantee that you will succeed twice just because you won once.

13
00:01:04,204 --> 00:01:05,994
As for me, at least,

14
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:09,584
I do believe that justice triumphs in the end.

15
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:12,714
I will say it again. I will go through the proper legal route.

16
00:01:12,714 --> 00:01:18,544
Whether it is a witness or evidence, I will find everything and will reveal the lady's innocence.

17
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:20,714
You are dreaming.

18
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:23,734
All right.

19
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:25,824
Within the bounds of a custom called marriage,

20
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:29,334
the weight of the duty that has to be carried is one-sided between a man and his wife.

21
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:32,234
The husband can abandon his wife, but the wife cannot.

22
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:34,934
The husband can punish his wife, but the wife cannot punish her husband.

23
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:38,114
And the law of the land says there is such a person as a wicked wife but never a wicked husband.

24
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:40,634
In a land where the law is already one-sided, what?

25
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,214
The proper legal way?

26
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:46,454
Well, fine then. Good luck to you.

27
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:48,904
If you manage to rescue the lady your way,

28
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:52,024
I will serve you as my master that day.

29
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:54,244
You mean it, right?

30
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:55,494
Promise me then.

31
00:01:55,494 --> 00:01:56,804
Sure.

32
00:01:56,804 --> 00:01:59,044
Okay, then.

33
00:01:59,044 --> 00:02:01,494
Here. My promise.

34
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:04,194
What in the world?

35
00:02:04,194 --> 00:02:06,114
My promise.

36
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:15,084
Fine. Leave, go.

37
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:18,414
To win the divorce case, you must know everything about Chief Advisor.

38
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:22,374
What his drunken habits are, if he snores or grinds his teeth in bed...

39
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:25,534
You must find out all the details and expose who he really is.

40
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:27,314
And you say you will do all that?

41
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,054
Without me? By yourself?

42
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:31,684
Do you think you could handle it?

43
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:38,004
 However, if you get divorced,

44
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:42,224
 you can protect the property you inherited from your parents.

45
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:50,104
 Would it not be the ultimate revenge to prevent him from taking that property he desires so much?

46
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:53,934
 Land and property ownership documents

47
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:56,414
All right.

48
00:02:56,414 --> 00:03:01,334
 It means you have to give up at least one leg to achieve your goal.

49
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:04,044
 I will go through the proper legal route.

50
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:06,994
 I will prove that Chief Advisor falsely accused the lady

51
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:10,834
 and make him pay for his crime and get them divorced.

52
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:22,014
 Episode 4: Divorce Suit Vol. 2

53
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:27,544
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

54
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:34,454
 Closed for the day

55
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,350
 Wishes Inn

56
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,104
I will go and look for a new attorney,

57
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:44,174
and you have to do something for me in the meantime.

58
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:46,354
Please give your order.

59
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:50,114
To win a divorce lawsuit,

60
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:54,864
find out what kind of person Chief Advisor is and what he did to the lady.

61
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:56,834
 You must know everything about Chief Advisor.

62
00:03:56,834 --> 00:04:01,234
 What his drunken habits are, if he snores or grinds his teeth in bed...

63
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:04,964
 You must find out all the details and expose who he really is.

64
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:09,434
He says it is essential to discover all the details and expose who he really is.

65
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:11,334
"He says"?

66
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:15,624
It is... It is important, is it not?

67
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:18,064
Yeah, right. Yes, it's important. Very important.

68
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:19,364
It's important.

69
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:21,264
So...

70
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:28,754
 Yun, monitor his every move and find even the smallest flaw.

71
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:30,814
 Meet everyone who is connected to him.

72
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:35,554
 We must think through even the number of spoons they own, pillows, even the cotton feathers.

73
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:44,660

74
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,870
 Wishes Inn

75
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,614
 Nanny, you should find people who could testify to the lady's usual behavior

76
00:04:52,614 --> 00:04:56,004
 and receive their signed statement that they pledge to rescue the lady.

77
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,934
 Baek, be sure to feed the lady well so her health does not deteriorate.

78
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:04,264
My Lady, you must eat and gain strength. Okay?

79
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,544
You have told her everything she needs to know then.

80
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,794
I think she will pull it off without you, Hyeongnim.

81
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:17,044
No way. Never.

82
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:21,264
Well, I did let her know nonchalantly, so I am sure she will be able to act the part.

83
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:23,354
But that would be all.

84
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:29,064
I am sure she will seek me out at some point and will realize that my method is the right way to go.

85
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:31,114
Well, I guess...

86
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:33,204
there would not be an attorney who would come forward, either.

87
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:34,594
That is right!

88
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:38,044
Does she think that the world is that easy to control?

89
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:40,544
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa...

90
00:05:40,544 --> 00:05:42,524
Okay! 
  Moonlight Hall

91
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:46,264
But why are we here?

92
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:51,574
I will probably take that case on again, so I should prepare a weapon of my own.

93
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:53,464
Put away the donkey before you come in.

94
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:57,564
Okay. Let me see. Where is a tavern?

95
00:05:57,564 --> 00:05:59,674
So how is your case going?

96
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:03,354
Well, I did accuse her of committing the Seven Vices*.
  (Seven plausible causes for a man to divorce his wife)

97
00:06:03,354 --> 00:06:08,264
But that fearless woman submitted a divorce lawsuit complaint to the Hanseong-bu.

98
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:10,804
But I still have some time to liquidate the assets.

99
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,694
So do not worry too much.

100
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:16,824
You must win your lawsuit as well, no matter what.

101
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:20,664
The minister should not catch you and your shallow tricks.

102
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:24,234
I will introduce you to a good attorney.

103
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:25,794
Are you out there?

104
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:27,684
 Yes, Your Excellency.

105
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,144
Have him work with your wife.

106
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,704
- Pardon? 
 - When the war begins,

107
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:40,184
the first thing you do is to plant a spy in your enemy's territory.

108
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:41,994
Right.

109
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:46,284
This is how I learn another new thing from you, Your Excellency.

110
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:55,604
By chance, do you handle divorce lawsuits?

111
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:58,124
Wh-What? Divorce? Gosh, no!

112
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:04,754
By chance, do you handle divorce lawsuits?

113
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:07,164
No, no! Go elsewhere!

114
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:09,654
Attorney, by chance, do you handle divorce lawsuits?

115
00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:11,324
- Don't even bring it up! 
 - Do not even mention it!

116
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:13,744
Geez! Go elsewhere!

117
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:15,374
Wait...

118
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,490
 Hanyang Prefecture

119
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:32,834
 So please give up already.

120
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:35,884
I am already Chief Advisor's person.

121
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:38,914
I mean, what is so great about becoming Chief Advisor's person?

122
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:42,964
He even drove out his rightful wife he had lived with for twenty years.

123
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:44,784
Well, that depends on the person.

124
00:07:44,784 --> 00:07:46,394
I am different from her.

125
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:48,944
That would never happen to me.

126
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,284
Are you sure about that?

127
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,284
I will bring in some drinking food.

128
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:01,374
Oh, well. That is okay.

129
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:04,834
Myeong Wol... Myeong Wol!

130
00:08:06,784 --> 00:08:08,724
How many times is this?

131
00:08:08,724 --> 00:08:10,854
Why does she keep going back and forth?

132
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:15,654
It seems like her heart is somewhere way out there.

133
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:21,614
Sir! Have you been waiting long?

134
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:26,984
I am sorry I am late.

135
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:30,824
Please take a cup.

136
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:39,074
It smells fishy.

137
00:08:39,074 --> 00:08:40,684
The smell...

138
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:46,504
The smell is somewhat familiar yet so unfamiliar.

139
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,874
I do not know about the smell.

140
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:56,544
But I do hear some sounds.

141
00:08:56,544 --> 00:09:03,034
Ticklishly cute yet vigorous laughter.

142
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:07,354
I think Myeong Wol is two-timing right now!

143
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:08,714
Two-timing?

144
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,774
What? I even paid her double today!

145
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:16,344
What are you going to do?

146
00:09:16,344 --> 00:09:17,734
Myeong Wol, you wench!

147
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:20,284
There are rules in courtesan houses, too! How could you!

148
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:24,334
How could you! H-How could...

149
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:27,274
Why are you being so rude?

150
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,334
You are up to all kinds of things now.

151
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,534
You are rather good.

152
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:48,894
You are quite a sight to behold, Sir.

153
00:09:48,894 --> 00:09:53,254
Do you two... know each other?

154
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:55,774
- Gosh, no way. 
 - I do not know him!

155
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:08,784
Oh, you are a woman.

156
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:11,334
I apologize.

157
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:13,954
To come in here, I had no choice.

158
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:16,814
It does not matter to me.

159
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:19,464
The important thing is not your gender

160
00:10:20,824 --> 00:10:23,014
but your sincerity.

161
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:30,924
Then Myeong Wol... will you please accept my sincerity as well?

162
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:33,124
Hearing about you becoming Chief Advisor's concubine

163
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:39,024
makes me feel so sincerely disappointed, but I will still wish you happiness.

164
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:43,764
This is a gift for you.

165
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:46,984
A gift?

166
00:10:46,984 --> 00:10:48,544
Yes.

167
00:10:50,254 --> 00:10:52,074
Be happy.

168
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:54,824
I guess I intruded for no reason.

169
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:09,280
And this is my gift.

170
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:11,894
All right, then.

171
00:11:34,024 --> 00:11:38,024
You managed to figure out that Myeong Wol is a core witness.

172
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:41,324
Did you think I was so stupid that I could not even figure that out?

173
00:11:41,324 --> 00:11:43,924
So were you able to convince her?

174
00:11:43,924 --> 00:11:46,354
I am in the process of doing so.

175
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:50,654
If Myeong Wol does indeed change her mind, it would definitely be due to my work.

176
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:55,664
So... how about you rehire me?

177
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:02,644
I already found a new attorney.

178
00:12:02,644 --> 00:12:05,854
What? No way.

179
00:12:05,854 --> 00:12:07,644
There is no way.

180
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:12,104
I could not find an attorney who would take on this lawsuit, so I was in a bind.

181
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:14,694
Thank you for stepping up wholeheartedly.

182
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:19,724
An attorney's job is to stand on the side of the weak in our society.

183
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:23,574
Here are the petitions that testify to the lady's usual behavior by her friends and neighbors.

184
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:27,004
Oh, good work. Okay...

185
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:28,864
These are the recent whereabouts Chief Advisor.

186
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:30,714
The number of his visits to the courtesan house.

187
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:35,154
This is a summary of anonymous testimonies by people who cannot testify.

188
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:42,434
Is there an interesting sight to see?

189
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:45,194
Well, I was looking at some stupid attorney

190
00:12:45,194 --> 00:12:48,264
who wants to take on a divorce case of a noble.

191
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:59,774
Sir, I brought him with me.

192
00:13:06,324 --> 00:13:07,754
Nice to meet you. It is my first time meeting you.

193
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,054
I am Kang Han Su.

194
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:15,854
Are you sure... it is indeed your first time seeing me?

195
00:13:15,854 --> 00:13:20,004
Where would someone like me get to meet someone like you, Sir?

196
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:26,324
Tell us honestly.

197
00:13:26,324 --> 00:13:30,724
Between Chief Advisor and Grand Merchant Jang, who do you hold your grudge against?

198
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:33,654
 He has been suspicious of me all this time.

199
00:13:33,654 --> 00:13:37,694
 Then this is... a trap.

200
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:39,514
Have a seat.

201
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:41,700
Sit down and eat.

202
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:44,654
Oh, okay.

203
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,394
A few days ago,

204
00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:59,314
I heard you disguised yourself...

205
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:06,424
and snuck into a party that I sponsored.

206
00:14:17,044 --> 00:14:19,580
Please forgive me, Sir!

207
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:22,214
To be honest...

208
00:14:22,214 --> 00:14:25,764
To be honest, I was planning to represent your wife at the divorce lawsuit.

209
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,774
So... I snuck in to find f-faults with y-you...

210
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:31,234
B-But not now! I quit!

211
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:35,894
How can I dare become enemies with someone like you, Chief Advisor?

212
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:40,964
I see.

213
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,664
As expected, that is what happened.

214
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:54,064
Then you must know very well how I can win the lawsuit.

215
00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:56,064
For my victory,

216
00:14:57,624 --> 00:14:58,944
speak.

217
00:14:58,944 --> 00:15:03,974
If you were my attorney, what advice would you give me?

218
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:11,704
For free?

219
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:14,224
Look, Attorney Kang!

220
00:15:16,854 --> 00:15:19,474
Look at this guy!

221
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:21,624
Or...

222
00:15:21,624 --> 00:15:26,114
I can give you a few tips on some core issues, and as a consultation payment,

223
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:29,300
it would not be so bad to have some free drinks.

224
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,000
If I did not have my own legal servant in my household, I would have hired you.

225
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,694
So... tell me now.

226
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:43,284
Depending on its value, your drinking table quality will change.

227
00:15:45,464 --> 00:15:47,344
You must cling to the established position you have presented,

228
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:51,924
and you must clearly prove that your wife is at fault.

229
00:15:51,924 --> 00:15:55,494
So ask your friends for their opinions of you and your wife.

230
00:15:55,494 --> 00:15:58,684
Very honestly and very boldly and have them testify–

231
00:15:58,684 --> 00:16:01,854
No! That cannot be.

232
00:16:01,854 --> 00:16:04,534
Yes, also, in my opinion,

233
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:08,224
Lady is so elegant and kind in her words and actions.

234
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:10,264
Oh, well...

235
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:11,974
Then?

236
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:15,774
That is what you should be telling me.

237
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,754
Me?

238
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:21,980
Please drink up!

239
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:28,124
Open up what is in your heart today and exaggerate to tell it in a negative way!

240
00:16:28,124 --> 00:16:31,034
 Look at the state of affairs of the nation.

241
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:34,804
 The nobles who take up high positions in the royal court

242
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:39,294
 have shut down the courtesan house in broad daylight to drink up.

243
00:16:40,394 --> 00:16:43,964
- Yes, yes! 
 - All right, now, now...

244
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:47,304
Now, now, sirs!

245
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:49,414
Do you now know of anything more controversial?

246
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:51,624
What I am hearing is still too weak.

247
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:53,734
Let me tell you one.

248
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:56,894
My wife is not human.

249
00:16:56,894 --> 00:16:59,274
She is made out of wood and stone.

250
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:01,254
Is my home a temple?

251
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:04,614
She has no idea how to behave cutely.

252
00:17:04,614 --> 00:17:09,134
That is why I come to the courtesan house as if it is my home!

253
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:12,994
- No, no... 
 - But wood and stone do not spend money.

254
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:16,124
I have no idea why my wife buys so many things.

255
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:21,454
I mean, one person earns money, and the other only spends money.

256
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,044
All right, Hyeongnims.

257
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:26,384
My wife is extremely jealous.

258
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:30,434
Asking me about every move I make is a given.

259
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:31,984
She even has me followed!

260
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,104
- Aigoo! 
 - She is terrible!

261
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:39,614
- That is why you seem so anxious. 
 - What do you mean?

262
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:42,244
What are your thoughts, Attorney Kang?

263
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:49,074
A little better.

264
00:17:49,074 --> 00:17:52,654
All right. What you all just have spoken about.

265
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,484
They are not about all of you.

266
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:57,754
That is what you have heard and seen about the Chief Advisor's wife.

267
00:17:57,754 --> 00:18:01,054
You just have to go and tell the government office exactly like that.

268
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:03,094
Do you understand?

269
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:15,564
There are many paths to life.

270
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:18,294
Only our hearts are closed shut.

271
00:18:19,194 --> 00:18:22,014
Please speak simply.

272
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:29,844
Please open it.

273
00:18:38,424 --> 00:18:40,564
- This is... 
 - Yes.

274
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,900
It is the right to run a cosmetics store.

275
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:49,254
I heard that the cosmetics you create are very popular among the noble ladies. 
 Cometic Business Operation Authorization

276
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:53,594
What do you think of running your own cosmetics store?

277
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:05,034
What is it... you want from me?

278
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:11,904
Please stand on the side of the chief advisor's wife, who is sitting in prison accused of the Seven Vices.

279
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:16,714
You must testify to what you have seen and heard at the chief advisor's residence.

280
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:29,734
 I gave him a bunch of sweets that he so desperately wanted.

281
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:35,664
 When they were cleaning and shrouding his body, his face was brightly lit up—

282
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:42,934
That rotten scoundrel.

283
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:47,134
Oh, my gosh, sirs! 
  Moonlight Hall

284
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:49,074
Drink, drink.

285
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:51,984
Okay.

286
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:56,274
I'll bring a new bottle.

287
00:19:56,274 --> 00:19:59,074
Please enjoy yourselves.

288
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:13,084
So...

289
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:16,034
Well...

290
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:26,564
What in the world are you doing here?

291
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:30,214
You were with Myeong Wol at first, and now you're with Chief Advisor?

292
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:31,374
Yes, well, the thing is...

293
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:35,174
By chance, did you decide to work with him after I fired you?

294
00:20:35,174 --> 00:20:37,144
- Actually— 
 - By chance,

295
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:42,294
you are not telling him a strategy to win this case, are you?

296
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:53,114
I still trusted you, Sir.

297
00:20:53,114 --> 00:20:55,900
You pretended to threaten me and placate me,

298
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,100
and yet you told me everything to rescue the lady.

299
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:02,044
I was actually grateful for all that.

300
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:04,864
I thought your attitude of wanting to be helpful that way

301
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,074
was your genuine feeling.

302
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:09,614
That was genuine. I am still genuine now. I am doing all this for you—

303
00:21:09,614 --> 00:21:11,444
When you are interfering like this so blatantly?

304
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,114
That is because...

305
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:22,054
the higher the mountain you must climb, the faster and more you will grow.

306
00:21:26,904 --> 00:21:33,064
I do not think you know what the word "genuine" means, sir.

307
00:21:39,704 --> 00:21:43,474
I was foolish for expecting even a little bit of decency from you.

308
00:21:47,504 --> 00:21:51,234
Gosh, I am not doing this because I want to.

309
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:54,934
This is unfair for me, too! So unfair!

310
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:06,234
I am sorry...

311
00:22:21,844 --> 00:22:23,234
How did it go with Myeong Wol?

312
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:26,274
She says she will meet with us. Please follow me.

313
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:32,864
The drinks are...

314
00:22:35,384 --> 00:22:38,564
Hey! Where did you go, and what took you so long?

315
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:41,064
Come here. Take a cup from me.

316
00:22:41,064 --> 00:22:42,874
Yes, Sir.

317
00:22:42,874 --> 00:22:44,104
Sir.

318
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:46,324
This bottle is empty. Give me some from this bottle.

319
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:49,914
I hear this is the most popular alcohol in Moonlight Hall,

320
00:22:49,914 --> 00:22:53,604
Try smelling the scent.

321
00:22:57,664 --> 00:22:59,884
Oh?

322
00:22:59,884 --> 00:23:03,424
This is the scent of Myeong Wol.

323
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,854
Oh, Myeong Wol!

324
00:23:05,854 --> 00:23:08,824
I miss my Myeong Wol.

325
00:23:08,824 --> 00:23:10,664
Go and get her.

326
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:12,674
Yes, Sir.

327
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:15,474
That would not be so difficult, but...

328
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:19,974
is Myeong Wol indeed trustworthy?

329
00:23:19,974 --> 00:23:21,964
You wretch!

330
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:25,694
What in the world are you saying?

331
00:23:25,694 --> 00:23:28,844
Well, actually,

332
00:23:28,844 --> 00:23:33,274
I saw Myeong Wol secretly meeting your wife's attorney.

333
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,134
- What? 
 - That is not all.

334
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:42,034
She even took the bribe that I gave her when I was your wife's attorney.

335
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:45,154
Myeong Wol, that bitch!

336
00:23:45,154 --> 00:23:47,554
Aigoo, Sir! Aigoo!

337
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:50,504
Sir! Sir! Sir!

338
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:54,224
Sir! Sir!

339
00:24:00,054 --> 00:24:03,794
Do you dare try to betray me?

340
00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:06,894
Sir, what in the world are you talking about?

341
00:24:06,894 --> 00:24:10,984
Then what is all this?

342
00:24:15,684 --> 00:24:17,504
This is a misunderstanding.

343
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:18,664
Please hear me out—

344
00:24:18,664 --> 00:24:21,480
Do you think I do not know

345
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,350
that you are in contact with my wife's attorney?

346
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:33,754
Did you not hear the reason the chief advisor is raging?

347
00:24:33,754 --> 00:24:35,514
Things will get more out of hand when he sees us.

348
00:24:35,514 --> 00:24:38,754
Even so, do you expect to stand back and do nothing?

349
00:24:48,414 --> 00:24:50,484
Just die!

350
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:01,854
You despicable bitch!

351
00:25:01,854 --> 00:25:06,914
I was so generous with you, and you did not know your place!

352
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:39,644
Is she dead?

353
00:25:39,644 --> 00:25:41,174
I need to take her to a physician.

354
00:25:41,174 --> 00:25:42,804
No!

355
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:44,374
Just...

356
00:25:44,374 --> 00:25:45,874
Just let her die,

357
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:47,414
so she cannot speak nonsense.

358
00:25:47,414 --> 00:25:50,564
- But– 
 - She committed suicide.

359
00:25:50,564 --> 00:25:53,264
We will make it so.

360
00:25:53,264 --> 00:25:55,674
We will make it so.

361
00:26:07,494 --> 00:26:09,904
How do you mean?

362
00:26:09,904 --> 00:26:12,114
It is simple.

363
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:18,594
 Put a silken cloth around her neck and buy off a civil affairs officer.

364
00:26:22,284 --> 00:26:25,694
 Can you not even do this by yourself?

365
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:45,214
And we can give the autopsy examiners some money.

366
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:55,714
Hyeongnim!

367
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,804
Let us hurry.

368
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:14,014
What happened?

369
00:27:14,014 --> 00:27:16,264
We need a physician.

370
00:27:16,264 --> 00:27:18,424
Wait, Chief Advisor.

371
00:27:18,424 --> 00:27:22,394
Why do you look so pale?

372
00:27:22,394 --> 00:27:25,254
Did you see a ghost or something?

373
00:27:26,054 --> 00:27:27,304
Chief Advisor.

374
00:27:27,304 --> 00:27:29,234
Chief Advisor!

375
00:27:41,074 --> 00:27:43,314
 She committed suicide.

376
00:27:44,514 --> 00:27:47,174
 We will make it so.

377
00:27:47,174 --> 00:27:49,534
 We will make it so.

378
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:08,274
Grand Merchant Sir...

379
00:28:11,454 --> 00:28:13,454
How is Myeong Wol?

380
00:28:16,264 --> 00:28:18,944
It looks like there is no hope.

381
00:28:19,644 --> 00:28:22,314
He says she may not make it through the night.

382
00:28:22,314 --> 00:28:25,764
Do you mean she could die?

383
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:32,724
How could a man like him have lived with so much pride up until now?

384
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:34,394
I cannot let this be!

385
00:28:34,394 --> 00:28:37,824
We must make him pay for his crime before there are more victims!

386
00:28:37,824 --> 00:28:39,944
So, Attorney Sir—

387
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:51,894
Do you think he got scared and ran away?

388
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,770
 Wishes Inn

389
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,494
Attorney Sir!

390
00:29:19,764 --> 00:29:21,654
He's gone.

391
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:25,034
Everything is gone.

392
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:34,624
Please spare me, Your Excellency!

393
00:29:34,624 --> 00:29:36,644
For the last seven years,

394
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:40,544
the proof of how I shed blood and sweat for you and the Hungu Party is here.

395
00:29:40,544 --> 00:29:41,784
It is right here.

396
00:29:41,784 --> 00:29:45,154
You cannot abandon me, Your Excellency!

397
00:29:46,254 --> 00:29:50,084
Your Excellency, Attorney Kim is here to see you.

398
00:29:54,684 --> 00:29:57,454
Here is the evidence I gathered at the chief advisor's residence.

399
00:29:57,454 --> 00:30:00,154
They must be out of their minds by now.

400
00:30:00,154 --> 00:30:01,514
Good work!

401
00:30:01,514 --> 00:30:04,554
Go on a trip for a month or so.

402
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:06,884
Thank you for your grace, Your Excellency!

403
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:14,414
As for you,

404
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:19,994
you must have forgotten already that the minister is doing everything to help you.

405
00:30:39,264 --> 00:30:46,394
As long as you stay alert and wrap up the trial, nothing will happen to you.

406
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:48,634
I am deeply sorry.

407
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:52,884
I must have lost my mind for a moment!

408
00:30:58,594 --> 00:31:00,924
I will not forget this grace!

409
00:31:00,924 --> 00:31:03,504
Your Excellency, the Minister!

410
00:31:05,054 --> 00:31:11,964
Because of the hope I pointlessly held, an innocent person's life is about to be shortened.

411
00:31:11,964 --> 00:31:15,344
What Attorney Kang said was right.

412
00:31:16,244 --> 00:31:18,254
It is my fault.

413
00:31:19,054 --> 00:31:21,424
I was the dense one.

414
00:31:22,954 --> 00:31:27,764
 It means you have to give up at least one leg to achieve your goal.

415
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:32,644
And I was stubborn on top of that.

416
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:34,874
My Lady. My Lady!

417
00:31:34,874 --> 00:31:36,910
My Lady, please...

418
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:40,074
No!

419
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,184
I will bring back Attorney Kang somehow.

420
00:31:44,184 --> 00:31:45,954
There has to be another way.

421
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:48,234
No, please!

422
00:31:50,184 --> 00:31:52,444
Please!

423
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:55,284
Please wait a little bit longer.

424
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:58,074
I beg you.

425
00:32:18,914 --> 00:32:21,584
 I wondered why he sees the world so crookedly.

426
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:24,764
 I thought he was so twisted inside.

427
00:32:25,764 --> 00:32:28,304
 But I know now...

428
00:32:32,154 --> 00:32:33,804
 that the world is twisted.

429
00:32:33,804 --> 00:32:36,854
 That you were looking at it correctly.

430
00:32:40,064 --> 00:32:42,394
 So Kang Han Su...

431
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,074
 Please...

432
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:08,724
What!

433
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:17,274
What's this? Why am I here?

434
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:25,074
 Here we go again...

435
00:33:25,074 --> 00:33:29,504
 Will you say that all of this happening is only a coincidence?

436
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:33,684
 Wait, wait, wait!

437
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:41,814
 I do not know what you are scheming, but I can no longer let you run around wildly.

438
00:33:41,814 --> 00:33:45,744
 Go and sit quietly in your house until the day of the trial.

439
00:33:48,404 --> 00:33:51,514
Gosh, I am going crazy!

440
00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:55,234
I am still the one who made him a grand merchant.

441
00:34:00,994 --> 00:34:03,934
I guess you do not know me well yet. If you left me alone like this,

442
00:34:03,934 --> 00:34:06,424
did you think I could not get out of this?

443
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:08,764
Do you think I cannot do anything by myself?

444
00:34:08,764 --> 00:34:11,744
By myself? Dong Chi!

445
00:34:11,744 --> 00:34:14,504
Dong Chi!

446
00:34:22,414 --> 00:34:25,084
Go to a peaceful place...

447
00:34:42,104 --> 00:34:47,764
 Kang Han Su, come back. I am sorry.

448
00:34:47,764 --> 00:34:50,114
 Come back, Kang Han Su.

449
00:34:50,114 --> 00:34:52,694
 I am sorry.

450
00:34:53,914 --> 00:34:56,414
There is a man here!

451
00:34:56,414 --> 00:34:59,114
Over here!

452
00:34:59,114 --> 00:35:01,824
I am here!

453
00:35:01,824 --> 00:35:05,284
I, Kang Han Su, is here!

454
00:35:05,284 --> 00:35:07,244
Save—

455
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:15,284
I cannot burn the entire ship!

456
00:35:22,474 --> 00:35:25,044
Save me!

457
00:35:27,154 --> 00:35:29,744
We have no idea how far he has gone.

458
00:35:29,744 --> 00:35:31,574
Do you think he could see this?

459
00:35:31,574 --> 00:35:35,744
Fortunately, the wind is blowing toward the river. They are floating away nicely.

460
00:35:37,564 --> 00:35:39,284
If the lanterns are floating away so well,

461
00:35:39,284 --> 00:35:42,614
I'm sure the ship sailed away very far, right?

462
00:35:43,994 --> 00:35:49,664
I guess the way back for Attorney Kang will be that much longer.

463
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:57,484
Fine. If I die, it is their loss.

464
00:35:57,484 --> 00:36:00,994
Fine... let them...

465
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:04,684
live a good life without me.

466
00:36:07,574 --> 00:36:09,734
The lawsuit?

467
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,854
What lawsuit?

468
00:36:11,854 --> 00:36:16,254
I am sure the new attorney will do what he needs to do.

469
00:36:19,454 --> 00:36:23,664
But still, he is no match for me...

470
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,294
Gosh, this is exhausting...

471
00:36:34,074 --> 00:36:36,004
Gosh, no, I will not do it...

472
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:38,244
I will not go... no...

473
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:56,094
What's that?

474
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,800
 Faithfulness and Filial Piety Throughout the Home

475
00:37:47,804 --> 00:37:51,354
So what is it you want to tell me urgently?

476
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:57,084
I wanted to ask you why you involved yourself in a mere divorce case.

477
00:37:57,784 --> 00:38:01,424
What the lawsuit is about is not the issue here.

478
00:38:01,424 --> 00:38:04,754
The problem is that the person who is involved in the matter is my person.

479
00:38:04,754 --> 00:38:06,634
That is the problem.

480
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:11,524
Are you saying you will cover up his wrongdoing only because he is your subordinate?

481
00:38:11,524 --> 00:38:14,470
All I did during this time was to show a bit of generosity

482
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,170
to people who have been loyal to me.

483
00:38:17,174 --> 00:38:20,144
The verdict will be up to you.

484
00:38:20,144 --> 00:38:22,614
Father, you have cheated.

485
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:26,994
Chief Advisor and his wife will be on unfair grounds from the start, throughout the trial.

486
00:38:26,994 --> 00:38:30,384
And it is obvious who will win and who will lose.

487
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:33,494
Everything in this world is set up in such a manner.

488
00:38:33,494 --> 00:38:35,354
Father.

489
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:39,220
I hear the one helping the chief advisor's wife

490
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:43,230
is the owner of the inn you have been supporting.

491
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:48,364
I looked into it, and I found out that Princess Yeon Ju is living in that inn.

492
00:38:49,044 --> 00:38:53,814
If your intention is not to let the word spread about the Princess being linked to such a case,

493
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:56,734
you should end this discussion here and leave.

494
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,564
The lengthier our conversation,

495
00:38:58,564 --> 00:39:03,724
the more you, not me, will lose.

496
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,830
 Faithfulness and Filial Piety Throughout the Home

497
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:42,534
Gosh, it's hot.

498
00:39:58,554 --> 00:40:02,004
Let's think. Think.

499
00:40:02,004 --> 00:40:04,114
For now,

500
00:40:04,114 --> 00:40:09,724
the ship can't move so I have to.

501
00:40:13,354 --> 00:40:15,684
No, no, not that.

502
00:40:15,684 --> 00:40:17,524
No.

503
00:40:29,784 --> 00:40:31,764
This cannot be it.

504
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:34,054
Not this.

505
00:40:53,264 --> 00:40:55,824
Two.

506
00:40:55,824 --> 00:40:57,324
Two.

507
00:40:57,324 --> 00:41:00,594
Two, two, two, no, no, I can't.

508
00:41:00,594 --> 00:41:03,034
I can't, I can't.

509
00:41:04,334 --> 00:41:06,334
No, I can't.

510
00:41:09,014 --> 00:41:11,394
Okay, got it.

511
00:41:15,794 --> 00:41:17,724
Okay!

512
00:41:17,724 --> 00:41:19,584
One!

513
00:41:21,074 --> 00:41:23,724
I must be out of my mind.

514
00:41:33,714 --> 00:41:40,870
 Hanyang Prefecture

515
00:41:56,934 --> 00:42:01,084
Out of Seven Vices, adultery is

516
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:06,154
one of the felonies that are punishable by eighty floggings.

517
00:42:06,154 --> 00:42:12,834
Dol Seok will testify that he slept with you.

518
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:19,840
Even my friends are coming to attest to your usual promiscuous conduct.

519
00:42:23,884 --> 00:42:28,704
Even now, if you would drop your accusations against me,

520
00:42:28,704 --> 00:42:35,664
I will forgive you and ask the mayor to make favorable arrangements for you.

521
00:42:37,864 --> 00:42:41,964
It looks like your attorney abandoned you, too.

522
00:42:41,964 --> 00:42:45,404
How would you go up against me alone?

523
00:42:46,404 --> 00:42:53,014
It is not that I am trying to win, but it is to relieve the pain of my resentment.

524
00:42:54,744 --> 00:42:58,294
Even if I die, I cannot leave my grievances behind.

525
00:42:59,484 --> 00:43:03,704
If I die like this... and go to the afterlife,

526
00:43:03,704 --> 00:43:07,294
how will I face my parents?

527
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:24,624
You sure are rushing through your life.

528
00:44:17,964 --> 00:44:20,084
Oh, no, what is this?

529
00:44:39,484 --> 00:44:42,924
We welcome the mayor.

530
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,774
We will start overseeing the state affairs.

531
00:45:14,224 --> 00:45:16,204
 Father...

532
00:45:19,004 --> 00:45:21,434
 Mother...

533
00:45:21,434 --> 00:45:24,214
 Please help me.

534
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,794
 Now is not the time.

535
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:29,794
 Not yet.

536
00:45:34,584 --> 00:45:37,444
 I cannot leave just yet.

537
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:38,214
Your Excellency, both parties have arrived.

538
00:46:46,474 --> 00:46:49,724
Plaintiff, do you not have an attorney?

539
00:46:57,644 --> 00:47:00,274
We will commence the litigation.

540
00:47:00,274 --> 00:47:04,670
Plaintiff, step forward and submit the Lawsuit Initiation Agreement.

541
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:07,670
 Cho Gang Mun is a government official at Hanyang Prefecture in Pyeongyang Province...

542
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,614
 Is that not a noble official who has a base in Pyeongyang?

543
00:47:10,614 --> 00:47:13,424
 Do you want to promote his rank to fourth senior rank?

544
00:47:13,424 --> 00:47:15,184
 Yes.

545
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:20,514
 Also, sending former Dohwaseo Park Je Su to Hanyang Prefecture, too?

546
00:47:20,514 --> 00:47:24,234
 It was all decided at the original meeting.

547
00:47:24,234 --> 00:47:28,024
 The Grand Queen Dowager gave her approval as well.

548
00:47:32,454 --> 00:47:34,454
 I should do that.

549
00:47:48,484 --> 00:47:50,744
 Would you believe that

550
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:53,064
 laws can become your sword?

551
00:47:54,084 --> 00:47:59,814
 The one who wields that sword better than anyone is Attorney Kang Han Su.

552
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:03,564
That sword Yeon Ju was talking about.

553
00:48:05,224 --> 00:48:07,834
I wonder if it really is well-sharpened.

554
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,600
 Plaintiff: I'm here to sue my husband, Park Je Su, who committed adultery.

555
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,500
 He didn't return home for a month. Please adjudge according to the law.

556
00:48:16,234 --> 00:48:22,634
Each party should explain why they filed a lawsuit.

557
00:48:24,214 --> 00:48:26,684
Wait a moment!

558
00:48:36,034 --> 00:48:39,344
Here, the plaintiff's attorney is in attendance!

559
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:53,754
The plaintiff's attorney Kang Han Su greets you, Mayor.

560
00:48:53,754 --> 00:48:56,504
Wait, why would he?

561
00:48:56,504 --> 00:49:00,150
That persistent bastard.

562
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,354
Everyone, be quiet!

563
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:15,694
In this divorce case, the sinner who committed Seven Vices and disrupted a household

564
00:49:15,694 --> 00:49:18,334
dares to clear her name.

565
00:49:18,334 --> 00:49:21,244
It is an outrageous case!

566
00:49:21,244 --> 00:49:23,394
How dare she mock the national law!

567
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:26,570
I am the plaintiff's attorney, Kang Han Su.

568
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,474
The one who went against the law is

569
00:49:30,474 --> 00:49:32,834
Park Je Su, who falsely accused his wife.

570
00:49:32,834 --> 00:49:35,964
This is not only a felony equivalent to a false charge, but

571
00:49:35,964 --> 00:49:40,994
he is abusing the law that states a wife cannot accuse her husband.

572
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:42,584
Mayor,

573
00:49:42,584 --> 00:49:47,084
we have witnesses who will accurately testify to the couple's situation.

574
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,200
 My wife is quite jealous about it. Raise the hand; run away. Asking the basic time. Send someone to follow them.

575
00:49:52,204 --> 00:49:54,054
They are the husband's close friends.

576
00:49:54,054 --> 00:49:55,624
They would not provide unbiased testimony.

577
00:49:55,624 --> 00:50:00,434
They are officials from prestigious noble families and hold important posts in court.

578
00:50:00,434 --> 00:50:03,224
Whose statements would be more reliable?

579
00:50:03,224 --> 00:50:06,924
The testimony of this woman imprisoned for committing Seven Vices

580
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:10,234
or the statements by these high-ranking noblemen?

581
00:50:17,934 --> 00:50:24,034
I do not determine the truth based on one's high or low status.

582
00:50:35,334 --> 00:50:39,834
But, Mayor, the divorce of nobles is prohibited by law.

583
00:50:39,834 --> 00:50:43,564
Once married, it is right to stay together for a hundred years.

584
00:50:43,564 --> 00:50:47,684
However! There are exceptions.

585
00:50:47,684 --> 00:50:49,724
What is that?

586
00:50:51,064 --> 00:50:56,394
In the case of a betrayal between the couple, the state can force you to divorce.

587
00:50:56,394 --> 00:51:00,064
It is commonly referred to as Divorce of Righteousness. For instance...

588
00:51:24,234 --> 00:51:28,924
it is when one violates filial piety.

589
00:51:28,924 --> 00:51:32,554
Park Je Su came in to live with his in-laws, and

590
00:51:32,554 --> 00:51:35,044
he passed the state examination and entered the royal court.

591
00:51:35,044 --> 00:51:38,054
Until he became a prestigious nobleman in Hanyang,

592
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:40,384
he received much help from his father and mother-in-law.

593
00:51:40,384 --> 00:51:44,124
But he repaid their kindness with vengeance.

594
00:51:44,124 --> 00:51:45,844
Mayor!

595
00:51:45,844 --> 00:51:50,834
I do not understand what kind of nonsense that attorney is talking about!

596
00:51:50,834 --> 00:51:56,864
I have served my in-laws with all my heart, fulfilling my filial duty,

597
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:02,054
and they both loved me very much.

598
00:52:02,854 --> 00:52:06,024
This calligraphy is evidence of that.

599
00:52:06,024 --> 00:52:13,814
My father-in-law, in his own handwriting, wrote these beautiful words and gifted me with it.

600
00:52:13,814 --> 00:52:17,014
And this outfit. How about this outfit, you say?

601
00:52:17,014 --> 00:52:22,814
Right before my mother-in-law passed away, even rubbing her blurred eyes,

602
00:52:22,814 --> 00:52:28,534
she stitched these together one stitch at a time herself!

603
00:52:28,534 --> 00:52:30,474
This, this, this!

604
00:52:30,474 --> 00:52:36,774
It proves I was a son-in-law who received much love from his in-laws.

605
00:52:36,774 --> 00:52:38,864
What else could it possibly mean?

606
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,684
Right, right.

607
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:51,154
For the in-laws who cared for you so much,

608
00:52:53,294 --> 00:52:56,344
did you repay them with death?

609
00:52:56,344 --> 00:52:57,704
What?

610
00:52:57,704 --> 00:53:00,444
- What? 
 - Death?

611
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:02,044
Did he say death?

612
00:53:02,044 --> 00:53:03,934
What do you mean by death?

613
00:53:03,934 --> 00:53:07,034
Are you implying that he harmed his father-in-law?

614
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:12,374
Yes, that is correct, Mayor!

615
00:53:30,154 --> 00:53:34,064
I was promised the place of becoming his concubine.

616
00:53:34,064 --> 00:53:37,264
I am Courtesan Myeong Wol.

617
00:53:45,374 --> 00:53:47,174
It is Eonni Myeong Wol.

618
00:53:47,174 --> 00:53:50,174
What exactly is going on?

619
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:54,554
How could you?

620
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:03,214
How could you! Why?

621
00:54:03,214 --> 00:54:06,534
Let me go. Let go!

622
00:54:08,754 --> 00:54:11,654
You come over here!

623
00:54:11,654 --> 00:54:13,744
Let go of me!

624
00:54:13,744 --> 00:54:15,394
Mayor!

625
00:54:15,394 --> 00:54:19,664
That wicked girl is not human!

626
00:54:19,664 --> 00:54:22,254
She is a ghost!

627
00:54:22,254 --> 00:54:27,634
How could a girl who died and was buried be a witness?

628
00:54:27,634 --> 00:54:31,684
Please do not be fooled by her words!

629
00:54:31,684 --> 00:54:34,924
I almost became a ghost because of Chief Advisor!

630
00:54:34,924 --> 00:54:36,914
You wicked bitch!

631
00:54:36,914 --> 00:54:41,394
You had better shut your foul mouth!

632
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:52,014
It is true that Chief Advisor caused his father-in-law's death.

633
00:54:52,014 --> 00:54:57,974
He fed his father-in-law, who was suffering from diabetes,

634
00:54:57,974 --> 00:55:00,694
this yakgwa*. 
  (Traditional Korean honey-sweetened pastry)

635
00:55:00,694 --> 00:55:03,814
I heard this story myself.

636
00:55:05,524 --> 00:55:07,234
Mayor.

637
00:55:07,234 --> 00:55:12,234
Please ask the physician next to you what happens

638
00:55:12,914 --> 00:55:15,584
if a diabetes patient consumes this yakgwa.

639
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:17,774
It could be more fatal than poison.

640
00:55:17,774 --> 00:55:20,154
- Fatal? 
 - Oh, my goodness!

641
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:23,914
How could such a thing happen?

642
00:55:26,054 --> 00:55:28,534
That can't be.

643
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:44,784
All of this... is nothing but a distorted argument made by that attorney!

644
00:55:44,784 --> 00:55:52,034
I was only being a filial son and gave the yakgwa to my father-in-law.

645
00:55:52,034 --> 00:55:56,634
I was completely unaware of his condition!

646
00:55:56,634 --> 00:56:00,894
Then while the lady was in prison,

647
00:56:00,894 --> 00:56:07,484
why did you meet the brokers with all the ownership documents of the properties and lands?

648
00:56:13,114 --> 00:56:15,604
I did not commit any offense!

649
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:20,474
The only wrongdoing I committed was trying my best to succeed.

650
00:56:20,474 --> 00:56:25,524
I took what I needed and got rid of obstructions!

651
00:56:25,524 --> 00:56:29,994
Hold onto the ones who help me and shake off those who hold me back.

652
00:56:29,994 --> 00:56:31,934
Is that not how everyone survives?

653
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:33,774
What?

654
00:56:39,494 --> 00:56:44,674
My mother and father-in-law merely sacrificed themselves

655
00:56:44,674 --> 00:56:48,384
to brighten the future of their son-in-law!

656
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:52,494
That is how you should understand the situation.

657
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:55,084
Is that not true?

658
00:56:57,964 --> 00:57:00,744
Is that not true?

659
00:57:06,064 --> 00:57:08,294
Is that not true?

660
00:57:13,774 --> 00:57:16,064
Is that not true?

661
00:57:25,304 --> 00:57:29,934
This is not a place to discuss the defendant's sins.

662
00:57:29,934 --> 00:57:33,744
However, considering the witnesses and testimonies,

663
00:57:33,744 --> 00:57:36,774
it is clear that the defendant provided a reason for divorce.

664
00:57:36,774 --> 00:57:39,614
Even accusing his wife of committing Seven Vices

665
00:57:39,614 --> 00:57:43,874
seems to be a scheme to take over his wife's property, under the circumstances.

666
00:57:43,874 --> 00:57:45,534
Most of all,

667
00:57:45,534 --> 00:57:49,774
since it is clear that the defendant caused the death of his father-in-law,

668
00:57:50,474 --> 00:57:54,524
we will keep him in custody and begin proceedings to

669
00:57:54,524 --> 00:58:00,274
make him pay for the crime of committing murder against humanity for killing one's parent.

670
00:58:21,574 --> 00:58:23,704
One moment.

671
00:58:24,804 --> 00:58:27,454
Please return the clothes to me.

672
00:58:28,994 --> 00:58:31,284
I cannot bear to see

673
00:58:31,284 --> 00:58:37,354
the precious clothing that my parents made being taken to prison as well.

674
00:58:45,994 --> 00:58:49,524
High-quality silk does not belong in prison.

675
00:58:49,524 --> 00:58:51,504
Remove them from him.

676
00:59:00,734 --> 00:59:04,734
When you see Merchant Jang in hell, give him my regards.

677
00:59:04,734 --> 00:59:07,654
Bastard, you deserve to die.

678
00:59:07,654 --> 00:59:13,554
What vengeance do you have against me that you torment me like this?

679
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:15,484
Why?

680
00:59:15,484 --> 00:59:17,404
Why the hell?

681
00:59:18,104 --> 00:59:21,234
Are you curious about who I am?

682
00:59:21,234 --> 00:59:22,994
I will visit you soon.

683
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:25,504
We will catch up then.

684
00:59:35,784 --> 00:59:37,660
How sweet.

685
00:59:40,124 --> 00:59:42,464
What happened?

686
00:59:42,464 --> 00:59:45,584
I thought something terrible had happened to you.

687
00:59:45,584 --> 00:59:48,164
It was nothing to worry about.

688
00:59:48,164 --> 00:59:52,334
Just in case, I had hidden some pig's blood in my wig.

689
00:59:52,334 --> 00:59:56,214
It just happened to burst at the right time.

690
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:14,694
That old fool really was trying to kill me.

691
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,954
I am glad I tested him just as Kang Han Su had suggested.

692
01:00:17,954 --> 01:00:21,684
That shitty rotten scoundrel.

693
01:00:23,314 --> 01:00:25,584
How should I bring him down?

694
01:00:27,174 --> 01:00:28,624
Really?

695
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:31,814
Then was everything...

696
01:00:33,284 --> 01:00:36,074
That is what Attorney Kang said.

697
01:00:36,074 --> 01:00:41,604
Right now, Chief Advisor acts as if he will give me the world.

698
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:45,064
But as soon as I take the seat of his wife,

699
01:00:45,064 --> 01:00:51,684
my fate will not be much different from the lady confined in prison.

700
01:00:51,684 --> 01:00:53,764
Then at the right moment,

701
01:00:54,864 --> 01:01:00,814
you came to me and showed me another way of living.

702
01:01:01,704 --> 01:01:03,314
Then...

703
01:01:04,114 --> 01:01:05,204
That is right.

704
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:10,704
What ultimately moved my heart was your suggestion.

705
01:01:11,404 --> 01:01:18,044
Rather than putting my life in the hands of a man who cannot be trusted, I will make my own path.

706
01:01:18,044 --> 01:01:22,260
Pursuing my talent with cosmetics,

707
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,750
it would not be a bad idea to start a business.

708
01:01:26,914 --> 01:01:29,184
That is a good idea.

709
01:01:29,184 --> 01:01:32,304
You truly made a good decision.

710
01:01:46,504 --> 01:01:48,804
I am sorry to cause you so much trouble.

711
01:01:48,804 --> 01:01:51,394
Please accept my apology, My Lady.

712
01:01:57,374 --> 01:02:05,264
I will replace your debt to me with your presence at the hearing today.

713
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:07,324
From now on,

714
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:13,714
I hope you do not get tangled in such a rough situation and lead a peaceful life.

715
01:02:27,634 --> 01:02:31,444
How will I ever repay you?

716
01:02:31,444 --> 01:02:33,044
I did not do anything.

717
01:02:33,044 --> 01:02:35,754
It is all thanks to Attorney Kang.

718
01:02:35,754 --> 01:02:37,344
Right.

719
01:02:38,144 --> 01:02:41,204
Just compensate him well.

720
01:02:41,204 --> 01:02:44,154
Of course. Surely.

721
01:02:44,154 --> 01:02:46,924
I will be sure to pay him well.

722
01:02:49,044 --> 01:02:51,024
And My Lady...

723
01:02:54,514 --> 01:02:59,234
your divorce is nothing to be ashamed of.

724
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:02,644
It is one that was granted by the state,

725
01:03:02,644 --> 01:03:09,024
so do not hang your head or look away from others.

726
01:03:11,744 --> 01:03:17,934
For your happiness, proudly enjoy what you want in your life.

727
01:03:21,094 --> 01:03:24,044
I truly thank you.

728
01:03:35,494 --> 01:03:37,914
Thank goodness it was midsummer.

729
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:41,814
If it had been winter, you would have caught a cold or even worse.

730
01:03:41,814 --> 01:03:44,354
I am fine, and I feel good, too.

731
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:48,214
I saved Kang Han Su and also the lady.

732
01:03:48,214 --> 01:03:51,284
Do you know how scared I was?

733
01:03:52,434 --> 01:03:57,834
Who knew last night's shimmer was a signal from Kang Han Su?

734
01:03:58,764 --> 01:04:00,054
 Hyeongnim!

735
01:04:00,054 --> 01:04:02,224
 Where did you go?

736
01:04:02,224 --> 01:04:04,144
 Hyeongnim!

737
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:06,934
 Where did you go?

738
01:04:06,934 --> 01:04:08,784
 Hyeongnim!

739
01:04:08,784 --> 01:04:11,584
 Can you hear me?

740
01:04:11,584 --> 01:04:12,794
 It is Dong Chi!

741
01:04:12,794 --> 01:04:15,284
 I guess they have not left yet.

742
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,250
 Hyeongnim.

743
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,070
 Hyeongnim.

744
01:05:38,254 --> 01:05:40,304
 Kang Han Su!

745
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:46,004
 Kang Han Su! Wake up, Kang Han Su!

746
01:05:48,594 --> 01:05:51,384
 - Hyeongnim! 
 - Attorney Kang!

747
01:05:56,474 --> 01:05:59,584
 Did you worry about me that much?

748
01:06:01,894 --> 01:06:04,514
 Why would I worry...

749
01:06:05,234 --> 01:06:09,144
 Then... what could this be?

750
01:06:11,084 --> 01:06:12,974
 Th-That is just water!

751
01:06:12,974 --> 01:06:15,704
 Water from Han River.

752
01:07:01,334 --> 01:07:04,494
 Do you believe that I am being genuine now?

753
01:07:20,034 --> 01:07:23,924
It is such a relief, you know.

754
01:07:25,024 --> 01:07:26,854
Yes.

755
01:07:26,854 --> 01:07:30,084
I think he was born to live a long life.

756
01:08:00,764 --> 01:08:03,034
 She committed suicide.

757
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:13,700

758
01:08:21,114 --> 01:08:23,394
 We will make it so.

759
01:08:23,394 --> 01:08:25,864
 We will make it so.

760
01:08:29,944 --> 01:08:32,444
You got what you wanted.

761
01:08:45,674 --> 01:08:48,444
♫  Light you up, I'm on fire  ♫

762
01:08:48,444 --> 01:08:50,774
♫  Got you right down to the hell  ♫

763
01:08:50,774 --> 01:08:54,474
♫  Yeah we singing, oh  ♫

764
01:08:54,474 --> 01:08:56,474
♫  Everybody gotta&nbsp;stand up  ♫

765
01:08:56,474 --> 01:08:59,104
♫  Light you&nbsp;up, burn me&nbsp;down  ♫

766
01:08:59,104 --> 01:09:01,484
♫  Put you perfect underground  ♫

767
01:09:01,484 --> 01:09:05,694
♫  Now it's over, oh  ♫

768
01:09:05,694 --> 01:09:09,624
 Joseon Attorney

769
01:09:09,624 --> 01:09:14,254
 He received all of that for the cost of my father's life.

770
01:09:15,134 --> 01:09:17,574
 The balance...

771
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:19,024
 Aigoo, a murder!

772
01:09:19,024 --> 01:09:21,354
 How could there be a murder in our village?

773
01:09:21,354 --> 01:09:23,934
 I see nothing has changed.

774
01:09:26,664 --> 01:09:29,384
 Did you decide to become my assistant again?

775
01:09:29,384 --> 01:09:35,064
 Since you saved my life, I guess I can give you at least that chance.

776
01:09:35,934 --> 01:09:38,834
♫  Let's fix everything  ♫
