1
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,584
Sir!

2
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:48,740

3
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:53,244
Go ahead. Hurry!

4
00:01:46,534 --> 00:01:49,254
Get away from here! Hurry!

5
00:02:20,494 --> 00:02:22,244
Sir!

6
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:56,404
Father!

7
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,834
You have finally lost your mind.

8
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:04,064
Did you forget...

9
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:10,094
that the head of a village is the father of all who live in that village?

10
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:15,304
Seven years ago, I was your son back then.

11
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:19,824
All the people of Cheongsan trusted you and followed you, but...

12
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:25,894
what did you do to my father and my family?

13
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:30,464
On top of that, I could not even report you.

14
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:32,964
If a citizen of a village reported the head of the village,

15
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:38,974
the citizen would, in turn, be punished for breaking the Prohibition of Accusations Against Elders.

16
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:43,794
Thus...

17
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:51,034
are you trying to take it to court by bringing up all that now?

18
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:57,714
I will show you.

19
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:01,104
What?

20
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:04,354
How a real lawsuit should go down.

21
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:09,664
How a real head of a village should behave. How a real father...

22
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:13,764
should be.

23
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,774
You failed both as the head of a village and as a father.

24
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:21,934
You wretched fool!

25
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:24,674
Do you really want to die?

26
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,534
But you could not kill me.

27
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:43,914
Can you not tell?

28
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:48,884
I am here to respond to your warning.

29
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,210
 ...I was afraid of his Excellency until now...

30
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,970
 ...my father was wronged for three reasons...

31
00:04:58,284 --> 00:05:01,064
Kang Han Su!

32
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:03,774
Yes. I am Kang Han Su.

33
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:09,134
One who has never lost a case. The best attorney in Joseon, Kang Han Su.

34
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:10,804
And...

35
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:15,654
the son of Legal Officer Kang, whom you killed seven years ago. Kang Han Su.

36
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:26,194
So look forward to it.

37
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:34,994
This is the declaration I am making to you all.

38
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:38,854
I am saying I am declaring war.

39
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:49,674
 Episode 8: Confession

40
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:54,764
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

41
00:05:54,764 --> 00:05:56,350
 Moonlight Hall

42
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:00,144
Hyeongnim!

43
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:02,594
- Sir...
 - Hyeongnim...

44
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:13,904
Merchant Jo! Merchant Jo!

45
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:16,614
What the hell were you doing outside?

46
00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:19,164
Please calm down, your Excellency.

47
00:06:19,164 --> 00:06:22,214
- That Kang Han Su! 
 - Your Excellency!

48
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:26,044
If you make your move rashly, you will only reveal your identity to people.

49
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:29,364
And what if Minister Yu hears about this?

50
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:31,944
Then? Then what?

51
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:36,754
We should look for a quieter way to deal with this.

52
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,650
 Plaintiff

53
00:07:31,824 --> 00:07:35,434
Sir, are you feeling better?

54
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:37,044
Sorry.

55
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:39,844
I lacked tact and woke up too early.

56
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:42,604
Finish what you were doing.

57
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:46,804
Taking off my clothes, touching, and stroking and stuff.

58
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:48,574
It's not like you have nine lives.

59
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:51,954
Why do you keep doing crazy stuff like that?

60
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:55,834
It's already the third time you've passed out in my arms.

61
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:01,154
I know, right? I...

62
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:06,614
I have only passed out three times in my life.

63
00:08:07,764 --> 00:08:10,034
And it was always with you.

64
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:15,254
I must trust you that much then.

65
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:34,974
Did you get hurt?

66
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:37,944
- Pardon? 
 - Over here.

67
00:08:37,944 --> 00:08:39,394
Anywhere else? How about where you fell?

68
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,654
Is your knee okay?

69
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:46,170
You should have looked out for yourself and hidden behind me.

70
00:08:46,974 --> 00:08:50,250
Had I done so, we would both be dead.

71
00:08:52,434 --> 00:08:56,524
But still, do not fight back hastily like this.

72
00:08:56,524 --> 00:09:00,294
When I get hurt, I will heal in a few days, but when you get hurt...

73
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:06,704
it will not heal. It will stay in my heart for a long, long time.

74
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:08,954
As guilt.

75
00:09:11,324 --> 00:09:17,274
I will never lose another person I cherish ever again.

76
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:21,044
That is why I will fight even harder with my life on the line.

77
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:24,074
And when this fight is over,

78
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:29,924
I am considering living an ordinary life like others,

79
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:33,164
doing things other people do.

80
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:38,044
Things that other people do?

81
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:42,654
Yes, well, you know, those things...

82
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:49,474
Well... I will get married, too.

83
00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:51,614
Once I get married...

84
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:55,354
I will have children, too.

85
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:58,794
And stuff like this.

86
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:16,004
I am proposing to you.

87
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:20,234
Sir...

88
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:22,154
So...

89
00:10:25,054 --> 00:10:26,984
will you wait for me?

90
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:41,544
I have... a confession as well.

91
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:51,474
After this case is wrapped up,

92
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:54,064
I will tell you then.

93
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:57,594
So...

94
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:01,574
will you wait for me?

95
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:05,904
Sure. Sounds good.

96
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:10,244
I will wait for you... and you will wait for me.

97
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:13,734
Let us wait for each other.

98
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,700
 Anjim Public House

99
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:41,004
You asked Kang Han Su to work on a case connected to Minister Chu?

100
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:42,644
Yes.

101
00:11:42,644 --> 00:11:45,054
What exactly was your intention behind it?

102
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:49,474
Kang Han Su came to me and asked me to help him meet the princess.

103
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:53,274
Instead of giving him a clear answer, I gave him the Young Master Chu's incident and earned some time.

104
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:55,504
Are you saying you were being considerate of me?

105
00:11:55,504 --> 00:11:58,264
Also to satisfy my curiosity as well.

106
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:02,264
Are you not curious, Princess?

107
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:05,654
Whether all the things that Kang Han Su has done were coincidence,

108
00:12:05,654 --> 00:12:10,474
or if they were all a part of his revenge plot... are you already aware of all that?

109
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:13,534
Whatever Kang Han Su is trying to do,

110
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:16,334
I do not care if it is revenge.

111
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:24,254
Starting now, as So Won, I will only worry about protecting him.

112
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:41,444
 When will you open up to Kang Han Su about your identity?

113
00:12:43,134 --> 00:12:45,504
 Not now.

114
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:49,044
If I reveal the truth too rashly,

115
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:53,124
I already know how he will react with his fiery temper.

116
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:56,914
So I am trying to be careful.

117
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:13,844
 Going up against my father is like going up against the entire Joseon.

118
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:16,014
In the future,

119
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:22,364
we will have to fight against this nation of Joseon.

120
00:13:22,364 --> 00:13:25,284
I made up my mind to protect Kang Han Su.

121
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:27,564
So I will do anything.

122
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:31,024
If I have to hide my identity, I will do so even more tightly.

123
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:34,434
If I have to become a villain, I will do as well.

124
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:42,354
That is why you asked to meet with me first.

125
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:47,744
Because you may need my help to protect Kang Han Su.

126
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,954
But that is not everything.

127
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:54,244
I thought perhaps...

128
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:59,024
you might be able to stand with justice over blood ties.

129
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:01,954
Well, then.

130
00:14:03,414 --> 00:14:06,654
How did you hurt your face?

131
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,004
It is nothing.

132
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,010
 Wishes Inn

133
00:14:57,804 --> 00:14:59,374
How can you smile now?

134
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:02,934
You set fire to Minister Chu's heart.

135
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:04,434
I did.

136
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:09,164
Minister Chu will not sit back. Do you have a plan?

137
00:15:09,164 --> 00:15:10,024
As for that—

138
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:12,474
I will help him.

139
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:17,824
We have to destroy him before he makes his move.

140
00:15:17,824 --> 00:15:19,904
Is that not so?

141
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:22,824
That is right!

142
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:25,654
And what if you get hurt again, Sir?

143
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:28,154
Gosh, be careful what you say.

144
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:31,664
You have already suffered enough. Everything will be fine going forward.

145
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,634
Yes, yes.

146
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:35,064
See, Dong Chi?

147
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:38,784
We have so many on our side. What is there to worry about?

148
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:42,194
We will win for sure.

149
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,430
 Moonlight Hall

150
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:56,114
What do you mean we cannot go in?

151
00:15:56,114 --> 00:16:00,444
All the rooms are empty in broad daylight. Why do you refuse customers?

152
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:01,824
My apologies, Sir.

153
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:05,724
We have special guests today.

154
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,174
Now, now, everyone. Let us just leave.

155
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:11,614
We never partied at a place like this anyway.

156
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:14,994
I know of a bar near the entrance of Namcheon.

157
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:16,954
- Let us go there. 
 - Come on now.

158
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:19,234
- Let us go. Let us. 
 - Why all this on such a nice day?

159
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,564
We would be in no mood to drink without any beautiful women.

160
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:27,074
That man wearing the colorful robe is the new chief advisor.

161
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:32,414
They must have come as a group to celebrate among themselves.

162
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:36,144
You must be very proud.

163
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:41,284
Since a man from your Sarim*  party has taken a key post.
  (Opposition to Hungu Party)

164
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:43,944
It has been so long since I decided to work with Minister Yu.

165
00:16:43,944 --> 00:16:45,614
Why do you bring up my background?

166
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:48,704
But you would still retain your origin.

167
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:53,624
Why not you just settle the score with His Majesty?

168
00:16:57,774 --> 00:17:01,014
I cannot do that.

169
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:06,014
Out of the eight provinces of Joseon, six of them are still Sarim Party's world.

170
00:17:06,014 --> 00:17:11,054
If there were to be an internal conflict, they will try to take over Hanyang.

171
00:17:11,054 --> 00:17:14,344
They deny money and power.

172
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:17,774
All they believe in is what they read in books written by holy men.

173
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:22,554
They think doing what they study is the only truthful path.

174
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:29,304
If Joseon were to go down, that stubborn Sarim Party would be the reason.

175
00:17:29,304 --> 00:17:33,414
There are more and more of those people in the royal court. My goodness.

176
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:36,954
This is all because of that attorney, is it not?

177
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:41,634
I had no idea one mere attorney would muddy the waters.

178
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:44,744
So be cautious for a while, everyone.

179
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:49,104
You should not do anything that people could criticize.

180
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:57,144
It will be okay.

181
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,304
Go now.

182
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,430
 Business Bureau

183
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:21,904
Why can you still not get a confession out of him?

184
00:18:21,904 --> 00:18:27,034
People who have nothing usually cannot stand injustice.

185
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:30,064
And there is an attorney for someone like him now.

186
00:18:30,064 --> 00:18:31,784
What are you going to do now?

187
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:33,854
An attorney?

188
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:37,634
Hurry it up.

189
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:41,094
Before it reaches the ears of Minister Yu, you should wrap up this case.

190
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:45,794
Whether it is torture or threat, get his confession using whatever means necessary.

191
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:47,594
Yes, Your Excellency.

192
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:55,324
The day that Kang Han Su submits a lawsuit complaint, will be a headache for me.

193
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:09,204
It has been too long.

194
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:11,924
I have waited for you for so long.

195
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:17,024
I could not come too often.

196
00:19:18,694 --> 00:19:24,314
 Not only your meals, but I also had to prepare a drinking table for the prison guards.

197
00:19:24,314 --> 00:19:27,060
 Every time I walk into prison, I have to pay to get in.

198
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,580
 Entry 
 Prison Gate

199
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:34,654
 It costs 8kg of rice just to remove the knifed-neck shackle.

200
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:37,744
Are you saying that so I could hear?

201
00:19:44,074 --> 00:19:46,434
That's not what I meant.

202
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:52,804
Because you were sad about me not coming here often,

203
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:55,844
I just explained what I was dealing with.

204
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:42,814
So did you convince him?

205
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:53,674
It is so sweet!

206
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:55,164
Why is herbal medicine so sweet?

207
00:20:55,164 --> 00:20:58,314
Perhaps our lives are so bitter.

208
00:20:58,314 --> 00:21:02,304
Orabeoni, when did we ever enjoy such a lap of luxury?

209
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,004
That is what I am saying.

210
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:07,074
Gosh, I want to live here forever.

211
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:08,784
Me, too.

212
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:10,974
- Here you go. 
 - Again?

213
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:14,224
I will speak to the innkeeper about it.

214
00:21:14,224 --> 00:21:16,294
Stay here comfortably.

215
00:21:17,054 --> 00:21:20,034
Hyeongnim!

216
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:21,814
We have trouble!

217
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:27,630
- Why? 
 - Lee Bong Sam made a confession!

218
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:32,914
He's being transferred to the Justice Department prison!

219
00:21:32,914 --> 00:21:34,340
What?

220
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,560
 Royal Charity Court

221
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,804
Wait, wait!

222
00:21:38,804 --> 00:21:40,044
What is going on?

223
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:42,714
Did Minister Chu threaten you?

224
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:46,364
I killed him.

225
00:21:46,364 --> 00:21:48,154
Wait...

226
00:21:48,154 --> 00:21:50,104
Chil Gu...

227
00:21:50,104 --> 00:21:52,764
I am the one who killed him.

228
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:12,464
 I realized at that moment that if Chil Gu died,

229
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:16,124
 I thought the debt I owed him would go away.

230
00:22:16,124 --> 00:22:18,644
 Hey, Bong Sam!

231
00:22:20,344 --> 00:22:24,584
 Bong Sam, the wheat you borrowed from me last month...

232
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:26,084
 When will you pay me back?

233
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:28,644
 You borrowed 8kg of wheat from me.

234
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:31,264
 And the interest is already at 24kg.

235
00:22:31,264 --> 00:22:36,984
 I mean, if you don't have the money, quit sending Yong to school!

236
00:22:36,984 --> 00:22:40,384
 When you're dirt poor, why bother having the kid study?

237
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,564
 Aigoo! Seriously!

238
00:22:54,014 --> 00:22:58,584
 And my son caught me thinking that very thought.

239
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:08,144
Sir, to hang onto my life when I am so terrible...

240
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:12,164
I cannot have my family take on even more debt.

241
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:22,604
Even though they say people have different weights of conscience...

242
00:23:22,604 --> 00:23:27,364
But if you die like this, what will Yong learn from it?

243
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:32,114
Only resentment for this world and the injustice he feels will stay with him.

244
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:35,054
Even so, it would be like hitting a boulder with an egg.

245
00:23:35,054 --> 00:23:37,344
No matter what crazy deed one does,

246
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:42,264
I have never seen a high official's son get punished for it.

247
00:23:43,264 --> 00:23:46,624
How about your family then? Are they stupid or something?

248
00:23:47,754 --> 00:23:49,644
Pardon?

249
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,544
I cannot do it.

250
00:23:54,544 --> 00:23:56,204
No, I will not.

251
00:23:56,204 --> 00:24:00,164
What kind of wife in this world would tell her husband to confess to a crime he did not commit

252
00:24:00,164 --> 00:24:02,174
and die a murderer?

253
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:05,204
It is not right. Not at all.

254
00:24:05,204 --> 00:24:11,694
By chance, do you mean to give up on a chance to own 400-pyeong (1/3 acre) of farmland?

255
00:24:13,394 --> 00:24:18,884
If you own the land, you do not need to pay the rent, and whatever you work for will all be yours.

256
00:24:18,884 --> 00:24:21,274
Then your wealth will build up.

257
00:24:21,274 --> 00:24:26,114
And with that money, your son, who is known to be a genius in the village

258
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:28,234
could take the state examination.

259
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:34,144
As long as he passes the exam, you and your son could live as nobles.

260
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:36,304
I do not want that!

261
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:43,364
I do not want to live as a noble.

262
00:24:44,264 --> 00:24:47,094
I want to live as my father's son.

263
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:50,044
Well...

264
00:24:50,844 --> 00:24:54,514
Yong, you do not know much since you are young.

265
00:24:54,514 --> 00:24:56,944
No, I do not know.

266
00:24:56,944 --> 00:24:59,344
But I could still choose.

267
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:03,554
Rather than a noble who sits up high, lies,

268
00:25:03,554 --> 00:25:07,964
and frames an innocent man,

269
00:25:09,304 --> 00:25:14,014
I respect my father more, who works so hard with sweat and blood

270
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,634
and lives an honest life.

271
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:21,034
So I do not want to become a noble.

272
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:24,834
I want to live as my father's son.

273
00:25:40,444 --> 00:25:41,644
Yong!

274
00:25:41,644 --> 00:25:43,674
Father.

275
00:25:47,984 --> 00:25:49,594
Father.

276
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:55,334
Please be healthy and live a long life by my side.

277
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:58,604
You cannot go this way.

278
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:12,924
I am sorry, Attorney.

279
00:26:12,924 --> 00:26:16,434
I have messed things up. What can I do to fix it?

280
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:18,654
I did not think things through.

281
00:26:18,654 --> 00:26:20,514
Please.

282
00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:23,904
Please help my family!

283
00:26:23,904 --> 00:26:26,444
I will not do such a foolish thing anymore!

284
00:26:26,444 --> 00:26:28,554
I will not give up ever again!

285
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:30,804
So, please...

286
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:33,884
Yes! This is right!

287
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:37,534
You should have said so sooner!

288
00:26:37,534 --> 00:26:39,344
Do not worry.

289
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:42,424
I am Kang Han Su.

290
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,770
 Court House

291
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,444
What? 
  Court House

292
00:27:00,444 --> 00:27:06,404
Are you saying it was a false confession due to unbearable torture?

293
00:27:06,404 --> 00:27:08,294
That is right, Sir.

294
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,844
Here. 
  Great Collection of Laws

295
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:13,114
Okay, if you look at this book of the law,

296
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:15,504
you must use a designated punishment site for torture

297
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:17,734
and you must not administer more than thirty floggings at one time.

298
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:23,454
And it says you cannot torture someone twice within three days.

299
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:27,354
However, here at Gyeonggi Provincial Office, you gave Lee Bong Sam fifty floggings

300
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,824
and even twisted his legs.

301
00:27:28,824 --> 00:27:31,184
And on two consecutive days at that.

302
00:27:31,184 --> 00:27:34,804
Who goes by all those regulations?

303
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:39,244
It was designated according to the King's order.

304
00:27:39,244 --> 00:27:44,154
So are you saying it is okay to go against the King's order?

305
00:27:44,154 --> 00:27:46,624
And the three branches that deal with the law,

306
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:47,924
Hangseongbu, Ministry of Justice, and the Office of Inspector General.

307
00:27:47,924 --> 00:27:53,314
It is not something one of the legal branches, the head of the Ministry of Justice, should say.

308
00:27:53,314 --> 00:27:56,024
If Lee Bong Sam is not the murderer,

309
00:27:56,724 --> 00:27:59,304
you are saying someone else is the culprit, are you not?

310
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:02,704
Yes. The son of Associate Right Minister of Chief Administrative Agency, Minister Chu.

311
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:05,624
Chu Dae Seong is the real culprit.

312
00:28:05,624 --> 00:28:07,674
He was arrested immediately after the murder

313
00:28:07,674 --> 00:28:10,574
and even was locked up in the Gyeonggi government office's jail for the night.

314
00:28:10,574 --> 00:28:13,774
There must be a record of that as well.

315
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:18,324
You sound very confident.

316
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:24,084
Yes. So the truth should be revealed through a retrial.

317
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:25,834
Then...

318
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:29,714
will you put your neck on the line?

319
00:28:29,714 --> 00:28:31,414
Excuse me?

320
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:36,464
As you have said, this is where

321
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,174
high treason, treason, misdemeanors,

322
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:41,864
blasphemy, the crime of disrespect for the throne, and the crime of false reporting are punished.

323
00:28:41,864 --> 00:28:45,734
This is the Ministry of Justice, where usually murderers or traitors die.

324
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:49,034
You may walk in here, but you'll leave on your back.

325
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,164
It is also the responsibility of the head of this department

326
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:58,294
to show what happens if you mouth off in a place like this.

327
00:28:58,294 --> 00:29:02,574
According to your advice, I wish to do my best in carrying out my duty.

328
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,174
What do you mean by that?

329
00:29:05,174 --> 00:29:08,434
If you cannot prove that Chu Dae Seong is the culprit,

330
00:29:08,434 --> 00:29:11,694
you are the one who is accusing an innocent.

331
00:29:11,694 --> 00:29:13,434
For making a false accusation,

332
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:17,154
you will be punished as a murderer just the same.

333
00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:23,684
If you think you can handle that, I will approve the retrial.

334
00:29:24,644 --> 00:29:26,644
Or...

335
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:32,550
I will decide Lee Bong Sam is the culprit and submit a report of the verdict to the royal court.

336
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,934
What would you like to do?

337
00:29:48,784 --> 00:29:50,784
Of course...

338
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:56,784
I will accept your offer.

339
00:30:08,994 --> 00:30:10,054
Sir!

340
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:12,374
What happened?

341
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:20,354
That's right. Well...

342
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:22,684
if you kill someone, you have to pay with a life.

343
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:26,154
If you want to save someone, you should put your life on the line.

344
00:30:26,154 --> 00:30:27,354
How nice is that?

345
00:30:27,354 --> 00:30:29,554
No matter how many times you put your life on the line,

346
00:30:29,554 --> 00:30:31,854
you only die once, anyway.

347
00:30:31,854 --> 00:30:34,314
I just love it.

348
00:30:34,314 --> 00:30:37,074
Yeah, right. It's all good.

349
00:30:37,074 --> 00:30:39,594
I get it, but

350
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:41,394
why?

351
00:30:43,554 --> 00:30:45,354
Because we're one.

352
00:30:45,354 --> 00:30:46,974
We share a destiny.

353
00:30:46,974 --> 00:30:50,004
We live together, we die, you know?

354
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:56,994
There are three of us now.

355
00:31:02,764 --> 00:31:04,694
This is crazy.

356
00:31:04,694 --> 00:31:07,404
So! What will you do now?

357
00:31:07,404 --> 00:31:09,604
What else can I do?

358
00:31:09,604 --> 00:31:11,274
I have to fight it with the law,

359
00:31:11,274 --> 00:31:13,704
as I have always been doing.

360
00:31:36,504 --> 00:31:38,420
Next.

361
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:40,904
Next. 
  Attorney for Hire

362
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:49,204
Legal Officer, make your statement.

363
00:31:49,204 --> 00:31:52,464
 Judge / Legal Officer

364
00:31:52,464 --> 00:31:53,944
 Lee Bong Sam / Kang Chil Gu / Chu Dae Seong

365
00:31:53,944 --> 00:31:55,974
 Yes, Ma'am.

366
00:31:59,174 --> 00:32:02,094
- I am innocent! 
 - If Lee Bong Sam killed him,

367
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:05,334
pieces of evidence like these should be at the crime scene.

368
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:06,984
Is that not so, everyone?

369
00:32:06,984 --> 00:32:09,514
That is correct! 
  Legal Officer

370
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:12,754
Flog that man 300 times. 
  Judge / Secretary

371
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:21,974
 No one in Joseon could beat me in a trial.

372
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:28,034
We need to counterattack this time.

373
00:32:28,034 --> 00:32:30,774
It will take some time, but what can we do?

374
00:32:30,774 --> 00:32:34,664
There is no way to beat Kang Han Su through a trial.

375
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:37,864
All right.

376
00:32:38,564 --> 00:32:40,534
I will do so.

377
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:03,114
What?

378
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:05,894
Hyeongnim!

379
00:33:05,894 --> 00:33:07,874
Hyeongnim!

380
00:33:07,874 --> 00:33:09,044
Why?

381
00:33:09,044 --> 00:33:12,114
Today's trial was canceled!

382
00:33:12,114 --> 00:33:13,334
Why?

383
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:17,330
The Justice Department official who was supposed to interrogate the criminal got a stomach ache.

384
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,450
Does that make any sense?

385
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:22,814
Did they say when the next date will be?

386
00:33:22,814 --> 00:33:25,344
They said just wait for now.

387
00:33:25,344 --> 00:33:27,424
Damn it.

388
00:33:37,454 --> 00:33:39,684
Father!

389
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:45,004
Father!

390
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:55,974
What is going on?

391
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:01,834
We need a physician.

392
00:34:03,634 --> 00:34:06,964
Hyeongnim! Over there! Look there!

393
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:13,834
Poison?

394
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:15,334
P-Poison?

395
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:20,874
By chance, are these people trying to kill my husband to prevent a trial?

396
00:34:20,874 --> 00:34:23,864
Please take Yong home for now. We will look after—

397
00:34:23,864 --> 00:34:25,334
- Yong! 
 - I will go.

398
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:28,034
So Won, Dong Chi, take care of things here.

399
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:30,764
Please leave it to Attorney Kang for now.

400
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:33,774
How could this happen?

401
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:36,474
Damn it. Those bastards!

402
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,404
How dare they use such a despicable method!

403
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,984
Save my father!

404
00:34:42,984 --> 00:34:45,284
What did my father do wrong?

405
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:47,634
The person who did wrong is...

406
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:49,404
It's you, Young Master Chu!

407
00:34:49,404 --> 00:34:52,034
I saw everything!

408
00:34:53,554 --> 00:34:55,464
Come on.

409
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:59,974
Kid, you sure have a loud voice for no good reason.

410
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:10,724
Young Master Chu was the one who killed Ahjussi Chil Gu.

411
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:14,334
But why is my father getting punished?

412
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:16,494
Why!

413
00:35:18,554 --> 00:35:20,554
You!

414
00:35:27,724 --> 00:35:30,054
What are you doing to a child?

415
00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:32,644
He's dirty. So I moved him aside.

416
00:35:33,694 --> 00:35:37,834
It seems he's the son of the murderer.

417
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:40,974
Why do you not tell him properly?

418
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:44,324
Your father did not die because of me.

419
00:35:44,324 --> 00:35:47,734
He is dying because of you, Kang Han Su.

420
00:35:47,734 --> 00:35:49,634
What?

421
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:53,394
If Lee Bong Sam were to die, it would all be your fault!

422
00:35:53,394 --> 00:35:58,644
I did not want to give you any reason to pick on me so I am using him as a sacrifice.

423
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:04,474
Thus, try to save him if you are able.

424
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:07,154
The next trial date...

425
00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:10,704
will be at least another month.

426
00:36:10,704 --> 00:36:14,424
And the trial will get canceled again.

427
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:16,504
And the trial after that.

428
00:36:16,504 --> 00:36:18,794
Why?

429
00:36:18,794 --> 00:36:21,364
Because I have the power to do so.

430
00:36:21,364 --> 00:36:27,454
The law can be handled by only those who have power.

431
00:36:29,194 --> 00:36:31,644
Do you get it, kid?

432
00:36:52,214 --> 00:36:58,044
What is going to... happen to my father now?

433
00:36:58,044 --> 00:37:00,044
Will he...

434
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,484
Will he be able to get treated by a physician?

435
00:37:05,284 --> 00:37:07,314
Will he?

436
00:37:07,314 --> 00:37:09,614
How about the trial?

437
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:22,484
I am sorry.

438
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:25,334
- Pardon? 
 - It seems...

439
00:37:27,694 --> 00:37:30,194
we will have to give up on trial.

440
00:37:44,844 --> 00:37:47,964
Geez... who is it–

441
00:37:47,964 --> 00:37:51,184
F-F-Father.

442
00:37:51,184 --> 00:37:53,304
You sure are living the life.

443
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,604
You fool.

444
00:37:56,404 --> 00:38:00,454
Do you even know what I am going around doing because of you?

445
00:38:00,454 --> 00:38:03,764
M-M-My apologies...

446
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:06,654
Only if I had another son!

447
00:38:39,544 --> 00:38:45,074
 If Man Gap takes a break, who should do his tasks instead?

448
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:50,984
 Well, other servants should divide up the tasks.

449
00:38:58,094 --> 00:39:01,154
 Do you know the reason they exist?

450
00:39:01,154 --> 00:39:02,674
 Pardon?

451
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,054
 To make this into a country of Confucianism,

452
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:07,784
 us, nobles, must study all our lives.

453
00:39:07,784 --> 00:39:10,374
 They exist to support us.

454
00:39:10,374 --> 00:39:15,554
 Other than that, they are no different than animals that eat, poop, and sleep.

455
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:18,534
 You are our only son in three generations.

456
00:39:18,534 --> 00:39:23,024
 And if you are going around wondering if the servants are sick or not,

457
00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:25,684
 how will you ever study?

458
00:39:26,384 --> 00:39:30,014
 First, pass the state exam.

459
00:39:30,014 --> 00:39:32,804
 That is the reason for your existence.

460
00:39:35,364 --> 00:39:38,364
 You passed! You passed!

461
00:39:45,184 --> 00:39:47,624
 It was a mistake.

462
00:39:47,624 --> 00:39:50,044
 It had to have been a mistake.

463
00:39:50,044 --> 00:39:52,244
 Do you understand?

464
00:39:52,244 --> 00:39:53,984
 Yes.

465
00:39:53,984 --> 00:39:56,274
 Next time, I will definitely...

466
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,314
 It was a mistake, Father.

467
00:40:19,314 --> 00:40:20,954
 No!

468
00:40:20,954 --> 00:40:23,814
 It was my mistake to give birth to you and raise you.

469
00:40:23,814 --> 00:40:27,704
 Even a lowly servant fulfills his role.

470
00:40:27,704 --> 00:40:30,584
 You are worse than a servant.

471
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:50,004
 Do you dare look down on me?

472
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:56,014
 How dare you?

473
00:40:57,064 --> 00:40:59,474
 You are nothing but a servant...

474
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:13,204
I did all I could do.

475
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:17,774
Now, the patient must endure.

476
00:41:17,774 --> 00:41:20,234
All right, then.

477
00:41:25,364 --> 00:41:27,984
How could he survive in a place like this?

478
00:41:40,574 --> 00:41:42,454
My sister?

479
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:55,434
Minister Yu.

480
00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:00,050
I brought petitions that require your response within the day.

481
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,414
But were you on your way out?

482
00:42:06,764 --> 00:42:08,654
Well, the thing is...

483
00:42:16,014 --> 00:42:18,064
Princess.

484
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,494
What brings you here?

485
00:42:21,494 --> 00:42:24,484
I heard Young Master Chu's trial was canceled so I stopped by the inn out of worry

486
00:42:24,484 --> 00:42:27,374
and heard that you came into the palace.

487
00:42:30,004 --> 00:42:33,104
What if someone sees you while you are out and about like this?

488
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:37,334
Why are you so reckless?

489
00:42:37,334 --> 00:42:39,874
What will you do by meeting His Majesty?

490
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:42,164
I will ask him to change the judge.

491
00:42:42,164 --> 00:42:46,274
It is not right for Minister Won to oversee this case to begin with.

492
00:42:46,274 --> 00:42:49,264
Minister Won's daughter and Young Master Chu will be married soon.

493
00:42:49,264 --> 00:42:51,274
As for marriage talks...

494
00:42:53,854 --> 00:42:56,664
they could be broken at any given point.

495
00:42:57,774 --> 00:43:01,474
Thus, there is no need for Minister Won to recuse himself.

496
00:43:01,474 --> 00:43:05,494
It is also not the fault of Minister Won that one of the interrogators came down with a stomach ache.

497
00:43:05,494 --> 00:43:08,004
Everything is Minister Chu's trickery. Do you not know this?

498
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:10,364
How could I not know?

499
00:43:10,364 --> 00:43:12,994
It is just that I am telling you

500
00:43:12,994 --> 00:43:16,474
I have no reason to blame them nor recuse them from the trial.

501
00:43:20,954 --> 00:43:25,994
If you step forward so rashly this way, you can harm His Majesty.

502
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:33,694
Many people are watching you. So, please leave the palace for now.

503
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:37,594
I will speak to His Majesty.

504
00:43:38,194 --> 00:43:39,994
Court Lady Hong.

505
00:44:06,254 --> 00:44:09,034
Do not worry.

506
00:44:09,034 --> 00:44:14,444
As always, Attorney Kang will find a way.

507
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,370
There.

508
00:44:43,824 --> 00:44:46,264
Now you see me?

509
00:44:47,904 --> 00:44:50,434
What are you thinking so deeply about?

510
00:44:50,434 --> 00:44:52,764
Wondering what kind of underhanded means

511
00:44:52,764 --> 00:44:55,874
I should use against these nasty people to be even nastier.

512
00:44:55,874 --> 00:45:00,194
Anything. You must punish them by whatever means.

513
00:45:02,154 --> 00:45:04,434
Whoa, what in the world?

514
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:07,174
You always cared about rules and duty.

515
00:45:07,174 --> 00:45:10,684
That depends on who it is and the situation we are dealing with.

516
00:45:11,784 --> 00:45:16,534
Would it not be so nice if there was a tonic like this that makes you

517
00:45:16,534 --> 00:45:18,554
spill truth once you drink it down?

518
00:45:18,554 --> 00:45:21,734
If there was such a thing, an attorney like me—

519
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:24,504
There is.

520
00:45:25,404 --> 00:45:28,294
There is. There is. There is.

521
00:45:28,294 --> 00:45:30,074
Great! That's it!

522
00:45:30,074 --> 00:45:32,064
That was it!

523
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:35,964
Our So Won, how pretty you are.

524
00:45:35,964 --> 00:45:38,764
You're the prettiest in the world.

525
00:45:38,764 --> 00:45:39,834
Where are you going?

526
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:42,524
To make a tonic that Young Master Chu will drink.

527
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:52,864
What is that?

528
00:45:52,864 --> 00:45:54,704
Money.

529
00:45:54,704 --> 00:45:59,024
When you took my girls and tortured them, I am sure you were paid money.

530
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:03,034
No way it was only money.

531
00:46:06,304 --> 00:46:09,804
I am also not saying I will only offer you money.

532
00:46:10,914 --> 00:46:13,674
What can you give me then?

533
00:46:16,724 --> 00:46:19,224
A chance to

534
00:46:19,224 --> 00:46:21,774
- change sides. 
 - What?

535
00:46:21,774 --> 00:46:24,764
Right about now, I am sure you have a lot on your mind.

536
00:46:24,764 --> 00:46:27,644
I am sure you probably feel you have gone down the wrong path.

537
00:46:27,644 --> 00:46:30,824
So you want to take my side, but you have no reason.

538
00:46:30,824 --> 00:46:33,604
So you are hesitant. Are you not?

539
00:46:35,024 --> 00:46:36,814
Stop trying to sell your idea.

540
00:46:36,814 --> 00:46:39,024
Just get to the point.

541
00:46:39,024 --> 00:46:42,014
I will decide after I hear about it.

542
00:46:44,954 --> 00:46:46,814
Come on.

543
00:46:56,044 --> 00:47:01,884
I do not think that will hasten the trial, though.

544
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:05,954
There is no rule that says I can only win through the trial.

545
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:11,880
 Jo's Mercantile

546
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,694
Happy now?

547
00:47:39,694 --> 00:47:43,984
It is a list of merchant ships coming into Mapo dock next month and their inventory.

548
00:47:45,244 --> 00:47:48,234
You could have given me help for free, like earlier.

549
00:47:48,234 --> 00:47:51,154
Nothing in this world is free.

550
00:47:51,154 --> 00:47:54,624
I mean, you know this full well.

551
00:48:11,914 --> 00:48:13,854
Young Master.

552
00:48:14,654 --> 00:48:16,534
Young Master.

553
00:48:18,674 --> 00:48:20,194
What is it?

554
00:48:20,194 --> 00:48:22,604
You have a guest.

555
00:48:32,814 --> 00:48:35,124
Our fathers are quite close,

556
00:48:35,124 --> 00:48:38,044
but I was sad that we could not get together often.

557
00:48:38,044 --> 00:48:41,894
No, it is because I have not advanced in status just yet.

558
00:48:41,894 --> 00:48:43,474
Since you do not neglect your studies,

559
00:48:43,474 --> 00:48:46,534
I am sure you will pass the state exam soon.

560
00:48:46,534 --> 00:48:52,294
I heard there are quite a few scholars who lack luck in taking exams.

561
00:48:52,294 --> 00:48:54,214
But as they say, devotion will touch heaven.

562
00:48:54,214 --> 00:48:58,284
I am sure heaven will know of your efforts.

563
00:48:58,284 --> 00:49:02,054
I am moved to tears to hear you say that.

564
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:08,150
In any case, your father must be in grave distress over the recent incident.

565
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,684
Yes.

566
00:49:11,684 --> 00:49:14,064
According to Lee Bong Sam's attorney Kang Han Su,

567
00:49:14,064 --> 00:49:17,374
you are the culprit who killed victim Kang Chil Gu.

568
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:20,314
He said he even has proof.

569
00:49:20,314 --> 00:49:22,204
Proof?

570
00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:25,184
So I brought you an autopsy report.

571
00:49:25,184 --> 00:49:29,404
Without this, Attorney Kang's argument is of no use.

572
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:37,774
Wh-What is wrong?

573
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:40,334
By chance, did that Kang Han Su...

574
00:49:40,334 --> 00:49:41,924
This is not good.

575
00:49:41,924 --> 00:49:45,364
If Kang Han Su pleads to the King during the procession, with the proof,

576
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:48,950
your father will not be able to avoid taking responsibility.

577
00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:54,624
Where are you going?

578
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:57,474
I have to stop that attorney, so he cannot run his mouth!

579
00:49:57,474 --> 00:49:59,504
Look!

580
00:50:16,724 --> 00:50:18,754
Kang Han Su?

581
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:22,024
Kang Han Su!

582
00:50:31,924 --> 00:50:33,604
 Have you not heard of the crime of false accusation?

583
00:50:33,604 --> 00:50:36,844
 If the fact your father framed Lee Bong Sam is revealed,

584
00:50:36,844 --> 00:50:40,154
 he can be punished for murder instead.

585
00:50:42,514 --> 00:50:44,914
No! No! No!

586
00:50:44,914 --> 00:50:48,534
 Then who will your father blame the most?

587
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:53,134
 Kang Han Su? Or you?

588
00:51:09,214 --> 00:51:11,844
Never. I can never forgive him.

589
00:51:11,844 --> 00:51:14,774
Stop, Kang Han Su!

590
00:51:28,244 --> 00:51:30,544
Kang Han Su!

591
00:51:35,434 --> 00:51:39,774
It is the honor of my household to greet you this way.

592
00:51:44,614 --> 00:51:47,724
You asshole!

593
00:51:47,724 --> 00:51:50,374
Wh-Wh-What?

594
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:51,424
Give it to me!

595
00:51:51,424 --> 00:51:53,034
What? What are you talking about?

596
00:51:53,034 --> 00:51:55,084
You found proof or something? Give it!

597
00:51:55,084 --> 00:51:59,500
Calm down! If you do this here, it is your loss!

598
00:52:18,684 --> 00:52:21,584
Are you kidding me, you asshole!

599
00:52:24,744 --> 00:52:26,794
Do you dare report me?

600
00:52:26,794 --> 00:52:28,464
What did I do wrong?

601
00:52:28,464 --> 00:52:30,544
What is so wrong about teaching a lowly servant a lesson?

602
00:52:30,544 --> 00:52:33,284
It is the dead man's fault!

603
00:52:33,284 --> 00:52:37,114
Minister Chu. Does Minister Chu know about it, too?

604
00:52:37,114 --> 00:52:38,284
How dare you mention my father!

605
00:52:38,284 --> 00:52:41,684
No! Listen to me!

606
00:52:42,614 --> 00:52:46,684
I heard you are the only son Minister Chu has.

607
00:52:46,684 --> 00:52:50,284
But that one and only son...

608
00:52:51,444 --> 00:52:54,824
is so, is such a...

609
00:52:54,824 --> 00:52:58,284
lout.

610
00:52:58,284 --> 00:53:00,370
Does he know?

611
00:53:05,894 --> 00:53:08,174
That asshole!

612
00:53:11,364 --> 00:53:12,994
No.

613
00:53:12,994 --> 00:53:14,514
He does know.

614
00:53:14,514 --> 00:53:17,714
That is why he's running all over the place to save his only son

615
00:53:17,714 --> 00:53:21,574
talking to the Gyeonggi Inspector and pleading with the Minister of Justice he's about to be in-laws with,

616
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:25,584
asking every witness to bear false witness and bribing—

617
00:53:25,584 --> 00:53:27,554
Shut up!

618
00:53:28,794 --> 00:53:30,494
You fool!

619
00:53:30,494 --> 00:53:34,374
Only if I had another son!

620
00:53:34,374 --> 00:53:36,404
 You sure are living the life.

621
00:53:36,404 --> 00:53:39,074
 You fool.

622
00:53:39,074 --> 00:53:42,674
I will rip apart that mouth of yours!

623
00:53:45,894 --> 00:53:47,984
You asshole, Kang Han Su.

624
00:53:47,984 --> 00:53:49,254
I will kill you.

625
00:53:49,254 --> 00:53:53,204
It is as Merchant Jo said. He said it straight out.

626
00:53:56,044 --> 00:53:59,264
You! Die!

627
00:53:59,264 --> 00:54:01,354
Die!

628
00:54:15,484 --> 00:54:19,194
R-Right State Minister! L-Left State Minister!

629
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:22,334
Do not cause any more commotion. Take your leave.

630
00:54:22,334 --> 00:54:26,004
When your father finds out about this, he will be gravely worried.

631
00:54:26,904 --> 00:54:28,924
What is everyone doing?

632
00:54:28,924 --> 00:54:31,504
Close your windows.

633
00:54:39,954 --> 00:54:41,584
There...

634
00:54:52,824 --> 00:54:54,924
 Have you not heard of the crime of false accusation?

635
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:58,134
 If the fact that your father framed Lee Bong Sam is revealed,

636
00:54:58,134 --> 00:55:01,484
 he can be punished for murder instead.

637
00:55:05,784 --> 00:55:07,374
 Court House

638
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,680
 Court House

639
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:22,010
 Reach great heights of success

640
00:55:28,684 --> 00:55:30,664
What are you talking about?

641
00:55:30,664 --> 00:55:33,154
Why would my Dae Seong be there?

642
00:55:33,154 --> 00:55:34,594
I am not sure.

643
00:55:34,594 --> 00:55:39,154
I came here because I thought I should let you know.

644
00:55:58,874 --> 00:56:00,824
Chu Dae Seong! 
  Court House

645
00:56:01,784 --> 00:56:04,304
Wh-What are you doing here?

646
00:56:04,304 --> 00:56:07,314
What were you thinking when you confessed?

647
00:56:08,194 --> 00:56:10,314
If I don't?

648
00:56:10,314 --> 00:56:11,994
What?

649
00:56:13,394 --> 00:56:16,114
I heard there is a thing called the crime of false accusation.

650
00:56:16,114 --> 00:56:17,524
What are you saying?

651
00:56:17,524 --> 00:56:21,374
It is all out in the open anyway.

652
00:56:22,514 --> 00:56:25,764
I cannot pull you into this, either.

653
00:56:26,564 --> 00:56:30,504
I committed the crime. I will...

654
00:56:31,264 --> 00:56:34,384
It is right for me to be punished and die.

655
00:56:36,074 --> 00:56:38,874
In the end,

656
00:56:38,874 --> 00:56:43,274
I will not be able to pass the state exam anyway.

657
00:56:58,444 --> 00:57:00,824
Before it is too late,

658
00:57:03,934 --> 00:57:07,034
please have one more son.

659
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,734
D-Dae Seong.

660
00:57:12,734 --> 00:57:15,694
Wh-What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?

661
00:57:15,694 --> 00:57:17,404
What is wrong with you?

662
00:57:17,404 --> 00:57:19,524
Why are you doing this? Why?

663
00:57:19,524 --> 00:57:22,714
What are you doing?

664
00:57:29,144 --> 00:57:32,954
Why are you doing this?

665
00:57:50,324 --> 00:57:51,514
What did you say?

666
00:57:51,514 --> 00:57:53,144
My apologies.

667
00:57:53,144 --> 00:57:56,614
It was not something I could step forward to resolve.

668
00:58:06,564 --> 00:58:11,354
 Please listen to our plea, Your Majesty!

669
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:16,134
 Please listen to our plea, Your Majesty!

670
00:58:16,944 --> 00:58:20,644
The law must be fair for everyone under heaven.

671
00:58:20,644 --> 00:58:24,054
There cannot be an exception for an influential vassal's son!

672
00:58:24,054 --> 00:58:29,314
 Please listen to our plea, Your Majesty!

673
00:58:30,114 --> 00:58:33,704
 Please listen to our plea, Your Majesty!

674
00:58:33,704 --> 00:58:36,354
M-Minister Yu.

675
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:40,304
Why did you hide the matter for it to come this?

676
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:42,804
I am ashamed, Your Excellency.

677
00:58:42,804 --> 00:58:45,204
- It is all my lack of virtue— 
 - So,

678
00:58:45,204 --> 00:58:47,664
you should take responsibility.

679
00:58:48,564 --> 00:58:50,164
M-Minister.

680
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:08,174
Minister Yu, what should I do?

681
00:59:08,174 --> 00:59:12,764
I tried to be merciful to Associate Right Minister to save your face,

682
00:59:12,764 --> 00:59:15,944
and all the Sarim Party scholars and Sungkyunkwan Confucious scholars came running

683
00:59:15,944 --> 00:59:18,794
and are petitioning against my ruling.

684
00:59:18,794 --> 00:59:24,734
You already knew this would happen and gave him a weak verdict, did you not?

685
00:59:24,734 --> 00:59:27,194
It is not like I can foresee the future.

686
00:59:27,194 --> 00:59:30,044
How could I have predicted this?

687
00:59:50,644 --> 00:59:53,864
 Please give him the lightest of the verdict.

688
00:59:59,654 --> 01:00:03,664
 Then those who hear this will grow louder

689
01:00:03,664 --> 01:00:06,484
 and make you stronger, Your Majesty.

690
01:00:06,484 --> 01:00:08,964
 It turned out the way my sister anticipated.

691
01:00:11,724 --> 01:00:14,974
Please do according to the law, Your Majesty.

692
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:20,244
Would it be okay to do so?

693
01:00:20,244 --> 01:00:23,264
It will have a great negative impact on you and your allies.

694
01:00:23,264 --> 01:00:26,774
It is all because I lack virtue.

695
01:00:26,774 --> 01:00:29,524
So I shall handle that.

696
01:00:29,524 --> 01:00:33,644
Something as small as this should not cause the central royal court to become enemies

697
01:00:33,644 --> 01:00:36,964
with the Sarim Party scholars from all over the country.

698
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:45,004
Thank you so much for... making such a decision, Minister Yu.

699
01:00:48,554 --> 01:00:52,224
 Path of the Great Sinner

700
01:00:52,224 --> 01:00:56,244
 Who said an influential vassal's son does not receive the death penalty?

701
01:00:57,884 --> 01:00:59,984
Father...

702
01:01:01,904 --> 01:01:05,024
 The law must be fair under heaven.

703
01:01:06,734 --> 01:01:12,084
 Chu Dae Seong, who killed a neighbor and tried to accuse someone else of the crime,

704
01:01:12,084 --> 01:01:15,214
 will be hung according to the law.

705
01:02:31,804 --> 01:02:37,764
Your Excellency... how could you do this to me?

706
01:02:39,164 --> 01:02:41,224
All this time...

707
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:45,334
for your sake... for our Hungu!

708
01:02:45,334 --> 01:02:47,744
You know what I have done!

709
01:02:51,714 --> 01:02:56,764
You said there should be only one way for Joseon.

710
01:02:56,764 --> 01:03:01,214
That other voices will only cause internal conflict!

711
01:03:01,214 --> 01:03:04,504
You said we should ensure Sarim does not covet Hungu's place!

712
01:03:04,504 --> 01:03:07,824
You said we should unite as one!

713
01:03:07,824 --> 01:03:12,704
You said... we have the same destiny!

714
01:03:12,704 --> 01:03:17,894
You said that over and over again! However!

715
01:03:35,744 --> 01:03:38,404
That legal officer's son is alive.

716
01:03:38,404 --> 01:03:43,264
The rest of the ledger... I sent them to him.

717
01:03:48,014 --> 01:03:53,494
He should have at least that much to go up against you, Minister!

718
01:03:54,154 --> 01:04:00,994
Do you think that victory in war is only dependent on weapons?

719
01:04:00,994 --> 01:04:04,534
They say a pebble could never become a boulder.

720
01:04:04,534 --> 01:04:09,174
You only know how to think small. Look at how you deal with this to the end.

721
01:04:09,174 --> 01:04:13,000
Excellency! Excellency! Excellency!

722
01:04:13,734 --> 01:04:16,004
Excellency!

723
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:22,224
Excellency!

724
01:04:46,684 --> 01:04:48,784
Father!

725
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:52,584
Y-Yong.

726
01:04:54,164 --> 01:04:57,594
Lee Bong Sam endured this well.

727
01:04:57,594 --> 01:05:01,994
It is because his family believed in him and stood by him.

728
01:05:07,724 --> 01:05:09,654
Dear!

729
01:05:13,094 --> 01:05:15,074
Dear.

730
01:05:23,394 --> 01:05:25,414
 Father...

731
01:05:25,414 --> 01:05:28,714
 I protected a family this time.

732
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:32,664
 Can you see that?

733
01:06:01,104 --> 01:06:05,034
My goodness! Darn it.

734
01:06:10,624 --> 01:06:14,234
Geez, my son...

735
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:22,054
Aigoo! What in the world...

736
01:06:31,264 --> 01:06:34,584
Die! Die—

737
01:06:38,884 --> 01:06:43,344
I minded my manners and tried my best to do the proper thing for my longtime friend.

738
01:06:43,344 --> 01:06:45,384
So do not be too sad.

739
01:06:45,384 --> 01:06:49,404
If you hurry along, you might be able to

740
01:06:49,404 --> 01:06:53,604
walk with your son on his journey to the afterlife.

741
01:06:53,604 --> 01:06:58,174
Do not fret and think that your death will be in vain.

742
01:06:58,174 --> 01:07:05,264
I will gift your death to Princess Yeon Ju and Kang Han Su.

743
01:07:48,594 --> 01:07:52,514
My older brother is alive.

744
01:07:56,274 --> 01:07:58,744
Did you know?

745
01:08:06,224 --> 01:08:09,124
My son is helping your brother.

746
01:08:09,124 --> 01:08:11,884
Already many times.

747
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:16,234
So would you like to meet him or

748
01:08:16,234 --> 01:08:19,854
do you want to do what you ought to do as first promised?

749
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:58,670

750
01:08:59,554 --> 01:09:02,454
 We worked with animal experts for scenes involving animals for their safety.

 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

755
01:09:13,134 --> 01:09:14,484
 Do not enter

756
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:17,944
 Wherever you go, incidents and accidents do not seem to sto.

757
01:09:17,944 --> 01:09:21,064
 By chance, are you suspecting me?

758
01:09:21,064 --> 01:09:23,884
 How much longer will you live in Wishes Inn for free?

759
01:09:23,884 --> 01:09:25,574
 Sir?

760
01:09:25,574 --> 01:09:28,564
 What is the relationship

761
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:31,024
 between you and So Won, Mayor?
