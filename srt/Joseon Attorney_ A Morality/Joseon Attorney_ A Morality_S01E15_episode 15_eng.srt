1
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:46,650

2
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:03,724
 Father. Father.

3
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:09,914
 Please make sure to protect your mother and Eun Su...

4
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:14,134
 I am counting on you, Han Su.

5
00:01:16,154 --> 00:01:18,324
 Father!

6
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:27,454
 If something happens to Father, it is all your fault, Mother!

7
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:05,264
Han Su!

8
00:02:07,304 --> 00:02:09,574
- Let go. 
 - You can't!

9
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:11,444
Let go. Let go!

10
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:14,034
Scum like me should die! Let go!

11
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,514
- Let go of me!
 - I'll not!

12
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:21,034
If you die, what about me? How am I going to live?

13
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:24,034
What am I going to do alone?

14
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:32,784
It is all your fault, Hyeong!

15
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:38,894
Even if I refused, you should have dragged me!

16
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:42,004
You should have nagged me

17
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:45,444
hundreds and thousands of times,

18
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:50,254
saying I need to look into

19
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:55,384
where and how my only sister is doing as her family!

20
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,844
That is why...

21
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:14,884
I should be the one to die.

22
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,274
Why would you die?

23
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:33,860
I missed her.

24
00:03:35,544 --> 00:03:38,784
I could not see her face properly...

25
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:45,794
because the p-prison was too dark.

26
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:52,904
I could not see at all how my Eun Su grew up...

27
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:58,334
and what kind of an adult she became, Hyeong.

28
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:03,894
But you saw, right, Hyeong?

29
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:06,504
Of course, I saw.

30
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:09,864
I looked and looked

31
00:04:09,864 --> 00:04:13,044
until I could not look anymore.

32
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,834
She was pretty like a flower,

33
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:19,144
bright like a star,

34
00:04:19,144 --> 00:04:22,034
and her smile was...

35
00:04:23,174 --> 00:04:25,814
really beautiful.

36
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:29,684
- She smiled? 
- Han Su.

37
00:04:30,674 --> 00:04:35,704
When she smiled, our Eun Su

38
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:40,894
looked just like when she was young.

39
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:51,084
I will be able to see her once I drop dead.

40
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:59,094
Seriously...

41
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:02,764
things just had to be so twisted.

42
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:23,914
 Young Master, you are different from Minister Yu.

43
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:29,274
 Your goals and your path...

44
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:14,314
Princess.

45
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:19,154
The date has been set.

46
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:27,454
Will you... marry me?

47
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:41,174
If the marriage is only to weaken my father's power,

48
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:43,794
it does not serve any meaningful purpose now, does it?

49
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:47,244
I already put down my position and in the future as well—

50
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:49,654
I need a stage.

51
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:57,884
Our wedding will be a public hearing where Minister Yu gets interrogated for his sins.

52
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:03,704
All of Minister Yu's ill deeds, corruption, and illegal acts will be brought to light.

53
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:11,534
A wedding where lots of people gather is the perfect stage.

54
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:14,474
Will you be okay...

55
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:18,994
if I use you to the very end?

56
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:21,614
No.

57
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:27,824
You are not using me, Princess.

58
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:32,064
I am going to use you from now on.

59
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:39,944
Because I want revenge.

60
00:07:50,514 --> 00:07:57,024
 Episode 15: A Wedding Vow

61
00:07:57,714 --> 00:08:01,344
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

62
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:06,014
There have been many scandalous happenings within and outside the palace,

63
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:11,764
so I am elated to deliver such good news to you all.

64
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:17,874
It is all thanks to your grace, Grand Queen Dowager.

65
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:21,140
 Congratulations, Your Highness!

66
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:29,074
This wedding is specially planned to take place at an inn in Mapo so that all of our people can watch.

67
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,694
I will order Internal Affairs to

68
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:34,804
prepare it perfectly and completely according to royal conduct,

69
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:37,724
so please do not worry.

70
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:42,704
I wish for all of you to attend and congratulate them.

71
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:46,654
 Thank you for your grace.

72
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:11,814
Young Master Ji Seon will be marrying the princess.

73
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:16,314
Thank you. Thank you!

74
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:18,084
Congratulations.

75
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:21,214
Do not forget that this is all Minister Yu's grace and mercy!

76
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:23,154
Aigoo, no doubt about that.

77
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:26,404
He gives out so much whenever there is a happy occasion for his son.

78
00:09:26,404 --> 00:09:28,194
So we can only be thankful.

79
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:30,800
Here comes Minister Yu!

80
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:34,850
 All hail Minister Yu!

81
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,304
 All hail Minister Yu!

82
00:09:37,304 --> 00:09:40,060
 All hail Minister Yu!

83
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,950
 All hail Minister Yu!

84
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:45,650
 All hail Minister Yu!

85
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,480
 All hail Minister Yu!

86
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:51,050
 All hail Minister Yu!

87
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,654
 All hail Minister Yu!

88
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:56,060
 All hail Minister Yu!

89
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,430
 All hail Minister Yu!

90
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,090
 All hail Minister Yu!

91
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,580
 All hail Minister Yu!

92
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,994
How was your trip, Father?

93
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:10,850
 All hail Minister Yu!

94
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,530
 All hail Minister Yu!

95
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:16,410
 All hail Minister Yu!

96
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,830
 All hail Minister Yu!

97
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:21,744
 All hail Minister Yu!

98
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:39,904
Will Minister Yu willingly accept the marriage?

99
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:43,074
He has no apparent cause to oppose it.

100
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:46,754
But we do not know what he may be scheming behind our backs.

101
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,660
 Marriage Proposal

102
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:16,070
There is no doubt you are the best calligrapher of them all, without question.

103
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,550
 25th of December

104
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:31,094
I am aware it is not what you want,

105
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:35,474
but I truly love Princess.

106
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:39,924
There is nothing wrong with having feelings of love for her.

107
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:43,424
I am just doing my job as your father.

108
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:35,794
Look here, Mr. Gourd.

109
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:38,384
Do you have a family?

110
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:42,204
Let us orphans have a shot together.

111
00:12:42,204 --> 00:12:45,914
Where is your mouth— Is it here?

112
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:51,834
I hate gourds because I once almost died because of a gourd,

113
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:54,684
but I have taken a liking to you.

114
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:22,294
It was as you said, Your Excellency.

115
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:25,394
- Bring him here.
 - Yes.

116
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,520
 Advance Payment Welcome

117
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:54,174
Hide one there and...

118
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:58,684
Wait a second. Where should I hide this?

119
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:04,634
Yes, I am sure he will never be able to find it here.

 Petition to the King by Kang Eon Jik

121
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,960
 Advance Payment Welcome

122
00:14:46,604 --> 00:14:48,534
Hey!

123
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:52,674
What is this? Huh?

124
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:54,794
You little—

125
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,384
Just take a look. It looks like a letter.

126
00:14:57,384 --> 00:14:59,324
- Gosh, I do not care. 
 - Just take a look—

127
00:14:59,324 --> 00:15:00,514
I do not care!

128
00:15:00,514 --> 00:15:02,254
Seriously!

129
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,774
Are you really going to keep this up?

130
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:07,944
Why did you come back if you were going to be like this?

131
00:15:07,944 --> 00:15:09,764
Did you come back to stress me to death?

132
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:11,394
How long are you going to keep this up?

133
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:14,514
I am going to stop! I will stop!

134
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:18,504
I will stop when I drop dead! When I die.

135
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:22,854
All right. Sure, here you go. Drink up.

136
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:26,164
There, drink it all. There you go.

137
00:15:26,164 --> 00:15:27,774
All right, go ahead.

138
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:30,194
Would that be enough to kill you today?

139
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:34,684
There. Drink these, too. All the way.

140
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:08,654
Just what the heck is alcohol to him?

141
00:16:36,624 --> 00:16:38,754
Dong Chi.

142
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:43,820
Gosh, Dong Chi.

143
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:47,520
Aigoo, Hyeongnim!

144
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:28,710
 I will meet you at Wishes Inn

145
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:38,614
Dong Chi!

146
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:41,524
Dong Chi!

147
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,124
Yes, Hyeongnim.

148
00:17:46,124 --> 00:17:48,034
You are here.

149
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:51,854
Why you little...

150
00:17:55,344 --> 00:17:57,134
- Wh-Whoa— 
- What happened?

151
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:59,094
I asked you what happened!

152
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:01,074
Y-You are killing me.

153
00:18:01,074 --> 00:18:04,404
Han Su, calm down, okay?

154
00:18:06,134 --> 00:18:08,474
If I lose you, too, Hyeong...

155
00:18:09,374 --> 00:18:13,104
What am I going to do if you disappear, too?

156
00:18:19,294 --> 00:18:21,164
Sir!

157
00:18:55,254 --> 00:18:59,644
♫  I'll always be with you  ♫

158
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:06,674
♫  On the day we held hands  ♫

159
00:19:09,294 --> 00:19:13,984
♫  I always remember  ♫

160
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:20,964
♫  The moment I first saw you  ♫

161
00:19:20,964 --> 00:19:25,944
Everyone, please bring the stuff piled up in the backyard.

162
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:27,064
 Y-Yes.

163
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:34,670
♫  I knew  ♫ 
♫  That our time exists in the same space  ♫

164
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:41,540
I told him this was the only way to wake you up.

165
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,620
♫  Even if it hurts like crazy  ♫

166
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:47,340
It was all my idea.

167
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:53,604
♫  Stay by your side  ♫ 
♫  Even if the cold wind blows  ♫

168
00:19:53,604 --> 00:19:59,444
I missed you.

169
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:02,000
And I was worried.

170
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:12,534
♫  Can't you come one step closer to me?  ♫

171
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:15,884
♫  I'm waiting for you here  ♫

172
00:20:15,884 --> 00:20:18,004
About Eun Su...

173
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:21,294
So Won...

174
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:27,070
let us not talk about that.

175
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:41,064
How long do you plan to turn a blind eye?

176
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:03,974
Why on Earth... Why did you do it? Why?

177
00:21:05,804 --> 00:21:07,744
Hit me more.

178
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:14,074
I am sure it will not be enough to calm your anger...

179
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:18,044
or bring Eun Su back to us...

180
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:26,614
but it will help me to live on.

181
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:34,814
I am sorry, Kang Han Su.

182
00:21:34,814 --> 00:21:37,784
Although it is shameless of me to apologize to you...

183
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:41,754
I am sorry.

184
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:48,314
Eun Su was also...

185
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:53,924
a precious and dear person to me.

186
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:49,214
A-Aigoo, where are you headed?

187
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:51,154
I have mountains of work to do.

188
00:22:51,154 --> 00:22:53,594
We left the palace using marriage as an excuse.

189
00:22:53,594 --> 00:22:58,744
I should report something to prevent the Grand Queen Dowager from becoming suspicious.

190
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:02,074
Wait! So what?

191
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:04,614
What do you mean by that?

192
00:23:04,614 --> 00:23:08,764
I need to go to the market to buy chestnuts, dates, and blue and red strings

193
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,584
to put on the table of the bride and groom.

194
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:14,634
Hey, w-wait a second.

195
00:23:15,264 --> 00:23:16,984
In that case...

196
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:24,524
you will need someone to carry stuff, right?

197
00:23:28,604 --> 00:23:32,074
All right, then. I will take that as a yes.

198
00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:35,174
Now, let us go.

199
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:48,464
Oh, how have you been?

200
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:52,624
You are here, Innkeeper Hong?

201
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:03,354
Your business is doing well these days, right?

202
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:07,514
- Innkeeper Hong, come over here. 
- Aigoo— Hey, wait—

203
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:12,304
So my dear Innkeeper Hong can go anywhere and

204
00:24:12,304 --> 00:24:15,114
overcome any walls and...

205
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,724
What was it again?

206
00:24:18,564 --> 00:24:22,644
Aigoo, excuse me. I-I will come again next time.

207
00:24:27,124 --> 00:24:29,654
All right. Ta-da.

208
00:24:29,654 --> 00:24:32,754
Here. Honk, honk!

209
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:38,554
Aigoo, they are pretty.

210
00:24:38,554 --> 00:24:42,004
- How much are they? 
- That would be three nyang.

211
00:24:47,684 --> 00:24:50,784
- Here you go. 
- Thank you.

212
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:54,874
I am touched.

213
00:24:54,874 --> 00:24:56,944
They are yours.

214
00:25:01,444 --> 00:25:03,464
She is my woman.

215
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:16,554
 Kang Eun Su Memorial Tablet

216
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:27,654
 I will protect you.

217
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:33,504
 I will ensure you can live an ordinary and happy life like others, in a safe place.

218
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:35,794
 I will do that for you.

219
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:56,514
 Kang Eon Jik Memorial Tablet 
 Lady Lee Memorial Tablet

220
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,464
 Kang Eun Su Memorial Tablet

221
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,664
Eun Su knew it before she left.

222
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:10,494
Knew what?

223
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,804
That I am deeply in love with you.

224
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:22,284
Therefore, I am sure she was assured as she passed.

225
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:29,540
 Kang Eun Su Memorial Tablet

226
00:27:37,894 --> 00:27:40,754
Mother and Father, you can see, right?

227
00:27:40,754 --> 00:27:43,444
Eun Su, you can see, right?

228
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:45,564
What is this?

229
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,824
Just stay still.

230
00:27:50,354 --> 00:27:54,294
There. I am going to hold onto Kang Han Su's hand tightly like this

231
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:57,724
and will be by his side until death.

232
00:27:57,724 --> 00:28:02,834
So do not worry about a thing and rest in peace.

233
00:28:57,124 --> 00:29:00,374
Thank you. All right, please help yourselves.

234
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:03,914
Have some cinnamon punch with pine nuts.

235
00:29:03,914 --> 00:29:06,274
Three nuts for each.

236
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:23,684
Let me come with you!

237
00:29:28,094 --> 00:29:32,074
So what are you two planning to do?

238
00:29:44,234 --> 00:29:46,864
I have been investigating the case of Minister Chu in secret.

239
00:29:46,864 --> 00:29:51,844
If you just testify and say you saw Minister Yu killing Minister Chu at the wedding,

240
00:29:51,844 --> 00:29:54,324
I will not punish you for framing Kang Han Su.

241
00:29:54,324 --> 00:29:56,794
We need your help.

242
00:29:57,974 --> 00:30:00,834
Since the King and all of his royal subjects will have gathered,

243
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:04,094
what better public hearing place can we ask for?

244
00:30:10,554 --> 00:30:14,664
I will think about it if Kang Han Su asks me.

245
00:30:14,664 --> 00:30:18,654
I have quite a debt to repay to him.

246
00:30:23,854 --> 00:30:26,834
Grand Merchant Jo was being clever, knowing how I went into hiding.

247
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:30,274
Looks like he used me as an excuse to get out of this.

248
00:30:30,274 --> 00:30:33,354
Just in case, Chu Sal is watching Grand Merchant Jo.

249
00:30:33,354 --> 00:30:35,624
If something happens, we will be notified right away.

250
00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:39,894
I will know if he is sincere or not once I meet him in person.

251
00:30:41,024 --> 00:30:46,794
By the way, the two of you have got a lot of guts.

252
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:52,044
Planning to expose your father or father-in-law's ill deeds on the day of your wedding...

253
00:30:52,744 --> 00:30:57,484
People might even call you immoral. Are you not afraid?

254
00:30:57,484 --> 00:30:59,514
Also, our So—

255
00:31:00,214 --> 00:31:01,724
Prin—

256
00:31:04,014 --> 00:31:05,684
Princess So...

257
00:31:05,684 --> 00:31:11,734
Well, the royal family's dignity and authority, both of which she cherishes, will be tarnished.

258
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:13,854
Do not worry about the royal family.

259
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:17,374
We need to weaken Minister Yu's power, which neither the king nor the grand queen dowager

260
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:19,534
were able to deal with,

261
00:31:19,534 --> 00:31:23,934
even if it means holding a funeral instead of a wedding ceremony.

262
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:28,994
I need to be prepared for that much.

263
00:31:35,964 --> 00:31:38,514
As Princess is making a decision for the royal family,

264
00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:43,144
I am also making a decision for my family.

265
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:49,404
Making Father stop so he will not commit any more sins

266
00:31:50,104 --> 00:31:52,734
is the best I can do.

267
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:57,324
Well...

268
00:31:58,314 --> 00:32:02,534
if we have this much support, we will succeed this time.

269
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,504
So Won, it will be better for you to enter the palace in advance.

270
00:32:14,504 --> 00:32:17,574
If you are away for too long, people will start getting suspicious.

271
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:19,604
You said you would meet Grand Merchant Jo, though.

272
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,144
We will be fine by ourselves.

273
00:32:21,144 --> 00:32:23,454
- I will come with you. 
- No.

274
00:32:23,454 --> 00:32:27,194
That will only cause Minister Yu to find out.

275
00:32:28,394 --> 00:32:30,244
Let us go.

276
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:20,634
Be safe.

277
00:33:25,014 --> 00:33:27,314
Wait for me.

278
00:33:32,194 --> 00:33:33,754
What in the world?

279
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:40,614
What in the world just happened here?

280
00:33:44,624 --> 00:33:46,494
Die!

281
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:53,084
Hey, hey, hey!

282
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:02,884
Hey, hey!

283
00:34:04,194 --> 00:34:05,894
You!

284
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:12,084
- What is going on?
 - Where is Merchant Jo?

285
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:14,534
I have no idea what is going on!

286
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:19,264
Some men just barged in and took away Grand Merchant Jo.

287
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,804
What?

288
00:35:14,394 --> 00:35:16,334
H-Help me...

289
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:19,604
Help me! Is anyone out there!

290
00:35:19,604 --> 00:35:22,754
There is a man here!

291
00:35:50,964 --> 00:35:53,334
There is something over there!

292
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,554
Grand Merchant, Sir!

293
00:36:05,344 --> 00:36:06,944
Chu Sal...

294
00:36:06,944 --> 00:36:09,444
Don't come too close.

295
00:36:09,444 --> 00:36:11,554
Chu Sal!

296
00:36:17,454 --> 00:36:19,664
Watch out!

297
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:37,614
Dong Chi!

298
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:41,534
Hey!

299
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:43,034
Hey! Hey, hey, Dong Chi!

300
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,874
Dong Chi! Hey, hey!

301
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:46,914
Hey, hey! Get up!

302
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:49,074
Wake up!

303
00:36:53,204 --> 00:36:56,184
- Dong Chi, wake up! Wake up! 
- Hyeongnim...

304
00:36:56,184 --> 00:36:58,234
Hyeongnim.

305
00:37:00,024 --> 00:37:01,924
No!

306
00:37:14,094 --> 00:37:17,114
I'll have to shorten the sleeve.

307
00:37:17,114 --> 00:37:19,864
It's okay. Do not waste your energy on something unnecessary.

308
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:21,564
What do you mean unnecessary?

309
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:24,094
It is your once-in-a-lifetime wedding.

310
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:26,104
Later.

311
00:37:27,764 --> 00:37:30,714
 - Princess.  
- Come in.

312
00:37:35,894 --> 00:37:38,404
Minister Yu is here to see you.

313
00:37:38,404 --> 00:37:40,224
What did you say?

314
00:38:07,364 --> 00:38:10,534
Do you want to save him?

315
00:38:39,124 --> 00:38:40,944
Sir!

316
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,464
Yes?

317
00:38:55,414 --> 00:38:57,144
What is going on?

318
00:38:57,144 --> 00:39:00,224
I thought I would never see you again.

319
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:14,454
What has happened?

320
00:39:21,174 --> 00:39:22,874
Well...

321
00:39:22,874 --> 00:39:24,824
Watch out!

322
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:26,824
No!

323
00:39:40,984 --> 00:39:42,794
Are you all right?

324
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:46,214
Well, for now. Dong Chi, run, run!

325
00:40:07,064 --> 00:40:08,434
Wait!

326
00:40:08,434 --> 00:40:10,964
Wait a minute!

327
00:40:10,964 --> 00:40:12,434
Wait.

328
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:15,104
This is exhausting! I'm dying here!

329
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,744
I can't do it! I'm dying!

330
00:40:17,744 --> 00:40:21,394
I can't go on. Too tired.

331
00:40:21,394 --> 00:40:23,434
I'm dying.

332
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,764
This is nuts!

333
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:33,934
Who are you?

334
00:40:35,354 --> 00:40:38,754
You do not expect them to answer you, do you?

335
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:44,684
Did you just speak down to me?

336
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:49,064
Our heads are about to roll. Who cares about speaking down to you, huh?

337
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:53,734
What the hell are you two doing?

338
00:40:56,614 --> 00:40:58,484
Now!

339
00:41:09,144 --> 00:41:10,764
Get them!

340
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,464
Let us go.

341
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:36,174
They're gone...

342
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:38,694
They're all gone. Gone...

343
00:41:44,174 --> 00:41:45,714
Let's go!

344
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:47,114
To where?

345
00:41:47,114 --> 00:41:49,324
To rescue Yu Ji Seon.

346
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:52,394
Hurry and come!

347
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:12,324
Geez, I almost peed in my pants.

348
00:42:13,294 --> 00:42:16,534
Mayor Yu! Mayor Yu!

349
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,604
Are you all right?

350
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:41,274
Hyeongnim! Hyeong—

351
00:42:41,274 --> 00:42:43,284
Mayor Yu!

352
00:42:47,444 --> 00:42:49,394
I am okay.

353
00:42:49,394 --> 00:42:51,144
What do you mean?

354
00:42:51,144 --> 00:42:54,624
The poison has spread a lot. Let us go to the pharmacy first.

355
00:42:58,694 --> 00:43:00,874
This works out.

356
00:43:00,874 --> 00:43:02,854
Just use me.

357
00:43:02,854 --> 00:43:05,224
In whatever way works for you.

358
00:43:15,904 --> 00:43:18,084
It is an antidote.

359
00:43:19,404 --> 00:43:21,454
Is it really? How did you get this?

360
00:43:21,454 --> 00:43:24,904
Minister Yu had come to see me.

361
00:43:24,904 --> 00:43:27,374
I think he tried to lure me away

362
00:43:27,374 --> 00:43:30,844
saying you got hurt so I'd miss the wedding.

363
00:43:39,904 --> 00:43:41,784
No!

364
00:43:43,234 --> 00:43:44,854
Stay back.

365
00:44:02,624 --> 00:44:05,044
What do we do now?

366
00:44:05,044 --> 00:44:08,244
He said to use him, so be it.

367
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:13,714
- Dong Chi! 
  - Yes, coming!

368
00:44:21,614 --> 00:44:25,834
It is the letter that my father had sent to the late King.

369
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:28,284
The one that was stolen from you.

370
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:34,954
It is the last gift that our Eun Su had left behind for us.

371
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:45,244
 I, Kang Eon Jik...

372
00:44:45,244 --> 00:44:48,434
 write this letter to you, Your Majesty.

373
00:44:49,184 --> 00:44:53,154
 There are people who seem to live above the law.

374
00:44:53,154 --> 00:44:59,174
 They are the ministers of the Hungu Party who lead Joseon at the moment.

375
00:44:59,174 --> 00:45:07,614
 Please turn over a new leaf and end the politics of strife and polarization.

376
00:45:09,344 --> 00:45:11,824
So this is what the letter said.

377
00:45:19,824 --> 00:45:23,344
Would we be able to bring down Minister Yu with this?

378
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:25,614
Probably so.

379
00:45:25,614 --> 00:45:28,704
Did you not notice anything special?

380
00:45:28,704 --> 00:45:30,154
Anything special?

381
00:45:30,154 --> 00:45:31,744
Yeah.

382
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:40,080
 Petition to the King by Kang Eon Jik

383
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:46,490
 Petition to the King by Kang Eon Jik

384
00:45:49,254 --> 00:45:51,214
You got it.

385
00:45:55,074 --> 00:46:00,194
I intend to... use that element.

386
00:46:16,594 --> 00:46:18,844
Wh-Who is there?

387
00:46:45,294 --> 00:46:49,684
 Princess Yeon Ju found out about Legal Officer Kang's incident.

388
00:46:53,334 --> 00:46:58,324
 I trust that all of you will work with me once again.

389
00:47:55,724 --> 00:47:57,384
He is getting dressed.

390
00:47:57,384 --> 00:48:00,774
I will bring him with me on time.

391
00:48:42,434 --> 00:48:46,800
 Wishes Inn

392
00:49:09,244 --> 00:49:12,074
Gosh, I am looking forward to this.

393
00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:25,324
By chance, did you receive the letter?

394
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,074
I received it, too.

395
00:49:29,074 --> 00:49:32,124
I have no idea what he is thinking!

396
00:49:59,774 --> 00:50:02,444
How many times have we heard this same music?

397
00:50:02,444 --> 00:50:04,564
I know, right?

398
00:50:04,564 --> 00:50:08,204
They should have started the ceremony already.

399
00:50:31,214 --> 00:50:33,534
I could see how the bride could be delayed.

400
00:50:33,534 --> 00:50:36,804
But even the groom is nowhere to be found.

401
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,430
 Wedding Program

402
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:53,594
Minister Yu.

403
00:50:53,594 --> 00:50:58,154
I'm sorry, but as for me...

404
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:01,904
Princess Yeon Ju enters!

405
00:52:04,174 --> 00:52:06,464
P-Princess!

406
00:52:06,464 --> 00:52:08,594
Princess!

407
00:52:08,594 --> 00:52:11,134
My gosh! Princess!

408
00:52:11,134 --> 00:52:12,974
Sister!

409
00:52:12,974 --> 00:52:16,384
Princess! Princess!

410
00:52:26,694 --> 00:52:28,904
The physician has arrived.

411
00:52:29,844 --> 00:52:31,974
Let him in, and do not let anyone else in or out.

412
00:52:31,974 --> 00:52:34,434
Princess needs to rest right now.

413
00:52:34,434 --> 00:52:35,774
Yes.

414
00:52:35,774 --> 00:52:37,714
Please enter.

415
00:53:15,814 --> 00:53:18,674
P-Please...

416
00:53:21,944 --> 00:53:24,634
put me to death!

417
00:53:28,364 --> 00:53:34,554
Princess has been poisoned and is unconscious right now!

418
00:53:34,554 --> 00:53:36,504
What?

419
00:53:39,594 --> 00:53:43,504
Your Majesty, Grand Queen Dowager,

420
00:53:43,504 --> 00:53:49,004
the culprit who tried to harm Princess is here in this place.

421
00:53:49,004 --> 00:53:55,744
Please capture him and find out the truth and punish him harshly!

422
00:54:02,084 --> 00:54:03,704
What in the world are you talking about?

423
00:54:03,704 --> 00:54:06,174
The culprit is here?

424
00:54:31,374 --> 00:54:34,874
 Please spare us, Your Majesty!

425
00:54:39,544 --> 00:54:42,584
We do not know anything about this!

426
00:54:42,584 --> 00:54:45,374
Yes! We did not do this!

427
00:54:45,374 --> 00:54:47,714
What do you mean you did not do this?

428
00:54:48,504 --> 00:54:51,174
Then are you saying you know who has done this?

429
00:54:56,564 --> 00:54:58,804
Speak up and tell the truth!

430
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:02,254
Who are you saying the culprit is?

431
00:55:36,754 --> 00:55:41,074
 Princess Yeon Ju found out about Legal Officer Kang's incident.

432
00:55:41,864 --> 00:55:46,774
 I trust that all of you will work with me once again.

433
00:56:10,014 --> 00:56:15,084
The culprit is... Minister Yu!

434
00:56:44,344 --> 00:56:47,494
The stage does not change. It is just that...

435
00:56:49,464 --> 00:56:53,694
the charge against Minister Yu will change.

436
00:56:53,694 --> 00:56:57,914
Minister Yu and the other ministers present agreed upon

437
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,184
and tried to assassinate the princess.

438
00:57:07,614 --> 00:57:09,474
Is that true?

439
00:57:09,474 --> 00:57:12,634
It is true that we did receive such a letter.

440
00:57:12,634 --> 00:57:15,204
However, I did not agree to it!

441
00:57:15,204 --> 00:57:18,694
It is the same with me, Sire!

442
00:57:41,604 --> 00:57:46,514
What is the reason Minister Yu sent this letter to you?

443
00:57:46,514 --> 00:57:50,024
W-Well...

444
00:57:54,114 --> 00:57:56,264
More than a decade ago,

445
00:57:57,134 --> 00:58:02,124
we were involved in a conspiracy to eliminate Legal Officer Kang, and we took out articles

446
00:58:02,124 --> 00:58:07,324
that were disadvantageous to Minister Yu and us while publishing the Book of Laws.

447
00:58:07,324 --> 00:58:10,854
And as the late King passed away right around that time,

448
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:15,654
he even spoke of treason and placed the blame on us.

449
00:58:15,654 --> 00:58:22,064
Yes! Ever since that day, we have had no choice but to follow Minister Yu's orders!

450
00:58:22,064 --> 00:58:24,814
All of that is nonsense, Your Majesty.

451
00:58:24,814 --> 00:58:26,704
No!

452
00:58:29,414 --> 00:58:31,734
It is all true.

453
00:58:34,264 --> 00:58:38,714
I submit the letter that my father, who served as a legal officer at the time

454
00:58:38,714 --> 00:58:41,724
sent to the late King as evidence of that claim.

455
00:58:53,854 --> 00:58:55,854
Please take a look at the end of that letter.

456
00:58:55,854 --> 00:58:57,730
Minister Yu wrote the official judgment.

457
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:01,350
 Petition to the King by Kang Eon Jik

458
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:03,730
 To eliminate the despair

459
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:06,224
Yi-jeol-hwa-geun?

460
00:59:07,164 --> 00:59:09,634
It means to eliminate the source of trouble.

461
00:59:09,634 --> 00:59:11,444
Yes.

462
00:59:11,444 --> 00:59:14,784
My father wanted to prohibit special favors for personnel appointments

463
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:17,594
and limit the special benefits received by vassals of merit, among other things.

464
00:59:17,594 --> 00:59:21,494
He wanted to enact policies that were disliked by the Hungu Party.

465
00:59:21,494 --> 00:59:26,434
When Minister Yu found out about this, he framed my father

466
00:59:26,434 --> 00:59:29,284
and caused his death.

467
00:59:30,784 --> 00:59:33,894
Other than the people who are present here, people like Park Je Su, Chu Yeong Wu,

468
00:59:33,894 --> 00:59:36,874
and Im Sang Ho carried out the actions according to his orders.

469
00:59:36,874 --> 00:59:38,944
This is how...

470
00:59:39,904 --> 00:59:45,364
Minister Yu has been eliminating people who have gone against his will.

471
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:48,804
This is entrapment, Your Majesty!

472
00:59:48,804 --> 00:59:51,924
If what he is saying is true,

473
00:59:51,924 --> 00:59:59,594
there is another person who is not so innocent in this place!

474
01:00:02,714 --> 01:00:06,024
The last name that is written in that letter!

475
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,130
 Si Jing...

476
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:15,144
That is Grand Queen Dowager's name that she used as a child in her parent's home!

477
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:19,594
Will you continue to go on with this kind of ridiculous interrogation

478
01:00:19,594 --> 01:00:23,190
solely believing in what that man says without solid evidence?

479
01:00:52,604 --> 01:00:55,214
Everything he says is true.

480
01:00:56,134 --> 01:00:58,074
Royal Grandmother!

481
01:01:05,984 --> 01:01:08,054
Minister Yu...

482
01:01:08,764 --> 01:01:14,604
showed me Legal Officer Kang's letter and suggested that we eliminate him.

483
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:17,084
I agreed to it as well.

484
01:01:18,874 --> 01:01:20,784
At the time,

485
01:01:21,824 --> 01:01:29,214
I believed that doing so was for the survival of the royal family and the peace of the royal court.

486
01:01:29,214 --> 01:01:34,024
I had to stop another bloodbath in the royal court!

487
01:01:37,064 --> 01:01:43,144
But yet again, you dare harm Princess in this way?

488
01:01:43,854 --> 01:01:46,394
How dare you try to harm my granddaughter!

489
01:01:46,394 --> 01:01:52,314
Grand Queen Dowager, this is Kang Han Su's trap!

490
01:01:56,184 --> 01:02:00,074
Then how would you explain that the judgment portion of this letter was written in your handwriting?

491
01:02:00,074 --> 01:02:04,254
Just because it is the same handwriting, it does not guarantee that I wrote it!

492
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:07,244
If it were not you, Minister Yu...

493
01:02:10,544 --> 01:02:14,084
then it is Mayor Yu.

494
01:02:17,654 --> 01:02:19,764
Mayor Yu Ji Seon?

495
01:02:24,014 --> 01:02:25,954
Yes.

496
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:30,114
I have read several hundred verdicts written by Mayor Yu.

497
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:32,674
When you write in Haeseo style, you use the method that is called Jangbong

498
01:02:32,674 --> 01:02:35,624
where you hide the tip of the brush inward to create the brushstrokes.

499
01:02:35,624 --> 01:02:37,464
However, Mayor Yu uses the calligraphic method called Nobong

500
01:02:37,464 --> 01:02:40,014
which allows the brushstroke to show outward

501
01:02:40,014 --> 01:02:45,294
and the trace of the tip of the brush remains on the paper.

502
01:02:47,744 --> 01:02:49,464
Then...

503
01:02:50,364 --> 01:02:53,324
are you saying the father and the son share the same handwriting?

504
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:04,200
 February 7

505
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:11,760
 February 7

506
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,830
 The princess was aware...

507
01:03:24,494 --> 01:03:26,634
That is so, Your Majesty.

508
01:03:39,924 --> 01:03:42,294
Then it must be either Minister Yu or

509
01:03:43,204 --> 01:03:46,234
Yu Ji Seon, who wrote this letter.

510
01:03:47,834 --> 01:03:56,094
How dare you use my son to entrap me?

511
01:04:06,934 --> 01:04:10,144
It is your specialty.

512
01:04:11,374 --> 01:04:14,154
So what will you do?

513
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:18,874
Will you confess your crime and obey,

514
01:04:18,874 --> 01:04:22,884
or will you place all the blame on your son?

515
01:04:22,884 --> 01:04:25,624
How dare you!

516
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:21,660

517
01:05:23,024 --> 01:05:25,650
♫  Run away  ♫

518
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:28,664
♫  Run away  ♫

519
01:05:28,664 --> 01:05:31,700
♫  We got the liar  ♫

520
01:05:34,454 --> 01:05:37,054
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

521
01:05:37,054 --> 01:05:41,704
 We cannot fool Minister Yu by acting.

522
01:05:42,354 --> 01:05:48,094
 Someone must risk the danger.

523
01:05:48,094 --> 01:05:50,624
 You are wrong, Father.

524
01:05:50,624 --> 01:05:56,554
 That is why I did what I could do.

525
01:05:57,204 --> 01:06:03,124
 Please let me determine the punishment for Minister Yu.

526
01:06:04,334 --> 01:06:07,334
 Please make your decision, King!

527
01:06:09,634 --> 01:06:11,884
 Hear ye!

528
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:14,670
 Capture Minister Yu!

529
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:18,789
♫  Run Away  ♫
