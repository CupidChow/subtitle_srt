00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:34,844
 The characters, events, and era of this drama are unrelated to historical facts and are fictitious.

2
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:37,364
Jeong Wol!

3
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:39,784
Come here...

4
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:42,360
Come...

5
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:45,824
Gosh, scared me!

6
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:54,044
Sir!

7
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:55,504
We are in trouble!

8
00:00:55,504 --> 00:00:57,584
- What? 
 - We are in trouble!

9
00:00:57,584 --> 00:01:00,164
Outside... We have a big problem!

10
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:03,564
Geez, damn it...

11
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,990
 Serene Tower

12
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:10,004
Did you kill a person?

13
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:14,164
So you are here to be punished?

14
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:18,444
Yes. Before that, I have a request to make.

15
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:22,444
You dare make a request when you have killed someone?

16
00:01:23,144 --> 00:01:25,824
Please oblige.

17
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:30,004
Aigoo, what brings you all the way here, Court Lady Hong?

18
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:31,844
You are saying you are happy to see me, right?

19
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:34,564
Yes, yes! Of course!

20
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:38,864
You had served the late king at one point, and you have come all the way here.

21
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:41,264
This is an honor for our family!

22
00:01:41,264 --> 00:01:48,164
Then for my sake, please listen to what this woman has to say.

23
00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:50,414
Pardon?

24
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:52,114
W-Well, as for that...

25
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:54,114
You must hear her out.

26
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,474
Come now! Who do you think you are?

27
00:01:57,474 --> 00:02:02,154
I am So Won, an assistant to the attorney who will take this woman's lawsuit.

28
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:03,774
A-An attorney?

29
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:06,124
She is my subordinate.

30
00:02:06,124 --> 00:02:11,174
Princess values her greatly.

31
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:13,774
Oh, I see.

32
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:22,694
 If you wish to find out even now,

33
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:25,504
 you should leave without fighting me.

34
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,094
 Did you know about everything?

35
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:34,244
 Then... I will tell you everything.

36
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:42,590

37
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:50,074
Hyeongnim!

38
00:02:50,074 --> 00:02:52,694
Did that old man figure it all out?

39
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:53,744
Let's just go for now.

40
00:02:53,744 --> 00:02:57,714
Sir! Dong Chi! We're here!

41
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:00,904
She turned herself in and went to the crime scene right away.

42
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:05,174
They said they would check the old lady's body and start the investigation first thing in the morning

43
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:09,584
I do not want to be on the run!

44
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:15,344
I cannot let my child live in hiding for life just because of me.

45
00:03:24,644 --> 00:03:27,054
Please save me, Attorney Sir!

46
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:29,574
Please help my baby and me.

47
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:32,404
I beg you desperately!

48
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:23,454
Do not kneel like this again in the future.

49
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:25,844
You are not a criminal.

50
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:28,724
Just trust me from now on.

51
00:04:28,724 --> 00:04:31,604
I will make sure to save your life.

52
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:53,790
 Are you saying you will pursue this?

53
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,474
 I do not want to become someone who is just like you, Foreman.

54
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:11,174
 Episode 6: Brutal History of Cheongsan, Vol. 2

55
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:16,064
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

56
00:05:23,794 --> 00:05:26,374
Geez, my back!

57
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:31,220
You are crazy!

58
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:34,484
Are you not even curious as to what Foreman knows?

59
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:39,094
To put it bluntly, we do not even know if we can save the new bride or not!

60
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:40,694
That's right.

61
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:43,304
I am crazy. I mean...

62
00:05:43,304 --> 00:05:47,964
I must be crazy to be doing something like this that is punishable by beheading.

63
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:49,924
B-B-Beheading?

64
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:51,744
Don't you dare think of running away.

65
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:54,424
If I get caught, I will put it all on you.

66
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:56,564
Wh-Wh-What?

67
00:05:56,564 --> 00:06:00,144
Look. You dug up more dirt than I did.

68
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:06,214
Kang Han Su!

69
00:06:06,214 --> 00:06:08,104
I will bury you!

70
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:11,284
What? Wait, wait, wait!

71
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:12,864
- You! 
 - Wait! Wait a minute!

72
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:15,124
Hey, hey...

73
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,834
Look!

74
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:23,764
Dig it up! Hurry!

75
00:06:23,764 --> 00:06:25,954
The cause of death for Seo Chang Su was battery.

76
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,950
The fatal blow was to his chest.

77
00:06:30,794 --> 00:06:34,224
There is are sunken areas on his left shin and the top of his foot.

78
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:38,374
There are swollen areas on his knee joint and left ankle.

79
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:41,204
But these are not lethal blows.

80
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:50,804
There is a reddish-black wound that is about 10cm long on his solar plexus.

81
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:54,764
This is probably what killed him.

82
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:00,984
It is exactly as the new bride said.

83
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:04,084
Well, did you think she had lied to us or something?

84
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:08,204
If she had, we would have had a reason to turn down her representation.

85
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:12,564
Of course. You acted like you were all that by yourself.

86
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:16,094
In the end, you are having second thoughts about Foreman's suggestion.

87
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:19,264
So if this autopsy result turned out differently than her testimony,

88
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,714
you were going to use that as an excuse to deny the lawsuit.

89
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:24,884
It is half and half.

90
00:07:24,884 --> 00:07:26,624
Anyway, write it all down and keep a record.

91
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:28,834
This is most crucial when we catch the real culprit.

92
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:32,134
Why did we dig the corpse for evidence when it is of no use?

93
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:34,974
Wh-Wh-Where are you going?

94
00:07:34,974 --> 00:07:38,844
We have to bury him again! Do you want me to do this alone?

95
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:41,504
Damn you!

96
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:47,424
Geez, the stench.

97
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:50,784
All right. Aigoo.

98
00:07:51,884 --> 00:07:55,004
Who's going to Hanyang?

99
00:07:56,014 --> 00:07:59,464
I'll take the fastest walker.

100
00:08:01,224 --> 00:08:02,744
What?

101
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,190
What did I do?

102
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:16,694
Sir! Sir!

103
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:18,664
Stop right there!

104
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,784
- Get him! 
 - Stop right there!

105
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:22,794
Stop!

106
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:41,464
 Do not enter

107
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:43,864
Why did you take the case?

108
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:45,634
I had no choice!

109
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:50,314
A surprise guest came down from Hanyang and people are watching.

110
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:52,504
We have to conduct the investigation even if it is just a formality.

111
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:57,834
So come up with a reason before the governor arrives.

112
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:59,310
Whether you kill her...

113
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,630
or let her live.

114
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,934
Please tell us what we need to do.

115
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:23,214
One. In Joseon, it is allowed for a child to avenge his parents,

116
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:26,034
or for a husband to avenge the wife.

117
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:31,184
Two. The verdict of murder is only up to the King.

118
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:37,044
Then we can convince the King that the new bride killed the old lady to avenge her husband.

119
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,614
Of course, there are particular terms that say you must have witnessed the crime

120
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:42,964
and the revenge has to take place on the same day.

121
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:45,074
They usually give a verdict to reflect any precedent.

122
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:49,314
Even so, I had no idea a person's vengeance would be allowed.

123
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:52,494
Even for me, if my family died right in front of my eyes,

124
00:09:52,494 --> 00:09:55,164
I would kill that person right there and then!

125
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:56,774
Well...

126
00:09:57,794 --> 00:10:02,094
I guess the law has to deal with the situation with compassion.

127
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:07,214
But to be technically exact, her husband died while fighting with villagers and was beaten to death.

128
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:09,064
He did not die because of the old lady.

129
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:12,354
If it were not for the old lady in the beginning, such a fight would not have started.

130
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:16,174
Can you prove that the fight occurred because of the false rumors the old lady started?

131
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:17,804
Those who spread the rumors would know it for themselves.

132
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:20,834
But they would not testify on behalf of the new bride.

133
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:24,004
If they did, they might get arrested for murder.

134
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:31,044
That difficult task is for us to resolve.

135
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,504
Okay, gather closer.

136
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:40,144
Hey!

137
00:10:40,144 --> 00:10:42,634
 First, Dong Chi...

138
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:44,414
Have a drink first.

139
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:48,364
 Try to get one of them to betray the rest.

140
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:57,744
They were born and raised in this village all their life.

141
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:58,894
Will they betray each other?

142
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:03,084
Loyalty? That is when nothing has been tested.

143
00:11:03,084 --> 00:11:07,134
It is different now. "A person has died."

144
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:12,534
"There may be other deaths. And perhaps it could be me."

145
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:15,974
We just have to stimulate such anxiety.

146
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:18,974
 We have to go now!

147
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:24,914
Aigoo, honey! If we don't tell them first, we will be framed for everything!

148
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:30,434
What you are saying, Wife, is that you want me to betray them

149
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:34,714
before they betray me first!

150
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:41,954
Other men have spilled everything.

151
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:43,374
They have already spilled everything.

152
00:11:43,374 --> 00:11:46,534
If you stay back like this, you will take all the blame.

153
00:11:46,534 --> 00:11:50,514
See? What did I tell you?

154
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:52,484
It is a lie.

155
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:53,974
Stop lying to me.

156
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:57,164
There is no way Hyeongnim and Choon Seob would do that.

157
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:02,314
As for the new bride's husband—

158
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:05,604
He died as a result of a lethal blow to his solar plexus.

159
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:08,574
If it was a lie, how would I know this?

160
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:09,694
How do you know—

161
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:14,224
See? I know it because those men have told me so.

162
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:08,274
Tie it like this.

163
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:14,244
Geez, whatever.

164
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:25,554
Were you not asleep?

165
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,164
I woke up because I heard some noise.

166
00:13:29,394 --> 00:13:31,234
You can be honest with me.

167
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:33,204
That you came out because you were worried.

168
00:13:33,204 --> 00:13:35,144
You can be honest with me as well.

169
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:37,704
Say you are in pain if it hurts.

170
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,604
Ow! It hurts!

171
00:13:43,604 --> 00:13:46,564
- Exaggerating...
 - You said to tell you.

172
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:06,424
Here.

173
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:08,604
What is this?

174
00:14:08,604 --> 00:14:10,864
Cheongshimhwan  (Herbal medicine to calm nerves).

175
00:14:10,864 --> 00:14:12,984
You must have been shocked.

176
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:16,574
I'm sure all these things were a first for you.

177
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:19,394
Are you giving me the illness and the medicine at the same time?

178
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:21,594
I am afraid you might run away if I give you only the illness.

179
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,414
Whoa.

180
00:14:23,414 --> 00:14:28,634
You are finally saying you need me and for us to be together officially, are you not?

181
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,614
Well...

182
00:14:30,614 --> 00:14:34,464
Then let us share this as a sign of our promise.

183
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:37,274
A promise?

184
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:43,614
If we share it...

185
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:04,944
No!

186
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:07,314
No, no, no...

187
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:10,964
It's not like this is the sharing of jujube during the wedding ceremony.

188
00:15:10,964 --> 00:15:15,034
For two different people to meet and work together toward a common goal

189
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:18,844
is just as important as getting married.

190
00:15:20,934 --> 00:15:22,544
If you are

191
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:27,574
trying to reserve the spot as my bride inadvertently—

192
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:33,774
You promised me then,

193
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:36,254
that we would become each other's cheongshimhwan.

194
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:38,684
To be together always.

195
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:51,294
All right.

196
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:57,974
A promise.

197
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:25,944
 Congratulations on passing the state examination.

198
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:42,014
 So I intend to do a good job and not get caught.

199
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:46,194
 Thus, please do not acknowledge me again.

200
00:16:46,194 --> 00:16:51,124
 Princess, what is it you are up to?

201
00:16:51,124 --> 00:16:56,014
 What is your relationship with that attorney?

202
00:17:00,204 --> 00:17:02,014
Mayor Sir.

203
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:04,384
They found the culprit who killed Park Je Su.

204
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:06,044
What?

205
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:12,814
Get the troops ready.

206
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:14,474
Yes, Sir.

207
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:33,054
Come at me.

208
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:20,304
I will send out a messenger today to the governor with a report.

209
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:53,344
Go and wait around in his path.

210
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:58,084
We must stop the messenger, whatever it takes.

211
00:20:46,284 --> 00:20:50,294
The messenger who was on his way to the governor was attacked.

212
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:53,244
Whoa, these country bumpkins are too gutsy and have no fear!

213
00:20:53,244 --> 00:20:55,114
Did they even stop the messenger?

214
00:20:55,114 --> 00:20:58,854
- How about the report? 
 - It was torn up and thrown away.

215
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:05,744
It would take forever to ask the magistrate to rewrite the report.

216
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:11,414
I think it would be better for someone just to go to the governor and tell him in person.

217
00:21:11,414 --> 00:21:13,194
Yoon, you go.

218
00:21:13,194 --> 00:21:15,364
Yes, Ma'am.

219
00:21:15,364 --> 00:21:19,424
Whoa, we're doomed for sure.

220
00:21:19,424 --> 00:21:21,764
What will you do—

221
00:21:37,904 --> 00:21:39,344
Has everyone gathered?

222
00:21:39,344 --> 00:21:41,584
Yes, Father.

223
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:44,144
Okay. Let us go.

224
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:51,664
It looks like they are trying to cover up this case before the governor arrives.

225
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:57,794
Let us go!

226
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:59,064
- To where?
 - How about food?

227
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:00,484
I mean, why all of a sudden-

228
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:02,984
The new bride is in danger.

229
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:30,114
Drag out the girl!

230
00:22:30,114 --> 00:22:34,154
Drag the girl! Drag her!

231
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:39,634
Drag her! Drag her!

232
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:42,884
You must shelter in a safe place, Magistrate.

233
00:22:42,884 --> 00:22:44,954
Geez, those country bumpkins!

234
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:48,434
Drag her! Drag her!

235
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:52,384
Drag her! Drag her!

236
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:07,764
Go, go! Hurry!

237
00:24:12,514 --> 00:24:14,574
What happened?

238
00:24:14,574 --> 00:24:17,764
You go to Marmeori Tavern first. You know what to do after that, right?

239
00:24:17,764 --> 00:24:19,134
What is going on?

240
00:24:19,134 --> 00:24:21,094
Follow me for now.

241
00:24:33,454 --> 00:24:36,650
I will hold a disciplinary hearing.

242
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,334
Bring her out!

243
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:40,364
Please spare me!

244
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:42,604
Spare me, Foreman!

245
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:44,594
Please!

246
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:51,354
You should have gone away when I first let you go.

247
00:24:51,354 --> 00:24:55,034
There will be no mercy the second time around.

248
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:56,584
Hang her.

249
00:24:56,584 --> 00:24:59,084
I carry a baby in my womb!

250
00:24:59,084 --> 00:25:01,224
- Please spare me! 
  - She's with child!

251
00:25:01,224 --> 00:25:03,284
 Does she have a baby?

252
00:25:07,384 --> 00:25:11,694
Hang her!

253
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:16,524
Hang her!

254
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:20,744
Hang her!

255
00:25:20,744 --> 00:25:24,794
Hang her!

256
00:25:24,794 --> 00:25:29,024
Hang her!

257
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:33,104
Hang her!

258
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:36,794
You should hang her, however...

259
00:25:40,544 --> 00:25:44,234
What is an outsider here for?

260
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:46,484
Stop interrupting and get lost!

261
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:49,454
How dare he meddle in our village matters?

262
00:25:49,454 --> 00:25:51,284
- I know. 
 - He is no good...

263
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:54,404
Gosh, what do you mean an outsider? That makes me sad.

264
00:25:54,404 --> 00:25:59,114
I am not an outsider. I am an attorney.

265
00:25:59,114 --> 00:26:02,594
I am this new bride, Yeong Sil's attorney.

266
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:06,934
So I must know why you will only punish this new bride.

267
00:26:08,404 --> 00:26:11,064
According to our village rules,

268
00:26:11,064 --> 00:26:16,774
whoever causes disturbances in the village must be punished by being hung on a tree.

269
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:22,564
Then what kind of punishment did you give to that matchmaking granny?

270
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:26,634
What? What nonsense are you spewing?

271
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:28,864
Punishment for the victim?

272
00:26:28,864 --> 00:26:32,824
You should not just feign ignorance like that, Foreman.

273
00:26:34,404 --> 00:26:37,904
What are they doing? What's this?

274
00:26:37,904 --> 00:26:40,994
What are they doing?

275
00:26:40,994 --> 00:26:46,704
Who does not know the new bride's inside story among the villagers here?

276
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:49,744
No matter the injustice done to you,

277
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:56,074
we cannot ignore the killing of a person using a hoe in broad daylight.

278
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:13,734
So you were aware that this was an injustice done to her after all.

279
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:16,474
Wh-What did you say?

280
00:27:17,224 --> 00:27:19,474
I am sure you were all aware

281
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:24,014
that the origin of the rumors was the usual suspect, the matchmaking granny.

282
00:27:24,014 --> 00:27:27,074
At first, I am sure you all thought, how did this nice and pretty new bride

283
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:29,204
get mixed up with that vicious matchmaking granny and thought,

284
00:27:29,204 --> 00:27:31,564
"What a pity!" and felt compassion for her.

285
00:27:31,564 --> 00:27:35,614
But as more time passed,

286
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:41,304
I am sure you knew they were not true, yet you enjoyed the gossip, chewing her out.

287
00:27:41,304 --> 00:27:43,844
Why do you think you did that?

288
00:27:43,844 --> 00:27:49,064
Why do you think you did that? Please do tell! Everyone, why did you do that?

289
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:52,214
Everyone, please tell us! Why did you do that?

290
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:55,394
Why did you do that, everyone?

291
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:03,004
Because it was someone else's story.

292
00:28:05,104 --> 00:28:07,994
I am sure it was fun.

293
00:28:09,094 --> 00:28:14,234
This is a poor region where you go hungry unless you work every minute of every day.

294
00:28:15,564 --> 00:28:18,404
So in the midst of the repetition of mundane daily chores,

295
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:23,050
there could not be anything more fun than talking about others' rumors.

296
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:25,584
 Is the rumor true?

297
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:27,644
 - The rumor about the new bride? 
 - New bride?

298
00:28:27,644 --> 00:28:30,634
 That bitch is the crazy one.

299
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:33,944
 That bitch is crazy about men.

300
00:28:38,154 --> 00:28:40,194
At times like that,

301
00:28:40,994 --> 00:28:46,974
what this village needed the most was elders like you, Foreman.

302
00:28:51,704 --> 00:28:55,104
But what did you do, Foreman?

303
00:28:55,104 --> 00:28:59,284
Foreman, please, I beg you!

304
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:03,884
 If my husband finds out about the rumor, I am afraid of what might happen.

305
00:29:03,884 --> 00:29:06,704
 Oh, my. Goodness...

306
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:09,864
 Did the rumors get blown that badly out of proportion?

307
00:29:10,764 --> 00:29:16,004
 But are you sure those are indeed false rumors?

308
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:21,094
 Excuse me?

309
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:28,294
 I have never seen a chimney that does not produce smoke when there is fire.

310
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:40,074
- Han Su. 
  - What in the world is going on...

311
00:29:45,864 --> 00:29:47,864
At that time!

312
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:55,374
 What the hell. What a dirty family line your household is.

313
00:29:59,244 --> 00:30:03,004
If you had not turned your head, Foreman!

314
00:30:03,004 --> 00:30:06,184
Only if you had fought on our side!

315
00:30:07,024 --> 00:30:09,034
Only if you had done so!

316
00:30:10,904 --> 00:30:13,994
We would not have had to make a run

317
00:30:13,994 --> 00:30:17,354
or kill ourselves,

318
00:30:17,354 --> 00:30:20,794
or commit a brutal murder.

319
00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:24,844
We could have looked for another solution!

320
00:30:24,844 --> 00:30:27,834
How dare you mouth off like that here!

321
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:33,114
Then are you saying I am the cause for the incident?

322
00:30:33,114 --> 00:30:38,804
Do you not think you carry too much power compared to your competency or qualifications?

323
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:43,244
How could a foreman try to control the life and death of a person?

324
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:46,620
You are challenging the gods' power.

325
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:52,704
Or at least vying for the power of the king.

326
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:56,440
And we call that...

327
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,390
treason.

328
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:05,650
Kang Han Su!

329
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:10,874
What's going on? Treason?

330
00:31:10,874 --> 00:31:15,004
What in the world is he talking about?

331
00:31:17,194 --> 00:31:20,624
Look around and see what that treacherous heart has brought about.

332
00:31:20,624 --> 00:31:26,360
An old lady was murdered in broad daylight and one of the villagers became a murderer.

333
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:31,000
Why do you not judge the murderer who murdered

334
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,430
the new bride's husband in this disciplinary hearing?

335
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,534
Choi Dae Sik!

336
00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:57,834
Step forward and receive your punishment!

337
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,774
Why are you picking only on my husband?

338
00:31:59,774 --> 00:32:02,464
The three of them fought together.

339
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:06,264
But the one who killed him is your husband, Choi Je Sik.

340
00:32:07,064 --> 00:32:10,784
Who in the world spews such nonsense?

341
00:32:11,704 --> 00:32:13,684
Who else?

342
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:20,934
 Chang Su died as a result of a lethal blow to his solar plexus.

343
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:24,024
 If it was a lie, how would I know this?

344
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:28,494
 - How do you know— 
-  See?

345
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:31,504
 I know it because those men have told me so.

346
00:32:31,504 --> 00:32:33,944
It's not me! I-It was Hyeongnim Je Sik!

347
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:37,224
Geez, these traitors!

348
00:32:41,414 --> 00:32:44,584
You traitors!

349
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:48,284
You punched him first!

350
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:51,544
You guys spilled everything! Why do you do this to me?

351
00:32:51,544 --> 00:32:54,704
Would I be crazy to spew that around?

352
00:32:54,704 --> 00:32:58,214
-  Do you think I wanted to tell him? 
 - Quiet. Quiet!

353
00:32:58,214 --> 00:32:59,874
I had no choice since he knew everything!

354
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:02,004
What a total mess this is.

355
00:33:02,004 --> 00:33:06,454
What will you do now? You should hang those three on a tree, too.

356
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:08,464
Oh, why?

357
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:11,444
You cannot bear to hang your son-in-law?

358
00:33:16,114 --> 00:33:18,574
So what do you all think?

359
00:33:18,574 --> 00:33:21,494
You all heard everything, right?

360
00:33:21,494 --> 00:33:25,044
Move, move. Step aside.

361
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:40,834
Greetings to you, Mayor Sir.

362
00:33:46,344 --> 00:33:48,554
Mind your proper manners!

363
00:33:48,554 --> 00:33:55,154
How can you not know the mayor in charge of Hanseongbu, the second senior in rank?

364
00:33:56,154 --> 00:33:58,744
And if that does not help, let me see...

365
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:00,614
Yeah, that's right!

366
00:34:00,614 --> 00:34:04,614
He is the son of Minister Yu.

367
00:34:06,574 --> 00:34:09,904
The son of his legal wife!

368
00:34:21,474 --> 00:34:25,374
Greetings to you, Mayor Sir.

369
00:34:35,134 --> 00:34:36,774
Mayor Sir.

370
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:41,914
As you saw and heard, this murder did not occur solely because of the new bride.

371
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,564
Please consider the circumstances and—

372
00:34:43,564 --> 00:34:46,614
Of course, your trial was very impressive.

373
00:34:46,614 --> 00:34:51,994
I got to understand the new bride's situation and the crimes of these villagers.

374
00:34:51,994 --> 00:34:57,654
However, that does not justify the new bride's act of murder itself.

375
00:34:57,654 --> 00:35:01,734
The national law says anyone who kills another should be killed.

376
00:35:01,734 --> 00:35:06,974
No matter how harsh the false accusations may have been, it does not give a death penalty.

377
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:11,004
Even if it was vengeance due to grave indignation, if the result was to commit murder,

378
00:35:11,004 --> 00:35:16,514
I dare not give an opinion to say that I could consider mitigating circumstances or forgive.

379
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,234
Her husband died because of that false rumor!

380
00:35:19,234 --> 00:35:21,284
The new bride avenged her husband's death.

381
00:35:21,284 --> 00:35:24,414
- She should have let the government office take care of it.
 - I am sure she tried.

382
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:28,364
Hey! Be quiet!

383
00:35:28,364 --> 00:35:30,044
So Won...

384
00:35:33,744 --> 00:35:35,854
My apologies.

385
00:35:38,534 --> 00:35:39,754
My apologies.

386
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:41,784
I will investigate the details of the case.

387
00:35:41,784 --> 00:35:44,704
Everyone in the village is an accomplice or at least part of the faction.

388
00:35:44,704 --> 00:35:46,794
Arrest everyone and take them to the government office.

389
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:48,544
Yes, Sir.

390
00:35:48,544 --> 00:35:49,644
Take them!

391
00:35:49,644 --> 00:35:51,664
Yes, Sir!

392
00:36:12,764 --> 00:36:14,004
Oh, wait...

393
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:17,034
Do you truly not understand?

394
00:36:18,204 --> 00:36:21,094
You should apologize beforehand.

395
00:36:26,164 --> 00:36:28,404
He says he caught the killer who killed Park Je Su.

396
00:36:28,404 --> 00:36:29,884
What?

397
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,984
 If you want to meet the culprit who killed Chief Advisor Park,

398
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:40,534
 please come to Marmeori Tavern in Dabokri in Cheongsan.

399
00:36:41,854 --> 00:36:45,240
Would you have come if I had told you the truth?

400
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:50,734
Only the king can sentence the criminal for murder in Joseon.

401
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:54,004
Of course, the King would base his decision on the case report.

402
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:58,024
Thus,  who will be the one to report this case to him is crucial and

403
00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:02,514
and the only person I could trust to do that job was you, Mayor.

404
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:03,724
Why would you trust me?

405
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:07,574
You let me win the case last time.

406
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:13,884
Of course, all the trials and verdicts you oversaw as royal secret inspector traveling all over the country...

407
00:37:13,884 --> 00:37:16,134
I read them all.

408
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:21,934
I was so ashamed of the bias I held against you for being the son of Minister Yu.

409
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:28,204
I found out that you are a very fair and outstanding person.

410
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:31,534
You deceived me before. Now, you're buttering me up with flattery.

411
00:37:31,534 --> 00:37:33,134
Is this how you get around the world?

412
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:35,384
Well, not immediately, but

413
00:37:35,384 --> 00:37:40,644
if I were to someday find the killer who killed Chief Advisor Park and were to let you know?

414
00:37:40,644 --> 00:37:45,834
So you want me to cooperate with you in saving this new bride?

415
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:50,024
It will become your case to oversee anyhow.

416
00:37:51,564 --> 00:37:54,764
I did not expect you to pay me a visit here, Sir.

417
00:37:54,764 --> 00:37:57,574
I cannot believe I get to sit at the same table as you.

418
00:37:57,574 --> 00:38:02,454
I am overwhelmed by your presence. I do not know what to do.

419
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:05,694
I did not know I would get to meet with you this way, Magistrate Son.

420
00:38:05,694 --> 00:38:09,034
So, how do you like the tea?

421
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:10,824
Oh, yes.

422
00:38:14,954 --> 00:38:16,714
It is very good.

423
00:38:16,714 --> 00:38:19,954
You brought these tea leaves yourself from Hanyang.

424
00:38:19,954 --> 00:38:21,974
They must be so valuable.

425
00:38:21,974 --> 00:38:27,034
The scent and the taste are both so unique. It is very flavorful and very nice.

426
00:38:28,944 --> 00:38:31,884
It was made by soaking the maple tree mushrooms.

427
00:38:31,884 --> 00:38:35,054
Oh, maple tree mushrooms...

428
00:38:35,054 --> 00:38:37,664
Wow, the name is so unique—

429
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,854
- Pardon?
 - Yes.

430
00:38:41,854 --> 00:38:43,754
It is a poisonous mushroom.

431
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:47,344
You start snickering after you eat it, but you die in the end.

432
00:38:47,344 --> 00:38:50,074
Is it not the happiest death of all?

433
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:53,424
I hear it is too great a gift for you, Magistrate Son.

434
00:39:00,694 --> 00:39:04,244
Wh-Why do this to me?

435
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:08,624
You should be the one giving us the answer, Magistrate.

436
00:39:09,524 --> 00:39:11,834
Why did you do it?

437
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:17,434
Why did you ignore the new bride's plea for help and not properly delve into her husband's death?

438
00:39:17,434 --> 00:39:21,290
I-I mean, the villagers from that area

439
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:25,270
are always fighting among themselves and making a ruckus.

440
00:39:25,274 --> 00:39:27,794
They reside in the deepest area of Cheongsan.

441
00:39:27,794 --> 00:39:31,844
Even the bandits avoid going through that village.

442
00:39:31,844 --> 00:39:34,984
You still have not come to your senses.

443
00:39:34,984 --> 00:39:37,404
Then go ahead and just die like this. Let us go, Sir.

444
00:39:37,404 --> 00:39:41,234
Oh! W-Wait, wait, wait! Please save me!

445
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:44,064
W-W-Wait, the medicine! The antidote!

446
00:39:44,064 --> 00:39:47,104
Please give me the antidote.

447
00:39:47,104 --> 00:39:51,004
That old woman. That old lady came to see me.

448
00:39:51,804 --> 00:39:56,894
 I guess a few men in our village had a fistfight.

449
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,284
 Please turn a blind eye to the incident.

450
00:39:59,284 --> 00:40:04,154
 Foreman and I will resolve the issue quickly.

451
00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:09,634
I needed a gift to offer His Excellency.

452
00:40:14,744 --> 00:40:17,304
Something that would stand out from others.

453
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:20,304
I just wanted to impress all the excellencies.

454
00:40:20,304 --> 00:40:26,754
I wanted them to know how hard I was working for the sake of my region.

455
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:32,934
Please save me!

456
00:40:32,934 --> 00:40:34,314
Look!

457
00:40:34,314 --> 00:40:36,974
Arrest Magistrate Son of Cheongsan immediately!

458
00:40:36,974 --> 00:40:42,054
Please save me! Please.

459
00:40:51,844 --> 00:40:56,184
As the antidote for maple tree mushrooms, poop water works the best.

460
00:41:01,024 --> 00:41:03,214
You must drink all of it.

461
00:41:19,114 --> 00:41:23,474
Would it have been the right thing to do if that new bride had stabbed her own neck with the hoe?

462
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:25,004
No.

463
00:41:25,004 --> 00:41:27,954
If that had happened, the vengeful spirit probably could not even close her eyes

464
00:41:27,954 --> 00:41:33,964
and would have wandered around the netherworld and harmed humans or caused trouble for this world.

465
00:41:34,974 --> 00:41:37,504
Thus I desperately plead with you,

466
00:41:37,504 --> 00:41:41,964
please deeply consider how horrible the wife must have felt when she found out

467
00:41:41,964 --> 00:41:46,674
he died because of her and the guilt she must feel.

468
00:41:54,474 --> 00:41:58,714
It totally resonates in my heart!

469
00:41:58,714 --> 00:42:03,204
Of course. It was worth writing up all those petitions over the years.

470
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:07,064
So what? All we can do now is wait.

471
00:42:09,084 --> 00:42:11,464
- Where is So Won?
 - Well,

472
00:42:11,464 --> 00:42:16,024
she went to the hot springs with Hostess Hong. They left early morning.

473
00:42:19,364 --> 00:42:21,324
Therefore...

474
00:42:21,324 --> 00:42:27,244
how do you propose we handle this agenda brought to us by

475
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:29,944
Hanseongbu mayor Yu Ji Seon and Choongcheong-do governor Park Tae Yeong?

476
00:42:29,944 --> 00:42:32,814
How does the Royal Bureau of Investigation feel about this?

477
00:42:32,814 --> 00:42:37,524
Although she is an atrocious woman who committed murder,

478
00:42:37,524 --> 00:42:41,474
her reason was to avenge the death of her husband.

479
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:44,654
How could we punish her for that?

480
00:42:46,584 --> 00:42:49,004
What are your thoughts, Minister of Justice?

481
00:42:49,004 --> 00:42:54,314
Yes, if a faithful woman was framed for lewd behaviors,

482
00:42:54,314 --> 00:42:57,184
there could not be anything more unfair than that.

483
00:42:57,184 --> 00:43:02,724
She did not have anything to prove her innocence and she had no choice but to do what she did.

484
00:43:02,724 --> 00:43:05,584
We should understand that.

485
00:43:06,914 --> 00:43:12,044
 No one has reasons to oppose this case since it was brought in by Minister Yu's son.

486
00:43:12,844 --> 00:43:19,254
Even so, are you suggesting that we let the woman who killed another just live?

487
00:43:19,254 --> 00:43:21,594
What if this becomes a precedent

488
00:43:21,594 --> 00:43:26,294
and more cases of people killing another with avenging a family member as an excuse happen?

489
00:43:26,294 --> 00:43:28,834
How would you all take responsibility for that?

490
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:31,654
Queen Dowager,

491
00:43:31,654 --> 00:43:37,354
the law says the king ought to make the judgment for a murder case.

492
00:43:38,254 --> 00:43:42,034
Is the will of the king what is important here?

493
00:44:02,164 --> 00:44:04,544
 I desperately make this plea

494
00:44:04,544 --> 00:44:08,734
 that the law does not put its people in prison and punish them,

495
00:44:08,734 --> 00:44:11,644
 but that there are laws that save its people.

496
00:44:11,644 --> 00:44:17,104
 Please be the kind of king who lets this fact be known to all the world.

497
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:23,234
 Did you personally write this petition?

498
00:44:23,234 --> 00:44:25,634
 I personally

499
00:44:25,634 --> 00:44:28,674
 transcribed what Attorney Kang had written without his knowledge.

500
00:44:28,674 --> 00:44:30,764
 Seeing how good he is at writing petitions,

501
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:34,284
 that Kang Han Su's skills are quite outstanding.

502
00:44:34,284 --> 00:44:37,564
 He has certainly captured your heart like this.

503
00:44:37,564 --> 00:44:40,964
 Did it move your heart as well, Your Majesty?

504
00:44:43,734 --> 00:44:47,804
 How would I not know  your and Attorney Kang's desperate plea?

505
00:44:47,804 --> 00:44:50,514
 However, it is a murder case.

506
00:44:50,514 --> 00:44:54,634
 Only  a life can pay for taking away another life.

507
00:44:54,634 --> 00:44:57,544
 Yes. I knew you would reason that.

508
00:44:57,544 --> 00:45:02,454
 Fortunately, there are two more lines left to go.

509
00:45:02,454 --> 00:45:07,284
I... already have an answer.

510
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,904
Here is my verdict.

511
00:45:25,544 --> 00:45:30,434
 The crime of killing someone for any reason is unforgivable.

512
00:45:30,434 --> 00:45:35,584
 It must be dealt with according to the law of the country.

513
00:45:37,044 --> 00:45:38,764
 However...

514
00:45:38,764 --> 00:45:43,044
 the law of the country states that if one person is killed, it must be repaid with one life.

515
00:45:44,364 --> 00:45:51,464
 This means that no more than one life should be taken for one life.

516
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:57,064
 The criminal Choi Young Sil is currently pregnant.

517
00:45:57,064 --> 00:46:00,894
 If the criminal is punished now, it would be equivalent to taking two lives.

518
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:04,454
 So wait until the child is born and grown up.

519
00:46:04,454 --> 00:46:07,204
 Then make her pay for her crime.

520
00:46:13,294 --> 00:46:16,234
I am sorry that I survived alone.

521
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:25,254
I will raise our child well, and then follow you...

522
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:30,574
I miss you.

523
00:46:33,034 --> 00:46:36,034
She will not really be living even if she is alive.

524
00:46:37,034 --> 00:46:39,784
The fact that such an ordinary person

525
00:46:39,784 --> 00:46:43,744
hurt someone without overcoming her resentment means

526
00:46:44,464 --> 00:46:48,014
she also has hurt her own soul.

527
00:46:49,104 --> 00:46:55,284
From that moment on, she will live in hell forever.

528
00:46:55,284 --> 00:46:58,194
Even if she could survive, it does not mean that everything is over.

529
00:46:58,194 --> 00:46:59,554
Yes.

530
00:46:59,554 --> 00:47:04,734
By the way, when are you going to tell her to pay the fee?

531
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:06,564
Are we not here for the money?

532
00:47:06,564 --> 00:47:08,124
- You have not told her yet?
 - Should I tell her?

533
00:47:08,124 --> 00:47:10,334
- Then should I do it? 
 - Should I tell her now?

534
00:47:10,334 --> 00:47:12,664
- Now? 
 - Wait.

535
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:18,000
 Wishes Inn

536
00:47:18,784 --> 00:47:22,744
 It is this place. They say this place is so good.

537
00:47:22,744 --> 00:47:23,884
 Welcome.

538
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:27,134
 Please set a generous table for us.

539
00:47:27,134 --> 00:47:31,404
 We will quickly put down our things and come back.

540
00:47:38,414 --> 00:47:40,434
Sir!

541
00:47:41,604 --> 00:47:43,594
Sir!

542
00:47:47,084 --> 00:47:49,274
Did we crisscross?

543
00:47:49,274 --> 00:47:51,464
We should have waited for him in Hanyang.

544
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:54,684
No, his things are still here.

545
00:47:57,634 --> 00:48:02,234
The crime of attacking the government office and escaping from prison should be repaid with your life.

546
00:48:02,234 --> 00:48:04,864
Are you aware of it?

547
00:48:04,864 --> 00:48:07,154
Are you here to laugh at me?

548
00:48:07,154 --> 00:48:09,994
I mean you are going to need an attorney.

549
00:48:09,994 --> 00:48:13,174
A very talented attorney.

550
00:48:14,974 --> 00:48:20,764
I am not sure about you, but I will save your daughter and family and the people in the village.

551
00:48:21,594 --> 00:48:23,804
What do you want from me?

552
00:48:23,804 --> 00:48:27,684
Why are you asking me that? You already know.

553
00:48:38,594 --> 00:48:43,614
My son... Do you remember Gwang Sik?

554
00:48:43,614 --> 00:48:48,054
Yes, of course. He used to work with my father.

555
00:48:48,054 --> 00:48:52,970
He was a secretary of your father, Legal Officer Kang.

556
00:48:54,244 --> 00:48:57,144
His job mostly involved delivering letters

557
00:48:57,144 --> 00:49:02,144
to the palace in the capital city.

558
00:49:02,144 --> 00:49:04,164
Letters?

559
00:49:05,064 --> 00:49:08,194
They were delivered to the King.

560
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,604
But one day,

561
00:49:12,604 --> 00:49:18,294
he said someone had taken that letter from him.

562
00:49:18,294 --> 00:49:21,304
 But unfortunately that day,

563
00:49:21,304 --> 00:49:25,034
 he heard the urgent news that his own son was born that day,

564
00:49:25,034 --> 00:49:27,204
so he just left in a hurry.

565
00:49:28,044 --> 00:49:30,814
And then, after a while,

566
00:49:30,814 --> 00:49:37,634
Legal Officer Kang was arrested on charges of bribery.

567
00:49:39,914 --> 00:49:42,384
I was afraid.

568
00:49:42,384 --> 00:49:45,434
So you pretended not to know about it?

569
00:49:51,034 --> 00:49:55,724
Instead, I set your house on fire.

570
00:49:56,664 --> 00:50:01,384
That is how I made you run away like that.

571
00:50:04,404 --> 00:50:09,094
I also spread rumors that you had died.

572
00:50:09,094 --> 00:50:14,754
Thanks to that, you are still alive.

573
00:50:18,564 --> 00:50:22,054
Are you saying there is someone who is targeting me?

574
00:50:23,374 --> 00:50:26,834
I can only guess that.

575
00:50:27,534 --> 00:50:33,054
I do not know who that person is.

576
00:50:33,054 --> 00:50:37,774
Then who took away the letter at that time?

577
00:50:44,924 --> 00:50:48,064
Please tell me! Who was it?

578
00:51:00,184 --> 00:51:04,974
Two appeals came up that day.

579
00:51:06,584 --> 00:51:08,824
One was a personnel order for the successor to the chief of Dohwaseo  (Office in charge of paintings needed by the court),

580
00:51:08,824 --> 00:51:12,124
which had already passed the council meeting.

581
00:51:12,124 --> 00:51:14,994
The other one was about the murder case.

582
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:20,644
It turned out that the personnel appointment recommended by you happened to be

583
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:25,834
Song Jong Seok, the magistrate handling the case in Cheongsan.

584
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:28,314
If I had mentioned them together at the time,

585
00:51:28,314 --> 00:51:33,934
other subordinates might have misunderstood that you recommended someone who was not qualified.

586
00:51:33,934 --> 00:51:37,174
So I did not approve it on purpose.

587
00:51:37,174 --> 00:51:42,314
I am deeply grateful for your thoughtful consideration.

588
00:51:43,824 --> 00:51:45,604
Then...

589
00:51:47,984 --> 00:51:53,444
can I say that you owe me a debt today, Minister?

590
00:52:01,514 --> 00:52:03,944
What a surprise!

591
00:52:03,944 --> 00:52:07,074
I cannot believe I have stunned you.

592
00:52:08,864 --> 00:52:13,594
You do not need to count debts, Your Majesty.

593
00:52:13,594 --> 00:52:19,824
If you want something, you can simply command me.

594
00:52:19,824 --> 00:52:22,614
Yes, you are right.

595
00:52:22,614 --> 00:52:25,914
Thank you for saying that.

596
00:52:25,914 --> 00:52:29,244
Then while we are on the subject,

597
00:52:31,564 --> 00:52:36,544
can I recommend a person for Chief Advisor?

598
00:52:48,394 --> 00:52:52,644
Young people these days do not seem to know limits.

599
00:52:52,644 --> 00:52:55,294
Not only did my son,

600
00:52:55,294 --> 00:53:00,134
but the young king also rushed in without knowing his place.

601
00:53:00,134 --> 00:53:03,704
Mayor Yu was the one who brought in the report this time.

602
00:53:03,704 --> 00:53:06,014
So, many were surprised.

603
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:10,774
We assumed it was your idea, so we took his side.

604
00:53:10,774 --> 00:53:16,044
But we had no idea that of all people Song Jong Seok, our Hungu Party member, would be involved.

605
00:53:20,634 --> 00:53:23,064
Was it Kang Han Su?

606
00:53:23,064 --> 00:53:24,514
Pardon me?

607
00:53:24,514 --> 00:53:28,874
I'm talking about the attorney who helped the princess solve the murder case in Cheongsan.

608
00:53:28,874 --> 00:53:30,634
Oh, that is right!

609
00:53:30,634 --> 00:53:35,704
I was already watching him closely because he is not an ordinary person.

610
00:53:35,704 --> 00:53:40,724
It turns out the person who sued Merchant Jang and got rid of him

611
00:53:40,724 --> 00:53:43,704
was also that Kang Han Su. And

612
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:49,094
he is also the attorney who handled Chief Advisor Park's lawsuit.

613
00:53:49,094 --> 00:53:52,324
Why are you telling me all that now?

614
00:53:53,044 --> 00:53:59,154
It seemed a bit unnecessary to go into detail about a mere attorney.

615
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:04,504
This, this... Is this not a coincidence?

616
00:54:24,704 --> 00:54:27,024
Attorney Kang is late.

617
00:54:27,024 --> 00:54:28,904
He is always late when we are here. 
   Wine

618
00:54:28,904 --> 00:54:30,754
He goes somewhere every night.

619
00:54:30,754 --> 00:54:32,214
Even when I asked him, he did not tell me.

620
00:54:32,214 --> 00:54:35,014
Dong Chi also just told me to pretend not to know.

621
00:54:38,194 --> 00:54:40,394
Are you disappointed?

622
00:54:41,324 --> 00:54:48,084
No, now that I think about it, I realize that I do not actually know much about him.

623
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:53,714
Kang Han Su looked different than usual, especially here in Cheongsan.

624
00:54:53,714 --> 00:54:59,154
Well, he is still competent in his abilities as a lawyer.

625
00:54:59,154 --> 00:55:01,924
He has completely convinced me.

626
00:55:04,004 --> 00:55:09,604
By the way, is it okay for you to dress up so nicely like this?

627
00:55:11,194 --> 00:55:15,664
Let us just say that I dressed up after the hot springs.

628
00:55:21,644 --> 00:55:24,764
Tell him you gave me the clothes and the hair ribbon as gifts, okay?

629
00:55:24,764 --> 00:55:26,844
The hostess to the maidservant?

630
00:55:26,844 --> 00:55:30,474
Well... you can say it is my birthday.

631
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,274
When did it begin?

632
00:55:33,274 --> 00:55:35,444
What do you mean? From this morning to night.

633
00:55:35,444 --> 00:55:40,304
No, I mean, when did you let Attorney Kang into your heart?

634
00:55:44,624 --> 00:55:47,244
If it has not been too long,

635
00:55:47,244 --> 00:55:52,264
before you get too attached, hurry up and let him leave.

636
00:56:59,214 --> 00:57:01,014
Han Su!

637
00:57:01,814 --> 00:57:03,504
 Father!

638
00:57:05,114 --> 00:57:07,074
 Your mom is sleeping now.

639
00:57:08,264 --> 00:57:10,584
 Now, let us see.

640
00:57:22,474 --> 00:57:23,874
 What are you doing?

641
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,514
 This well has dried up, so we cannot use it.

642
00:57:25,514 --> 00:57:27,464
 Why can't we use it?

643
00:57:27,464 --> 00:57:30,824
 Everything in the world depends on how we use it.

644
00:57:30,824 --> 00:57:32,744
 Here we go!

645
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,634
 Here!

646
00:58:00,464 --> 00:58:02,034
 Here!

647
00:58:02,034 --> 00:58:03,644
 Take it.

648
00:58:06,664 --> 00:58:08,514
 Drink it.

649
00:58:17,434 --> 00:58:18,914
 Yes.

650
00:58:18,914 --> 00:58:23,684
 My first drink was with your mom at our wedding.

651
00:58:23,684 --> 00:58:25,794
 I wondered why you kept drinking alcohol that you did not drink before.

652
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:29,374
 So it is a habit you developed after sending Eun Su to get married.

653
00:58:30,764 --> 00:58:36,584
 Han Su. In your next life, be sure to be born as a nobleman.

654
00:58:36,584 --> 00:58:40,004
 Do not be born as the child of this foolish father.

655
00:58:40,004 --> 00:58:42,814
 You can be born as a nobleman, Father.

656
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:46,054
 Aigoo, that would be good, too.

657
00:58:46,704 --> 00:58:50,874
 No, you should be born as a nobleman, and I will be born as your child.

658
00:58:50,874 --> 00:58:54,654
 And I will pay you back for what you did.

659
00:59:11,984 --> 00:59:14,294
 Orabeoni.

660
00:59:14,294 --> 00:59:16,154
 Why? Did you leave something behind?

661
00:59:16,154 --> 00:59:19,134
 I hid dried persimmons in the attic.

662
00:59:19,134 --> 00:59:23,134
 Eat them when you are really, really, really hungry.

663
00:59:23,134 --> 00:59:25,834
 What is that? I got scared.

664
00:59:25,834 --> 00:59:28,444
 Did you come back just to tell me that?

665
00:59:28,444 --> 00:59:32,544
 Are you going to come and visit me?

666
00:59:33,614 --> 00:59:34,904
 Of course.

667
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,974
 You really have to come.

668
00:59:39,394 --> 00:59:42,944
 To be honest, I am scared.

669
00:59:42,944 --> 00:59:46,224
 I will definitely visit you.

670
00:59:48,244 --> 00:59:54,104
 Do not tell Mother and Father that I cried.

671
00:59:56,764 --> 00:59:58,074
 Promise.

672
00:59:58,074 --> 01:00:00,294
 Do not worry about Mother and Father.

673
01:00:00,294 --> 01:00:03,264
 I will take good care of them.

674
01:00:05,604 --> 01:00:08,704
 You also take care of yourself, too, Orabeoni Dong Chi.

675
01:00:10,014 --> 01:00:11,724
 Goodbye.

676
01:00:31,174 --> 01:00:32,904
 Where are you going, Orabeoni?

677
01:00:32,904 --> 01:00:34,794
 You have to fan me ten times.

678
01:00:34,794 --> 01:00:38,484
 Hey, Kang Han Su!

679
01:00:38,484 --> 01:00:40,244
 You guys!

680
01:00:40,244 --> 01:00:43,224
 Father is here. You should greet him first.

681
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,624
Where did he go?

682
01:01:36,104 --> 01:01:38,264
Who are you?

683
01:01:47,824 --> 01:01:49,154
Who are you?

684
01:01:49,154 --> 01:01:51,174
It is me.

685
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:07,204
Is it Eun Su?

686
01:02:12,724 --> 01:02:14,644
Eun Su...

687
01:02:18,024 --> 01:02:20,044
Eun Su!

688
01:02:23,264 --> 01:02:25,134
I missed you.

689
01:02:25,134 --> 01:02:27,704
I missed you!

690
01:02:29,074 --> 01:02:31,024
I am sorry.

691
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:35,860
I am sorry, Eun Su.

692
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,314
Sir.

693
01:02:37,314 --> 01:02:38,844
Yes.

694
01:02:41,484 --> 01:02:43,024
Yes...

695
01:02:46,584 --> 01:02:49,734
My kind younger sister, Eun Su.

696
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:53,554
On the day you set out on the journey to get married,

697
01:02:53,554 --> 01:02:57,434
I promised you that...

698
01:02:59,464 --> 01:03:01,734
on behalf of you...

699
01:03:03,494 --> 01:03:09,164
I would take good care of our mother and father.

700
01:03:10,634 --> 01:03:13,124
But what should I do?

701
01:03:13,124 --> 01:03:16,254
Both of our parents passed away.

702
01:03:17,424 --> 01:03:20,964
Too unfairly.

703
01:03:22,634 --> 01:03:25,554
Too tragically.

704
01:03:32,314 --> 01:03:35,394
I hoped that you would not find out.

705
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:40,584
You got married at a young age for the sake of our family.

706
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:44,414
If you had known the truth, you would have been willing to die along with them.

707
01:03:44,414 --> 01:03:47,344
So I could not say anything.

708
01:03:49,594 --> 01:03:55,504
You should just have lived well after you got married.

709
01:03:55,504 --> 01:03:59,474
Why did you come here, you silly?

710
01:04:15,044 --> 01:04:17,024
Everything is okay.

711
01:04:18,374 --> 01:04:20,674
She would not know.

712
01:04:21,544 --> 01:04:24,034
She would not know anything.

713
01:04:24,034 --> 01:04:27,514
She must be living happily now.

714
01:04:29,874 --> 01:04:32,264
So do not cry.

715
01:04:35,894 --> 01:04:38,234
Do not cry, Sir.

716
01:04:55,664 --> 01:04:57,994
Princess.

717
01:04:59,204 --> 01:05:01,664
♫  Turning back time &nbsp;♫

718
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:03,044
You were...

719
01:05:03,044 --> 01:05:04,884
♫  As I see you getting further away  ♫

720
01:05:04,884 --> 01:05:08,354
a princess.

721
01:05:08,354 --> 01:05:13,344
♫  I'll run and call your painful name &nbsp;♫

722
01:05:13,344 --> 01:05:20,574
♫  Wiping away the tears that flow white &nbsp;♫

723
01:05:20,574 --> 01:05:24,264
♫  Traversing memories &nbsp;♫

724
01:05:24,264 --> 01:05:29,074
♫  Affectionately calling your name &nbsp;♫

725
01:05:29,074 --> 01:05:30,764
Princess...

726
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:34,644
♫  Saying I love you for no reason &nbsp;♫

727
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:38,034
♫  I want to go back to that time  ♫

728
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:44,880
♫  And meet you just once more   ♫

729
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:50,180

730
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:54,744
 We worked with animal experts for scenes involving animals for their safety.

731
01:05:54,744 --> 01:05:59,514
 We thank Kang Shin Il for his special appearance

732
01:05:59,514 --> 01:06:02,144
 Joseon Attorney: A Morality

733
01:06:02,144 --> 01:06:08,674
 If you find out the truth... will you forgive me?

734
01:06:09,804 --> 01:06:13,224
 Is it Legal Officer Kang?

735
01:06:13,224 --> 01:06:18,234
 Are you saying that Kang Han Su is going to target Your Excellency this time?

736
01:06:19,634 --> 01:06:22,454
 Here, this is your birthday present.

737
01:06:22,454 --> 01:06:30,004
 This pair of shoes will lead you to a better and more valuable place.

738
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:33,484
 Do not go!

739
01:06:34,104 --> 01:06:35,704
 Do not worry.

740
01:06:35,704 --> 01:06:40,270
 People who have encountered miracles do not die easily.
