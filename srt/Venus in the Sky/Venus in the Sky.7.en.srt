3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,100
You haven't opened your heart to me yet. It's okay.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,620
I'll keep working.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,940
Just don't think I'm annoying, Vee.

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,620
Okay. You can let me go now.

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,820
Now my feelings for you have gone beyond fondness.

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,050
I love you so much.

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,660
I really love you.

10
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,900
Hello?

11
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,020
At the Patient's Family Deposit Center?

12
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,100
Okay.

13
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,420
Please give me five more minutes. I'll be right there.

14
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,100
What a pity.

15
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,460
Your heart fluttered just now.

16
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,539
Who's heart?

17
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:24,380
Yours.

18
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,860
I've observed you very carefully.

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,300
How do you feel about me?

20
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,180
Just go, hurry!

21
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,860
Someone called you, right?

22
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,420
No.

23
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,460
I want to spend a bit more time with you.

24
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,820
Just go.

25
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,740
Don't keep them waiting.

26
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,460
Answer my question first.

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,500
Okay?

28
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,900
Get back to work.

29
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:55,460
Yes, sir.

30
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,940
Okay.

31
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,300
After you.

32
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,140
My heart is racing.

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,140
Will I die from tachycardia?

34
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,700
Whoa.

35
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,980
Stop!

36
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,700
Give them to me.

37
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,620
Your back hurts, doesn't it?

38
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,380
See, boss?

39
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,100
I told you I would carry them myself.

40
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,020
But you didn't listen.

41
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,940
What are you talking about?

42
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,730
You massage my back every night. My back is fine now.

43
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,100
We need to work together so that we can finish it quickly.

44
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,340
So, when customers come later,

45
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,620
the shop won't be messy.

46
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,140
Let me help you.

47
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,140
No, I'm just going to lay out the goods.

48
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,780
Please, let me help, okay?

49
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,900
Okay?

50
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,100
Fine.

51
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,860
You can help me.

52
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,660
Go and sit down.

53
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,620
It's heavy.

54
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,940
I got it.

55
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,980
Really?

56
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,980
Yes.

57
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,980
Let go.

58
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,620
Can you really take it?

59
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,660
Yes. Leave them to me.

60
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,460
Hold on.

61
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,180
Okay, okay. I got it.

62
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,500
When did you tell me that?

63
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,220
I told you, boss.

64
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,130
I told you, boss.

65
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,460
-When did you tell me? -I'm sorry, sir.

66
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,500
Boss.

67
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,180
Boss!

68
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,020
Bomb.

69
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,540
Sit on this chair so you won't get tired.

70
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,140
Thank you.

71
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,250
But I'm not good at it. So, it's hard to move them.

72
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,620
Oh, really?

73
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,420
It's okay.

74
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,580
Okay.

75
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:18,940
Bomb.

76
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:19,940
Here.

77
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,660
Have some more.

78
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,980
Why only a little? You'll get thirsty.

79
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,420
Because I just drank some water.

80
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,260
I'll have to run to the bathroom later if I have some more.

81
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,060
Oh, that's right.

82
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,220
You'll have to run to pee.

83
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,659
Hey!

84
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,180
What are you doing?

85
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,580
I'm afraid you'll get hot. You'll sweat later.

86
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,020
It's cool.

87
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,650
But the air conditioner is on.

88
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,020
Oh, right. The temperature is cool.

89
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,340
Don't worry about me.

90
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,860
I'm not tired at all.

91
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,820
Do you remember what you promised me?

92
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,220
You promised that you'd let me help you.

93
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,130
Okay.

94
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,490
This is nothing.

95
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,260
Okay.

96
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,580
Can I cheer for you?

97
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,940
Okay.

98
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,020
Keep up.

99
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,620
Do you really have to go this far?

100
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,340
Yes.

101
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,140
Go back to work.

102
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,340
You know? You're much heavier than water.

103
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,700
No, I'm not.

104
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,500
Are you done?

105
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,340
Go on.

106
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,140
It's okay.

107
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,940
This is why the work is hard.

108
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,540
Oh, keep going.

109
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,260
It'll be done in a minute.

110
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,500
Oh.

111
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,140
Can I finish it on time?

112
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,780
Oh.

113
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,380
[Come to my office later]

114
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,980
He won't give me more work, right?

115
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,659
I can't even get these in time.

116
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,900
What is it, Mr. Sky?

117
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,420
Hello?

118
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,340
Yes?

119
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,100
Let me ask you one more time.

120
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,020
Please answer me honestly.

121
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,010
You don't like Vee, do you?

122
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,340
What's wrong, Sky?

123
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,580
It doesn't matter to you

124
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,340
whether I like Vee or not.

125
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,260
Listen, Sky.

126
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,980
You can't pester people

127
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,580
and ask how they feel about Venus.

128
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,860
That's why I said it doesn't matter.

129
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,700
What matters is

130
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,300
how you feel about each other.

131
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,020
Then, if you really want to know,

132
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,100
I'll answer you.

133
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,500
Yes.

134
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,700
I used to like Venus.

135
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,860
And I'm still like him,

136
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,940
as a friend.

137
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,780
Darn it.

138
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,940
It feels so good to tease you.

139
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,490
You must be frustrated.

140
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,140
Really?

141
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,220
Enough with that kind of joke.

142
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,540
Well, I'm telling you the truth.

143
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,940
I invited Venus to decorate my home

144
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,620
to tease you. I wanted to see you jealous.

145
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,770
That's funny.

146
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,660
I was so scared.

147
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,420
I'm worried that no one can cover my shifts.

148
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,860
You...

149
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,260
Oh, Sky.

150
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,420
By the way, you're serious about him, right?

151
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,300
Yes.

152
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,420
Are you going to get him?

153
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,500
Of course.

154
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,820
Just wait to congratulate me.

155
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,180
You're so manly.

156
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,540
If it were in the past, I would've competed with you to pursue him.

157
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,860
But not now.

158
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,700
If only I have a man in my bed.

159
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,060
Calm down. Don't look at me like that.

160
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,580
I'm talking about someone else, not Venus.

161
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,660
Go.

162
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,380
Go back to your desk and work.

163
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,900
Why should I?

164
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,900
If you don't leave, I'm really going to pursue Venus.

165
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,780
Work harder.

166
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,060
I saw you!

167
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Whose boyfriend is this? So cute.

168
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,380
And he is working hard.

169
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,220
What are you doing?

170
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:41,940
Put them on the shelf.

171
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,740
Here.

172
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,380
Wrong again.

173
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,420
-What? -We should put the goods of the same color 
on the same shelf.

174
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,500
-Okay. -Pay attention to the color.

175
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,020
-I did wrong? -Yes.

176
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,060
Put the same color on the same shelf.

177
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,980
Okay.

178
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,460
This one first.

179
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,780
And...

180
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,740
this one.

181
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,700
Right.

182
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,260
-Okay. And... -Great.

183
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,220
Oh.

184
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,540
Didn't you say you'd take care of your boyfriend?

185
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,300
Now you're asking him to work?

186
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,660
No, I offered to help.

187
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,540
J happens to be so tired recently.

188
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,740
What do you think? Is my boyfriend cute?

189
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,500
Come here.

190
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,050
What?

191
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,780
Come here.

192
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,500
What?

193
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,340
What?

194
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,180
J.

195
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,450
Your little brother is right in front of us.

196
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,100
Oh.

197
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,180
Are you still not used to it yet?

198
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,180
You've seen it many times.

199
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,540
It doesn't mean I want to watch it.

200
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,620
What?

201
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,980
Then you and...

202
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,820
Who?

203
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,300
Who? Finish it.

204
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,890
I'm just saying.

205
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,570
By the way,

206
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,420
how's that home decoration you're doing for the doctor going?

207
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,700
The design and estimation are done.

208
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,620
No, workers are making walls

209
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,340
and installing soundproof boards in the bedroom.

210
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,900
Then paste the wallpaper, order furniture,

211
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,300
and make a little decoration. Then it's done.

212
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,060
Seems like there's a lot of work left.

213
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,340
Does that doctor have time to supervise your work?

214
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
Of course not.

215
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,780
He gave me his key.

216
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,180
I may not be able to help in the store frequently.

217
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,820
Oh?

218
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,340
Will it take long?

219
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,260
I wanted to save the employees' expenses.

220
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,260
Oh.

221
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,220
It'll only take a month and a half.

222
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,180
The workers are here. It won't take long.

223
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,820
There won't be any big projects.

224
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,210
Don't bother Vee.

225
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,890
We have staff.

226
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,500
If we're short-handed,

227
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,700
I'll help.

228
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,140
See? You have your staff.

229
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,300
But I don't want others to cheer for me.

230
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,900
I don't want others to help me.

231
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,980
I want my brother to help. I want you to cheer for me.

232
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,740
-I want you to help me. -Don’t…

233
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,900
I miss you already. I'll miss you.

234
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,700
Let go of me.

235
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,500
Go hug Bomb.

236
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,500
I gotta go. I'll grab something to eat.

237
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,340
Why do you help him?

238
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,180
He's your brother.

239
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,340
Let him go.

240
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:30,980
Oh.

241
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,700
Oh my god.

242
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,740
[It's all yellow and red patients today. I'm exhausted]

243
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,580
[It's better to use the time to text to sleep]

244
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,300
[No, I want to talk to you]

245
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,460
Oh.

246
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,660
[What do you want to talk about? You didn't say anything]

247
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,380
[What do you want to talk about? You didn't say anything]

248
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,220
[Can I call you? My head hurts]

249
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,500
[Can I call you? My head hurts]

250
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,700
Hello?

251
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,660
What's wrong?

252
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,170
Did you take your medication for the headache?

253
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,300
Not yet.

254
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,100
I ran out of medicine.

255
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,940
I'll get better after taking a nap.

256
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,500
Do you often have headaches?

257
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,100
Yes.

258
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,260
Well...

259
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,300
I sit to see patients or walk.

260
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,900
My back will hurt after walking for a long time.

261
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,860
When my back hurts, it leads to headaches.

262
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,010
Like office syndrome?

263
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,140
It's common for working people.

264
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,100
Yes.

265
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,700
I think so.

266
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,460
Uh.

267
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,540
Did you use the candle that I gave you?

268
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,420
It'll help you relax.

269
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,540
No, I don't dare to use it.

270
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,620
I want to keep it.

271
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,140
Just go light it.

272
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,860
If you run out, I'll buy you a new one.

273
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,340
Really?

274
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,980
Yes.

275
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,780
What should we do after lighting it?

276
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,220
If it's the first time, you have to cut the wick after one to two hours

277
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,820
and let the smell spread.

278
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,140
Then close your eyes slowly.

279
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,860
Okay.

280
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,740
I lit it.

281
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,900
The wick is done.

282
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,569
I lay down. And?

283
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,980
If you lie down, close your eyes. Take a deep breath in

284
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,660
and exhale slowly.

285
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,700
You know, when we work, we may breathe unconsciously fast.

286
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,780
And our body will get tense.

287
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,020
I often did.

288
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,100
If you light a scented candle, it'll make you feel more relaxed.

289
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,460
Yes.

290
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,620
I want to talk to you like this every day.

291
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,940
It's good to have a headache.

292
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,420
How is that good?

293
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,900
Because you'll worry about me.

294
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,380
I'm just worried that no one will pay me if you die.

295
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,540
Hey.

296
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,220
Do you smell it? Does it smell good?

297
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,530
Yes.

298
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,420
I smell it.

299
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,100
It's really relaxing.

300
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,580
Yes.

301
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,900
If you still don't feel better, just use your index finger 
to press your eyebrows.

302
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,740
I tried. It's very useful.

303
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,860
Index finger?

304
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,330
Eyebrows.

305
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,940
Then what?

306
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,980
Press your eyebrows with your index finger.

307
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,180
Then stay for 10 seconds and release slowly.

308
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,780
Press it repeatedly until you feel better.

309
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,500
How is it?

310
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,940
Are you feeling any better?

311
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,300
I'm much better.

312
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,020
See? I told you.

313
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,650
It feels so good.

314
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,100
Vee.

315
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,620
Yes.

316
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,580
Sing me a song.

317
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,660
No.

318
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,740
Please.

319
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,900
Just one song. A verse will do.

320
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,420
I don't know which song to sing.

321
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,980
Just the song you sang before.

322
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,220
Okay? Okay?

323
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,700
Just a verse.

324
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,820
Okay.

325
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:33,340
♫You must be up to something♫

326
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:38,060
♫Work magic with your eyes♫

327
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:43,180
♫Have you thought about the future?♫

328
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,420
♫If I really fall in love with you♫

329
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,220
♫It won't be a game. Just wait and see♫

330
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,210
Oh.

331
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,980
Can you sing it again?

332
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,340
That's it. I can't remember the lyrics.

333
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,220
Why are you quiet?

334
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,020
Are you asleep?

335
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,980
Good night. Get well soon.

336
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,100
Where did I put it?

337
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,660
I remember I bought two sets.

338
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,900
Come to bed and sleep.

339
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,700
That's Vee's, isn't it?

340
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,740
Don't tell me you stole that from your brother.

341
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,210
Oh, this is called borrowing.

342
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,980
Today, I'll give you a massage

343
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,980
as a reward for your help.

344
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,940
Oh, I'm not in pain.

345
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,380
Okay. I've lit candles to create a relaxing atmosphere.

346
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,940
Okay? Let me massage you.

347
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,340
Can you massage?

348
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,540
No, but who am I?

349
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,820
I'm Janus.

350
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,420
The only disciple of Tiktok.

351
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,100
Just watch the video and I'll know how to massage.

352
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,980
-Come on. -Sit tight.

353
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,570
Relax.

354
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,420
-Are you ready? -Yes.

355
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,300
Let's start with the head.

356
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,380
-Don't be shy. -Okay.

357
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,500
Don't feel embarrassed.

358
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,780
One, two, three.

359
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,900
Oh!

360
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,620
Goodness.

361
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,380
What did you do?

362
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,660
Was it too hard?

363
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,740
I'm sorry.

364
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,100
Let me make it up to you.

365
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,660
I'm a bit cocky.

366
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,420
This will help with the pain.

367
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,780
-Carried stuff, right? -Yes.

368
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,060
Are you ready?

369
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,300
-Don't be shy. -Okay.

370
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,660
One, two...

371
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,700
Gosh.

372
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,020
Oh!

373
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,180
I'm sorry.

374
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,980
-Are you okay? -What are you doing?

375
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,300
It hurts.

376
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,580
I'm sorry. I thought it'd make you feel better.

377
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,020
I'm sorry.

378
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,060
Lie down.

379
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,860
I'll show you

380
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,540
what a real massage is.

381
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,180
It is like this.

382
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,820
Lower.

383
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,620
Do you like it?

384
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,780
Yes.

385
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,620
It really relieves stress.

386
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,380
Massage it more.

387
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,460
How about this kind of massage?

388
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,740
Great.

389
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,300
Harder.

390
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,300
Oh.

391
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,740
Oh, right.

392
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,260
This is the doctor's car.

393
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,740
What brings him here so early in the morning?

394
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,620
Did he have a date with Vee?

395
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,460
Vee.

396
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,860
Vee!

397
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,380
Vee.

398
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,100
Vee.

399
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,540
Vee!

400
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,020
Oh, this guy.

401
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,820
Wake up.

402
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,020
Wake up, Vee.

403
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,780
What is it?

404
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,180
Did you forget your date with the doctor?

405
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,700
He parked the car in front of our house early in the morning.

406
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,220
When?

407
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,740
8 a.m.

408
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,980
We made a date at 11.

409
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,660
You must be mistaken.

410
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,020
I'm not. That's definitely your friend, Dr. Sky.

411
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,260
Go down and have a look for yourself.

412
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,460
Go.

413
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,420
Fine, I'll go.

414
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,260
Hurry up.

415
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,380
He has been waiting for you for a long time.

416
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,100
Go.

417
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,460
Why are you here so early?

418
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,900
We're going to have coffee today.

419
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,380
Did you forget?

420
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,340
No, but it's still early in the morning.

421
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,980
No cafe shop will open at this hour.

422
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,900
I'm sorry.

423
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,380
I was on duty all night.

424
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,140
I rushed home from work this morning and took a shower.

425
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,020
I was afraid that I might fall asleep and miss the time,

426
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,580
so I waited for you in front of your house.

427
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,300
I wanted to take you out to celebrate the completion 
of your house decoration.

428
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,260
Did you get some sleep?

429
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,170
A little.

430
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,340
Then... do you want to sleep at my house?

431
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,820
Let's go out for coffee later.

432
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,740
Really?

433
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,100
Or, you can sleep in your car.

434
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,820
It's better to sleep at your house.

435
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,460
Hold on.

436
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,580
Oh.

437
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,700
Come to bed.

438
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,580
Yes.

439
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,260
I'll sleep here.

440
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,940
You take the bed.

441
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,260
No, I completely woke up now.

442
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,500
Because a crazy man parked his car in front of my house.

443
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,740
Who?

444
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,540
Gosh.

445
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,100
-Who is it? -Stop it.

446
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,530
Have some sleep. I'm going to take a shower.

447
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,140
Are you asleep?

448
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,700
Are you really asleep?

449
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,860
How come you fall asleep so quickly?

450
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,620
Oh.

451
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,300
This is Vee's scented candle.

452
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,900
If he finds out that his brother used it,

453
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,020
they'll have another fight.

454
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,980
I should return it.

455
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,420
Hey! What are you doing?

456
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,540
Who did you bring into your room?

457
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,140
A friend. You know him too?

458
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,140
Who?

459
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,820
I don't remember.

460
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,980
Let me see his face.

461
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,460
Hush, he's sleeping.

462
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,060
You can leave now. Don't cause trouble here.

463
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,500
Could it be...

464
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,100
Is it the one about whom Janus gossiped that day?

465
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,620
What gossip?

466
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,180
Why don't I remember?

467
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,820
I'm going to take a shower. Go out.

468
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,180
Okay.

469
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,420
By the way, J made breakfast.

470
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,380
Take your friends downstairs after you take a shower.

471
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,540
Okay.

472
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,660
What's wrong with your eyes? Go now.

473
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,340
Go.

474
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,780
Okay.

475
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,020
Hurry.

476
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,540
Sky, wake up.

477
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,260
Didn't you say it's easy for you to wake up? 
Why are you still asleep?

478
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,260
Are you teasing me?

479
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,260
No.

480
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,260
Mosquito. There was a mosquito just now.

481
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,940
I was worried that you might not sleep well.

482
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,340
Really?

483
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,700
Yes.

484
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,980
Are you pretending to be asleep?

485
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,140
No.

486
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,420
I'm so sleepy.

487
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,860
Can I sleep a little longer?

488
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,460
Eat something first, then you come back here and sleep.

489
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,540
Please.

490
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,580
I'm still sleepy.

491
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,860
Please, let me sleep a little longer.

492
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,180
That's too much.

493
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,020
This is too much.

494
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,100
Okay?

495
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,820
Okay?

496
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,860
A little while longer.

497
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,220
I'm so tired.

498
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,300
What's there to eat downstairs?

499
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,620
I don't know.

500
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,660
But J made something

501
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,450
waiting for you to eat.

502
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,100
Really?

503
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,900
Okay.

504
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,060
Let's go eat.

505
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,220
Are you okay?

506
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,260
Yes.

507
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,300
I just didn't expect to have another chance like this.

508
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,660
But if you don't let go of my hand,

509
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,740
you won't get another chance.

510
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,700
-Okay. -Get up.

511
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,540
Please help me up. I'm weak.

512
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:57,980
Okay?

513
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,410
Help me up first.

514
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,660
Oh.

515
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,260
Where is the mosquito? I see no mosquitoes.

516
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,900
There are bed bugs too.

517
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,980
You just made that up, right?

518
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,380
Oh.

519
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,380
Oh!

520
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,700
Ouch!

521
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,580
Oh.

522
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,460
What's wrong?

523
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,380
-Oh. -Are you okay?

524
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,020
Are you worried about me?

525
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,940
If it had been before, I'd have been worried about you.

526
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,020
But now...

527
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,300
You deserve it.

528
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,340
Stop trampling on my heart.

529
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,260
Ouch.

530
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,179
Can you step on my back?

531
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,620
It hurts.

532
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,500
Oh.

533
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,460
No, I don't know how.

534
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,420
It's not hard at all.

535
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,659
Just step on my back. That's all.

536
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,699
Okay?

537
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,580
Vee.

538
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,980
Help me.

539
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,780
I don't know what's going on here.

540
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,020
Here...

541
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,940
Here too.

542
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,659
Two places.

543
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:59,140
Here and here.

544
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,540
Vee.

545
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,300
It hurts.

546
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,820
Here hurts too.

547
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,020
Please?

548
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,260
Vee.

549
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,700
Please help me.

550
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,980
Please.

551
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,530
Give me a massage.

552
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,860
Here.

553
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,060
Yes.

554
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,180
Massage it.

555
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,300
Gosh!

556
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,220
Be gentle.

557
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,180
Vee.

558
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,380
I can't take it anymore.

559
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,700
My whole body hurts.

560
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,940
Vee.

561
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,620
Help me.

562
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,500
Hurry up.

563
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,580
Orange.

564
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,940
Your turn.

565
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,180
Red.

566
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,540
Be careful.

567
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,660
-Oh. -Be gentle.

568
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,340
Be gentle.

569
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,740
Stop talking!

570
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,700
Oh. The seventh one is coming out.

571
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,220
-Ah... -Ah...

572
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,140
Ah...

573
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,740
-Ah... -Be gentle.

574
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,980
Oh, it's coming out.

575
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,020
It's coming out.

576
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,620
-It’s happening. -Be careful.

577
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,220
Oh, it's coming out.

578
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,500
It's happening.

579
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,300
Oh!

580
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,300
Yes!

581
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,380
Here.

582
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,100
Place the order! Sailor Moon's outfit.

583
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,700
What the hell was I doing?

584
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,490
Give it to me now.

585
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,460
Here.

586
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,820
So cute.

587
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,940
You have to wear it since I've already made the order.

588
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,900
Uh.

589
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,780
I can transform again.

590
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,220
I'm choosing carefully for you.

591
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,100
Baby.

592
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,140
Yes?

593
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,060
Can we play it again?

594
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:09,140
If I win, you have to buy the costume for the masquerade ball.

595
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,220
Are we really gonna do that?

596
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,140
Okay. Come on.

597
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,730
I will represent the moon

598
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,090
and annihilate you.

599
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,140
You will definitely be hit.

600
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,340
Come on.

601
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,900
-Come on. Line them up. -Line them up.

602
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,300
Let's practice first.

603
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,980
Oh.

604
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,540
What's wrong? Does it hurt?

605
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,540
No.

606
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,300
You just hit my pressure point.

607
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,620
Oh.

608
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,220
Oh.

609
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,620
What the hell?

610
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,060
This is not a massage at all.

611
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,660
This is abuse.

612
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,220
I thought you liked to scream.

613
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,060
It hurts.

614
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,540
Uh.

615
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:15,490
Can you massage me like you taught me that night?

616
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,940
Then just do it yourself. I've already taught you, haven't I?

617
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,620
No.

618
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,180
It's different.

619
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,220
Please.

620
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,260
Give me a massage.

621
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,300
Are you having a headache?

622
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,460
Yes.

623
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,500
A little.

624
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,770
It might be because I've been sleeping less lately.

625
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,740
Here, sleep here.

626
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,860
It's nice.

627
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,380
Oh.

628
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,820
Be gentle.

629
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,140
That's it.

630
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,260
So comfortable.

631
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,940
Why didn't you do it properly like this

632
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,980
when you were massaging my back?

633
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,900
That's the best I can do. If you don't shut up,

634
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,970
I won't massage you anymore.

635
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:27,020
I'm just kidding. Keep going.

636
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,620
Are you satisfied?

637
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,540
three more minutes, please.

638
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,700
Okay?

639
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,420
I think we can go to the cafe another day.

640
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,810
You look tired today.

641
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,980
Besides, your back and head hurt. Go home and rest.

642
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,700
No.

643
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,020
I'm not tired.

644
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,500
I'm not tired anymore.

645
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,410
Really?

646
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,020
Yes.

647
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,380
Let's go today.

648
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,180
You won't go with me if we go another day.

649
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,580
But you look tired.

650
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,700
I'm not.

651
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,220
Really.

652
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,540
Come on. Get up. Let's go together.

653
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,620
Let's go.

654
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,020
You are as willful as ever.

655
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,580
I know I'm willful.

656
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,540
Ever since the day we argued,

657
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,300
every night, I've been thinking,

658
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,460
have I been too willful with you?

659
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,020
I'm sorry.

660
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,380
Why are you apologizing?

661
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,580
You've been willful for a long time.

662
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,580
I don't know if I ever apologized to you.

663
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,540
I'm sorry.

664
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:21,540
For being too hasty in expressing my feelings back then.

665
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,420
And for what happened that night

666
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,660
when I confessed to you, and it led to an argument.

667
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,980
Well, it's okay.

668
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,100
I want to apologize to you as well.

669
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,780
That day, I just wanted to force my emotions onto you.

670
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,540
But it turned out you didn't feel the same way.

671
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,260
And I got angry.

672
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,380
So, I blocked all your contacts.

673
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,380
You probably felt bad too that day.

674
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,180
And it was not your fault.

675
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,620
But it was really tough back then.

676
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,420
If I didn't do that,

677
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:25,140
I couldn't have mustered the determination to leave you.

678
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,300
Vee.

679
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,500
Honestly, you didn't do anything wrong,

680
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,620
it was my fault.

681
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,220
I was confused about my own feelings back then.

682
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,620
I really didn't know what I wanted.

683
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,940
But now,

684
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,860
can you give me another chance

685
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,660
to take our relationship to the next level?

686
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,580
Okay?

687
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,060
You don't have to answer me now.

688
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,620
I'll wait to hear your response

689
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,380
on the day you're truly ready.

690
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,180
Is the cafe far?

691
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,220
No.

692
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,180
It's only 15 minutes away from here.

693
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,700
Then let's go.

694
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,380
I happen to be in the mood for coffee.

695
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,980
Really?

696
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,460
We can go.

697
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,100
Let me first put away the mattress.

698
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,860
Okay?

699
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,060
Get up.

700
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,460
Oh.

701
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,500
Oh.

702
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,460
Let's go.

703
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,220
Baby, you bought too much.

704
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,700
I don't think so.

705
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,860
I always buy this much.

706
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,700
It's too much today. We can't finish them all.

707
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,940
You can share it with others.

708
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,260
In case you want to share it with your friends.

709
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,100
When someone asks, just say

710
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,260
it was bought by your lovely boyfriend, alright?

711
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,900
Baby, you know what?

712
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,940
When a doctor receives a lot of food,

713
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,820
many medical cases will soon follow.

714
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,860
Really?

715
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,250
If that's the case, no one would want to share with him.

716
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,940
Yeah, no one would help him.

717
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,100
Really? I never knew.

718
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:21,860
Then...

719
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,180
Just share it with familiar patients,

720
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,690
like...

721
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,370
giving some encouragement to the patients.

722
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,420
Well, that's a good idea.

723
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,500
What's going on?

724
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,820
So cute.

725
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,820
Then give me a kiss on my cheek.

726
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,500
Here? We're in front of the hospital.

727
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:40,460
Can't we kiss at home?

728
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,420
What do you mean going home? Baby, have you forgotten

729
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,020
I'm going to take a look at work tonight.

730
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,460
I have to pack up once I go home.

731
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,900
Well.

732
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,620
Come on.

733
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,020
That's great that you're willing to do it.

734
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,820
I'm going back to work now.

735
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,580
Have a safe trip.

736
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,340
Bye.

737
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,140
Bye.

738
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,860
I'll take these.

739
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,580
-Take them all. -Okay.

740
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,380
And fried chicken.

741
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,420
No, thanks.

742
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,460
Bye.

743
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,850
Bye.

744
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,620
I forgot to tell you something important.

745
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,300
That's why I came all the way here.

746
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,100
Hey, Tong.

747
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:40,580
Why did we incur losses this month?

748
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,140
What are you doing?

749
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,180
You look so nervous.

750
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,340
You scared me.

751
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,020
Why are you so shocked?

752
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,500
Well...

753
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,060
I was concentrating.

754
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,700
Concentrating on what?

755
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:03,220
Well...

756
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,660
Profit, the store's profit.

757
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,660
Is there a problem?

758
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,220
You look weird today.

759
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,980
Huh...

760
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,780
No, it's nothing. I'm just wondering why it's so hot here.

761
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,260
I'm going to sit somewhere cool.

762
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,650
[Credit: Turning the house into money]

763
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:29,820
Hey, Bomb.

764
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,700
I'm going to the store.

765
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:38,780
Okay.

766
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,140
Oh.

767
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,940
Look at the crab dumplings.

768
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,980
Hey, what did they call it?

769
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,180
-Crab meat soup. -Oh, crab meat soup.

770
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,420
Okay.

771
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,220
This cake looks delicious too.

772
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,340
Wow, it's beautiful here.

773
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:40,820
The atmosphere is nice and they have your favorite Thai food.

774
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,100
Yes. I didn't know there was such a nice cafe nearby.

775
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,420
And it's shade and quiet.

776
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,020
It's not crowded here either.

777
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,500
Do you like it?

778
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,220
Yes.

779
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,300
The decoration is beautiful too.

780
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,740
It's comfortable like home and refreshing.

781
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,340
The food is delicious too.

782
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,300
Hey, you know what? This is the charm of Thai cuisine.

783
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,700
It offers a wide range of flavors, is exquisite, and refined.

784
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,220
It's also visually appealing, like 'food' for the eyes.

785
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,700
I think I'll come again.

786
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,700
I'm so happy that you like this place.

787
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,460
When I go to a place and discover something good,

788
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,340
I always think of you, you know?

789
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,940
When I taste delicious food, I also want to bring you to try it together.

790
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,740
I want to know if you like it, what expression you'd have,

791
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:33,260
how you'd rate it, and what comments you'd make,

792
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,620
What kind of face would you make.

793
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,660
When you really like something,

794
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,100
you'd have this expression.

795
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,380
But if you just find it okay, you'd do this.

796
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,300
If it's just okay

797
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,540
and not your favorite, you'd have this expression.

798
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,700
But if you think it's not tasty and don't like it,

799
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,980
you'd put on a poker face and wouldn't say much

800
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,420
because you're afraid of hurting someone's feelings.

801
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,100
Would I really have that kind of expression?

802
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,460
Yes.

803
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,700
So, what expression am I wearing right now?

804
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,580
A happy smiling face.

805
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,020
Do you know why?

806
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,300
Why?

807
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,700
Because the cafe is pretty.

808
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,980
And the food is delicious, right?

809
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:31,980
No, because...

810
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,380
I'm here.

811
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,100
You're talking nonsense again.

812
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,980
I'm not.

813
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:43,180
You can eat now.

814
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,540
The food will get cold.

815
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,900
What?

816
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,780
Shouldn't we encourage each other?

817
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,980
Eat up.

818
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,500
I'm angry.

819
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,060
It won't take long.

820
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,860
Great.

821
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,540
If you get angry on your own, you should cool down on your own.

822
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:08,460
Well, I'm going for a walk to take photos and collect some materials.

823
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,100
Let's go together.

824
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,700
Are you still angry?

825
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,340
Yes.

826
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,420
But I want to stick to you.

827
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,500
Let's go.

828
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,060
Where should we start?

829
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,940
Take a photo of us first.

830
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:25,940
The best material.

831
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,940
No.

832
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,500
Let's go. Over there.

833
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,940
Get up.

834
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,380
Goodness.

835
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,820
What are you looking at?

836
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,780
I know you were peeking.

837
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,580
Do you like me?

838
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,980
What are you looking at? Get out.

839
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,260
I got goosebumps.

840
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,740
Stop pretending. What goosebumps?

841
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,340
Just tell me if you like me.

842
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,860
Are you shy? Why are you blushing?

843
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,180
It's hot. There's nothing to be shy about.

844
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,140
Are you really not shy?

845
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,980
No.

846
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,100
Are you not shy at all?

847
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,540
Have some water.

848
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,740
You must be thirsty.

849
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,300
I'm really thirsty.

850
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,940
You know me so well.

851
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,420
Crazy.

852
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:40,820
Yes.

853
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,690
I'm crazy in love with you.

854
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,180
Hey.

855
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,340
Is it that bad?

856
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,540
Hey, have some cake.

857
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:52,140
They said the cake here is delicious.

858
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,580
I'll cut it for you.

859
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,340
Coconut cake.

860
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,100
Do you want cream?

861
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,520
That's enough.

862
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,170
Try it.

863
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,500
It's all over your mouth.

864
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,300
Ah.

865
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,980
Why are you eating like a kid?

866
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,620
Let's come here together next time.

867
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:27,940
Sure.

868
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,100
The cake here is delicious.

869
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,220
Was last night's shift difficult?

870
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,100
Yes.

871
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,060
I encountered some really challenging cases.

872
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,340
I managed to catch a few hours of sleep around 1 am,

873
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,860
and then I was busy the entire night.

874
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:52,100
There were cases of asthma, septic shock,

875
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,540
septic shock due to blood infections,

876
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,020
arrhythmias,

877
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:02,860
and diabetic ketoacidosis with significantly elevated blood acidity in three patients.

878
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,900
With such a demanding job, why did you choose to become a doctor?

879
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,700
Well...

880
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,220
I didn't realize it would be this exhausting when I was studying.

881
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:18,300
When your internship is over, what kind of doctor do you want to be?

882
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,660
Well...

883
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:23,260
I think I want to become a pediatrician.

884
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,900
Yes.

885
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,900
It seems like a good fit for you.

886
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,580
Kids would like you.

887
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,460
Yes.

888
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,420
What about you?

889
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,700
Do you like me?

890
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,020
Oh.

891
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,860
Hey, put this away.

892
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,420
Are you choked?

893
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,580
Huh?

894
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,900
Are we going back?

895
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,140
There's going to be traffic later.

896
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,340
Okay.

897
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,780
We haven't finished yet. Can we take it to-go?

898
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,130
Let's take it to-go.

899
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:58,140
Okay.

900
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,460
Let's go in and tell them we're going back.

901
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,140
-Let's go. -Let's go.

902
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,220
Please.

903
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,820
I had fun today.

904
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,260
Thank you for hanging out with me.

905
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:25,900
And thank you for taking me to eat delicious food and dessert today.

906
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,540
You're welcome.

907
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,100
Go home.

908
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,940
Good night.

909
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,100
Is there anything wrong?

910
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,020
You look tired. Are you okay?

911
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,620
I'm fine.

912
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,300
I'm just sleepy.

913
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,180
Come to my house and rest.

914
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:03,180
You can go back once you're no longer sleepy.

915
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,020
Okay.

916
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,580
You suddenly became very energetic.

917
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:17,100
Yawn.

918
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,050
I'm sleepy.

919
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:21,500
Let's go in together.

920
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,100
I can't hold on anymore.

921
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,140
I'm so sleepy.

922
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,700
I'm about to fall asleep.

923
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,100
-Hurry. -Let's go.

924
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,380
Take me with you.

925
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,220
No.

926
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,500
Here.

927
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:53,100
Go take a shower. I'll go downstairs to shower.

928
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:56,020
Are you not joining me?

929
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:59,940
If you have the energy to spare, you can head home.

930
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:05,020
I'm too exhausted, and about to fall asleep.

931
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,900
Well, go take your shower soon. You'll feel refreshed afterward.

932
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,340
Okay.

933
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,300
I'm going to take a shower.

934
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,780
Cute pants.

935
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,940
Vee, are you asleep?

936
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,580
I'm not sleepy. Why?

937
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,140
What's wrong with you? Why aren't you sleeping?

938
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,380
I want to talk to you.

939
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,260
We've been talking all day, haven't we?

940
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,300
Do you know

941
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:12,740
why I decided to buy that house?

942
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,060
You mean the one you're living in now?

943
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:17,980
Yes.

944
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,220
Isn't that your relative's house?

945
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,700
No.

946
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,540
It's a house my mom's friend was renting out,

947
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:31,140
and then she moved abroad.

948
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,740
What?

949
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:33,940
Sky.

950
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:37,690
It's not funny at all. When did you buy it?

951
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,220
When I met you.

952
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,540
What's gotten into you, Sky?

953
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,930
This is a big deal.

954
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,660
You...

955
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,940
Don't get angry.

956
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,340
I'm not angry. I just think you didn't have to do this.

957
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:00,060
Did you buy the house to chase me or to apologize?

958
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,420
Chasing you is a part of it.

959
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,660
But I've made up my mind.

960
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:11,140
If you plan to permanently move here,

961
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:14,300
I might work here long-term

962
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:18,260
and open a small clinic in the future with this house.

963
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,780
But you won't feel uncomfortable, will you?

964
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:24,580
I know

965
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,500
I've been too willful,

966
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,020
and sometimes I didn't care about your feelings.

967
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:36,930
But I want to tell you that I intend to buy this house,

968
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:42,580
not to force you to rekindle your feelings for me.

969
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,940
Just like I told you before,

970
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,260
I can wait.

971
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,460
If you're not ready, it's okay.

972
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,660
As long as you don't feel uncomfortable.

973
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:28,860
I don't feel uncomfortable. I'm just surprised.

974
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:35,700
As long as you don't feel uncomfortable, I'm happy.

975
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:38,380
Thank you.

976
01:01:56,860 --> 01:02:00,060
Thank you for letting me know

977
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:03,260
that I have a place in your future.

978
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,140
Who is calling?

979
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,580
Hello, what's up?

980
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,020
Open the door for me.

981
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:43,380
Your other brother

982
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,980
doesn't even know where the key is.

983
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:45,980
Did he lose the key again?

984
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:46,740
Yes.

985
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:48,580
Uh.

986
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:49,620
Okay.

987
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,340
I'll wait in front of the house.

988
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,300
Okay.

989
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,540
Remember to bring the key next time.

990
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,500
Okay.

991
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,580
Don't just say it, do it.

992
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:16,060
I just forgot.

993
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,220
Sir, this way please.

994
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,700
I don't know what happened to Bomb.

995
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,820
I gave him the key, but he was unwilling to take it.

996
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,140
Okay.

997
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,860
Remember to bring your key next time.

998
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:33,380
Okay.

999
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,220
What are you arguing about?

1000
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:39,220
Bomb doesn't want to bring the key.

1001
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:43,340
I'm sorry. I forgot to bring the key from home.

1002
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:47,660
And if Vee weren't at home today, who would come downstairs to open the door?

1003
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:49,660
Okay.

1004
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,380
I'll go get ten duplicate keys made, and then you can go find a place to hide them.

1005
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,820
Don't fight.

1006
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,060
I'm sorry.

1007
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:59,460
We all forget things sometimes. You've forgotten things too.

1008
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:01,940
Let's go. Let's take a shower and calm down.

1009
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:02,780
Okay.

1010
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,180
Wait.

1011
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,620
I saw Doctor's car parked in front of our house.

1012
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,020
Why has he been coming so often recently?

1013
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:11,300
Well...

1014
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,420
To look at the design plans.

1015
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,810
To look at the design plans.

1016
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,100
You said you just finished.

1017
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:27,980
Let's go take a shower. You need to find the documents, right?

1018
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,420
Don't let me find out that you're secretly

1019
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,300
hiding something with Doctor and not willing to tell me.

1020
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,260
No. Are you crazy?

1021
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,490
I didn't say that...

1022
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,420
Well,

1023
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,620
I mean, if you two are secretly together and don't want to tell me,

1024
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,690
I'm sure I'll throw a fit.

1025
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:48,020
Just go.

1026
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:50,740
Let's go take a shower.

1027
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,660
Let's go.

1028
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,620
Am I right? Am I right?

1029
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:54,660
Just go.

1030
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:01,700
What document are you looking for? I'll help you.

1031
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:04,330
He said it's a very important document, in a folder.

1032
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:06,140
But he doesn't know which folder.

1033
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,980
I think it might be in the cabinet.

1034
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,140
Well, okay, help me find it. Let's go.

1035
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:51,980
How long did I sleep?

1036
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,690
Did you find it, Vee?

1037
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,420
No, Brother.

1038
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,500
Hasn't J finished taking a shower yet?

1039
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,740
Well, it's been a long time.

1040
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:38,820
He didn't even find a proper place to keep important documents.

1041
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:41,860
Every time he needs it, he has to come and look for it.

1042
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:44,820
Hey, try looking over there.

1043
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,860
J.

1044
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,260
Hey, Vee, can you take a look at this envelope? What kind of document is it?

1045
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:02,780
It looks like an insurance document, judging by this envelope.

1046
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:09,060
Isn't it?

1047
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,100
Do you think it would be on this?

1048
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:18,770
Well, I don't know. Look around.

1049
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,460
I'll search above,

1050
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:22,940
and you search below.

1051
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,780
Sure, no problem.

1052
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,020
Hey.

1053
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,140
Oh.

1054
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:31,580
Ah...

1055
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,020
Are you okay?

1056
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:35,420
My head is buzzing.

1057
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:36,900
But I'm fine.

1058
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:39,020
Are you okay?

1059
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:40,860
Your head isn't injured, is it?

1060
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,740
I'm fine.

1061
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,820
That's good.

1062
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,980
Fortunately, you weren't hit by the book spine.

1063
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:52,620
By the way, did you get hit?

1064
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,460
Where? Let me see.

1065
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,100
Are you really okay?

1066
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:02,250
I'm fine. I was just shocked.

1067
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,860
That's good to hear.

1068
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,300
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

1069
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,900
Doctor, have you seen Bomb before?

1070
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,460
Bomb.

1071
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,300
There.

1072
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,380
Oh.

1073
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:16,380
He looks familiar.

1074
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:17,939
I think I've seen him at the store.

1075
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:19,689
You met him before.

1076
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:22,899
Bomb was Vee's senior.

1077
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:27,420
He's been chasing after Vee since high school.

1078
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,899
You're here. You finally showed up.

1079
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,540
What took you so long?

1080
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:36,260
I just finished showering.

1081
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,170
Why are you so good at complaining?

1082
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,660
What were you whispering about?

1083
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:44,620
Hello.

1084
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,500
Finally, I get to see you in person.

1085
01:08:49,899 --> 01:08:52,020
We're all here.

1086
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,939
I'm sorry to bother you today.

1087
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,660
You are not bothering us, Doctor.

1088
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:00,979
Doctor, have you eaten?

1089
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,220
It's getting a bit late.

1090
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,060
I'll head back for now.

1091
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,380
I have a lot of cases to check tomorrow.

1092
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:11,899
Okay.

1093
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:13,779
I'm leaving.

1094
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:14,580
Okay.

1095
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:18,100
Be careful on your way home.

1096
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:19,970
Tell me when you arrive.

1097
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,220
Good night.

1098
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,130
I'll send you off.

1099
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,939
It's okay.

1100
01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:33,500
Stay with your brothers.

1101
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:40,700
Doctor, don't forget to lock the fence.

1102
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,939
J.

1103
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,220
What?

1104
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,220
What were you just saying to him?

1105
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:53,260
I just said, "Doctor, don't forget to lock the fence."

1106
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,780
No.

1107
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:56,100
What were you whispering to him?

1108
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,860
Tell me now.

1109
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,100
Well.

1110
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,780
What were you talking about while standing?

1111
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:04,620
I just told Doctor, "Bomb was Vee's senior."

1112
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,740
"He's been chasing after Vee since high school, Doctor."

1113
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,220
Really?

1114
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,380
Yes.

1115
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:14,700
Did you tell Doctor that his brother was also pursuing me, and eventually, we got together?

1116
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,940
I almost got to say it, but I got interrupted.

1117
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:19,940
What a pity.

1118
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:23,620
Hey, you shouldn't have said that. That was a long time ago.

1119
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,660
