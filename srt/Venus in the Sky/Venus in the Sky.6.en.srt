What are you doing here so early in the morning?

What brought you here?

12
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,220
And why did you park the car in front of my house?

13
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,620
J woke me up.

It looks like you can't hold on.

39
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,660
Why do you have to come to me every morning?

40
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,300
Because I miss you.

41
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,740
It sounds disgusting.

42
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,380

OK.

46
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,540
But you should take care of yourself.

What?

No, I don't want.

62
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,940
You asked me out for dinner as soon as we met.

63
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,740
I gained weight.

64
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,659
We can talk about the design of the house.

65

Go with me, please.

OK.

78

What?

79
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,179
I'm not free tomorrow.

80
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,820
You can eat at the eatery nearby.

81
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,420
Damn you!

82
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,820
You didn't answer the question.

83
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,700
What?

84
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,220
What did you ask me?

85
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,820
Forget it.

86
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,060
Why aren't you free? Are you on duty?

87
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,940
I'm going to eat with Vee.

88
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
Wow.

89
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,220
Is Vee willing to talk to you?

90
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,180
Hmm.

91
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,540
Yes.

92
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,540
I am

93
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,780
marvelous Dr. Fahklai.

94
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,900
Do you remember that?

95
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,420
Hey.

96
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,500
What are you bragging about? Just a meal.

97
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,780
Enjoy your meal.

98
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,540
Congratulations.

99
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,540
OK.

100
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,140
By the way,

101
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,020
why do you always eat with me these days?

102
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,140
Did you argue with Tong?

103
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,820
Sometimes.

104
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,620
He has been busy recently.

105
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,140
We didn't have to stay together.

106
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,460
I have many patients to treat

107
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,700
and need to do surgery in the operating room.

108
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,780
Well,

109
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,620
then why did you argue?

110
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,300
I want Tong to stop.

111
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,300
He doesn't have to call me if he's busy.

112
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,780
I don't want him to strive to see me.

113
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,620
I am unwilling to see him so tired.

114
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,300
Think about it.

115
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,500
He needs a two-hour drive to see me.

116
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,740
I told him it was dangerous.

117
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,540
But he never listened to me.

118
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,580
We've been dating for five years. I thought he could understand me.

119
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,780
Instead, he got mad at me.

120
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,620
Calm down.

121
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,020
I think you need to talk.

122
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,180
You might be afraid that he's tired.

123
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,420
But Tong wants to see you.

124
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,460
Isn't it because

125
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,860
you're too tired to talk to him?

126
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,900
I think Tong is very understanding and kind.

127
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,420
Everyone says you are lucky

128
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,420
to have a boyfriend like Tong who understands the hardship of being a doctor.

129
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,100
You've been dating for five years.

130
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,580
But the time you spent with him was much less than

131
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,250
other couples.

132
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,620
Yes.

133
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,460
You're right.

134
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,060
Gaining a little bit of love,

135
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,660
you come to lecture me, huh?

136
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,780
Where's the pathetic Sky.

137
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,380
Dude,

138
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,700
Vee has no feelings for me. Boo-hoo.

139
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,930
Hmm.

140
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,410
Who?

141
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,820
Who are you talking about?

142
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,020
Is it you?

143
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,500
You?

144
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,130
Or you?

145
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,460
Oh.

146
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,980
Poor thing.

147
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,260
OK.

148
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,780
At least you told Venus how you feel.

149
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,540
But Vee has no feelings for me anymore.

150
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,780
He even refuses to be my friend now.

151
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,260
If you really like Venus,

152
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,180
you don't have to approach him as a friend.

153
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,100
What should I do?

154
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,020
I can't lose Venus.

155
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,540
Wipe your tears first.

156
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,780
It uses up. I'll get more.

157
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,500
I won't tell you anything next time.

158
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,140
Gosh.

159
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,300
I'm so embarrassed.

160
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,060
Eat up.

161
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,420
I'm going back to write medical records.

162
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,060
No.

163
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,700
I want one more.

164
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,580
Hold the table for me.

165
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,700
Hello.

166
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,740
Are you free?

167
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,580
Why? I'm free.

168
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,220
I have something to discuss with you.

169
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,140
What is it?

170
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,100
Since I told Tonkla not to call me,

171
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,340
I think my boyfriend is missing.

172
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,020
I texted him, but it was too late when he replied.

173
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,620
Is he tired of me?

174
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,300
No. He loves you so much.

175
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,220
He must be busy.

176
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,060
Sometimes, I did't reply to your messages either.

177
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,460
You're my friend, but he's my boyfriend.

178
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,660
We have little time to meet each other.

179
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,700
I don't want to be distant from him.

180
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,220
Why doesn't he understand me?

181
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,340
Is it because he's too tired?

182
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,180
I've seen doctors working.

183
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,700
It's complicated.

184
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,220
Calm down.

185
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,980
You've been busy lately.

186
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,740
He might want you to focus on work.

187
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,300
Well, work

188
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,500
is really tired.

189
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,900
You know what?

190
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,140
My boss keeps getting me promoted.

191
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,540
Do you know why?

192
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,650
Because others resigned.

193
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,580
Now, the company

194
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,580
has many big clients.

195
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,380
It's not just about the apartment design

196
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,900
you don't like.

197
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,780
Are you really not coming back to work?

198
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,460
Go back to work?

199
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,540
I don't want to.

200
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,260
I won't go back on my word.

201
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,380
OK.

202
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,380
You're so stubborn.

203
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,620
If there's any interesting project,

204
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,940
I'll tell you.

205
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,020
OK.

206
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,900
I'm worried about you, Tong.

207
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,340
Don't let work affect your relationship.

208
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,820
Take it easy.

209
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,380
OK.

210
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,140
Thank you.

211
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,140
See you later.

212
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,300
Good luck.

213
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,940
Call me if you need any help.

214
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,940
OK.

215
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,260
Bye.

216
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,580
Where are you?

217
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,060
Are you done? It's too late.

218
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,860
Hey, did you see my favorite clothes?

219
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,980
It's in the closet.

220
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,020
I searched everywhere,

221
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,980
but couldn't find it.

222
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,500
Wear whatever you like.

223
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,060
I'll wait for you downstairs.

224
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,620
Go down quickly.

225
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,820
OK.

226
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,260
Where is it?

227
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,540
I remember I put it here.

228
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,700
Male massager.

229
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,980
Relax massager.

230
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,780
Wow, so many.

231
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,980
56 57 58

232
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,340
Thai, European size.

233
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,700
What did you buy?

234
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,420
I don't know. It's Vee's.

235
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,940
-Vee's? -Yes.

236
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,020
It's a stick.

237
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,420
Hey, don't open your brother's stuff.

238
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,220
Whatever.

239
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,660
Hey, it's mine.

240
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,900
Hmm.

241
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,140
Give it to me.

242
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,900
Ah.

243
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,380
Wait.

244
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,339
My clothes.

245
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,339
Yes, borrow me for a moment.

246
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,220
It smells like

247
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,540
the new perfume I bought recently.

248
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,180
I haven't used it yet.

249
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,740
-My new perfume. -Hey, where are you going?

250
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,260
I haven't used it yet.

251
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,580
Come here.

252
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,260
What's wrong with you?

253
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,100
I haven't even used the new perfume yet.

254
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,380
Let your brother use it first.

255
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,780
Oh.

256
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,220
Why are you dressed so nicely today?

257
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,780
Just so-so.

258
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,380
Really?

259
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,540
I thought you dressed up to see me.

260
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,300
So cute.

261
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,220
I'm not!

262
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,140
By the way, did you wait long?

263
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,220
I was called to write the transfer list.

264
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,130
I just arrived.

265
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,820
That's a relief.

266
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,060
Before we talk about the house,

267
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,460
can we order something to eat?

268
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,540
I haven't eaten anything since noon.

269
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,700
I'm hungry.

270
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,300
All the patients today were seriously ill,

271
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,140
and none of my juniors were here.

272
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,780
Then why did you ask me out today?

273
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,060
Because you wanted to finish it quickly.

274
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,260
It's not that urgent.

275
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,580
By the way, do you know what happened to Tonkla and Pai Tong?

276
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,740
What happened?

277
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,380
I think they had a fight.

278
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,380
Eh,

279
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,660
well, I know a little.

280
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,020
But they'll clear up the misunderstanding soon.

281
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,980
Don't worry about them. They've been dating for so long.

282
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,420
They won't break up anyway.

283
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,500
Yes.

284
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,380
If they break up,

285
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,860
it's a pity that they were together for so long.

286
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,700
Kla loves Pai Tong so much.

287
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,940
He won't break up with him.

288
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,020
Mind our own business.

289
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,500
What?

290
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,460
No, I don't care.

291
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,370
Alas, Vee.

292
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,220
I'm tired.

293
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,020
Ouch!

294
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,980
What do you want?

295
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,700
Rice noodles.

296
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,980
Where is it?

297
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,980
There are so many goods in 7-11.

298
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,410
There are clothes.

299
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,740
It's my babe's favorite food.

300
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,100
Crispy jerky.

301
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,580
Take two each.

302
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,660
And this.

303
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,260
Two.

304
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,020
It should be enough.

305
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,220
It looks delicious, too.

306
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,140
Why didn't he up?

307
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,900
Hasn't he got off work yet?

308
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,060
Hey, babe. Where are you?

309
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,500
I've been waiting for you for almost an hour.

310
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,180
Honey, I'm sorry. I was going down to find you.

311
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,220
OK.

312
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,060
Babe, are you tired?

313
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,180
Very tired.

314
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,420
I bought you snacks.

315
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,300
Here.

316
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,940
I don't have time to eat snacks.

317
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,340
I just finished my rounds

318
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,740
and have to go back to work.

319
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,450
What about the restaurant I booked?

320
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,620
Not today. Let's eat in that restaurant another day.

321
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,140
You said we could date today,

322
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,860
because you are not on duty.

323
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,580
I'm sorry, but I can't do it today.

324
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,900
Go back, please.

325
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,540
After I finish my work, we can look for something to eat.

326
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,380
You're always like this.

327
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,220
You should've told me first.

328
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,700
I'm sorry. I'm really busy today.

329
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,060
I'm busy, too.

330
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,700
Can't you call or text me in advance?

331
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
I'm sorry.

332
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,780
Hello?

333
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,180
OK, I'll go upstairs later.

334
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,980
Honey, wait for me at home.

335
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,380
Let's talk after I finish my work.

336
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,050
Why is it different?

337
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,700
Did I fill it wrong?

338
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,060
You're working as soon as you came back.

339
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,260
Yes.

340
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,500
Why do you look so upset?

341
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,060
About the accounts,

342
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,500
I don't know why these cannot match.

343
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,940
Do you want to take a break and have a cup of coffee?

344
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,420
I'll make it for you.

345
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,700
Thank you, honey.

346
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,380
Put it there.

347
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,980
Ah.

348
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,380
Bomb.

349
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,780
I'm sorry. Can you clean it with a rag?

350
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,180
OK.

351
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,020
Hurry up. It's all dirty.

352
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,900
Wipe it. Here.

353
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,820
Where did the 30,000 baht go?

354
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,540
This one is OK.

355
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,940
Do you want a reservation?

356
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,780
Yes.

357
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,940
I'll book it for you. What color do you want?

358
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,060
Yellow.

359
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,850
Don't ask for a beating.

360
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,340
Then brown is fine.

361
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,540
Calm down.

362
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,730
Smile.

363
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,300
It's all your fault. You kept playing.

364
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,100
I can't finish it then.

365
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,180
Is this one OK?

366
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,620
Yes.

367
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,300
The one is fine, too.

368
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,740
Let me know if you don't like it. I'll change it for you.

369
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,100
I'll take that one. OK.

370
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,580
Sky, if I decide

371
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,500
and then change it, it's a waste of time.

372
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,660
You want to finish it quickly

373
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,700
because you don't want to see me, right?

374
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,820
Let me know if you don't like it. I'll change it.

375
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,940
That's all for today.

376
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,300
You look tired. Go home and rest.

377
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,860
Bill, please.

378
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,420
Good night.

379
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,940
OK.

380
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,260
I'll go back now.

381
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,460
Sky.

382
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,780
What?

383
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,340
Yes, no.

384
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:34,700
Yes or no?

385
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,220
Here.

386
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,780
I think the smell will help you relax.

387
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,340
Why you give it to me, Venus?

388
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,500
Do you want it or not?

389
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,860
I want it.

390
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,060
It's because you've been busy with work.

391
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,370
Thank you.

392
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,180
I didn't expect you to care about me so much.

393
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,540
Hello, what's up, Tong?

394
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,140
Hello, are you free now?

395
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,500
Come and stay with me.

396
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,300
What's wrong?

397
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,580
When did you two start dating secretly?

398
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,940
You didn't tell me.

399
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,660
Be rational.

400
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,250
I just helped him design his house.

401
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,060
Really?

402
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,620
Yes.

403
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,980
Fierce Horse.

404
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,740
Hiss.

405
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,300
Hiss.

406
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,620
Thank you.

407
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,050
Here.

408
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,660
Why do you order this?

409
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,580
The color is so scary.

410
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,620
This is the specialty of this restaurant.

411
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,660
Fierce Horse.

412
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,660
It's fiercer than a horse.

413
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,660
Try it, Sky.

414
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,020
No, thanks.

415
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,940
I'll skip this round.

416
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,860
I drove here.

417
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,340
OK.

418
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,540
I understand.

419
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,340
But Vee,

420
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,940
don't reject me.

421
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,940
Drink with me.

422
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,300
-Here. -Okay.

423
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,860
I'll drink with you.

424
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,500
Cheers.

425
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,860
Eh?

426
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,700
It tastes good.

427
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,860
But it's hot.

428
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,650
It's spicy.

429
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,300
Vee, drink slowly.

430
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,940
Or you'll get drunk.

431
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,540
The purpose of coming here is to get us drunk, Sky.

432
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,580
That's how we release stress.

433
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,460
Here.

434
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,900
You can have the whole dozen. It's sweet.

435
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,060
As for me,

436
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,100
I need something bitter.

437
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,940
Hey, slow down.

438
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,260
You drank so fast. Have you eaten something yet?

439
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
Yes.

440
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,060
Tong, drink slowly, or you'll throw up.

441
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,460
Don't talk too much.

442
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,540
Drink with me.

443
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,740
Drink.

444
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,980
Give it to me.

445
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,100
Sky, you too.

446
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,860
Just one. It's OK.

447
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,780
Well.

448
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,060
Vee, you too.

449
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,980
OK.

450
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,180
It's strong.

451
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,300
That's right.

452
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,420
The taste of wine is

453
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,340
bitter than life.

454
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,980
Tong, calm down.

455
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,540
What's bothering you?

456
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,340
Where's Kla?

457
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,060
I don't want to hear that name.

458
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,220
I think they must have had a fight.

459
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,380
Stop poking his pain. Otherwise, he'll be angry again.

460
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,460
Hey, drink slowly.

461
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,260
Ha.

462
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,100
Vee, you're not drunk yet.

463
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,850
Keep drinking.

464
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,660
Come.

465
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,140
Drink with me.

466
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,220
Drink with me. Hurry up.

467
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,500
Hurry up.

468
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,540
OK, I'll get drunk with you tonight.

469
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,660
Good.

470
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,580
Vee, I don't understand.

471
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,180
Why?

472
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,060
Why do people

473
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,260
always ignore

474
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,420
the closest person to them.

475
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,260
I really hate it.

476
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,300
It's like I'm the only one

477
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,060
that makes efforts to sustain our relationship.

478
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,740
I've made lots of efforts,

479
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,540
because I still have feelings.

480
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,010
I still love him.

481
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,980
Don't you care about me?

482
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,900
[Sky: Your boyfriend is at the store we went to once. Come on. I think they two will get drunk.]

483
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,900
I've gone this far.

484
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,660
But where is he?

485
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:23,260
[Sky: Your boyfriend is at the store we went to once. Come on. I think they two will get drunk.]

486
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,750
Damn it.

487
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,010
What are you singing?

488
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,700
Vee,

489
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,940
let's continue.

490
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,220
Another dozen of wine, two dozen.

491
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,060
Enough.

492
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,700
What?

493
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,760
Cheers. Cheers.

494
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,010
Cheers.

495
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,620
For bitter love.

496
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,660
Cheers! Drink it! Cheers!

497
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
Ah.

498
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,610
I can only describe you in one word.

499
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,100
Lightweight.

500
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,300
Hello, is this the place in the picture?

501
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,340
Thank you.

502
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,300
Are you drunk?

503
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,260
Who's drunk?

504
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,100
You're too lightweight.

505
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,380
Hello, Kla.

506
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,140
Hello, where are you?

507
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,460
Here. See?

508
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,980
-Here. Can you see us? -Yes.

509
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,220
Tong is drunk.

510
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,220
Don't push me.

511
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,620
I'm taking Vee home.

512
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,300
Vee, get up.

513
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,420
Are you drunk, bro?

514
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,980
Who is your bro?

515
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,300
Sky,

516
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,620
thank you for taking care of him.

517
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,660
Alright.

518
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,140
You should solve the problem between you and Tong.

519
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,820
He loves you very much.

520
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,900
I don't want to comfort you again.

521
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,700
I'm leaving.

522
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,580
OK.

523
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,100
Vee, get up.

524
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,260
Go.

525
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,940
Stand up slowly.

526
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,260
Wow,

527
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,420
why are you so drunk?

528
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,210
No, I'm not leaving. No.

529
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,940
I want to sleep here. It's warm.

530
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,100
You can't sleep here.

531
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,140
Go home and sleep.

532
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,540
We're leaving.

533
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,580
You two should have a chat.

534
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,340
Take care.

535
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,340
Tong,

536
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,820
wake up. Let's go home.

537
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,060
What?

538
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,380
Aren't you my babe?

539
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,900
Aren't you...

540
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,740
He's so busy

541
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,660
that he doesn't even have time to call me.

542
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,860
I'm sorry.

543
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,340
We've been together for too long,

544
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,660
and you don't love me anymore?

545
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,300
You don't want to stay with me anymore?

546
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,380
Can't you spend more time with me?

547
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,260
Every time we met,

548
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,860
you complained that you were tired.

549
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,060
I'm tired too.

550
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,380
But I love you.

551
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,900
You used to comfort me

552
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,140
when you complained

553
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,940
how tired you were.

554
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,220
But recently, when we met,

555
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,340
you pushed me to rest

556
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,500
and let me go home.

557
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,900
Does it mean that I am

558
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,580
not attractive to you anymore?

559
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,180
What?

560
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,660
I'm sorry.

561
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,660
I'll reflect on myself.

562
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,580
Vee,

563
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,340
wait.

564
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,220
Can you hold on?

565
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,900
We're home.

566
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,580
I can't stand it. I'm so sleepy.

567
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,580
Vee,

568
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,180
get up.

569
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,260
Don't crash into the gear. It's dangerous.

570
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,140
Sit tight.

571
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,220
Where are you going?

572
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,860
Whose car is it?

573
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,580
Come here.

574
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,900
I told you to drink slowly.

575
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,020
Why did you drink so much?

576
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,060
Ah.

577
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,420
I'm drunk.

578
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,980
But it's better to be drunk than to be in love.

579
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,500
Hey, Venus,

580
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,980
calm down. Calm down.

581
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,460
Your brother will see us later.

582
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,060
I like.

583
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
I like it.

584
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,460
I like this smell.

585
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,420
Where's your key?

586
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,340
Vee.

587
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,060
Key, key is in the bag.

588
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,220
Hey, your brother will notice us. Go inside.

589
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,580
Walk slowly. I can barely hold you up.

590
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,460
Let's go.

591
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,820
Come in.

592
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,780
OK.

593
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,100
Vee,

594
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,260
walk slowly.

595
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,620
Slow down. We're on the bed.

596
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,700
Lie down slowly.

597
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,180
Slowly.

598
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,100
Slowly on the bed.

599
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,380
Ah.

600
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,660
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

601
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,810
Sleep like this.

602
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,490
What?

603
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,380
Hey.

604
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,740
It's too hot. Turn on the air conditioner.

605
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,460
Wait.

606
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:11,890
I'm going back.

607
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,530
Sky,

608
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:15,770
where are you going?

609
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,810
Sleep with me.

610
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,650
That's not a good idea.

611
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,530
It's a good idea.

612
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:22,570
I allow you to do so.

613
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,010
Oh no,

614
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,810
your body is so cold.

615
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,770
I want to take off your clothes.

616
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:35,770
It's hot here.

617
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:37,610
No, Vee,

618
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,090
your brother will see us later.

619
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,650
Vee,

620
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,120
wake up.

621
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,770
Vee,

622
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,130
no!

623
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,330
Let's sleep together

624
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,530
and then go home.

625
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,880
OK.

626
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,850
Don't move.

627
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:43,330
Calm down.

628
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,010
Wait a minute.

629
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,410
Don't tie my hands。

630
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,290
Wait.

631
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:58,250
We're having fun. Don't break free.

632
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,970
Don't move.

633
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,250
OK.

634
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,410
Wait a minute.

635
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,610
You've become a wild horse

636
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,450
from a naughty cat.

637
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,650
You're so tempting.

638
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,130
Don't do anything bad, Sky.

639
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:14,930
Damn!

640
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,730
I can't stand it anymore.

641
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:23,690
You are just like my babe.

642
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:30,930
You are my babe, right?

643
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:37,690
You don't love me anymore?

644
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,250
Are you tired of me?

645
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,970
Don't you love me anymore?

646
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,160
I love you.

647
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:54,930
I will treat you better in the future.

648
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,130
I promise.

649
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,490
I love you.

650
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,490
I love you too.

651
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:16,730
Am I not attractive to you?

652
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:05,690
Why are you here?

653
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,930
Do you know what happened between us last night?

654
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:15,210
No, I don't want to know.

655
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:20,530
Listen, last night,

656
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,450
you were so hot.

657
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,090
You are lying.

658
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:25,610
No, I'm not.

659
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,810
You are crazy. Untie me now.

660
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:37,050
I'm telling the truth. Last night,

661
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,770
you invited me to sleep with you several times.

662
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,250
That means you're not virtuous, and you are frivolous.

663
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,610
I can't remember anything.

664
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:46,570
Do you want to remember it?

665
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,490
Do you want me to help you regain your memory?

666
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,650
Untie me, you crazy jerk.

667
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:51,690
OK.

668
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,930
I'll untie you.

669
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:54,890
Don't break free.

670
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:00,250
I don't believe that you would be attractive

671
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,930
when you were drunk.

672
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:03,530
You're frivolous.

673
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:04,770
Aren't you going to work?

674
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,770
I'm going to work.

675
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,530
But next time,

676
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:11,010
when you are drunk,

677
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,770
please do not seduce others.

678
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,330
I'm worried.

679
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:16,650
OK, fine, I won't get drunk again.

680
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,210
Go to work now.

681
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,970
I'll send the design drawing

682
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,490
to you today after I finish the revision.

683
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:23,770
Then you can ask the workers to decorate your house.

684
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,250
Now you're driving me away.

685
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,010
But last night,

686
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,130
you invited me to sleep with you.

687
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:33,970
Sky, don't go.

688
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,890
Hug me.

689
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:37,650
Let me go. I'm going to take a shower.

690
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,890
Hug me, Sky. I'm cold.

691
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:41,770
Sky.

692
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,090
Ah!

693
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:58,330
My head hurts.

694
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,330
He must be at work again.

695
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:12,450
You have to eat vegetables.

696
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:13,890
Hey, honey.

697
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,490
Didn't you go to work?

698
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,850
I don't mind being late once in a while.

699
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,850
I want to take care of my boyfriend first.

700
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:31,490
What?

701
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:33,970
Why didn't you answer the phone?

702
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:35,490
It's OK.

703
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,130
Let's eat.

704
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,010
Do you have a headache?

705
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:41,050
Take some medicine later.

706
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:42,970
It just hurts a little.

707
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,570
Babe,

708
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:53,970
I am really sorry. I didn't spend much time with you.

709
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:55,130
I'll correct my mistake.

710
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,290
OK.

711
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,850
Promise me.

712
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:08,930
Thank you, babe.

713
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,610
I've already paid.

714
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,050
You can read the documents.

715
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:24,970
But you haven't given me the receipt yet.

716
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,130
If I pay this time, it's a loss.

717
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,490
How could you not know the inventory?

718
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:36,210
I counted it together with you.

719
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,090
I'll put it here.

720
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,570
OK.

721
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,370
I think you should calculate the total sales.

722
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,250
Have a rest and eat.

723
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,210
I'll eat later.

724
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:58,170
If I eat now, I won't have time to order goods.

725
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:01,530
I'll make it for you. Have a rest.

726
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,890
It's OK. I can do it myself.

727
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:05,730
The only thing you need to do is to cheer for me.

728
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:10,170
Janus.

729
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:11,690
What?

730
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:15,130
We're in a relationship now,

731
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:16,850
do you want me to stand aside and see you deal with this alone?

732
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:19,010
Why don't we break up?

733
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:22,410
Bomb,

734
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:25,650
why do you say so?

735
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:28,850
I don't want to get you into trouble.

736
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:30,770
I don't want to see you in trouble, either.

737
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:34,210
You're not alone anymore.

738
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,730
You don't have to do everything by yourself,

739
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:38,680
work,

740
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:40,170
take care of your family,

741
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:41,730
and take care of your brother.

742
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,810
Now you have me.

743
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:46,240
Please don't act like you don't have a boyfriend.

744
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,730
I think

745
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:50,810
it's the same when your back hurts.

746
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:53,090
Let me know if it hurts,

747
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,810
and you can be tired and weak in front of me.

748
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:00,490
At least let me give you some help.

749
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:05,210
I want to be with you.

750
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:07,690
Bomb.

751
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:11,130
Calm down.

752
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:13,330
Bomb.

753
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:30,450
[Venus: If you turn the bedside around, it'll be like this.]

754
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:44,890
[Sky: I'm having a rest and eating. What are you doing?]

755
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:47,530
[Venus: Working]

756
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:49,650
[Sky: Busy?]

757
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,570
[Venus: Very busy]

758
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:57,290
[Sky: Busy with working?]

759
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:59,210
[Venus: Well.]

760
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:21,530
Hey, I don't want to type.

761
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:24,970
I called to tell you that the designs of all the rooms are ready.

762
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:31,250
Hello? Can you hear me?

763
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,730
Yes, I can.

764
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,250
I'm excited.

765
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,770
I didn't expect that you would call me.

766
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:37,650
Well.

767
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:40,050
Are you free tomorrow?

768
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:41,610
I'll show you the design drawings.

769
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,450
Well,

770
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:44,770
I'm not free tomorrow.

771
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:46,330
I have a presentation.

772
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:47,450
What?

773
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:50,450
I'm free now. Can you send the design drawings to the hospital?

774
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:51,850
Now?

775
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:56,730
Oh,

776
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:58,410
which building are you in?

777
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:01,120
In the hospital lounge.

778
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,090
I'll wait for you.

779
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:04,410
OK.

780
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:06,130
I'll go there later.

781
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:09,170
Bye.

782
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:11,010
OK.

783
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:24,330
Huh?

784
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:28,330
Which department do you work in?

785
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:29,770
I'm in the nursing department.

786
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:31,690
I'll sit here.

787
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:33,490
No, no.

788
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:34,690
I'm sorry.

789
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:37,650
This place is for my boyfriend.

790
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:41,370
Are you serious?

791
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:44,400
OK, OK, whatever.

792
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,610
Sorry.

793
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,330
Hey.

794
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:10,050
Did you eat?

795
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:12,610
It's lunchtime, so many people are queuing up.

796
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,130
So, I ordered it for you.

797
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:15,890
I'm not hungry yet.

798
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:19,050
I'll eat later. Let me show you the design drawings.

799
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,160
Sure.

800
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:24,730
This...

801
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,450
Ah.

802
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,330
OK.

803
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,410
That's it.

804
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:42,610
Do you like it?

805
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:44,850
Yes. Let's decorate the house like this.

806
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:49,850
OK.

807
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:52,530
You're finally satisfied.

808
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,530
In that case, I'll make an appointment with the workers, and

809
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:59,290
we can take the furniture we ordered back home.

810
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:00,850
Sure.

811
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:02,850
Let the workers do the rest.

812
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:03,600
By the way,

813
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:05,810
I almost forgot,

814
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:11,650
please help keep an eye on the decoration work.

815
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:14,210
I don't think I have time.

816
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:15,650
Because I have to work

817
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,290
and I'm always on duty.

818
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,090
OK.

819
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:22,370
Don't worry.

820
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:23,250
OK.

821
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,410
Anyway, the design is done.

822
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,250
Let's go for coffee this Saturday.

823
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:30,130
I know a new cafe nearby.

824
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:32,250
It's beautiful according to the shop recommendation.

825
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:34,410
So I want to take you there.

826
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,810
I'll pick you up after work.

827
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,690
Aren't you tired?

828
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:43,450
I'm tired because I wanted to make you happy.

829
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:49,250
Then you can go to the cafe alone and relax.

830
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:51,970
No. Please come with me.

831
01:03:58,090 --> 01:03:59,450
Vee.

832
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:02,090
Vee, what are you doing here?

833
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:03,530
Hi, Day.

834
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:05,330
I'm here to show Sky the design drawings.

835
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,450
Then I'm going back to look after my brother's shop.

836
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:08,450
Now you are having a break?

837
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:10,930
Yes, I just received a transfer patient.

838
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,050
I want you to decorate my house.

839
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:16,730
Sure, I'd love to.

840
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:18,450
Uh

841
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:20,650
Day, you are going to eat with your friends,

842
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:21,530
right?

843
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:22,890
Go, go, go.

844
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,650
No.

845
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:25,970
I want to sit here and eat with Bee.

846
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:28,890
By the way, we haven't had a dinner date yet.

847
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:30,730
Yeah, when?

848
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:32,730
I'll go if you ask me out.

849
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:34,810
Recently, I felt exhausted after work.

850
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:37,210
Ask Sky. There are so many patients.

851
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,760
What?

852
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:41,210
The patient can't wait.

853
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,570
Get some food.

854
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:49,650
You can eat mine.

855
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,330
I haven't eaten it yet.

856
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:54,890
Why are you so gentle to him?

857
01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:00,570
No, Vee hasn't eaten yet.

858
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:03,930
What are you doing? Let Day eat first.

859
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:07,330
I'll eat at the shop later. I haven't eaten the food you ordered for me.

860
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:09,570
You don't want to eat it?

861
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:10,770
OK.

862
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:12,650
I don't mind as we are friends.

863
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:15,370
Thank you, Vee. It's very nice of you.

864
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:17,730
Eat up.

868
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:24,890

Put some medicine on my back.

870
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,090
I can't reach it.

871
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:40,210

872
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:57,770
I'm sorry.

What?

874
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:05,770
I'll tell you everything from now on.

875
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:10,450
Everything?

876
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,170
Everything?

877
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:16,810
OK, everything.

878
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:31,570
Let's start with the documents.

879
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:34,650
OK.

880
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:41,090
This is the list of the storage products.

881
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:44,250
This is our current product. It records

882
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:48,370
the total inventory, whether replenishment is necessary and our sales.

883
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:50,770
Do we need to stock up?

884
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:52,290
Try it.

885
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:00,090
You're not mad anymore, right?

886
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:04,370

Why are you pushing me?

897
01:09:49,529 --> 01:09:50,850
I have a question.

898
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:52,330
What is it?

899
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:54,090
What do you think about Day?

We're just friends.

You can't compare him to me.

916

How about this?

917
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:35,370
Do you dare to hug me?

918
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,170
Why should I hug you?

it's okay even if you haven't opened your heart to me yet.
