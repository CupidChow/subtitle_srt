3
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,210
Here.

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,310
These are all horror movies this month. Are you going to watch this one?

5
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,680
Aren't you afraid of ghosts?

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,210
Of course not.

7
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,520
I said I wanted to see it, so I have to see it.

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,010
A new Sky

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,040
is not afraid of ghosts anymore.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,510
Okay.

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,380
You must have seen a lot of ghosts in the hospital.

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,110
Well, don't say that.

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,040
It's a common name in the hospital.

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,550
What about the ghosts in the hospital?

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,480
Have you seen one?

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,350
It's like this.

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,480
I heard a voice the night before yesterday,

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,550
when I was on duty.

19
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,080
Boo, I thought you really saw that.

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,010
But it was really horrible.

21
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,110
I only heard the sound,

22
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,110
but I couldn't find where it came from.

23
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,350
It could be from the patient's family.

24
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,710
What are you afraid of? So childish.

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,250
Are you going to watch a movie?

26
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,450
Yes. Let's go.

27
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,650
Let's watch a movie.

28
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,539
Wait for me.

29
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:41,080
It's a challenge.

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,880
-Well, that's all I can say. -A challenge.

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,180
-Is it challenging? -Yes, a big challenge.

32
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,740
Sit here alone. I'll find a place to sit.

33
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,780
Oh! Ploy!

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,610
Please open the door for me.

35
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,380
It's tough.

36
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,110
-I turn it off, and you push. -Okay.

37
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,220
1,2,

38
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,449
35, 36, 37, 38...

39
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,710
Where should I hide?

40
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,620
Hey.

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,180
What are you barking about, you silly?

42
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,950
Has the ghost gone?

43
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,020
Has the ghost gone?

44
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,920
Yes.

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,180
Really?

46
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,440
Yes.

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,040
It's not even half done.

48
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,380
Let's finish it first. It's fun.

49
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,850
Where did they go?

50
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,780
Are they still mad?

51
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,480
Don't be mad.

52
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,450
As a woman, you should not be so angry.

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,450
What's wrong?

54
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,720
People behind us are going to scold us.

55
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,650
I can't hold on.

56
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,510
The preview is so-so,

57
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,550
but the movie is scary.

58
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,910
Gosh.

59
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,720
Keep watching.

60
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,480
We've spent the money.

61
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,250
No.

62
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,980
Are you really going to leave me alone?

63
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,780
I won't leave you here.

64
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,980
I'll come back later.

65
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,650
I don't think you will come back.

66
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,579
Okay? Okay? Okay?

67
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,940
I can't stand it anymore.

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,320
[Screaming]

69
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,540
Let's watch it together.

70
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,780
I'll tell you when the ghost comes. I swear.

71
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,910
Uh.

72
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,750
Yes.

73
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,020
Okay.

74
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,880
I'll go.

75
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,410
Where should I go?

76
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,380
Hey, open your eyes.

77
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,740
No.

78
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,020
What's wrong with my phone?

79
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,520
The ghost is gone.

80
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,550
No!

81
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,409
With such kind of music,

82
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,880
the ghost must appear again.

83
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,210
You know that?

84
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,150
Yes.

85
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,510
You can't fool me.

86
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,710
Whoa! Who is it?

87
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,610
Dee!

88
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,120
What's wrong with you, Dee?

89
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,510
Dee.

90
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,480
Hey, the movie is over.

91
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,750
We can go now.

92
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,380
Is it really over?

93
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,210
Yes, it's really over.

94
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,820
You can stand up and go. Get up.

95
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,580
Really?

96
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,250
Yes.

97
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,950
Don't lie to me.

98
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,650
Huh.

99
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,280
What's wrong with you?

100
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,440
Your hands are shaking. Why are you so scared?

101
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,550
Of course, I'm frightened.

102
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,780
Aren't you scared?

103
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,810
No, it's fun.

104
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,480
How is it fun? I'm still shivering.

105
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,340
Anyway, thank you for the movie.

106
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,580
Ever since I started working,

107
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,820
I've been too busy to go to the cinema.

108
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,780
Thai ghost movies are scary but fun to watch.

109
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,850
I'm terrified now.

110
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,120
It's scarier than what we watched before.

111
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,120
You can go home now. Let's go.

112
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,620
Wait.

113
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,780
Can you stay here?

114
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,980
I'm still scared.

115
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,909
Ghost movies are fictional.

116
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,320
There are no ghosts in this world.

117
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,710
But I think there is.

118
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,520
Sky, you're a doctor.

119
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,210
Don't doctors have the right to be afraid?

120
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,910
I don't know.

121
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,280
Wait.

122
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,710
Stay with me.

123
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,480
The way home

124
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,880
is scarier than the ghost movie.

125
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,980
That's your business. I'm going home.

126
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,780
Whoa.

127
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,480
Hey.

128
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,750
What's wrong with you?

129
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,909
Why are you following me?

130
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,820
Uh...

131
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,350
Please let me in. Please.

132
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,650
I'm still scared.

133
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,940
No, go back.

134
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,840
Okay, Vee?

135
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,419
I'm still scared.

136
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,610
Don't be a coward.

137
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,840
Go home now.

138
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,080
Can you let me take a shower at your place?

139
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,910
I'll go home right after taking a shower.

140
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,640
I dare not shower alone at home. It's horrible.

141
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,210
Why don't you go to the hospital?

142
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,010
There are a lot of people there.

143
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,280
That's even more impossible.

144
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,410
When I was washing,

145
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,280
if a ghost suddenly appears, my heart will beat too fast, and I'll die.

146
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,180
Okay? Please.

147
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,150
Whoa.

148
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,410
Vee, please let me in.

149
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,350
I'm scared.

150
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,310
None of my business.

151
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,050
Oh!

152
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,150
Do not forget to shut the fence when you leave.

153
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,220
Huh?

154
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,180
You crazy bastard!

155
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,940
What are you doing?

156
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,580
Are you so scared that you lose your mind?

157
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,740
It's because you don't allow me to shower in the room.

158
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,410
So I'm taking a shower here.

159
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,510
Oh!

160
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,880
Fine, take a shower in the room.

161
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,110
I have a favor to ask.

162
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,610
What?

163
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,310
Can you guard the bathroom door for me?

164
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,610
No.

165
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,140
Whoa.

166
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,080
Just wait here.

167
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,950
Why?

168
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,080
Look, the floor is wet.

169
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,040
I'll get you a towel.

170
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:12,710
Okay.

171
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,980
Thank you.

172
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,480
Who is it?

173
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,540
Why do you walk there?

174
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,980
You make the floor wet.

175
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,740
Who's next to you?

176
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,410
Oh, my.

177
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,940
Vee.

178
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,650
Hey, wait.

179
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,520
Sit here.

180
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,040
Walk slowly. Walk slowly.

181
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,680
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,420
Oh.

183
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,720
Where's the medical kit?

184
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,580
No.

185
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,950
I only have a Band-Aid

186
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,750
and saline.

187
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,680
Where are they?

188
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,510
In the bathroom.

189
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,750
Hold on. Don't move.

190
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,080
I'll treat your wound later.

191
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,710
It's okay. I'll do it later.

192
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,380
Oh, no.

193
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,680
I hurt you, so I have to take responsibility.

194
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,210
Be gentle.

195
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,180
Okay.

196
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,950
Does it hurt?

197
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,780
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,250
If I hadn't made trouble and wetted the floor,

199
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,440
you wouldn't have slipped and fallen.

200
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,550
If I had listened to you and went home,

201
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,450
you might not have gotten injured.

202
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,710
Yes.

203
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,580
You already apologized. Why do you say sorry again and again?

204
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,010
Because I want to apologize to you

205
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,180
for many things,

206
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,280
including my rejection

207
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,420
that day.

208
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,610
Shut up, Sky.

209
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,980
Why do you bring this up?

210
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,080
No, Vee.

211
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,610
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,220
I didn't mean it that day.

213
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,750
Take a shower now.

214
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,650
Whoa, Vee, listen to me.

215
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,680
I still like you.

216
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,950
If you don't take a shower,

217
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,480
get out of my house.

218
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,680
No, Vee.

219
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,240
I just want to know

220
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,110
if you still have feelings for me.

221
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,720
What do you want to do?

222
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,340
Because I like you, Vee.

223
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,040
I really like you.

224
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,480
I didn't mean to do so that day.

225
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,480
That's not what I want.

226
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,220
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,880
Please give me another chance.

228
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,120
Okay?

229
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,310
Sorry?

230
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,820
You want a chance, right?

231
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,010
Do you think it's easy for me

232
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,850
to let it go?

233
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,950
I didn't mean it.

234
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,640
I've realized

235
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
I really like you.

236
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,910
That's why I'm here today and beg you to give me another chance.

237
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,820
You rejected me

238
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,510
and now express your love as you wish.

239
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,280
You're so willful.

240
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,310
You know?

241
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,980
Don't say that.

242
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,020
I'm not willful.

243
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,820
I'll cry for your accusation.

244
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,320
Cry?

245
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,710
Then, cry in the bathroom.

246
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,180
Don't cry here.

247
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,380
Vee,

248
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,980
please wait for me here.

249
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,510
I'll take a shower first.

250
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,980
Don't stand up.

251
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,510
I told you to wait here.

252
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,610
I'll take you upstairs after taking a shower.

253
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,980
Mind your own business. I can walk by myself.

254
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,210
Vee,

255
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,110
wait for me here, please.

256
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,850
Hmm.

257
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,880
Hey.

258
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,450
What will you do when you're stressed out?

259
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,980
When I'm stressed out,

260
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,710
I went out for some fresh air,

261
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,750
and watch a movie with Pai Tong,

262
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,180
but I haven't always been with him recently,

263
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,140
because he went with Kla.

264
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,640
-I see. -What's wrong?

265
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,220
Are you under pressure?

266
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,180
Yes.

267
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,480
Yes.

268
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,920
I didn't expect to sit here all day and night and remember these things.

269
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,710
Gosh.

270
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,180
There are so many.

271
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,650
Uh, I understand.

272
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,710
It is like when I do projects day and night.

273
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,010
You need to have a rest and relax your brain,

274
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,480
and then come back and recite it again.

275
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,450
Hmm…

276
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,240
Okay.

277
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,850
But I think if I graduate,

278
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,510
I'll be more troubled than this.

279
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,180
Gosh.

280
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,150
Shall we do something to relieve stress?

281
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,520
What to do?

282
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,710
Well…

283
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,640
take a walk in the park

284
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,340
and then watch a movie, okay?

285
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,280
Hmm…

286
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,079
Okay.

287
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:10,770
Hey.

288
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:15,079
What?

289
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,980
Help me. I don't have the strength to get up and change my clothes.

290
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,480
Alas.

291
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,510
Go, go.

292
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,569
Help me.

293
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,610
-Get up quickly. -Help me. I can't get up.

294
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,610
Go away.

295
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,080
Ouch, my leg hurts.

296
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,840
Alas, you're so violent.

297
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,250
I'm more anxious.

298
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,540
What are you drawing?

299
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,640
What do you think I'm drawing?

300
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,880
Puppy.

301
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,940
What? Look carefully.

302
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,370
Pig?

303
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,010
What? I'm drawing a duck.

304
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,580
What kind of duck is like that?

305
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,280
Are you an interior decoration major?

306
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,520
Uh…

307
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,050
I'm drawing a cat.

308
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,080
[Come out and rest if you're tired. Anyway, you'll pass it~♡]

309
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,310
Thank you.

310
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,810
Don't say that. I don't draw it for you.

311
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,010
Well.

312
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,420
What movie do you want to watch?

313
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,080
Would you watch it if I say?

314
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,980
Yes.

315
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,480
What movie?

316
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,880
A porn movie?

317
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,840
Don't talk nonsense. What kind of porn movie can be shown in a cinema?

318
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,820
Where should we watch that?

319
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,040
It's your business.

320
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,910
Take me there.

321
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,850
Are you crazy? Go watch it alone.

322
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,950
Just watch this one.

323
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,680
Really?

324
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,510
Yes, why?

325
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,910
I declare war on you.

326
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,980
If I cover my eyes with my hands,

327
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,740
I'll buy you popcorn.

328
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,340
Deal.

329
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,610
You're going to lose,

330
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,940
medico Faklei

331
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,150
Put on your clothes

332
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,710
and go back.

333
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,480
I really want you to be part of my life, Vee.

334
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,280
Don't be mad at me for so long, okay?

335
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,540
From now on,

336
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,250
stop trying.

337
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,610
No.

338
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,340
This time, I'll arouse your love for me again.

339
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,050
Vee,

340
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,880
don't put too much weight on your feet,

341
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,840
or you'll get inflamed later.

342
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,070
Okay, I know.

343
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,110
Don't touch me.

344
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,680
Come here.

345
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,570
Slow down.

346
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,980
Don't come so close. My clothes will get wet.

347
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,540
Venus,

348
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,980
don't be naughty,

349
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,740
or you'll fall again.

350
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,610
Go.

351
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,980
Slow down.

352
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,650
Well.

353
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,540
Uh, Doctor,

354
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,110
what brings you here?

355
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,480
There was an accident,

356
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,270
so I help Venus upstairs.

357
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Gosh, you startle me.

358
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,080
By the way, is he okay?

359
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,820
He's fine. I've treated his wound.

360
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,340
If Vee wakes up tomorrow, give him some painkillers.

361
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,580
Okay.

362
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,850
Doctor.

363
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,780
Yes?

364
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,020
Are you sure he's okay?

365
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,850
Okay.

366
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,680
Are you sure you didn't fight again?

367
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,550
Yes.

368
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,180
Well, it's okay then.

369
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,880
Thank you, Doctor. You can go back now.

370
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,110
Goodbye.

371
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,980
What's wrong? Can you share it with me?

372
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,070
I don't know.

373
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,710
What is it?

374
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,880
It's about work or feeling?

375
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,180
See?

376
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,240
It's definitely about your feeling.

377
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,710
Yeah.

378
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,080
I'm really weak in this matter.

379
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,310
What else could it be?

380
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,440
Why?

381
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,820
What's the problem?

382
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,440
Nothing.

383
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,550
If it really was nothing, would you sit here so anxiously like this?

384
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,980
The whole ward knows

385
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,710
when you're stressed.

386
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,080
Am I that easy to be seen through?

387
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,020
Yes, you are.

388
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,210
You are always cheerful.

389
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,980
Look at yourself now.

390
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,950
Even the dog in front of the hospital knows it.

391
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,880
I want to hide my emotions.

392
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,810
Hey.

393
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,350
But I think

394
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,020
what you are now is fine.

395
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,440
How?

396
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,320
It's good that you're not pretentious.

397
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,340
You say whatever comes to your mind.

398
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,210
I think when you express love, you also do it very clearly.

399
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,850
But even if I make it crystal clear,

400
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,950
if someone chooses to turn a blind eye,

401
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,780
it's all in vain.

402
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,940
Oh, Sky.

403
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,780
Honestly, I think

404
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,940
you need to deal with your own emotions first.

405
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,750
Otherwise,

406
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,380
when you work, work problems and other things

407
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,010
will be mixed up.

408
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,040
I'm trying my best.

409
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,610
Anyway, I have to focus on my work.

410
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,380
Yes.

411
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,440
You can do it. You're the best.

412
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,950
Thanks, buddy.

413
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,740
Listen.

414
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,950
Anything too fast-paced or rushed,

415
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,380
I don't think it's good.

416
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,480
Because sometimes,

417
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,520
it can lead to me almost making mistakes.

418
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,540
My judgment was off at the time,

419
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,410
but I believe I made a big mistake in this matter.

420
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,570
Mistakes can be corrected, buddy, that's all.

421
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,320
Now, don't forget

422
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,380
what our responsibilities are.

423
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,210
Hey.

424
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,110
Hey, what's wrong?

425
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,080
You...

426
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,270
I'm so confused.

427
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,810
After graduation,

428
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,810
did you tell Sky anything?

429
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,880
Anything?

430
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,780
What thing?

431
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,140
Well...

432
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,470
Did you say anything to Sky?

433
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,580
No.

434
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,480
I'm just updated what happened to you and Sky

435
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,180
because my babe asked. That's all.

436
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,040
Nothing else.

437
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,940
Don't worry.

438
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,780
I'm always on your side.

439
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,280
If I really had told him anything,

440
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,610
you would have seen him every day.

441
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,550
Uh...

442
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,020
I trust you.

443
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,410
Good.

444
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,220
I'll come to you in a few days, okay?

445
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,550
I want to see your brother's new career.

446
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,980
Alas.

447
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,710
Tong.

448
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,880
Come to me as soon as possible.

449
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,510
I think I'm going crazy.

450
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Okay.

451
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,710
I'm going crazy too.

452
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,440
My work is piling up.

453
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,140
Are you really coming to me?

454
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,040
I'm not sure, but I'll try my best.

455
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,650
Because I promised my baby.

456
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,980
Okay.

457
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,850
Anyway, do your best.

458
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,610
Come to me.

459
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,350
You too.

460
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:05,410
[Diagnosis Room 19]

461
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,880
What is it?

462
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,650
Ah.

463
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,140
Just give inoxa 0.01 ml./kg.

464
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,650
SubQ b.i.d. And start warfarin the next day.

465
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,810
After that, follow up for PT-INR.

466
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,210
And bridging enoxaparin to warfarin.

467
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,050
Keep INR about 2-3.

468
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,510
Okay.

469
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,440
Okay.

470
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,850
Okay, okay.

471
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,980
How are you?

472
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,180
By the way,

473
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,410
the patients in this ward have high potassium levels in their blood.

474
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,650
I've already administered medication.

475
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,750
Please monitor the results.

476
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,020
Uh, If the patient still doesn't get better,

477
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,440
please continue with the treatment.

478
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,510
Um-hum. Okay.

479
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,980
How did it go?

480
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,240
It's a mess, isn't it?

481
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,210
Both the case and your feeling.

482
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,710
Yes.

483
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,680
I haven't eaten since afternoon.

484
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,650
Oh!

485
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,680
Do you want something to eat? My treat.

486
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,380
No, it's okay.

487
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,050
Just say it.

488
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,410
Dude, I pity you for being sick.

489
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,150
What do you mean I'm sick?

490
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,940
You're sick of love.

491
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,220
I pity you.

492
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,510
I saw someone who was so heartbroken that he went on a hunger strike.

493
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,980
Bad Day.

494
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,150
You're really putting salt on my wound.

495
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,180
Tell me what you want to order.

496
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,540
I'll heal you, man.

497
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,710
Stop teasing me.

498
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,140
What's wrong with you?

499
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,810
In my life... I've been through the same thing as you.

500
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
Here you go.

501
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,180
You can order anything, and order something for me.

502
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,010
Okay.

503
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,440
Just eat as usual.

504
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,110
Sure.

505
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,280
Then I'll go write the patient's referral letter first.

506
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,540
See you in the lounge in 20 minutes.

507
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,080
Okay.

508
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:03,010
There are quite a lot of food in this app.

509
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,320
What are you looking at?

510
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,480
Nothing.

511
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,340
I was planning to have you deliver things to the hospital,

512
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,680
but I forgot about your sore feet.

513
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,350
It's okay now. I will deliver it myself.

514
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,170
Are you okay with walking?

515
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,310
Didn't you walk around and then slip and fall?

516
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,310
That was quite cool, my little brother.

517
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,850
It's just a small wound. Stop nagging.

518
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,550
I'm not.

519
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,740
But you're weird too.

520
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,620
Normally, I almost had to kneel down and beg you before you were willing to deliver the goods.

521
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,320
It's so easy this time.

522
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,050
I'm just bored.

523
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,920
I'm dying standing here.

524
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,680
You want to go to the hospital too, right?

525
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,780
Why would I want to go?

526
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,450
Well, how would I know that?

527
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,110
In case you don't want to see your friend.

528
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,580
You care too much about me.

529
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,910
Recently,

530
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,580
your friend come here almost every day.

531
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,110
Of course I know.

532
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,010
You know?

533
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,720
What do you know?

534
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,350
I don't know. I really don't know.

535
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,450
You really don't know?

536
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,880
Yes.

537
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,880
What do you think it is?

538
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,280
Are you afraid I'll know?

539
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,020
Know what? I'm not.

540
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,580
How are your wound?

541
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,410
Aren't you going to clean the wound?

542
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,620
Why do I have to do it?

543
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,510
Oh?

544
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,880
You need to clean your wound.

545
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,810
No, I don't.

546
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,380
It will heal quickly with the adhesive plaster on.

547
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,980
What nonsense are you talking about?

548
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,640
Check the wound first.

549
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,450
It's festering.

550
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,910
Look at you.

551
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,510
Leave me alone.

552
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,110
I'll take that order and deliver it.

553
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,210
Okay.

554
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,610
What's the customer's name?

555
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,040
Let me see.

556
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,320
The customer's name is Badin.

557
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,320
Yes.

558
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,180
Can I ask for something in exchange?

559
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,340
What?

560
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,410
I want to ask for two days off to watch the series.

561
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,420
Goodness.

562
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:33,750
Okay.

563
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,940
I can give you a day off every week.

564
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,280
Great.

565
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,020
My brother is really great.

566
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,150
Make sure everything on the order is prepared.

567
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,350
Did you check well?

568
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,040
Okay. Two boxes, complete. But I forgot...

569
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,020
Thank you.

570
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,949
Wait, Vee.

571
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,850
Are you here to deliver customer orders?

572
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:48,870
Yes.

573
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,080
Wait.

574
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:53,949
How's your foot? Does it hurt?

575
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:55,420
Did you clean the wound?

576
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,880
Don't mess with me. This wound will get better soon.

577
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,680
But it can get infected easily.

578
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,380
The wound is far from the heart.

579
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,950
The wound is on the foot.

580
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,210
It is far from the heart but it can infect the blood stream.

581
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,340
Okay.

582
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,380
Let go.

583
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,840
I'm going to deliver the order. The customer is waiting.

584
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,050
Wait.

585
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,950
Are you going to deliver food to your customer?

586
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,880
Where is your customer located? I will deliver it.

587
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,580
It's okay.

588
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,650
I'll put it on the counter if I can't find him.

589
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,180
Someone will pick it up later.

590
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,510
Can you let me go now?

591
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,580
Vee.

592
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,440
Why do I always see you every time I come?

593
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,280
Don't walk for too long.

594
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,450
What's the customer's name, and in which building?

595
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,380
I'll deliver it for you.

596
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,440
No need, I've already called.

597
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,280
He'll be here soon.

598
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,710
Then I'll bathe your wound after you deliver the food.

599
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,350
Don't interfere. Don't you understand?

600
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,450
Yes.

601
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,120
I don't understand.

602
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,180
Even if I worry about you,

603
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,640
you won't understand me.

604
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,580
Are you crazy?

605
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,250
Yes, I am.

606
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,720
Venus.

607
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,780
Hey, Day!

608
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,520
Long time no see. How have you been?

609
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,880
I'm fine, Day.

610
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,740
You're so annoying.

611
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,550
I'm on duty today.

612
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,820
A doctor's daily life.

613
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,540
Well...

614
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,380
What are you doing here, Venus?

615
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,410
To deliver goods. I've been helping my brother lately.

616
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,010
By the way,

617
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,620
Is Badin you?

618
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,880
I thought the name was familiar.

619
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,980
Yes.

620
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,980
I ordered it.

621
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:40,910
Oh!

622
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,580
Do you know Sky too?

623
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,810
I've known him since college.

624
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,450
What a small world.

625
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,040
Vee was my friend in middle school.

626
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,210
He was also the first person to write a letter congratulating me on getting into medical school.

627
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,450
Oh, you remember?

628
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,840
It's been a long time.

629
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,010
I remember.

630
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,110
I was very impressed with you back then.

631
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,610
You really cared about your friends.

632
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,210
You're exaggerating. It's not that much.

633
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,240
No, not at all.

634
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,380
We were in different classes in school.

635
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,550
You're exaggerating.

636
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,310
You haven't eaten yet?

637
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,750
-Which meal is this for you? -It's our dinner.

638
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,450
Hey, Sky hasn't eaten since lunch.

639
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,340
Really? I'm so happy.

640
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,470
I haven't seen any other friends.

641
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,640
I'm going to work.

642
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,620
The number that called me is your number, right?

643
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,850
Let's meet later.

644
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,250
Sure, let's make an appointment soon. I've been quite free lately.

645
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,410
Okay.

646
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,910
Let's go and eat.

647
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,180
I'll go to the duty room and wait for you.

648
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,020
Come over quickly once you're done.

649
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,250
See you next time, Day.

650
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,610
Wait, Vee.

651
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,510
Let me send you off.

652
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,610
No need.

653
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,310
Why is it so hard to communicate with you?

654
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,180
You communicate very well with Day when you're chatting.

655
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,810
Hey, let go.

656
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,510
Why are your hands so sticky?

657
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,410
Yeah.

658
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,880
Your hands are sticky like squid.

659
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,250
This way, I can stick with you everywhere we go.

660
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,240
Goodness.

661
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,540
Let go.

662
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,640
Other people will see us.

663
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,110
No one will.

664
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,080
Yes.

665
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,180
It's me.

666
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,180
My mood interrupter has arrived.

667
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,040
How's it?

668
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,970
How's your foot?

669
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,040
J told me you slipped last night.

670
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,020
What's wrong with you guys?

671
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,180
Don't worry about such a small wound.

672
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,780
Oh.

673
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,980
You asked a weird question.

674
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,550
How nice is it when people care about you?

675
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,780
That means he loves you.

676
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,650
Yes.

677
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,050
Tell him how your foot is.

678
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,480
Much better. It doesn't hurt anymore.

679
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,680
And did you bathe the wound at the hospital?

680
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,610
No, I'll do it later.

681
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:23,910
I hope your wound rot.

682
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,110
I hope your wound gets infected, or even better, you have to undergo surgery.

683
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,940
I'll go organize the products first.

684
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,080
You don't have to go. Just give me some encouragement.

685
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,080
Oh, why don't you stay sweet?

686
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,080
Let go, J.

687
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,980
Oh.

688
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,910
Uh...

689
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,480
You are really not considering me.

690
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,850
Okay, go ahead.

691
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,480
I'm going to sort the drinks first.

692
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:56,680
Stop it, J.

693
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,280
Your brother won't like me.

694
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,420
Oh my.

695
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,440
Vee won't think too much.

696
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,110
Are you still thinking about that?

697
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,440
What the heck?

698
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,540
I have to think about it.

699
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,410
Yes.

700
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,380
Then go ask him. Then you can stop thinking about that.

701
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,780
-Should I? -Yes.

702
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,250
Vee.

703
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
Well...

704
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,350
Are you shocked or uncomfortable?

705
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,820
My relationship with J.

706
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,880
I was shocked at first.

707
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,180
I didn't expect that J's boyfriend would be you.

708
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,110
Tell me if you have anything to say.

709
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,110
I'm afraid that J and I might embarrass you.

710
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,780
Do whatever you want.

711
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,720
You didn't embarrass me.

712
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,480
Are you sure?

713
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,010
Yes, I am.

714
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,780
I'm afraid you may have felt awkward

715
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,610
when you saw me and J...

716
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,180
Well...

717
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,880
Doing that...

718
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,220
It was my mistake that day. Don't think too much.

719
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,110
Do whatever you want.

720
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,880
I really didn't think much.

721
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,050
I was shocked at first.

722
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,150
But now I'm used to it.

723
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,280
I'm happy that it's you.

724
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,750
I'm so shy.

725
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,840
Please take care of J no matter what.

726
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,020
Usually, you're the kind of person who works very diligently.

727
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,940
Now that there's someone helping to take care of him, I'm also very relieved.

728
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,780
I don't know how to tell you.

729
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,340
I liked you at first.

730
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,120
But then J came along and stopped it.

731
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,680
When I regained my senses, I'd already fallen in love with him.

732
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,750
Wow.

733
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,180
So, it has been going on since high school?

734
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,810
Don't be nervous.

735
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,010
I'm afraid that you would disapprove of it

736
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,450
and might think that I don't really love J.

737
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,480
So we had to secretly be together when you were away.

738
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,750
From now on, you two can be as sweet as you want to be.

739
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,480
Gosh.

740
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,910
I'm so relieved.

741
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,640
I've been worried about it for a long time.

742
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,910
But don't break J's heart. Or I'll break your back.

743
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,050
Oh.

744
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,210
That's impossible. Just see.

745
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,180
Okay.

746
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,710
But I've never seen Jack seeing someone.

747
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,320
I didn't expect him to be so happy.

748
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,550
And he's so crazy in love.

749
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:56,050
Then, why don't you try dating someone?

750
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:56,980
Huh?

751
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,740
No!

752
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,950
My standards are high.

753
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,340
I usually go after someone who doesn't like me.

754
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:08,420
Your tastes may change as you get older.

755
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,440
How about 50?

756
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,850
That's too old.

757
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,880
To be honest,

758
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,380
I don't know if I'll ever meet someone I like again.

759
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,980
Why?

760
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,020
Afraid of getting hurt.

761
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:30,010
Not everyone can be with someone who makes them happy.

762
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,340
Well.

763
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,540
Love will make you happy when you're with the one you love.

764
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,280
But do you know

765
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,540
what makes love last longer?

766
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,920
What?

767
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,350
It's being able to accept another person's flaws.

768
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,280
Then you must be very good

769
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,540
at accepting J's flaws.

770
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,210
Because that's not easy.

771
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,710
That's right.

772
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,710
It's true.

773
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,540
Don't fall in love with someone else so soon, Vee.

774
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,520
Please give me a chance.

775
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,110
Doctor.

776
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,980
You come to the shop early in the morning.

777
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:01,550
Don't tell me you just finished your shift.

778
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,680
Venus is not here?

779
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,050
What?

780
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:09,910
Doctor.

781
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,480
There's something here.

782
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,580
Well...

783
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,020
Vee isn't here, Doctor.

784
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:17,780
Oh...

785
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:22,890
When will Vee come? You look weird.

786
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,710
Oh, it's nothing, Doctor.

787
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:26,610
I'm doing facial exercises.

788
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:32,440
Well...

789
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,480
I don't know. I don't think he'll come today.

790
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:37,710
Really?

791
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,680
Yes.

792
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,510
Thank you.

793
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:44,840
What's wrong?

794
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,610
Oh. Nothing.

795
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,850
It's just dust.

796
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,440
-Thank you. -You’re welcome.

797
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,580
Hello.

798
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,280
You drove my car. Then which car should I use to deliver?

799
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,720
Huh, you can ride a bike.

800
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,250
Big deal.

801
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,480
Don't you ever check the weather in Thailand?

802
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,720
You're crazy.

803
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,640
Fine. I'll be back soon.

804
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,080
Well, then...

805
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,080
Vee!

806
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:47,910
Damn!

807
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,680
Wait, don't go!

808
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:56,940
Let me go!

809
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,350
No!

810
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,810
I said, "Let me go!"

811
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,640
But I really want to talk to you, Vee.

812
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,740
I thought I made myself clear that day.

813
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,240
You still don't understand?

814
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,140
Please give me another chance, okay?

815
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,180
Just once.

816
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,340
What about the day you rejected me?

817
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,070
Have you ever thought about that?

818
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,210
You didn't.

819
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,350
So I'll do the same this time.

820
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,840
Don't mess with me again.

821
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,810
You annoy me!

822
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,110
Goodness.

823
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,280
Do you need my help?

824
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,080
Who is ringing the bell so early in the morning?

825
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,250
Coming. Hold on!

826
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,140
Vee!

827
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,720
Tong!

828
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,310
I missed you so much, my dear friend.

829
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:12,420
Come on in. Make yourself at home.

830
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,140
Come on in?

831
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,140
Wait, this is my house.

832
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,950
You act as if this is yours.

833
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:18,880
You...

834
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,880
This place has changed a lot.

835
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,320
You didn't waste your time learning interior design.

836
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,880
You redecorated it again. It's pretty.

837
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:29,980
Since I graduated,

838
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:34,580
I've renovated and redecorated here. I tried to flip it over here and there.

839
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:36,110
This is its result.

840
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:40,580
I want the treasure that my parents left before their separation to be beautiful.

841
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,910
Umm.

842
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,610
It looks as if it came straight from a textbook.

843
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,420
You're exaggerating.

844
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:48,240
No, I'm not.

845
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,450
Look at each spot you place.

846
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:51,980
It's all correct.

847
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:55,280
But it looks... You don't seem to have such a heart.

848
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,350
Heart?

849
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,370
Here. My heart.

850
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,310
If you're here to complain about me,

851
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,710
you can go home now.

852
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,180
Well, I'll stop.

853
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,640
By the way, I brought you these.

854
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,650
I bought them for you in Bangkok.

855
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:11,280
This is a kind of bread with lots of fillings.

856
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,280
This brand is super tasty.

857
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,010
And this. This is a lava bun from Chinatown.

858
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,550
And this.

859
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,840
It's the mango sticky rice at Wong Wien 22. This is also absolutely delicious.

860
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,080
It's heavenly once you try it.

861
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:24,450
Well...

862
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:25,680
You...

863
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,880
My home is not that far from Bangkok.

864
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:31,180
I bought them especially for you and J.

865
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,210
Alright, sorry. Thank you so much.

866
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:36,780
Wow, there are so many delicious foods.

867
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,050
You're good at killing the vibe.

868
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,580
I bought these especially for you and J.

869
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,010
I'm sorry.

870
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:47,080
How's your work going, by the way?

871
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,180
Yes, I've been tired lately.

872
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,580
It seems that the boss is going to take foreign orders.

873
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,250
I'm reviewing house plans.

874
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,580
Do you remember Peter?

875
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:58,640
The designer who designs for renowned flagship stores.

876
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,050
Peter.

877
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,420
The Peter we met in Tokyo?

878
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,840
Yes, him.

879
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,650
He is very strict at work.

880
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,680
Huh? Really?

881
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,280
Yes.

882
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,710
I think he's nice.

883
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,840
Yes, he is.

884
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,570
But he doesn't chill while working at all.

885
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,550
I saw him looking for more employees.

886
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,910
You can create a resume and send it.

887
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:29,860
[Stinky-faced Cat: Please answer me. Did you go to the store today? Have you eaten anything yet?]

888
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,040
I bought these for you. Be sure to eat them.

889
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,650
Okay.

890
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:38,050
-Then I'll have some mango sticky rice. -I've been craving mango rice for a long time.

891
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:39,410
Can I eat the mango sticky rice?

892
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,280
Sure.

893
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:45,350
Or should I create a resume and upload it to social media?

894
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,840
So that I won't wallow in my wild thoughts when I get a good project.

895
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,980
I don't understand.

896
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,240
Why did you have to buy so many things while you were shopping?

897
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,180
Oh.

898
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,380
I'm stocking up. This place is really good.

899
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,050
I even bought some for my clients too.

900
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,050
Okay.

901
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,250
You...

902
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,380
I'm going to the hospital to find Tonkla.

903
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,080
How will you get there?

904
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,280
Oh!

905
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,480
I drove here. Did you forget?

906
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,480
Oh, I forgot.

907
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,150
But today is Saturday. Is he working today?

908
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,010
Yes.

909
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:29,950
I heard that he was on duty till this morning,

910
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,620
and then he had a presentation about M-M or something.

911
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,310
I don't think he is done yet.

912
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:36,880
So...

913
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,950
Are you going to wait until he gets off work?

914
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,810
I haven't taken a few breaths, and 24 hours are gone.

915
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,280
When will I get weekends off like you guys?

916
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,080
I have to make the 48 hours worth it.

917
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,210
Think about it.

918
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,610
48 hours.

919
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,540
And my babe has been busy for 32 hours.

920
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,310
I'll be happy even if we can only spend a few hours together.

921
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:02,850
I don't understand. I don't have a boyfriend.

922
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:04,750
I'd better leave.

923
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,420
It's better than being with a heartless person like you.

924
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:07,450
Gosh.

925
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,480
-Seriously? -Help me with these things.

926
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,140
Hurry up.

927
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:11,950
Take those two.

928
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,780
-Did you wait long? -Oh, baby.

929
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,220
Give me a hug.

930
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:39,050
It's okay. I can wait for you.

931
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:40,680
I bought you a drink.

932
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,450
But it's melting.

933
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,680
I can still drink it.

934
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,620
How was it? Did you and Vee have fun?

935
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,750
Yes.

936
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,610
I'm always comfortable with Vee.

937
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,070
How are you, baby?

938
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:58,210
Why is it so dark under your eyes?

939
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:03,120
Because lately, I've been working on a slide presentation

940
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,480
for the professor to explain why the patient died.

941
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,750
Then how about you?

942
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,340
Gosh.

943
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,180
My head hurts.

944
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:12,970
Baby.

945
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,080
Where do you hurt?

946
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,180
How does it hurt?

947
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,820
It's like one wave after another, or are you always in pain?

948
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,080
Has it been a long time?

949
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,110
I'm in pain here, here,

950
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:22,780
and here.

951
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,580
Because I missed you so much.

952
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,620
I was just kidding.

953
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,840
I was asking for your care.

954
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,770
But you are too serious.

955
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:35,610
How come, baby?

956
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:38,580
You work hard every day. How could it not scare me?

957
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,450
I'm sorry. I won't tease you anymore.

958
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,240
I want you to get rid of some stress.

959
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,250
Would you like some sweets?

960
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,980
You came to me, and my stress is gone.

961
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:50,880
Whose boyfriend is he?

962
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,550
So cute.

963
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:54,910
Let's have snacks together.

964
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,950
I bought it from a café near Vee's house.

965
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:00,410
That café there is delicious.

966
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,820
This is a brownie.

967
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:04,950
Your favorite.

968
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,650
I bought a lot.

969
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,480
Hey, man.

970
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,740
You said you wouldn't come to the store today, didn't you?

971
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,410
You can't just go in like this.

972
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:14,750
I haven't cleared a place yet.

973
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,450
Where do I have to store them?

974
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:23,650
What happened?

975
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,550
I don't know.

976
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:29,110
Maybe it's about the truck or storage.

977
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,810
No, no, man.

978
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:32,510
Doing business is difficult.

979
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,840
Why does he like it? I don't understand.

980
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:36,420
Okay.

981
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:39,040
Anyway, you come at 8 p.m.

982
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,540
If you come at 8 p.m., I'll clear a place and leave.

983
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,510
But don't do this again.

984
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:45,850
Okay.

985
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,380
Gotta go.

986
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:51,520
Oh!

987
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,820
Don't you want to eat first?

988
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,650
No.

989
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,120
That man is going to deliver goods to the store.

990
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,410
I have to hurry to clear a space.

991
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:56,850
Okay.

992
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:57,850
I'll go with you.

993
00:54:57,850 --> 00:54:59,580
No, no.

994
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,740
Just eat here. Sit down.

995
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,410
Just give me some encouragement.

996
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,010
Let's go together later.

997
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:07,880
No need.

998
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:08,550
Stop.

999
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,050
Just eat here.

1000
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,550
You can go after eating.

1001
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:16,840
Your brother is still here.

1002
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,310
If you two are going to go this far,

1003
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,680
you'll have to perform on the table next time.

1004
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,780
You said it yourself.

1005
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,110
Go.

1006
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,920
Maybe you'll see it later.

1007
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:48,800
[Stinky-faced Cat: Are you still mad at me? It's been days]

1008
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,980
[Stinky-faced Cat: I just finished my duty. I'll sleep until the evening. I'm exhausted]

1009
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,720
[Stinky-faced Cat: Have you been to this restaurant? It's delicious. I'll buy some for you tomorrow.]

1010
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:01,020
[Stinky-faced Cat: What are you doing? I miss you. 
Are you really not replying?]

1011
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:03,750
[Stinky-faced Cat: Haven't removed me from the blacklist, right?]

1012
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:02,280
Oh.

1013
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,020
If you text me this much,

1014
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,180
I'll block you, okay?

1015
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,070
What?

1016
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:08,250
Nothing.

1017
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,950
Just keep eating.

1018
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:12,410
[Stinky-faced Cat: Readed! You unblocked me again]

1019
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,510
[Stinky-faced Cat: I won't bother you anymore. Kiss]

1020
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,380
What?

1021
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,310
Jenus cooked for me?

1022
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,550
No.

1023
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:38,750
This is...

1024
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,780
Open it yourself. I have to go now.

1025
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,710
I'm going home.

1026
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,080
[This place is amazing! Since you don't want to eat with me, I'll order it for you. Eat up. Don't lose weight. -Sky]

1027
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:12,840
Hey!

1028
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,070
A letter. Someone sent it to you.

1029
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:30,640
Who sent it?

1030
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,210
Doctor. He asked me to give it to you.

1031
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:35,280
Don't take his letters again.

1032
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,510
Okay.

1033
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,280
Throw it away.

1034
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,010
Okay.

1035
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:00,970
What?

1036
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:02,810
Who do you want me to visit?

1037
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:05,020
The doctor asked me

1038
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:05,980
to give it to you like this.

1039
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:14,680
[Get better soon. I miss you.]

1040
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:19,480
Hurry up. It's heavy.

1041
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:22,310
Hurry and bring it back to him.

1042
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:23,550
Huh?

1043
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:25,880
Okay.

1044
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,380
In the future,

1045
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,950
if you bring me another gift from him,

1046
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,480
I'll ask J to kick you out.

1047
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,240
Okay.

1048
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,540
How was your night shift last night?

1049
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,480
I'm so tired.

1050
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,210
I've had two people in labor at the same time.

1051
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:49,350
I worked until 1 in the morning.

1052
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:51,910
My ER is overheated.

1053
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:53,550
Okay.

1054
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:56,510
Keep fighting. You can do it.

1055
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,280
Don't ask me to send gifts for you, Doctor.

1056
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,310
Otherwise, I'll be kicked out.

1057
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,040
Bye.

1058
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,450
Thank you.

1059
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,080
[Get better soon. I miss you]

1060
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,080
Get better soon. I miss you.

1061
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,080
Who are you going to visit?

1062
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,320
Visit? I sent it to Venus.

1063
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,140
You said he'd like it if I sent it, didn't you?

1064
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,440
Huh?

1065
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,340
I didn't tell you to buy a fruit basket.

1066
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:32,650
I told you to buy Venus' favorite things.

1067
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,480
Venus likes fruits.

1068
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,580
I don't have time to go to the market.

1069
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:39,880
Fine.

1070
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,050
It's okay. I understand you.

1071
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:47,520
It's kind of like a good memory too.

1072
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,910
Sent him a fruit basket to wish he get better soon.

1073
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,550
What memory?

1074
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,240
Vee always said I was weird.

1075
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:59,050
Trust me. Venus likes weird things.

1076
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:00,840
Otherwise, he wouldn't like you.

1077
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,350
Oh! Are you implying that I'm weird?

1078
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:08,680
Damn, you...

1079
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,250
I saw this post a few days ago.

1080
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,810
Tong shared it with me.

1081
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,480
What post?

1082
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,780
This one. Look.

1083
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,180
What is it?

1084
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,350
This!

1085
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:25,350
Venus posted that he would take orders for design and interior decoration.

1086
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:26,650
Think about it.

1087
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:29,480
Try to talk about work with Venus.

1088
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,580
What if he replies?

1089
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:42,040
Damn, I forgot to go back to Tong.

1090
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:42,580
You...

1091
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:43,710
See you later.

1092
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:46,780
Hello.

1093
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,510
Yes. I'm going.

1094
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:58,350
Will he reply if I text him?
