00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,500
Yes.

190
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,810
We've made up.

191
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,120
You should worry about yourself.

192
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,360
Get well soon.

193
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,800
Sky had been by your side all night

194
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,910
and had to rush to work in the morning.

195
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,460
Did you act out during the day?

196
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,890
No, I didn't.

197
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,350
By the way, what about the debt issue?

198
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,650
It's all settled.

199
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,410
That's good.

200
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,950
You should tell me if there're any problems next time.

201
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,370
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

202
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,680
You don't need to be so strong.

203
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,300
Okay.

204
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,660
You should take care of yourself first.

205
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,490
Talk like this when you're not fully recovered?

206
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,830
Go to sleep quickly.

207
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,940
Then you stay with me.

208
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,630
I won't, you're all grown up now.

209
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,450
I'm going to sleep then.

210
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,870
Hurry up and sleep.

211
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,080
Why don't you sleep a bit more?

212
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,110
I'm feeling better.

213
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,510
I'm tired of sleeping all day.

214
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,510
Where are you feeling better?

215
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,150
You're still a bit warm.

216
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,940
Oh...

217
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,810
So now you're letting go of my hand.

218
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,530
Because I've recovered.

219
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,460
Then you better stay sick.

220
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:31,850
Why?

221
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,300
I don't want to get sick again.

222
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,830
What kind of doctor are you, trying to make the patient sick again?

223
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,530
Because I want to hug you.

224
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,800
I want to kiss you.

225
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
I want to kiss your face,

226
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,490
just like when you were sick.

227
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,310
Do you know how cute you were acting with me last night?

228
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,410
Nonsense.

229
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,690
I don't remember.

230
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,880
What?

231
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:17,540
Last night, you were saying things like "Sky, hug me, I'm cold."

232
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,550
"Sky."

233
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,109
"Kiss me."

234
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,140
"I want to kiss you."

235
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,630
Do you know you had been saying that all night?

236
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,310
Do you really want me to get sick?

237
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,400
Who kept frowning all last night?

238
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,870
Huh?

239
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,050
Didn't you say you didn't remember?

240
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,080
I didn't forget.

241
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,930
I'm just shy.

242
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,270
I really want to bite you.

243
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,820
No, be careful, someone might see.

244
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,310
What?

245
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,320
We're in a relationship, what're you afraid of?

246
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,220
Oh.

247
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,170
Haven't you told anyone about us yet?

248
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,630
I haven't found the right timing.

249
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,190
By the way, how are things going with Tonkla?

250
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,930
You should worry about yourself.

251
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,970
You're still sick

252
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,200
and running a fever.

253
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,410
Sky.

254
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,710
Go upstairs to sleep.

255
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,040
Go ahead.

256
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,910
Don't let the doctor scold you.

257
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,710
Hurry up.

258
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,630
Fine.

259
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,260
Is Sky upset?

260
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,310
[Bai Tong]

261
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,960
[Bai Tong]

262
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,200
Hey, what's up?

263
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,130
Hey.

264
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,820
Can I come to your place now？

265
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,240
What's wrong? Coming to see me now?

266
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,500
Yeah, I'll come see you in a bit.

267
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,180
You sound a bit strange.

268
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,390
Is something wrong?

269
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,810
Hmm, yeah, you can come.

270
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,330
Be careful on the way.

271
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,480
[Are you asleep?]

272
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,120
By the way, Venus.

273
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,760
Do you think I can handle it if I go there?

274
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,000
I could only speak English.

275
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,560
You're going for a year, you'll learn German by then.

276
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,670
Really?

277
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,830
I'm so nervous.

278
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,850
I've never stayed abroad for more than ten days.

279
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,300
When are you leaving?

280
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,830
Around next month,

281
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,520
with about a month to prepare.

282
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,990
[What are you doing?]

283
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,510
Hmm, that's good.

284
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,170
You have some time to get mentally prepared.

285
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,440
How about you? How far have things gone with Sky?

286
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,360
Actually, we're already dating,

287
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,820
but I haven't told anyone yet.

288
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,920
Hey.

289
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,450
What do you mean?

290
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,860
Since when?

291
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,470
Hmm,

292
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,070
I just agreed a few days ago.

293
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,120
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

294
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,430
I didn't have the right opportunity.

295
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,360
But you're the first one to know.

296
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,950
Fine.

297
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,580
I'm glad that you've moved on from the past.

298
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:15,010
You know what? Sky had been asking about you for the past three years.

299
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,730
He asked Kla to pass me the money when he found out you had lost a lot of weight,

300
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,410
to buy you food, snacks and bring you to cafe.

301
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,380
I was so mad at him back then.

302
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,670
He didn't even like you.

303
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,820
Why was he pretending to care about you?

304
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,330
So I told him that you're trying to date someone.

305
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,790
And he stayed quiet.

306
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,390
But actually,

307
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,150
I felt sorry for him when I found out that

308
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,500
he just hadn't realized his own feeling.

309
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,050
But I'm on your side.

310
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,410
So I didn't care about him.

311
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,030
Really?

312
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,380
Yes.

313
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,430
That's why I feel so guilty toward him.

314
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,390
Do you think Sky might feel hurt

315
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,000
that I didn't tell anyone about us?

316
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,280
I don't know.

317
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,920
But if it were me, I might feel hurt for

318
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,460
not being introduced as a boyfriend.

319
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,310
But you can't compare me to Sky.

320
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,750
So do you think he might feel hurt?

321
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,750
I don't think so.

322
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,300
He is so busy with work，

323
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,380
yet he still carves out sleeping time to be with you.

324
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,190
He probably won't feel hurt.

325
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,750
The more you talk, the more anxious I get.

326
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,630
It's okay.

327
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,010
You don't have to worry.

328
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,570
He loves you so much.

329
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,330
Hmm.

330
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,510
Indeed.

331
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,220
I never thought he could try so hard for me.

332
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,090
That's why I keep telling you not to be too harsh on him.

333
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,080
Weren't you on my side?

334
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,980
Why are you taking his side?

335
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,100
No, I'm not.

336
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,470
I'm on your side.

337
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,910
I just want to see you happy.

338
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,810
I'm not taking his side.

339
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,080
You're too heartless.

340
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,470
Yes.

341
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,910
I'm not being harsh on him anymore.

342
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,990
But you were very harsh on him back then.

343
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,090
When was that?

344
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,160
I don't know.

345
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,030
He tried so hard to comfort you.

346
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,160
Really?

347
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,830
Then you don't cry to me anymore

348
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,080
if you pretend not to know now.

349
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,730
Did I cry?

350
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,070
Be careful, I might hit you.

351
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,430
You've already hit me.

352
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,660
I won't talk to you anymore.

353
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:57,730
You're something else...

354
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,800
I'm going to bed.

355
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,270
I'm going to sleep.

356
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,450
Are you really asleep?

357
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:15,770
Yes.

358
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,430
Are you chatting with someone secretly?

359
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,470
No.

360
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,510
I'm not chatting secretly.

361
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,760
I'm going to sleep.

362
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,790
[Are you asleep?]
[What are you doing?]

363
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,050
Where did he go?

364
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,610
This guy is sleeping so soundly,

365
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,040
like it's your house.

366
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:17,080
[Good night]

367
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,950
[Good night to you too]

368
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,890
What are you doing?

369
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,400
Why are you smiling so happily?

370
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,560
Sky must be busy.

371
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,210
That's why he's not answering the phone.

372
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,160
No.

373
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,620
He usually answers my calls regardless of work.

374
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,490
But he didn't even text me today.

375
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,900
And I sent him home earlier

376
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,450
because my family situation is abnormal.

377
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,310
Do you think he is mad at me for something?

378
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,310
Calm down.

379
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,710
Maybe he forgot his phone at home.

380
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,990
I'll be right back. Wait for me.

381
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,060
Where are you going?

382
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,360
Stay with me.

383
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,260
I took a leave specifically to see you.

384
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,240
Stay with me first.

385
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,410
Do you want to eat something? I'll make for you.

386
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,310
Do you want to have a try?

387
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,280
Do you want me to make it for you?

388
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,390
No.

389
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,110
I can accompany you.

390
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,930
Don't think too much.

391
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,330
Hey.

392
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,180
I'm going out for a moment.

393
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,890
I think Sky is unusually quiet.

394
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,740
He always texts me no matter how busy he is.

395
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,490
And I checked on his schedule today.

396
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,670
He's not on duty.

397
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,740
He must be mad at me for something.

398
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,700
You're quite attached to your boyfriend.

399
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,290
I think he'll call you back once he is free.

400
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,380
You stay at home for now.

401
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,710
Do whatever you want.

402
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,120
Oh.

403
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,460
Wait a moment.

404
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,750
Don't go first.

405
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,700
Wait for me, I'll go out with you later.

406
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,000
Are you going with me?

407
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,160
Yes.

408
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,070
I'll get changed and get you something.

409
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,180
Wait for me.

410
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,870
[Sky, Venus is going out.]

411
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,880
Bai Tong, what are you doing? Hurry up.

412
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,850
Okay.

413
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,420
You go upstairs, go to my room,

414
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,420
and pick some clothes for me.

415
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,940
But this is my house.

416
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,160
I want you to pick me some clothes.

417
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,120
Hurry up.

418
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,260
Come on.

419
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,020
How is this, honey?

420
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,650
Pretty good.

421
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,290
Are you tired?

422
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,160
No.

423
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:19,980
What?

424
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,650
Why is Kla here?

425
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,270
I'm sorry.

426
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,060
Haven't you two had a fight?

427
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,630
No.

428
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,830
We're very loving.

429
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,260
Go if you want.

430
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,560
I know this is your dream.

431
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,620
I'm here to cheer you on.

432
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,080
Really?

433
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,600
Are you sure you're okay?

434
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,800
We can video call.

435
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,200
Are you really okay with it?

436
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,660
I'm okay.

437
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,660
Anyway, you'll come back in the end.

438
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,580
If I can take time off, I'll fly to see you.

439
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,880
Although there's a time zone difference,

440
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,230
but as you know, doctor's working hours aren't normal.

441
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,670
Alright.

442
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,140
Let's get used to it slowly.

443
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,830
Whatever happens, we won't break up.

444
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,030
I've been busy all these years and you've endured it.

445
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,000
Now it's my turn to put up with it.

446
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,490
I love you so much.

447
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,110
Thank you for being with me.

448
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,960
I love you so much.

449
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,160
Don't even think about breaking up.

450
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,600
I won't.

451
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,120
Wait a moment.

452
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,060
Why is Sky calling me?

453
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,560
Hello?

454
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,300
Well, just wait a minute.

455
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,540
Hey.

456
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,810
Come here.
Come over here.

457
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,050
Over here, over here.

458
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,150
Hurry up.

459
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,900
Sit over here, sit over here, quickly.

460
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,040
This way, this way.

461
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,240
Oh, everyone is here.

462
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,020
Honey, sit here.

463
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,020
You can sit here too.

464
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,450
Have a seat. Feel free to sit.

465
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,100
Why are you all here?

466
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,600
Sky invited us, saying that

467
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,710
it is to celebrate the upcoming holiday.

468
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,200
At first, he wanted to pick you up himself.

469
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,000
But since you're here, just stay here.

470
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,240
Where is Sky?

471
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,100
He is in the house preparing something.

472
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,340
He'll be here soon.

473
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,420
You two haven't had a fight, have you?

474
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,820
Is there something you want to tell me?

475
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,840
Go ahead.

476
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,060
They have nothing to tell you.

477
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,630
But do you have anything to tell us?

478
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,520
Huh?

479
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,190
It's not a big deal.

480
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,430
It's just that

481
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,480
Sky and I are in a relationship.

482
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,750
I didn't mean to keep it from everyone,

483
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,200
but I didn't have the chance to say it.

484
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,630
Oh.

485
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,620
We didn't know anything about this.

486
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,500
Yeah, we had no idea.

487
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,570
Wow.

488
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,690
Did everyone know?

489
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,290
No.

490
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,790
No one knew.

491
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,070
I had no idea, you hid it pretty well.

492
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,740
Just you wait.

493
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,660
To be honest,

494
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,010
have you really thought this through?

495
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,380
Yes.

496
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,640
How about breaking up?

497
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,430
You should find someone more normal than my brother.

498
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,930
Hey.

499
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,440
Who are these two?

500
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,120
What are their names?

501
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,740
Introduce yourself.

502
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,290
My name is Tin.

503
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,660
My name is Tul.

504
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,980
We are Sky's cousins.

505
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,170
Seriously, we've been wanting to meet you for a long time.

506
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,080
Sky brags about you when he calls aunts and uncles.

507
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,570
You know what? He's a big bragger.

508
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,230
I thought he was just making it up.

509
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,230
Yeah.

510
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,600
Why would you date my brother?

511
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,830
He is so talkative and stubborn.

512
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,989
How could you not see his flaws?

513
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,010
You must be really annoyed.

514
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,270
I agree with that too.

515
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,290
It's not that I didn't see his flaws.

516
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,739
In fact, Sky has many good qualities.

517
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:45,110
I'm not perfect either.

518
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,130
And there were times when I got mad at him to the point of blocking him.

519
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,780
It is really frustrating.

520
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,480
You shouldn't have unblocked him.

521
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:02,820
What?

522
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,610
You should tell Day too when he arrives.

523
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,870
You bought so many things. Who did you invite?

524
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,510
Lower your voice.

525
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,530
He might hear you.

526
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,310
Come on.

527
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,120
I invited Janus and Bomb.

528
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,200
Also you and Bai Tong.

529
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,060
Oh, and my twin cousins.

530
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,380
They don't believe that someone like me would have a boyfriend.

531
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:06,060
So I asked them to come over to see how loving we are.

532
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,460
Oh.

533
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,960
I almost forgot about Day.

534
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,490
He'll come over after his duty.

535
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,690
Don't slack off and give me a helping hand.

536
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,440
Hurry up.

537
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,950
What do I take leave to come here for?

538
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,950
To prepare. Go check the table over there.

539
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,780
Is that a good place to put it?

540
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,790
I'm so happy

541
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,170
to hear someone speak from the heart.

542
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,830
You eavesdropped on me?

543
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,880
Did you plan it?

544
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,000
No.

545
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,900
I didn't eavesdrop on you.

546
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,580
I just happened to come by, so I heard it.

547
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,730
I didn't expect you to tell them.

548
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,450
Actually, I wanted to tell everyone when you confessed to me.

549
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,300
You're not angry, are you?

550
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,650
I've prepared a surprise for you.

551
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,990
I'm sorry for not calling you.

552
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,940
I'm not angry.

553
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,680
Really?

554
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:06,960
Are you really not angry?

555
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,240
Really?

556
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:09,800
Yeah.

557
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,520
Hey!

558
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:13,970
Oh.

559
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,000
If you're not angry, you should show us that you're not angry.

560
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,010
Stop! No!

561
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,460
People are watching.

562
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,730
Don't you feel ashamed in front of your cousins?

563
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,120
Aren't you two going to stop?

564
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,220
Stop now. Don't challenge us.

565
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,220
Enough.

566
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,500
Hey.

567
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,060
Can I still make it to your gathering?

568
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,880
-Yes. -Of course.

569
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,030
-Come on. -Day, hurry up.

570
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,730
Sit here.

571
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,120
Sit.

572
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:03,960
Day, come sit here.

573
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:04,560
No!

574
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,550
Just sit over there.

575
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,330
Sit next to Tong.

576
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,210
But I don't have a chair for you.

577
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,280
It's okay.

578
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,630
Put your bags down first.

579
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,220
I brought a chair with me.

580
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,950
Wow, you come well prepared.

581
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,190
So did all of you take time off to come here?

582
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,190
Yes.

583
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,410
It's going to be a long vacation, so it was easy to ask for leave.

584
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,110
Ahem.

585
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:36,310
Ask Day to listen carefully, boyfriend.

586
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,950
What are you going to say?

587
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,400
Sky and I are dating.

588
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,920
Congratulations, Venus.

589
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,960
Is there anything to eat?

590
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,370
I'm so hungry.

591
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,340
I came here right after I got off work at the hospital.

592
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:51,640
What the hell?

593
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,420
Is that all you've got?

594
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,220
Or you don't believe it?

595
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,610
Or you don't want to hear it from Venus?

596
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,490
Honestly, who wouldn't believe that?

597
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,880
You would spread the word even when you pass by someone.

598
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:12,110
You know what? A few days ago, he told a nurse 
that his boyfriend wanted to grind his teeth.

599
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,800
He even bragged to me that Venus bit him.

600
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,790
I really want to fix his brain.

601
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,890
Why did you show off in front of everyone?

602
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,160
What's there to brag about?

603
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,900
I'm just very proud.

604
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,970
My boyfriend bit me.

605
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,160
It was meant to be a punishment.

606
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,590
What's there to brag about?

607
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,920
I don't know.

608
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,600
But this scar is so obvious.

609
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,090
I want to show off to everyone in the hospital clinic.

610
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,650
Since today is a good day,

611
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:48,130
I would like to sing a song as a gift for both of you.

612
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,080
Wait.

613
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,220
Who are they?

614
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,440
Hey, introduce yourself.

615
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,870
This is the second time.

616
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,490
Yes.

617
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,670
I'm Tin.

618
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,880
I'm Tul.

619
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,040
Yes.

620
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,750
They are my cousins.

621
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,080
Oh.

622
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,160
We are working hard for our dreams.

623
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,150
Please give us some encouragement.

624
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,530
Of course.

625
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,070
Come on.

626
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,650
♫Someone who has never fallen in love♫

627
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,250
♫ wouldn't understand the significance of love♫

628
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,910
♫People who cherish love with all their heart♫

629
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:33,610
♫Make me can't fall in love with others again ♫

630
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:43,730
♫ Do you know how much I've changed?♫

631
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,730
♫But my heart still belongs to you♫

632
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:54,260
♫I love you every moment♫

633
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,190
♫Please remember♫

634
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:04,280
♫I only love you♫

635
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,640
♫Please remember♫

636
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:15,060
♫I only love you♫

637

♫Only you♫

638
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,720
Great.

639
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,710
Thank you.

640
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:27,280
We wish Venus and Sky to be in love forever.

641
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:31,370
And we wish the rest of you to always be happy.

642
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,170
Is this a wedding ceremony?

643
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,400
I can only live happily with popcorn.

644
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,380
Cheers.

645
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:39,900
Here.

646
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,500
Uh.

647
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,020
Cheers.

648
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,930
I don't have a glass.

649
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,190
This...

650
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,150
Here you go.

651
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,600
There's just one empty cup left.

652
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:45,900
Come on.

653
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,860
Cheers.

654
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,920
Cheers!

655
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,780
Cheers.

656
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,350
Venus.

657
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,690
Let's go home.

658
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,310
I got something for you.

659
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,190
No. Can't you show me here?

660
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,790
No.

661
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,420
I can only show it to you at home.

662
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:49,630
Okay?

663
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,630
Fine. Let's go.

664
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,150
Let's go.

665
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,480
We're going back.

666
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,540
Bye.

667
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,130
I'm going back. I'm leaving now.

668
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:00,960
Bye.

669
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,170
Be careful on the way.

670
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,910
Sky, wait until we get home.

671
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,130
Let's sleep when we get back.

672
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,770
Let's go.

673
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:09,890
Everyone.

674
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,590
Go back inside and continue drinking if you can still manage.

675
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:14,900
Okay?

676
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,440
Janus and I will stay outside.

677
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:19,620
Come on.

678
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,610
I think we'd better drink in the house.

679
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,560
-They're going to make out here. -Let's go.

680
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,150
Are you alright?

681
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,140
Let's go. It's raining.

682
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:28,580
Let's go.

683
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:29,670
Does your tent keep the rain out?

684
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,320
Don't you want to stay outside?

685
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,170
Let's go.

686
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,810
Where are you going?

687
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,350
Just stay here.

688
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,150
They all left, J.

689
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,790
Stay right here.

690
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,040
Do you like it?

691
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:38,870
I prepared it specially for you.

692
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,680
Yeah.

693
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:43,930
I like it.

694
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,250
I like it very much.

695
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,840
I love you very much.

696
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,890
I want to promise you once again.

697
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:15,130
From now on, we will always be in love.

698
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:26,130
That insensitive, stupid Sky will never show up again.

699
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,030
Yeah.

700
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,430
Okay.

701
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:13,850
Ever since I met you, I can't control my heart anymore.

702
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:19,570
I never stopped loving you.

703
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,110
I love you.

704
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,160
I love you so much.

705
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,210
Yeah.

706
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:43,190
You can't leave after this kiss.

707
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,410
You have to stay by my side for the rest of your life, okay?

708
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:51,750
Okay.

709
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,170
I want to be with you forever.

710
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:04,270
There is no patch of Sky that loves you, Venus, more than I do.

711
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,800
But

712
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:14,230
you're up there.

713
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,670
Can you stay up there, still?

714
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,340
Huh?

715
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,290
I meant my waist.

716
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,640
It hurts.

717
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:25,700
Ah.

718
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,180
Can you reward the romantic Sky today?

719
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,090
Okay?

720
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,640
Okay?

721
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:42,950
Okay?

722
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:48,500
Yeah.

723
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,500
I'll reward you for the entire night.

724
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,560
Don't lie to me.

725
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,680
Do you like it?

726
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:40,160
Sky.

727
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,420
It hurts.

728
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:44,780
Be gentle.

729
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,430
I can't.

730
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,600
I've been holding it up for a long time.

731
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,010
Can I be a bit tougher this time?

732
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:54,740
Do you like it?

733
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,830
Why did you do it so many times?

734
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:01,900
Are you comfortable?

735
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,610
I like it so much.

736
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,430
Do you like it?

737
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,240
Yes.

738
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:41,520
I like it.

739
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,840
I like it so much.

740
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:49,950
Haven't you finished yet?

741
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:51,520
Hey.

742
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,260
Give me ten more minutes.

743
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,430
You've been dressing up for an hour.

744
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,350
Oh.

745
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,240
Honey, I can't dress casually.

746
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,680
I'm meeting your parents today.

747
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,500
Why are you so nervous?

748
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,440
Just a little.

749
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:16,440
Hurry up.

750
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:53,030
[Watch the store for me today. 
I'm going to have lunch with Bomb's parents.

751
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:57,590
[Come on. Don't worry.]

752
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:05,880
Sky.

753
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,030
Wake up.

754
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,490
Let me sleep a little longer.

755
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,330
Go back to sleep then.

756
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,610
I'm going to look after the store for my brother.

757
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:30,100
Are you coming back here to sleep tonight?

758
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:33,530
I'm not sure.

759
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:34,860
We'll see then.

760
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,770
Then I won't let you go to work.

761
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,020
You're not coming back, anyway.

762
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:47,350
What?

763
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:48,620
Are you still a kid?

764
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,590
Yes, I'm a kid.

765
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,820
I'm a kid.

766
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,900
Okay, I'll sleep here tonight.

767
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,520
So cute.

768
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:08,460
I'll pick you up in my car after work.

769
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:10,420
Okay.

770
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:11,840
Work hard.

771
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:12,630
Keep it up.

772
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:17,740
Okay.

773
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,970
I want to be with you like this every day, Venus.

774
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:27,760
Me too.

775
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,960
Let me sleep for five more minutes.

776
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,280
Let me go.

777
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,120
Let me sleep a bit longer.

778
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:47,110
Just five more minutes.

779
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:48,910
I'm going to time it.

780
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,600
Wow, you answered so quickly.

781
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,910
I miss you so much.

782
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,660
I'm off work.

783
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,220
But I don't want to sleep.

784
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,210
I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to hear my phone ringing if I fell asleep.

785
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:14,040
Oh.

786
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,780
You don't have to torture yourself.

787
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,960
I want to.

788
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,440
Also, did you receive the parcel I sent you?

789
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,470
Yes.

790
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,340
You‘ve sent me many things.

791
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,540
Just some snacks you like.

792
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:31,190
Didn't you say there's no good food over there?

793
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,410
Yes.

794
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,890
Thank you.

795
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,330
I'm so happy that you're so sweet.

796
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:42,200
I'm not as sweet as you.

797
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,690
It's not that bad.

798
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:48,960
How about you? Did you get used to the lifestyle over there?

799
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,270
Yes.

800
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:51,370
I'm used to it now.

801
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,740
I'm not as tired as when I just got here.

802
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,290
But there are still some places which I am not familiar with.

803
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,520
It's not like Thailand.

804
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,670
The language and food are different.

805
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:03,710
And...

806
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:04,230
What?

807
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:09,320
I feel lonely without you.

808
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,810
I can't pinpoint my feelings.

809
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,220
I don't want to be apart from you.

810
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,510
Keep chasing your dream.

811
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,530
Don't be afraid.

812
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:19,380
I'll wait for you to come back.

813
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:21,880
Thank you for waiting for me so patiently.

814
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,480
Take care of yourself, baby.

815
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,880
Eat well and have more delicious food.

816
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:28,870
I'll call you again.

817
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:31,020
Love you.

818
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:50,150
What?

819
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,390
My friend is in such a good mood.

820
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,070
Of course.

821
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,680
I have a boyfriend to cheer me up.

822
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,910
So, I'm in a good mood every day.

823
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,950
Unlike someone

824
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:05,270
who has been wearing a frown

825
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,680
and draining my energy since the moment he walked in.

826
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,550
You troll me whenever you have a chance.

827
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:12,090
Of course.

828
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:13,670
You always tease me.

829
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,310
You deserve it.

830
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:21,580
By the way, you take Venus home. Did his brother say anything? 
Won't he be worried?

831
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,690
He didn't say anything.

832
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:28,710
Oh my God, Sky.

833
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:32,550
You're smart at everything except relationships.

834
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:37,080
Think about it. Venus is his only brother.

835
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,260
He'll be worried no matter what.

836
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,440
He probably doesn't want to tell you.

837
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:45,030
Yeah.

838
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,080
I forgot to think about that.

839
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:53,160
I think you should have a formal conversation with his brother.

840
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:55,970
Okay.

841
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,820
Thank you.

842
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,970
I'll talk to his brother

843
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:03,980
and tell him not to worry about Venus.

844
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:06,750
That's right.

845
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,160
You're smart at everything except relationships.

846
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,190
What?

847
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:17,630
Gosh.

848
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,990
If I hadn't cherished my iPad, I would have thrown it at you.

849
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:31,030
[711 Convenience Store]

850
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,610
I would like to have a drink.

851
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,940
What would you like?

852
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:49,300
A cup of Thai milk tea. Ease on the sugar and spread more love.

853
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:50,740
It's sold out.

854
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,470
Then I'll take the seller instead.

855
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:57,530
Because the seller

856
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,230
is also delicious.

857
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:02,120
You rascal, Sky.

858
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:04,500
I only act like a rascal in front of you.

859
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,100
Don't you try being a rascal to someone else.

860
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:12,490
No.

861
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:15,670
Are you getting off work?

862
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,250
Let's go home together.

863
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,190
There's still a little bit of work left to wrap up.

864
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:25,310
I need to go home and get changed.

865
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,210
Sure.

866
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,290
Take more clothes with you this time.

867
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,280
So you don't have to go back home as often.

868
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:34,170
No.

869
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,960
Now my brother is already complaining that I don't come home.

870
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:41,290
Okay.

871
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:44,800
Are you done?

872
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,330
Not yet.

873
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:50,950
Let's go home.

874
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:53,350
Hurry up.

875
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:54,760
Okay.

876
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:26,360
I don't think your parents like me.

877
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:28,970
Why do you think so?

878
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,390
Didn't you feel it? It was very serious.

879
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,940
Your parents didn't talk much, either.

880
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,730
Baby.

881
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:41,210
Don't overthink.

882
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:44,030
It's all in the past.

883
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,780
Don't worry about other things.

884
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,880
Okay?

885
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,020
I promise

886
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,550
I won't break up with you, no matter what.

887
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:00,710
But they are your parents.

888
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:08,380
But you're the one who holds my hand.

889
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,100
Didn't you tell me that too?

890
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:12,480
Right?

891
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:29,350
My mom.

892
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,550
Hello, Mom.

893
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:41,540
Let me talk to Janus.

894
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:48,460
My mom wants to talk to you.

895
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:50,790
I don't want to.

896
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,710
Hello, Mom.

897
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:03,090
I'm sorry.

898
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,990
Hello, ma'am.

899
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,540
Break up with Bomb.

900
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,750
I won't break up with him.

901
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:23,140
No matter how many times you ask me to break up with Bomb,

902
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,120
I can't do it.

903
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:31,300
Because I don't want to leave Bomb.

904
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:37,850
No matter how many tests we have to face in the future,

905
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:41,190
I'll hold Bomb's hand.

906
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:44,130
We'll overcome the difficulties together.

907
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,750
I won't leave Bomb behind.

908
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:55,070
So... ma'am, can you give us another chance?

909
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:56,970
I understand.

910
01:04:57,050 --> 01:04:58,780
Please take good care of Bomb.

911
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,320
Wait.

912
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,350
What did you say, ma'am?

913
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:08,550
Thank you for taking care of Bomb.

914
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,050
I know what you've been through. I've seen everything.

915
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:17,630
I just wanted to test whether you'd hold on to Bomb.

916
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:19,570
Thank you very much.

917
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,330
Thank you, ma'am.

918
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,610
You can call me "Mom" now.

919
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:29,670
Okay, Mom.

920
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,810
Thank you so much, Mom.

921
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:33,780
Okay.

922
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:36,360
Baby,

923
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:38,110
your mom has accepted me.

924
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:40,100
She accepted me.

925
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:41,820
Okay, okay.

926
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:47,700
How is it?

927
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,090
You can relax now.

928
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,670
It's like a boulder lifted from my shoulders.

929
01:05:54,720 --> 01:06:00,380
At last, Janus has finally become the legal son-in-law of a Chinese.

930
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:05,990
By the way, where is your mother from?

931
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,860
Chaozhou, Guangdong, or Hainan?

932
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:09,160
I can practice her hometown dialect.

933
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:11,990
No need.

934
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,040
My mom also speaks Thai.

935
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:16,290
Are you crazy?

936
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:18,290
I'm so excited.

937
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:19,960
Let's go inside.

938
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,760
I'm going to practice singing a Chinese song.

939
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:32,330
That's enough. Let's go.

940
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:48,960
You're ridiculous. Go inside.

941
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:52,350
Bye, Mom.

942
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,300
I miss this room so much.

943
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:03,700
It's been a long time.

944
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:05,550
What?

945
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,120
It's only been two weeks.

946
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:08,800
Are you sure?

947
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:10,480
Are you sure you want to sleep here tonight?

948
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:12,370
I'll go home to get my clothes.

949
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,140
Don't bother.

950
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:15,250
We'll only sleep here for one night.

951
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:16,560
You can wear my clothes.

952
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:18,470
Okay.

953
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:23,750
Scented candle.

954
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:29,260
I think my brother used it.

955
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:30,760
Look.

956
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:33,360
No.

957
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:35,130
I'm taking it with me tomorrow.

958
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:42,330
Venus.

959
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:44,710
What's wrong?

960
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:54,740
What are you going to say?

961
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,750
You suddenly become very serious.

962
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:59,860
Do you remember what I said to you this morning?

963
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:02,790
What?

964
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:08,780
I said, "I want to be with you forever."

965
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:11,140
I mean it.

966
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:14,620
I'm at your home every day.

967
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:21,340
I mean, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

968
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:28,490
I want to see your face every morning when I wake up.

969
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:35,609
Every night after work, I want to recharge with you.

970
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:43,029
I want to hug you, kiss you, and hold your hand.

971
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:50,090
I've been so happy ever since you've come back into my life.

972
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,720
What about you? Do you feel the same?

973
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:11,630
Me too.

974
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:26,450
You said it.

975
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,170
You can't change your mind.

976
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,939
You promised to spend the rest of your life with me.

977
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:34,790
Yes.

978
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,439
Okay.

979
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,970
I'm so excited.

980
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:00,580
What should I prepare to become the son-in-law of a Chinese?

981
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,740
Why are you so excited?

982
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,620
My hair is standing on end.

983
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,860
You came together?

984
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:19,530
Are you going to run away from home?

985
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,510
Or did you forget that you have a brother?

986
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:25,870
How could I forget you?

987
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,200
I only have one brother.

988
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,530
Sky and I have something to tell you.

989
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:37,030
What is it?

990
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:39,320
Look at your face.

991
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:41,280
Is it something serious?

992
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:44,400
Well...

993
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,190
Uh...

994
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:50,450
I...

995
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,000
Well...it's...

996
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:54,630
Can I hear you say it by the end of today?

997
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:04,430
J,

998
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,680
I have something to tell you.

999
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,170
So, what is it?

1000
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,520
From now on, I want to take responsibility for taking care of Venus from you.

1001
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:39,880
What do you mean?

1002
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,960
I love Venus.

1003
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:56,420
Can I become part of your family?

1004
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:01,600
I'll spend the rest of my life with Venus.

1005
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:05,270
I won't make you sad again.

1006
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,770
Are you saying

1007
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,770
that you're taking Venus away from me?

1008
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,220
Yes.

1009
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,750
I want your permission.

1010
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,950
I want to do the thing right

1011
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,280
so you won't worry about Venus.

1012
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,530
J.

1013
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:52,840
If Venus chooses the person whom he will spend his life in the future,

1014
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:57,890
I can't compel him

1015
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:02,550
to live with me

1016
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,780
or to love me until he dies.

1017
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:10,210
Please take good care of him.

1018
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,100
J.

1019
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:16,200
Hold his hand tightly.

1020
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,000
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

1021
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,480
Thank you, J.

1022
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:24,100
I'll take good care of Venus.

1023
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,710
From now on, Sky, you can move in any time you want.

1024
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,880
You're welcome.

1025
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:36,470
Thank you.

1026
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:40,840
What's wrong?

1027
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:42,710
Why are you crying?

1028
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:44,670
I'm going to cry with you.

1029
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:46,800
I'm just happy.

1030
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,290
Like a child.

1031
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,320
Thank you.

1032
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:11,510
For what?

1033
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:12,780
I didn't say anything.

1034
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,470
Thank you for giving me another chance to come back to you.

1035
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:21,690
I didn't give you a chance.

1036
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,940
It's you who kept chasing me.

1037
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,020
True.

1038
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:31,610
But you were so cruel.

1039
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:33,790
You didn't show me any mercy.

1040
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:35,590
I'm in love with you now.

1041
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:37,110
Let go of the past.

1042
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:39,010
Okay.

1043
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:41,050
I love you no matter what.

1044
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:46,810
Don't abandon me once you have me.

1045
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:49,530
That's what I was going to say.

1046
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,090
Whoever says it first wins.

1047
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:54,110
You're so bad.

1048
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:56,340
Venus.

1049
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:57,690
What?

1050
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:02,760
You're so heavy.

1051
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:04,620
Sky.

1052
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,140
I can't feel my legs.

1053
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,680
Just kidding.

1054
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:12,690
Didn't you say your legs were numb?

1055
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:14,730
Just kidding.

1056
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:17,760
How could I lift you up last night if you were heavy?

1057
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,530
Rascal.

1058
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:23,490
Do you want to do it with me again tonight?

1059
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,680
I'm really strong.

1060
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,640
I can lift you up many times.

1061
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:29,640
Let go of me.

1062
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:32,220
Let me hug you.

1063
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:33,290
A little longer.

1064
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:36,270
Don't be mad at me.

1065
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,710
Don't be mad at me.

1066
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,120
Give me a kiss.

1067
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,700
Lean closer. I can't kiss you.

1068
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,950
You won't be able to kiss me anymore.

1069
01:15:51,540 --> 01:16:03,020
[Watch the uncut version online exclusively on iQIYI and iQ.com]

1070
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:53,640
Because I'm going to kiss you.

1071
01:15:58,760 --> 01:15:59,690
I love you.

1072
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:01,020
Yes.

1073
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,020
I love you too, Sky.
