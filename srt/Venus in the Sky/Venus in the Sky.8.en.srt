Bomb was Vee's senior.

3
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,190
He's been chasing Vee

4
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,450
since Vee was in middle school.

5
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,930
What's wrong?

6
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,050
I think I understand now, Kla.

7
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,090
I understand why Vee has been neglecting my feelings.

8
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,390
What happened? Are you okay?

9
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,289
I don't know what I should do anymore.

10
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,020
I've done everything.

11
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,990
I've done everything I can.

12
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,090
But you know what?

13
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,190
No matter how hard I try,

14
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,360
it's not enough to change Vee's mind about me.

15
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,100
Calm down.

16
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,320
You might just be tired right now.

17
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,480
There always seems to be an obstacle

18
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,390
between me and Vee.

19
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,390
I don't like this feeling.

20
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,890
I don't know what you're going through.

21
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,660
but I believe you can do it.

22
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,920
I also believe that Venus can see your efforts.

23
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,290
Maybe I made my efforts too late.

24
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,690
Get some rest and don't think too much.

25
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,460
Okay.

26
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,890

00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,520
Did you call me

for a reason,

48
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,550
or is it because you had an argument with Sky?

No, we didn't.

He's nice. He's really nice.

Yes.

53
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,920
Before, I thought that my feelings for him

54
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,060
had faded away.

55
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,390
But it's not the case.

56
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,250
I still have feelings for him.

57
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,090
The more he is kind to me

58
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,190
and tries to do things for me,

59
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,190
the more I feel that my feelings for him

60
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,360
have never really disappeared from my heart.

61
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,490
I've just hidden them well.

62
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,660
Then why don't you start dating him?

63
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,960
I'm afraid.

64
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,090
I'm afraid of mistakenly thinking he likes me like before.

65
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,890
If we are not looking for the same thing,

66
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,620
what should I do?

67
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,520
If I express my feelings to him,

68
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,960
but he's not the same as before,

69
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,660
I won't be able to handle it.

70
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,890
Yes, I understand.

71
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,060
But what if he's doing all of this,

72
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,830
trying to please me and inviting me to places,

73
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,590
just out of guilt?

74
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,230
What if he doesn't genuinely like me?

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,860
Calm down.

76
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,390
Whether Sky's feelings towards you

77
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,260
are genuine,

78
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,360

Try to follow your heart,

80

and when the day comes that you're certain, you can respond to him.

Thank you.

83

Did you tell Tonkla about your two-week job in Taiwan?

84
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,830
Not yet.

85
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,020
Every time I got the chance to say it, I forgot.

86
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,790
Then why don't you send him a message?

87
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,460
It's fine to tell him later.

88
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,300
It's just two weeks.

89
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,590
To be honest, Tong.

90
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,950
You should have told him from the beginning even if it's just 2 weeks, right?

91
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,090
You're leaving in a few days.

92
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,060
I just made up with him.

93
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,320
I don't want to tell him and spoil the atmosphere.

94
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,220
Besides, right now, both he and I

95
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,820
are busy with our own lives.

96
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,750
To be honest,

97
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,159
sometimes I wonder

98
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,760
if we can hold hands and keep going.

99
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,560
You've been through everything together,

100
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,830
so don't overthink it. Keep going!

101
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:06,090
OK, you shouldn't overthink it either.

102
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,190
I want to see you happy too.

103
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay.

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,790
-Okay. See you later. -Bye.

105
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,260
Goodbye, let's leave it at that for now.

106
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,420
That's weird. He usually texts me every morning.

107
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,860
Or is it too early?

108
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,060
Coming.

109
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,790
I'm coming to open the door.

110
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,160
I'll open it.

111
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,960
Why are you in such a hurry?

112
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,420
-What are you doing here? -Eh.

113
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,190
I'm here to deliver a package.

114
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,190
I'm sorry.

115
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,260
I didn't mean to say that. I thought it was someone else.

116
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,420
It's okay.

117
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,860
Are you Mr. Jetthanat?

118
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,990
It's mine.

119
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,020
Hurry up and give me my thing.

120
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,320
Give me my thing.

121
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,160
What did you buy?

122
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,250
I'm not telling you.

123
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,230
It is a cylindrical object,

124
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,690
and it vibrates.

125
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,160
Give it to me!

126
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,430
What?

127
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,560
Sir? Sir?

128
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,490

I'm sorry.

131
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,290
I'm sorry.

132
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,650
Why are you lost in thought so early in the morning?

133
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,460
Are you feeling unwell?

134
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,360
No, I'm fine, just a little dizzy.

135
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,730
Probably because I stayed up late last night.

136
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,460
Well,

137
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,990
you should go home and rest then.

138
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,950
No, I'll stay here.

139
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,060
It saves on air conditioning costs, and there's food to eat.

140
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,290
Are you sure you're okay?

141
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,630
Or is there something on your mind,

142
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,290
or have you encountered any problems?

143
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,090
No.

144
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,190
I'm just thinking about what's about to expire,

145
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,230
and I want to eat it.

146
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,790
Humph.

147
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,890
I'm worried about you.

148
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,430
I'll go check the food.

149
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,190
That way, I won't feel drowsy.

150
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,160
Okay.

151
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,020
Eat whatever you want.

It's too hot.

161
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,000
No, it's a waste of gas for such a short distance.

162
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,930
Just ride a bicycle.

163
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,550
Bro, please.

164
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,750
I'll send them later.

165

Oh wow, a miracle happened, thank you!

166
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,250
Stop it, Ank.

167
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,260
And you. Aren’t you feeling unwell?

168
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,460
Just let Ank go.

169
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,530
It's okay, finding something to do can make me feel better.

170
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,620
Okay?

171
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,350
Hey.

172
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,530
Okay.

Okay.

177
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,460
You don't want to go to nearby places, do you?

178
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,420
Yes, bro.

179
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,390
I have another order.

180
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,810

181
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,420
and 7 cases of 1-liter drinking water.

182
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,150
Yes.

183
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,090
There's no car.

184
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,830
No car?

185
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,390
Yes.

186
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,330
-Oh... -You go and deliver them, hurry.

187
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,120
How should I go, bro?

188
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,830
On foot.

189
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,530
Can you go with me?

190
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,350
Go ahead.

191
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,090
Come on.

192
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,790
Hurry up!

193
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,860
Okay.

194
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,420
Sly little one.

195
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,890
Thank you.

196
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,350
Vee?

197
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,450
Oh, Day.

198
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,690
Are you here to deliver?

199
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,430
Oh, yes.

200
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,090
You can't find your customer?

201
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,420
Are you here for Sky?

202
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,790
Did he order these things? Should I take them to him?

203
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,850
These were ordered by a patient's family.

204
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,860
Oh, really?

205
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,150
Yes.

206
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,820
Vee, do you have something to say?

207
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,790
Is Sky busy lately?

208
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,530
Lately? He's as busy as usual.

209
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,890
Vee, what's up?

210
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,590
Oh, nothing.

211
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,920
I'm going to deliver the goods first.

212
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,330
The customer is calling.

213
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,250
There must be something wrong.

214
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,860
Get back to work.

215
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,530
Hey, Sky. I met Venus just now.

216
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,760
Really?

217
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,220
He must be here to deliver goods.

218
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,090
What are you doing?

219
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,850
Are you happy or not?

220
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,120
You made me confused.

221
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,760
You used to annoyingly show off Venus in front of me.

222
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,890
What?

223
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,620
Did you have a fight?

224
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,760
No.

225
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,490
Then what happened?

226
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,760
It's my own business.

227
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,620
Are you accusing me of being nosy?

228
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,160
Alright, you better remember this.

229
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,450
Speaking to me like that,

230
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,090
I won't help you anymore.

231
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:24,460
What are you doing? Are you busy?

232
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,130
What's wrong with you?

233
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,230
You haven't replied to my messages for several days.

234
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,990
Normally, even if you're busy, you'd still send a message to let me know, right?

235
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,430
What's wrong? So agitated early in the morning?

236
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,260
No, nothing's wrong.

237
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,250
But I feel like something's bothering you.

238
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,090
Just someone who is usually a talkative person is silent now.

239
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,150
Well...

240
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,850
And?

241
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,820
What do you think is the reason?

242
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,930
Well,

243
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,300
did you make him angry or uncomfortable?

244
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,500
No.

245
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,760
No.

246
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,260
I didn't.

247
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,020
If you didn't do anything,

248
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,830
he's probably just tired.

249
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,990
Tired?

250
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,050
Just let him rest for a while

251
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,090
and send him a message later.

252
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,760
What should I send?

253
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,630
Usually, we only talk about work.

254
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,820
Umm...

255
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,320
How does he usually text you?

256
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,630
Just like that.

257
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,690
Oh.

258
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,160
Five missed calls from Tong.

259
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Hey, baby. I'm sorry. I had to check on a patient earlier.

260
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,690
How's work?

261
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,160
It's quite hectic.

262
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,060
But for this task, I'm just in a management role

263
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,620
and have the junior members in the team handle the design.

264
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,620
Are you planning to come home? What time will you be back?

265
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,350
I'm on my way back now. Do you miss me?

266
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,420
Of course.

267
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,990
You've only been gone for a day, and I already miss you.

268
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,020
We hardly get to meet during a week,

269
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,830
and you never say you miss me.

270
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,790
I'll say it more often in the future.

271
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,850
Oh, baby, well...

272
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,190
Baby, wait.

273
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,590
Someone is calling me. Let's talk later.

274
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,260
Hello?

275
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,860
Doctor, there's an emergency patient. Are you available now?

276
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,160
Yes, I'll head down right away.

277
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,920
[The worker has already put up the soundproof panels]

278
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,650
[Have you finished work? Go check the job. I'll be at your place waiting for you]

279
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,630
[Are you busy? Why aren't you responding?]

280
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,390
Alas.

281
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,190
Not even a single response?

282
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,460
Is he upset about something?

283
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,420
Whether Sky's feelings towards you

284
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,690
are genuine,

285
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,760
only you can truly perceive.

286
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,650
Try to follow your heart.

287
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,220
and when the day comes that you're certain, you can respond to him.

288
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,260
Why? Why aren't you replying?

289
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,890
I won't forget, sister.

290
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,290
Give me two more weeks, sister.

291
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,690
I can pay the full amount in one installment at that time.

292
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:28,190
Or if you're not okay with it, I can pay it in three installments at once.

293
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,390
Sister, I've never thought of avoiding payment.

294
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,830
My home is also in this area, and my shop is already open.

295
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,560
I'm not going anywhere.

296
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,360
Sister?

297
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:38,920
Sister?

298
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,090
Who are you talking to? Your mistress?

299
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,890
I'm going to tell on Bomb.

300
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,760
What are you talking about?

301
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,620
I was talking about work.

302
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,950
By the way, where are you going at this hour?

303
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,100
I need to do something.

304
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,450
What is it at midnight?

305
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,230
I'm leaving. I'll be back soon.

306
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,160
Wait.

307
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,360
Buy me some porridge. I'm hungry.

308
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,860
Okay, I'll buy it for you later.

309
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,720
Okay.

310
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,880
It's done. Thank you.

311
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,820
Your pen.

312
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,090
-Keep it. -Okay.

313
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,990
I've finally finished work.

314
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,530
Vee!

315
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,260
Hey, Vee!

316
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,590
Oh, Day.

317
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,650
Where are you in such a hurry to? Why do you look so rushed?

318
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,140
I came to see Sky.

319
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,790
Oh, I ran into you.

320
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,830
Is Sky on duty? Which building?

321
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,430
Yes, he's on duty today. I'll take you there.

322
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,860
By the way, what brings you here?

323
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,020
Why did you come to see him so late?

324
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,590
Well...

325
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,220
Did you have an argument? Sky was unusually quiet today too.

326
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,560
No, but I don't know what's wrong with him.

327
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,730
Take me to him.

328
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,060
OK.

329
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,760
He should be in the ward. I'll take you there.

330
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:18,660
Let's go.

331
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,520
Alas.

332
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,130
Come in.

333
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,820
Vee.

334
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,920
Are you here to deliver?

335
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,180
Yes, delivering it for someone.

336
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,390
Sky.

337
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,460
What's up?

338
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,830
Why aren't you replying?

339
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,620
There are many patients recently.

340
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,520
I'll have to take a shower in a while

341
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,990
and then continue my shift.

342
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,620
Are you really okay?

343
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,890
I'm fine.

344
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,690
Go home.

345
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,360
It's late.

346
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,150
I don't believe it.

347
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,860
Why did you change suddenly?

348
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,090
You've been quiet,

349
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,030
not replying or sending me messages.

350
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,160
What's going on, just tell me.

351
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,060
Didn't you say you'd wait for my answer?

352
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,690
I'm still waiting.

353
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,420
But I don't know how much my efforts

354
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,520
mean to you.

355
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,690
If you're already talking to someone or have feelings for someone,

356
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,590
you can just tell me.

357
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,450
I understand.

358
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,360
Why did you like me back then?

359
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,120
What was the previous Sky like?

360
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,090
Why did you like him?

361
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,360
Tell me.

362
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,220
Why is it so difficult between you and me?

363
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,060
My love

364
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,120
has clearly filled this place.

365
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,060
I really want to be close to you,

366
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,990
hold your hand,

367
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,190
kiss your face,

368
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,730
and kiss your mouth.

369
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,730
I'm jealous

370
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,550
and possessive of you.

371
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,290
But I can't do anything.

372
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,960
I can't even hold your hand right now.

373
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,750
I can't do anything to you.

374
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,950
Isn't that easy?

375
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,860
Now,

376
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,330
the only person who's talking to me

377
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
is Sky.

378
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,360
Why are you crying?

379
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,860
Thank you.

380
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,030
Have you missed me?

381
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,060
Do you have feelings for me now?

382
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,620
Since you're here,

383
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,050
can I test the soundproof panel

384
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,120
to see if it works well?

385
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,930
Come on, I'm also curious

386
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,690
about how you want to test it.

387
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,830
Well...

388
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,050
Don't you have to go on duty?

389
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,860
Go take a shower.

390
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,260
I still have some time.

391
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,630
I can stay with you for another half hour.

392
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,760
Okay.

393
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,290
Do you prefer me to be gentle or rough?

394
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,320
As long as it's you,

395
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:26,330
I like it either way.

396
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,360
One more round.

397
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,720
Enough.

398
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,530
Aren't you tired? You worked all day.

399
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,590
I can't feel it when I have you in my arms.

400
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:49,850
Come on, let's do it again.

401
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,490
Go take a shower.

402
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,660
Hey.

403
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,320
We can do it again later.

404
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,920
Then come shower with me.

405
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,190
I want to be with you.

406
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,390
Then you can't take a shower.

407
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,990
Come back after work.

408
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,990
It's a deal, then.

409
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,790
Don't try to run home first.

410
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,790
Okay.

411
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,960
I can't help it.

412
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,060
Promise me first.

413
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,120
Okay, it's a deal.

414
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,990
We have a deal.

415
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,130
Okay.

416
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,260
Don't go anywhere.

417
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,930
I've been waiting for this day for so long.

418
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,280
I shouldn't have come to work today.

419
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,430
What a pity.

420
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,530
One more time.

421
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,590
Come on.

422
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,090
Go away.

423
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,820
Just five more minutes.

424
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,530
What five minutes?

425
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,090
-Five minutes is enough to do it again. -Are you crazy?

426
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,530
Get some rest.

427
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,820
I'll be right back after work.

428
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,990
I'm going to work.

429
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,290
Focus on your work.

430
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,460
Okay.

431
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,860
I'll focus on my work like I did earlier.

432
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,190
Hey, Sky, are you crazy?

433
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,350
Go now.

434
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,290
What's wrong?

435
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,190
I'm going to work.

436
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,560
Remember to grab something to eat.

437
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,120
Okay.

438
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,090
What?

439
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,790
Hot rice is here.

440
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,800
Thank you.

441
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,490
Eat up.

442
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,790
Honey.

443
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,220
Wake Vee up. Let's eat together.

444
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,030
I didn't see him.

445
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,960
His door is open.

446
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,890
What?

447
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,330
He didn't come back last night?

448
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,790
Really?

449
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,490
I'll call him.

450
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,850
Aren't you going to answer it?

451
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,590
No.

452
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,790
Probably some insurance guy or telecom fraud.

453
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,520
I keep getting spam calls these days.

454
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,020
It's okay. Let's eat.

455
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,850
Okay.

456
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,220
Have some meat. Here.

457
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,720
Have all the meat.

458
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,760
I'll have boiled water to eat with rice later.

459
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,190
You don't have to give me that much.

460
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,090
Okay.

461
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,320
Eat up.

462
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:01,490
Dr. Sky, the hot meal is here.

463
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,190
Dr. Sky, the hot meal is here.

464
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,960
Ready-to-eat. It's delicious.

465
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,020
Okay. Coming.

466
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:22,800
Dr. Sky, the meal is here.

467
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,730
Dr. Sky, the meal is here.

468
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,520
Sky isn't at home. I'll take it for him.

469
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:34,890
Who are you?

470
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,760
His housekeeper?

471
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,390
His friend?

472
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,860
Or his boyfriend?

473
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,690
Dr. Sky.

474
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,230
Dr. Sky!

475
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,760
Dr. Sky!

476
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,830
Dr. Sky!

477
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,890
Dr. Sky!

478
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,020
Dr. Sky.

479
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:55,120
[Venus: Thank you for the food]

480
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,760
[Sky: I want to see your face, not the food]

481
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,420
[Venus: No. My face looks very pale now]

482
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,590
Crazy.

483
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,020
[Sky: How's the food? This place is good]

484
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,260
[Venus: Delicious]

485
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:27,090
[Sky: Eat more. You'll need strength tonight]

486
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,660
[Venus: Rogue]

487
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:52,630
Hello?

488
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,520
What's going on?

489
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:57,320
You didn't even tell me that you weren't coming home.

490
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,790
I was so worried. I thought

491
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,790
someone had abducted my brother to have fun.

492
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,490
What fun? You're talking nonsense again.

493
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:06,390
You know what?

494
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:09,920
I've been waiting for you for dinner, and I'm starving.

495
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,050
Little puppy.

496
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,830
Okay, I'm sorry.

497
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,020
I'll buy you dinner next time.

498
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,390
So?

499
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:22,520
Are you going to stay out or come home?

500
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,700
I'll come home whenever I want.

501
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,060
Wait.

502
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,790
Are you singing?

503
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:32,390
You're in such a good mood?

504
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,990
You and Sky

505
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,780
slept together, right?

506
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,390
Why are you so annoying?

507
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,190
Well, I just want to know.

508
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,620
Last night...

509
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,690
was it intense?

510
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:47,550
How can you ask a question like that?

511
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,560
Who would tell others such things?

512
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:52,430
Hey, I was just kidding.

513
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,890
But I know you're still shy.

514
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:00,720
Okay, bye. I'm going to clean the room.

515
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,690
Okay, I need to go to work too.

516
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,260
Bye.

517
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,190
Sky is awesome. He made my brother so obsessed

518
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:14,020
with him that he couldn't find his way home.

519
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,720
Bye!

520
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,790
Okay, I'm hanging up.

521
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,920
Little puppy.

522
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,090
Go sleep with him.

523
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:44,820
So? Are you relieved to know that your brother hasn't disappeared?

524
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,990
Yes, but if he comes back, I'll yell at him.

525
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:47,560
Humph.

526
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:50,660
I'll call him out on it.

527
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,680
Let me wipe your face.

528
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,390
Stop it.

529
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,420
Wipe the table.

530
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:00,850
Well,

531
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:04,160
I'll take this call outside.

532
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,930
Okay.

533
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,860
What's with him so early in the morning?

534
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,720
Who is it? Why does he keep calling?

535
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:15,760
What are you doing?

536
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,690
You scared me.

537
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,850
Why does this number often call you?

538
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,380
An insurance guy.

539
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,060
Did he call you every day?

540
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,220
Yes.

541
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,590
Some people are just too persistent.

542
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,920
But you can block them and let me help you.

543
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:36,760
It's okay. Leave them alone.

544
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,620
Are you hiding something from me?

545
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,530
No.

546
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,250
I'll tell you if there is.

547
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:50,090
Are you sure?

548
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,150
Bomb.

549
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:54,290
We should trust each other.

550
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,520
When I say it's nothing, it's nothing.

551
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:01,060
I'm sorry.

552
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,250
We'll talk about it when we're at home.

553
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:02,960
Bomb.

554
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:43,730
I don't even have time to chat with Tong while on duty.

555
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,920
What is this group talking about? So many messages.

556
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,250
[Bai Tong: Kla, how are you? How's your work?
[Bai Tong: Did you eat today?
[Bai Tong: I just saw the duty schedule.
[Bai Tong: Call me when you're free.
[Bai Tong: Baby, I miss you. Good night.]

557
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,820
[Bai Tong: I'm going abroad for two weeks. I wanted to tell you in person,
but you were too busy. The plane has taken off. Let's talk later.]

558
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:27,060
Sorry, the number you dialed is busy. Please try again later.

559
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:50,650
What happened to the mailbox?

560
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,220
Letters from the bank.

561
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,090
What's going on?

562
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,490
Hello?

563
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:46,520
Hello, Vee. This is Tonkla.

564
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,990
Oh, what's up?

565
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:51,030
Did you talk to Tong recently?

566
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:52,150
Yes.

567
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,260
I talked to him two days ago.

568
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,220
Do you know where he's going on a business trip?

569
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,430
Wait.

570
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:01,220
Today, Tong

571
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,430
is going on a business trip to Taiwan.

572
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:06,020
Oh, Taiwan?

573
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:08,490
He said he had a special project.

574
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:11,060
Don't tell me that he forgot to tell you.

575
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,920
He just texted me

576
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,850
that he's going abroad for two weeks.

577
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:18,360
Vee, I feel like I did something wrong.

578
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,320
Don't think too much.

579
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,720
Damn.

580
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,190
I should've been more concerned about him.

581
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:27,960
We're usually busy with our work. We don't live together.

582
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,020
Tong usually tells me everything.

583
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,860
But why didn't I know about this?

584
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:36,060
I don't know how to comfort you.

585
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:38,790
But ask yourself.

586
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:40,620
If you still have feelings for Tong,

587
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:43,390
you know what you should do.

588
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:47,620
He'll call you when he arrives.

589
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,430
Okay, thank you.

590
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:50,790
It's okay.

591
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,090
You have to calm down, no matter what.

592
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:52,960
Okay.

593
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,190
Bomb.

594
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,330
I bought you many things you like.

595
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,590
I'm sorry for yelling at you during the day.

596
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:38,460
Sit down. I have something to tell you.

597
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:45,760
I'm sorry. What do I have to do to make you feel better?

598
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:52,820
Explain this first. What is this?

599
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,820
What are you thinking?

600
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,950
You mortgaged your house to the bank.

601
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:07,350
It's a huge thing. Why didn't you tell me?

602
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:11,090
I can handle it.

603
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:14,050
We have a business. We need working capital.

604
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,550
You can borrow money from me!

605
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,320
Please tell me next time. Don't go to the bank like this.

606
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,450
I don't want to trouble you.

607
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:26,560
I'm already so grateful that you invested in me in the first place.

608
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,920
So what's your problem now?

609
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,020
Nothing serious.

610
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,160
I'm asking you, what trouble are you in?

611
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,930
I don't have enough money to pay the rent.

612
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:51,250
But it's okay. I'll take care of it.

613
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,830
Why didn't you tell me?

614
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,590
I have my grandpa's money.

615
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,420
I'll talk to my family later

616
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,290
and give you some money to pay the rent first.

617
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:03,930
So you don't need to fall behind on your rent like you are now.

618
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,060
I don't want to trouble you.

619
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,190
Does Vee know about this?

620
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,260
He doesn't know it yet.

621
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,220
Don't tell him.

622
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,860
I don't want him to worry about these things.

623
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,460
I think you should tell him this.

624
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,250
It's not a small matter.

625
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,450
I'm sorry.

626
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,130
How many times has this happened? You won't tell me anything.

627
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,130
If you can't keep your promise,

628
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,150
you don't have to apologize.

629
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:29,220
Babe, did you start to get drama when you were alone?

630
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,930
I missed you so much.

631
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,280
Say those sweet things more. I like it.

632
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,860
But why didn't you tell me in advance?

633
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,620
You'll be away for two weeks.

634
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,650
I'm so busy. I'm sorry.

635
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:45,520
I didn't have the chance to tell you.

636
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,360
And the new project was coming up when I wanted to.

637
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:53,830
You were busy too. Before you know it, it's time to go on a business trip.

638
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,330
I'm sorry too.

639
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,730
I'll care more about you next time.

640
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,920
You're not angry, are you?

641
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:06,090
I'm angry, but I'm even angrier with myself.

642
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,620
I'm also worried about you.

643
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,390
If I had known you were going on a business trip,

644
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:10,750
I would have seen you off.

645
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,950
It's okay. I can take care of myself.

646
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:15,990
Look.

647
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:18,990
I'm using data to video you.

648
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:21,720
Okay, you'll be punished

649
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,420
when you come back.

650
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,990
Yes, I will gladly take it.

651
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:29,690
You're so naughty.

652
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:31,460
You want to be punished?

653
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,530
Wait after you come back.

654
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,950
Baby, I gotta go.

655
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,790
I'm running out of data.

656
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:39,290
Okay, send me some photos when you're free.

657
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:40,090
I'll miss you.

658
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:43,150
Yes, I'll miss you too.

659
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,960
I'll send you some photos.

660
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,790
-Bye. -Bye.

661
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,390
Bomb.

662
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,360
Bomb, let's eat together.

663
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,360
Come on.

664
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,620
Just a few bites will be good.

665
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,350
Bomb.

666
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:57,990
Are you asleep?

667
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:10,720
Are you asleep?

668
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,630
Good night.

669
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:23,060
Why are you so quiet today?

670
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:38,750
Did you have a fight?

671
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:46,050
What?

672
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,620
What's bothering you?

673
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,290
Why are you sitting here 
feeding mosquitoes?

674
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,590
I'm apologizing.

675
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,350
I'm donating blood

676
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:23,890
to gain merit.

677
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:29,750
Did you have a fight with Bomb?

678
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,290
Fights are inevitable. Couples will have many problems.

679
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,860
The reason for the fight was funny.

680
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,120
I don't think it's funny.

681
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:44,330
If Bomb didn't care about you, you'd be dead already.

682
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,030
Did you do something wrong?

683
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:49,020
You still don't have a good personality.

684
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:52,160
Nothing.

685
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,990
Nothing makes me happy.

686
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,020
It'll be over soon.

687
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,560
Yeah, be good together.

688
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,520
Tell me if you need anything.

689
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,250
Don't sulk here alone.

690
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,420
Okay?

691
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:08,250
What?

692
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,890
Are you worried about me?

693
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,450
Yes.

694
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:18,090
Whose brother is this? So cute?

695
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,260
Whose brother?

696
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,520
Come on, give me a kiss.

697
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:25,130
Go away.

698
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:25,990
Why?

699
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:27,390
Get lost.

700
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:29,390
Then donate blood for me.

701
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:30,590
Mosquitoes! Hurry up and bite him.

702
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,750
-Are you crazy? -Help me donate blood.

703
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,130
Mosquitoes, bite him!

704
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:35,320
Stretch out your legs.

705
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,550
-Let go of me. -Stretch out your legs.

706
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:39,790
-Let go of me! -Help me donate blood.

707
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:41,650
Are you crazy?

708
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,460
Come and bite him, mosquitoes!

709
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,490
Hello, Mom.

710
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:34,690
I have something to...

711
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:38,890
What's wrong? Why are you calling me?

712
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:42,020
Can I have my savings?

713
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:46,090
What do you want? If you spend it,

714
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,950
you don't have much left.

715
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:51,260
I want to use it in the shop.

716
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:53,290
But the money won't be wasted.

717
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,150
We just need some working capital.

718
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:57,220
Okay.

719
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:00,720
Take it if you need it. I'll transfer it to you later.

720
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,150
I'll go now, or you'll find me nagging.

721
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,090
Thank you, Mom.

722
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:14,190
To be honest, we have money to support you.

723
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:17,290
I don't understand why you have to bother Janus.

724
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:19,420
You can be very comfortable at home.

725
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,050
I want to earn money on my own.

726
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,460
Fine.

727
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:27,250
You won't listen to me, no matter what I say.

728
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,850
Mom, you have to trust in my determination.

729
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,460
Are you still angry?

730
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:18,860
I'm still a little bit

731
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:20,120
angry.

732
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:28,030
You're not mad anymore.

733
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:29,420
Give me a hug.

734
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:45,260
-I'll go down a bit. -Okay.

735
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:49,390
Hurry up.

736
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:56,090
- Do you like it? -Yes. Ah.

737
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:57,590
Harder.

738

What are you doing?

01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:19,560
Why? My ears are itchy. What's wrong with clearing out my ears?
