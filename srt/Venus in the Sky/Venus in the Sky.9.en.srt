3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,430
Are we there yet?

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,610
I feel dizzy.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,140
Why do I have to cover my eyes?

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,040
Okay.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,570
It's a secret.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,310
But we're almost there.

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,670
Are you taking me to a motel?

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,720
Well.

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,990
How did you know?

12
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,780
Since you said so, let's turn around.

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,020
No, Sky!

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,910
I'm just kidding.

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,550
You're doomed.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,060
We're here.

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,470
Is this really a motel?

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,470
Get off first.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,320
You'll know later.

20
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,260
Hold on. Watch your head.

21
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,520
Okay.

22
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,610
Wait here.

23
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,060
Let's go.

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,160
We're almost there.

25
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:26,990
Turn around.

26
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,650
What are you doing?

27
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,630
[Happy New Year]

28
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,120
Put down the spoon.

29
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,540
Come, sit down.

30
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,360
Let's eat.

31
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,050
Here.

32
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,290
You're welcome, kid.

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,070
Thank you.

34
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,120
Thank you for inviting me to dinner today.

35
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,360
It's been a long time since I celebrated New Year like this.

36
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,190
I'm so happy.

37
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,230
Oh.

38
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,220
Doesn't your family like celebration?

39
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,930
My family loves it.

40
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,810
Since my parents separated,

41
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,830
I haven't eaten or celebrated like this.

42
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,590
I shouldn't have asked.

43
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,870
I'm sorry, kid.

44
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,750
It's okay.

45
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,300
I'm not sad.

46
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,760
And I understand them.

47
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,490
If they're not happy together, it's better to separate.

48
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:32,050
Anyway, my parents raised me and my brother. We can take care of ourselves now.

49
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,850
If that's the case,

50
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,510
you can come and eat with us frequently.

51
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,350
I'll ask Sky to invite you.

52
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,280
I'd better not disturb you.

53
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,890
What are you talking about?

54
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,350
Sky doesn't go home frequently.

55
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,680
Your uncle and I always feel lonely.

56
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,710
Come on.

57
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,600
Come here when you have spare time.

58
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:59,750
She cooks so much every time,

59
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,560
and we can't finish them.

60
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,130
Yes.

61
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,510
Please come here often.

62
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,970
Then we can eat all the dishes cooked by my mom.

63
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,570
She won't be sad anymore.

64
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,030
They are exaggerating.

65
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,630
Let's eat.

66
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,110
Okay.

67
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,530
Eat more, kid.

68
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,990
You'll lose strength if you are skinny.

69
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,090
Thank you, aunt.

70
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,990
But I think this is enough.

71
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,470
It looks like Uncle and Sky want food, too.

72
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,300
I always get food for Sky.

73
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,909
I want to get some for you today.

74
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,710
Eat them, kid.

75
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,030
Stop flattering my parents.

76
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,510
My parents don't care about me anymore.

77
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,460
I'm sick of Sky.

78
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,640
He is too talkative.

79
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,790
I want you to be our child.

80
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,200
You're welcome anytime.

81
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,220
Vee.

82
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,760
Are you okay?

83
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,110
I'm fine.

84
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,030
Do you know what I regret every day?

85
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,830
What?

86
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,650
I didn't control my feelings that day.

87
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,860
Besides losing you,

88
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,760
I don't want to lose Aunt Pa and Uncle Kiat either.

89
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,520
To be honest,

90
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,630
from that day on,

91
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,630
I thought I would never come back here.

92
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,700
Vee,

93
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,980
I also thought

94
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,890
I would lose you forever.

95
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,870
Thank you

96
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,920
for giving me another chance.

97
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,040
How's everything going?

98
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,290
I'm graduating soon.

99
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,320
Are you busy at work?

100
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,650
It's as busy as usual, Mom.

101
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,430
You look anxious.

102
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,230
What about Venus?

103
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,380
Won't he still come here this year?

104
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,980
Did you call him?

105
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,580
Did you say your dad and I miss him?

106
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,910
Did you?

107
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,990
Is Venus' school work heavy?

108
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,070
He hasn't visited us for a long time.

109
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,190
Vee happens to be busy today.

110
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,640
He can't come.

111
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,150
So, he asked me to apologize on his behalf.

112
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,990
You might not see him for a long time.

113
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,150
It's okay, Sky.

114
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,870
Let's eat.

115
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,630
I made everything you like.

116
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,419
Here, let me get some for you.

117
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,390
You've lost weight.

118
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,530
Uh, a little.

119
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,390
Sky,

120
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,460
have you decided on the accommodation?

121
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,120
Yes.

122
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,060
My friend, Aunt Sumli, is moving abroad.

123
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,450
She lives near the hospital where you work.

124
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,360
She said if she didn't come back, she would sell her house.

125
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,550
Her house is rented now.

126
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,770
It will be great if someone can take care of her house. Right, honey?

127
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,450
That's why I thought of you.

128
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,690
Tell me, do you want to live in the dorm or her house?

129
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,390
What is it?

130
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,790
It's abnormal. Why are you calling me at this hour?

131
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,440
Mom,

132
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,490
can I buy this house from Aunt Sumli?

133
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,190
Are you going to buy it?

134
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,550
May I ask why?

135
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,160
Well...

136
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,430
I might open a small clinic nearby.

137
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,290
So I thought I'd buy this house someday.

138
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,500
Why are you in such a hurry to buy a house?

139
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,280
Is there another reason?

140
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,630
Well, Sky,

141
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,960
are you sure you want to live there?

142
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,710
Actually, I want to buy this house because of Venus.

143
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,270
I want to stay by his side.

144
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,140
But I don't know how to get close to him.

145
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,870
I think this might help Vee and I get along.

146
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,130
Mom, I don't want to lose him anymore.

147
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,670
Your dad and I have thought about it. You must have done something that upsets Venus.

148
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,070
What's wrong with you, Sky?

149
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,600
No matter what you do, please consider your friend's feelings, my son.

150
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,490
See?

151
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,910
Venus hasn't visited us for a long time.

152
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,960
It's all my fault, Mom.

153
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,490
Have you decided?

154
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,700
This is a big deal.

155
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,190
Yes.

156
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,220
Then, promise you will bring Venus

157
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,080
to visit us often

158
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,950
after you buy the house.

159
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,120
I promise you, Mom.

160
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,220
I'll do my best.

161
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,790
I don't know how much effort I can make,

162
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,870
but I won't let Vee leave again, Mom.

163
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,810
Good luck, my son.

164
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,940
We back you up!

165
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,680
Okay.

166
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,000
How is it?

167
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,800
Wow, it looks delicious.

168
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,270
This is your favorite.

169
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,870
Eat more, honey.

170
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,660
I ordered it for you.

171
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,140
Where did you buy it?

172
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,130
Your favorite.

173
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,440
Dad, Mom.

174
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,690
Venus!

175
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,590
Venus!

176
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,150
How are you, kid?

177
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,900
I miss you so much!

178
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,110
How are you doing?

179
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,310
Long time no see.

180
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,150
Let me have a look at you.

181
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,540
I'm fine.

182
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,310
I miss you and Uncle, too.

183
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,830
Mom,

184
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,770
Vee just stopped crying before he entered the house.

185
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,200
What?

186
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,310
Sky,

187
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,850
did you bully Vee again?

188
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,110
I didn't, Mom.

189
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,470
If he does something bad to you,

190
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,990
just tell me.

191
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,860
How are you?

192
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,920
We're all fine.

193
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,900
But we feel lonely

194
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,780
as Sky doesn't come home.

195
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,020
Dad, Mom's a pretty good actress now.

196
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,010
You two are neck and neck.

197
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,190
Let's eat.

198
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,130
The food will get cold.

199
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,440
Honey,

200
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,350
whose side are you on?

201
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,230
Tell me.

202
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,690
I'm on your side.

203
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,950
Oh, Dad.

204
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,780
Let's eat.

205
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,870
I prepared a lot of food.

206
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,990
Eat more today.

207
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,760
Okay.

208
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,590
Have a seat.

209
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,680
Mom, Som Tam again?

210
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,830
That's your dad's favorite.

211
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,180
Aunt, let me help you.

212
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,180
It's okay, kid. Let me wash them.

213
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,010
I want to help you.

214
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,170
But...

215
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:05,750
Fine.

216
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,660
Okay.

217
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,310
Okay.

218
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,330
Sit down and rest.

219
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,990
Vee,

220
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,830
thank you, kid.

221
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:18,910
What?

222
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,910
Thank you for coming back with Sky.

223
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,860
Ever since you broke up with Sky,

224
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,920
he was very upset.

225
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,670
He's like a different person.

226
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,420
I dared not interfere in your relationships.

227
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,420
I could only care about you from a distance.

228
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,690
Actually, I was surprised, too.

229
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,560
When Sky said you were too busy to come,

230
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,610
your uncle and I could only sit alone without knowing what to do.

231
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,390
I like you. You are just like my other child.

232
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,030
If Sky does something bad,

233
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,830
you can tell me.

234
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,240
I like you too.

235
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,890
Thank you for always being so nice to me.

236
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,410
Don't cry, my boy.

237
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,280
Don't cry.

238
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,860
Sky will scold me later.

239
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,370
Thank you.

240
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,580
Thank you so much.

241
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,940
Who made my precious Venus cry again?

242
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,869
You're asking for it.

243
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,280
What do you mean?

244
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,819
It's obvious.

245
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,910
Come on.

246
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,560
Let me hug you.

247
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,109
Come on.

248
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:18,710
Here.

249
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,760
Are you crazy?

250
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,690
Don't hug me. Go away.

251
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,319
Let me hug you.

252
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,869
Who made my baby cry?

253
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,480
Are you feeling better?

254
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,450
Are you feeling better?

255
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,320
Turn around.

256
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,710
Why are you against me?

257
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,930
Hey.

258
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,850
Don't move.

259
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,910
Just stay like this.

260
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,760
Are you feeling better?

261
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,070
Who's crying?

262
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,360
I'm not crying.

263
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,420
You are just reluctant to admit it.

264
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,390
Looks like you need another kiss.

265
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,390
Two kisses?

266
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,610
Give it to me.

267
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,590
Here.

268
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,590
Thank you.

269
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,100
Why is this all I have?

270
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,580
Did you steal my money?

271
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,530
Hell no.

272
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,590
You've lost all your money after giving me the rent.

273
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,380
Come on, another round.

274
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,630
Really?

275
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,150
Why did I leave it at your house again?

276
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,980
Maybe my spell worked.

277
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,910
I prayed every day to make you obsessed with me.

278
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,190
What do you think?

279
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,490
Are you really in love with me?

280
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,330
You always leave it at my place.

281
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,620
Are you chanting a spell?

282
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,190
Pay! Pay! Pay!

283
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,950
Don't deny it.

284
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,840
Hurry up.

285
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,840
Give me all my money.

286
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,720
Did you run out of money?

287
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,840
Yes.

288
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,140
How is it?

289
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,120
Are you really in love with me?

290
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,330
It's in progress.

291
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,100
I parked at my house.

292
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,890
Oh.

293
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,190
What should we do now?

294
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,190
Should I pay you?

295
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,460
No, you have to throw the dice again.

296
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,630
Okay.

297
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,790
What is this?

298
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,460
Power plant.

299
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,460
Do I have to give you money again?

300
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,670
Okay.

301
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,920
Why did you give me the title deed?

302
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,050
It's for you.

303
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,070
-Take it. -Really?

304
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,540
I still have a lot.

305
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,550
Take it.

306
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,780
It's your turn.

307
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,200
Hey, Tong is here.

308
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,510
Hey.

309
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,230
You're cheating.

310
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,230
You stole all my money.

311
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,400
I didn't.

312
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,220
What's wrong with you?

313
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,140
What?

314
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,270
No, I didn't steal your money.

315
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,490
-I didn't. -Give it back.

316
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,300
-Did Tong steal it? -Give it back.

317
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,450
-Give me back my money. -No.

318
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,910
Where did he go?

319
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,450
He didn't reply to my message.

320
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,320
It's late. Why isn't he back yet?

321
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,050
I'm home.

322
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,170
Honey.

323
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,990
I only bought you desserts.

324
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,030
I won't share them with anyone.

325
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,490
What?

326
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,500
Why do you look like you miss me so much?

327
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,320
Because I miss you a lot.

328
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,860
I haven't seen you all day.

329
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,190
I was worried.

330
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,740
You're flattering me.

331
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,720
Do you need my help?

332
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,860
Tell me.

333
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,520
I want you, okay?

334
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,950
What's wrong with you?

335
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,530
Baby, what are you doing?

336
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,030
What are you doing?

337
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,570
Wait, baby.

338
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,570
I haven't taken a shower yet.

339
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,830
But you smell good already.

340
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,480
You're exaggerating.

341
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,030
Next time, do not disappear secretly.

342
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,040
I didn't receive your message, and I was worried.

343
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,990
Are you serious?

344
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:17,340
As people say, a small farewell makes a couple love each other more. I see.

345
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,710
What?

346
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,130
We'll never be apart again.

347
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,220
And I won't let you go.

348
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:22,980
Yes.

349
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,420
I also bought you a souvenir.

350
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,070
That's an energy drink.

351
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,080
And the other is dessert.

352
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,330
I bought them for you.

353
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,680
Thanks.

354
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,930
Did you finish your work?

355
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,050
Is that why you came back early?

356
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,190
Yes.

357
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,430
Fortunately, my client liked my design.

358
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,510
So there's no need to change too much.

359
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,820
As for the rest, I let others in the team continue to revise.

360
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,160
The boss told me to come back first.

361
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,880
And it seems he wants to give me a new project.

362
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:59,390
Things are tough these days

363
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,020
I'm so tired.

364
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,830
I didn't expect to meet such complicated things.

365
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,340
But it's fun, right?

366
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,790
You like it, right?

367
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:12,830
Yes.

368
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,400
It was fun.

369
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,580
But I don't have much time to chat with you.

370
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,210
Here.

371
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,560
What?

372
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,520
Sit here.

373
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,940
Why?

374
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,230
Let me hug you.

375
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,910
Hug me.

376
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,990
Next time, don't leave me here again.

377
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,630
Okay.

378
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,120
Pinky promise.

379
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:41,900
Pinky promise.

380
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,610
Hey, you scared me.

381
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,800
Why do you smell so good?

382
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,920
I just used your soap.

383
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,580
It's fake.

384
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,950
I used it, but you didn't smell my scent.

385
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,040
What?

386
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,710
Do you want me to smell it?

387
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:31,990
Yes.

388
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,860
Let's try kissing. -(In Thai, "scent" sounds like "kissing cheek"

389
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,950
See if I'm as fragrant as you.

390
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,390
You smell so good.

391
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,750
So cute.

392
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,690
To be honest,

393
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,690
your room hasn't changed at all.

394
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,350
A kitty four-piece bed set.

395
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,400
Cute.

396
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,390
Yes.

397
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,350
I was exhausted after work.

398
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,030
So I didn't have time to clean up.

399
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,700
I'm waiting for someone around here to clean the room for me.

400
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,840
Let's go to sleep.

401
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,950
After a long day's work,

402
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,100
I was exhausted like a patient.

403
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,390
I always went to bed directly when I got home.

404
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,530
Why did you follow me around when you were so tired?

405
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,350
Tell me frankly, were you tired?

406
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,680
Not at all.

407
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,670
When I'm with you,

408
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,880
I'm thrilled.

409
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,900
But I'm too sleepy now.

410
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,410
I want to sleep.

411
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,680
Go to bed if you're sleepy.

412
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,670
No!

413
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,630
It's best to sleep here.

414
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,500
What's wrong with you?

415
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,000
Stinky-faced Cat,

416
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,990
stop moving.

417
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,640
Stop staring at me.

418
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,960
Are you going to keep staring at me until tomorrow morning?

419
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,420
I want to keep looking at you like this

420
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,080
to make up for the three years I missed.

421
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,640
Go to sleep.

422
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,680
Aren't you sleepy?

423
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,820
I miss you more.

424
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,320
We meet every day.

425
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,030
Not enough.

426
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,430
Vee.

427
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,350
Say it.

428
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,140
Since the day you left,

429
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,260
I missed you every day.

430
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,350
I want to know if you missed me.

431
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,940
At first, I missed you too.

432
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,810
After that, I tried not to miss you.

433
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,450
But you always appeared in my mind.

434
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,190
Really?

435
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:51,570
Yes.

436
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,570
Stop staring at me.

437
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,310
I feel a little wired.

438
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,140
Is there anything wrong

439
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,950
with our relationship now?

440
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,380
What do you mean?

441
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,730
I just think

442
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,280
something makes you not sure about our relationship.

443
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,710
But I'll make you assured.

444
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,400
I will never change my mind to you.

445
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,790
Our relationship will never break.

446
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,230
It may seem a bit late,

447
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,590
I still want to ask you again.

448
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,380
Will you be my boyfriend?

449
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,510
Yes.

450
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,710
Yes. Yes.

451
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,790
What?

452
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,690
Are you crying secretly again?

453
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,770
Let me see your face.

454
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,160
Let me see.

455
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,600
No.

456
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,750
You said you wouldn't change your mind.

457
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,630
Never.

458
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,250
I love nagging.

459
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,420
I'll behave myself and never let you complain.

460
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,260
Thank you for loving me.

461
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,720
What?

462
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,280
Are you kissing me secretly?

463
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,870
Let me kiss you, too.

464
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,790
No.

465
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,670
Kiss me.

466
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,540
We're a couple. Can't we kiss?

467
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,180
No.

468
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,810
Why?

469
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,060
A couple should kiss.

470
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,900
Let me kiss you.

471
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,350
All right.

472
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,700
Stop teasing me. I'm going to sleep.

473
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,290
Do you want it?

474
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,100
Very much.

475
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,030
To celebrate us being together again, okay?

476
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,740
Then we go home for dinner.

477
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,790
Don't flatter me.

478
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,790
You've never been gentle to me.

479
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,120
See?

480
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,120
It really needs you.

481
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,390
Take pity on it.

482
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,060
I can't bear it anymore.

483
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,480
You're too hard.

484
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,960
You said you liked it no matter how I hug you.

485
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,550
Which one do you like?

486
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,710
Whatever.

487
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,230
Bring it on.

488
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:25,830
[Boss]

489
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,210
Hello?

490
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,180
Aren't you up yet?

491
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,770
It's only seven in the morning, sir.

492
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,720
Sorry to call you during the holiday.

493
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,030
I have something to tell you.

494
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,920
Don't tell me there's a new project.

495
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,460
The old project is not done yet.

496
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,820
No.

497
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,260
The client requested you to do a project in Germany.

498
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,190
Are you interested?

499
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,570
The client likes your project in Taiwan.

500
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,350
They said if you weren't there, They would waste more money and time.

501
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,620
Really?

502
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,020
Is it Mr Paul's project?

503
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,900
Yes.

504
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,650
I think it's an excellent opportunity.

505
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,340
Honestly, I don't want to let you go, either.

506
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,200
Because without you, I can hardly complete all the projects now.

507
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,550
Thank you, Boss.

508
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,990
I didn't expect to hear such a request.

509
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,460
Thank you so much.

510
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,010
Okay.

511
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,050
I'll send you the number of the client later.

512
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,930
Think about it.

513
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,390
Okay, Boss.

514
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,270
Thank you.

515
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,430
Okay. Bye, Boss.

516
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,260
Okay.

517
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,690
What?

518
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,260
A year?

519
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,430
Babe.

520
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,630
Honey, you're awake.

521
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,910
Why are you up so early?

522
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,200
Yes.

523
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,550
I got a call.

524
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,490
Honey, go back to sleep.

525
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,330
I'll wake you up later.

526
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,230
Go to sleep.

527
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,720
Mom, don't push me.

528
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,560
I've made up my mind.

529
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,910
I don't know what's good about you staying there.

530
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,940
I want to be with J no matter what.

531
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,830
J is nice.

532
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,380
He works hard

533
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,880
and he is very patient, Mom.

534
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,450
Actually, J could borrow money from me.

535
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,400
But he didn't do that.

536
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,840
He mortgaged his house to the bank.

537
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,740
I couldn't just watch him work hard like this.

538
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,010
So I went to help him.

539
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,170
Anyway,

540
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,790
I'll give you time to think about it.

541
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,240
If you can't make it, go home.

542
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,120
Vee,

543
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,610
is there anything I should know?

544
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,840
Are you heavily in debt and mortgaging the house to the bank?

545
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,350
Why didn't you tell me?

546
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,560
I told you I can handle it.

547
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,220
I just transferred the money first.

548
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,120
It costs a lot of money to do business.

549
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,740
But I'll get the money back soon.

550
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,410
Are you sure you can handle it?

551
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,860
Yes, I'm sure.

552
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,040
I can handle it.

553
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,940
Let me know if you can't.

554
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,130
I'll go to the shop to help you.

555
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:03,870
I don't need your help.

556
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,220
Just continue to work.

557
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,070
I told you I could handle it.

558
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,590
But you're in trouble now.

559
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,460
How can I not worry?

560
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,090
You're in debt.

561
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,240
Didn't I tell you

562
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,040
not to let Vee know?

563
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,500
This isn't something you should hide from me.

564
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,940
I already told you Vee should know about this.

565
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,660
He is my brother, not yours.

566
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,060
You never regard me as your family.

567
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,330
You always think you can handle everything.

568
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,170
It's like you're alone.

569
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,030
What about me?

570
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,540
I'm right next to you. I want to help you.

571
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,220
You keep me out of the door.

572
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,220
What am I to you?

573
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,740
Hell no!

574
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,730
What did I say?

575
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,850
It's okay.

576
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:09,900
Calm down.

577
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,610
We can solve this problem together.

578
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:15,990
No need.

579
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,210
Just continue to work on interior design.

580
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,670
I can handle it.

581
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,010
Let me pay for the expenses.

582
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,330
No need.

583
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,640
Well.

584
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,510
But I've grown up.

585
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,970
I have savings,

586
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,770
I have income.

587
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,320
Let me help you if I can.

588
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,740
You can take your time to take care of the shop.

589
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,560
Vee,

590
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,880
do you think I'm a failure?

591
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,680
It's okay.

592
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,360
You're an excellent brother.

593
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,750
I'm sorry.

594
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,140
It's okay.

595
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:39,830
But now, you need to talk to Bomb.

596
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,360
He really loves you.

597
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:44,870
In addition,

598
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,210
he didn't mean to tell me this.

599
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,430
I knew it myself.

600
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,230
Vee,

601
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,420
do you think my words are hurtful?

602
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,510
No.

603
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,050
I think Bomb understands you.

604
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,720
If he gets mad, he'll be fine soon.

605
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,950
You know, right? I didn't mean it.

606
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,550
I know.

607
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,220
I think he knows it, too.

608
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,870
[Are you free now?]

609
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,150
Hello, my friend.

610
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,920
I was just about to call you.

611
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:00,460
Vee,

612
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,370
my dream is about to come true.

613
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,440
I can work with Mr Paul, the owner of the magazine.

614
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,200
The one we were crazy about in the home design class.

615
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,860
Do you remember?

616
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,620
Really?

617
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,500
Congratulations!

618
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,670
So cool.

619
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,810
Yeah.

620
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,320
I'm happy, too.

621
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,300
Why do you sound so down?

622
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,800
I have to work in Germany for about a year.

623
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,810
A year?

624
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:33,810
Does Tonkla know now?

625
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,120
Not yet.

626
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,460
I'm still thinking about it.

627
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,520
Will Tonkla agree?

628
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,080
I've only been with him for a short time.

629
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,720
Now we have to live apart for about a year.

630
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,520
Will it work?

631
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,550
I think this is a big problem.

632
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,100
You need to talk to Tonkla.

633
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:55,820
I think so, too.

634
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,610
But I don't dare say it now.

635
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,970
Our life is changing every day.

636
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:06,150
But it depends on whether you two can adjust to each other.

637
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,120
Yes.

638
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,230
Indeed.

639
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:10,970
Anyway, congratulations.

640
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,390
You'll make it through anyway.

641
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,990
Thank you.

642
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:18,270
Well,

643
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,600
you said you were about to call me.

644
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,150
What's wrong?

645
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,110
Oh, nothing.

646
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,550
I just want to tell you I'm ready for projects.

647
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,690
If you have any good projects, you can give it to me.

648
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:33,630
I'm ready.

649
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,470
Okay.

650
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:36,530
Get ready.

651
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,970
I'll give you my job.

652
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,330
Why did you sigh?

653
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,790
What's wrong?

654
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,590
I need to think about something.

655
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:49,500
About Sky?

656
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,590
Hey, you.

657
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:53,680
Our life is short.

658
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,910
You can accept him now.

659
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,920
Don't be so cruel to him.

660
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,760
Otherwise, you'll be upset.

661
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,760
Okay, bye.

662
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,830
I'll call you later.

663
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,230
Someone is calling.

664
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,250
Congratulations again.

665
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,550
Okay, bye.

666
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:30,630
Am I sick?

667
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:40,750
[CID: Stinky-faced Cat]

668
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:49,190
[CID: Stinky-faced Cat]

669
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:01,750
Why are you here so late, Doctor?

670
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,430
Well.

671
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:03,980
Brother,

672
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,390
you scared me.

673
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,790
I couldn't contact Venus.

674
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,150
I'm worried about him.

675
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,150
Then why are you here?

676
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:14,870
Well...

677
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,030
I'm sorry for making you misunderstand that day.

678
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,110
Janus likes joking.

679
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:22,500
Don't take it seriously.

680
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,180
It's okay.

681
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,070
I'm sorry, too.

682
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,880
I couldn't control my emotions that day.

683
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,350
Stop being jealous of Vee.

684
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,490
I'm J's boyfriend.

685
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,870
Venus told me that.

686
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,060
But now, I can't reach Vee.

687
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,580
Can you go in and take a look?

688
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,250
I had a fight with J.

689
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,970
Go in and see for yourself.

690
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,910
I'll open the door for you.

691
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,440
Thank you.

692
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,150
Okay.

693
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,050
Come on.

694
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,050
Thank you.

695
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:23,840
Damn it.

696
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,510
Gosh, bro,

697
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,400
what are you doing?

698
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:30,240
Oh, Doctor.

699
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:32,000
I thought it was Bomb.

700
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:34,150
It's me.

701
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,550
Your boyfriend is in front of the house.

702
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,520
He opened the door for me.

703
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,390
Is Bomb in front of his house?

704
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:43,690
Yes.

705
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,690
Is Venus here?

706
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:52,140
J,

707
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:54,830
is Venus here?

708
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,230
Vee?

709
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:58,500
He's upstairs.

710
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,920
He's been upstairs since night.

711
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:02,430
He didn't want to have dinner.

712
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,840
Then I apply to see him upstairs.

713
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:09,470
I can't reach him.

714
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,330
Doctor,

715
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,330
please wake him up and let him eat dinner.

716
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,430
Your body is hot.

717
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:39,970
I'm sorry.

718
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:45,770
Wait a minute.

719
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:49,070
Take off your clothes.

720
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,480
Take off your vest.

721
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:57,620
Okay.

722
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,080
This way.

723
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,490
Take off your clothes first.

724
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,890
Okay.

725
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:29,850
Why are you sick?

726
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,310
Vee, look up.

727
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:13,670
Okay.

728
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,590
Put the vest on.

729
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:24,860
Okay.

730
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,100
Get better soon.

731
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,950
I don't want you to get sick.

732
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,030
Bomb,

733
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,360
I'm sorry.

734
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,630
Hum.

735
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,550
I was wrong.

736
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,270
I never thought you were an outsider.

737
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,990
I was in a bad mood when I said it.

738
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:05,540
I didn't mean it.

739
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:11,680
To be honest,

740
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,950
do you want to break up with me?

741
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,970
No. No. No.

742
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:17,960
Don't say that.

743
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,120
It seems you don't want to continue our relationship.

744
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:33,790
To be honest, I'm under a lot of pressure.

745
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,470
I want our career to thrive.

746
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,950
I want your family to trust me.

747
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:46,790
I want to prove to everyone that your family accepted our relationship.

748
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:50,020
I...

749
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,450
I don't want to break up with you.

750
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,270
Neither do I.

751
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,980
But can you promise

752
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,190
keeping back nothing from me from now on?

753
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,900
Don't let me know until afterward.

754
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,730
Family should be a comfort zone.

755
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,370
I hope you can tell me everything reassuringly.

756
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:25,670
Say anything you want.

757
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,410
I promise.

758
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,430
I'm sorry for being so mean.

759
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:02,340
I'm sorry for being so harsh.

760
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:09,550
You're not mad anymore, right?

761
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:11,830
Yes.

762
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:14,410
But promise me. Don't hide anything from me.

763
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,950
Okay.

764
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:22,660
That's enough.

765
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,880
Your face is oily.

766
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,150
Okay.

767
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:31,040
I don't want to talk with you anymore.

768
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,260
I'm going to leave.

769
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:37,110
Where are you going?

770
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:39,820
I don't know.

771
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,060
No one is there.

772
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,090
Do you want to do something?

773
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:48,850
Are you crazy?

774
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:50,680
Do you want to do something?

775
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,240
J.

776
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:51,980
Come on.

777
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:52,960
J.

778
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,420
J.

779
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,810
Fine, no one sees us. Hurry up.

780
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,240
Let's go inside and have a look.

781
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,550
Is Vee sick?

782
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:23,830
Yes, I think so.

783
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:28,910
Let's go.

784
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,460
Sky is taking care of him.

785
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,080
We can come to visit him tomorrow.

786
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,060
Okay.

787
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,230
Doctor is here. Don't worry.

788
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,050
Vee, wait.

789
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,810
Why is your body so hot?

790
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:36,740
Why are you here?

791
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,980
You have a fever.

792
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:42,360
Your body is hot.

793
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,250
So I wipe your body.

794
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,650
Hug me.

795
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:51,670
I'm cold.

796
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:01,560
Here.

797
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:14,890
I miss you.

798
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,580
I miss you so much that my head hurts.

799
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:20,780
Really?

800
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:22,730
Yes.

801
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:24,480
It hurts so much.

802
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:37,260
Should I get you another blanket?

803
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:45,380
I don't like your clothes.

804
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:48,470
I feel no warmth to hug it.

805
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:50,950
Take it off.

806
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,580
Vee.

807
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,950
The door is open.

808
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:07,300
Things will be awful if J sees it.

809
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:10,870
Vee.

810
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:15,600
Venus.

811
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:21,450
You don't do as I wish.

812
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,400
Where are you going?

813
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,070
The door is locked.

814
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,070
You can keep making trouble.

815
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:15,780
Venus,

816
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,890
may I wipe your body first?

817
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:21,340
You'll get better soon in this way.

818
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:23,790
No.

819
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:25,700
Venus,

820
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,070
are you so stubborn because of sickness?

821
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:30,080
Huh?

822
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,510
Yes.

823
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:35,080
Very stubborn.

824
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,670
I want to kiss you.

825
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,400
But I'm worried that you might be infected and have a fever, too.

826
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:34,480
No.

827
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,630
I'm strong.

828
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:40,960
No.

829
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:52,790
Vee.

830
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:57,540
Venus.

831
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:06,720
What?

832
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:11,220
Venus.

833
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:16,860
Venus.

834
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,220
What the hell?

835
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,090
Are you kidding me?

836
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:50,400
I'm going to work.

837
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:53,450
Are you on duty today?

838
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:54,780
No.

839
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,810
I'll see you at lunch.

840
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,010
Sleep and rest.

841
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:02,570
Then you will recover quickly.

842
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:08,700
Come back soon.

843
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,240
I will miss you.

844
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:15,680
Okay.

845
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,490
I'll be back soon.

846
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:20,380
Have a sleep.

847
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:28,920
Here.

848
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:30,100
Can you sleep now?

849
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:33,230
Okay.

850
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,470
Hey, Doctor.

851
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:52,750
Are you going home?

852
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:54,030
How's Vee?

853
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:56,280
Venus is much better.

854
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:58,620
But his body is still hot.

855
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:02,230
I'll get changed at home and go to the hospital.

856
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,950
But during lunch break, please let me see Venus, bro.

857
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:08,230
Sure, Doctor. Good.

858
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:10,230
I have a lot to do today.

859
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:13,030
Anyway, please take care of Vee.

860
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:15,710
Okay.

861
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:16,700
Doctor.

862
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:31,819
Well.

863
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:41,930
It's hard to please Vee when he's sick, Doctor.

864
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:44,550
He doesn't like being sick.

865
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:49,060
Since our parents got divorced and had new families respectively,

866
01:08:49,649 --> 01:08:51,319
Vee was probably in Junior one,

867
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:52,810
while I was a Senior two.

868
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:55,010
We depended on each other.

869
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:57,439
I wouldn't do anything when he was sick,

870
01:08:57,910 --> 01:09:00,340
but let him take medicine to reduce his fever

871
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,210
until he got better.

872
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:05,520
I was exhausted at that time, Doctor.

873
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:07,979
Why?

874
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:08,950
Well...

875
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:10,140
Vee

876
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:12,880
was very willful when he was sick.

877
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,880
"This medicine won't cure me.

878
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,680
Get me another kind of medicine."

879
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:21,080
One day, he went to play soccer with his friends.

880
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:22,930
When he came back, he had a headache and a whole body ache.

881
01:09:23,979 --> 01:09:25,240
Do you know what he did?

882
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,390
He knocked on the door.

883
01:09:29,529 --> 01:09:33,939
He asked me to sit and watch him cry at such a hard time.

884
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:39,740
Especially when he was heartbroken for you.

885
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:41,729
He's even tougher than before.

886
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,240
How was Vee back then?

887
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,600
Back then, Doctor?

888
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,450
He decorated the houses back then,

889
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,710
taking up projects and looking for projects.

890
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:00,950
He had no appetite.

891
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:03,810
He was skinny and often got sick.

892
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:08,070
I had to force him to exercise, which made him hungry.

893
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,590
Fortunately, Tong took him to eat.

894
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:15,250
He felt better in almost a year.

895
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,970
Then, he went to Bangkok to work with Tong.

896
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:24,590
Anyway, please take care of this problematic kid.

897
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:28,550
Thank you so much for taking care of Vee.

898
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:33,350
I'll do my best.

899
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:38,550
From now on, I may often come to disturb you.

900
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:41,180
It's okay, Doctor.

901
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:44,740
Come and try my cooking.

902
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:46,740
Thank you.

903
01:10:47,730 --> 01:10:49,380
I'll take good care of Venus.

904
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,590
Don't worry.

905
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,560
As long as you don't make him heartbroken, that's enough.

906
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,110
I promise.

907
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:07,120
I'm leaving.

908
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,150
Okay.

909
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:09,550
Good luck, Doctor.

910
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:10,250
Hey.

911
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:14,050
It should be, "Good luck, little brother."

912
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,470
Thank you.

913
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:21,550
His name is Sebastian.

914
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:22,640
Don't lose it.

915
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:27,530
Go. Go.

916
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,290
How is it, buddy?

917
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:55,650
Hello. An awful Monday.

918
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:58,770
Also, there are many cases to be dealt with.

919
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:01,170
Get ready to say goodbye to lunch.

920
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,910
OPD (Outpatient Department) must be crowded.

921
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,510
Don't say such ominous words.

922
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:06,730
Uh...

923
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,700
By the way, where did you go today?

924
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,650
Surgery rounds?

925
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:10,820
Yes.

926
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:12,630
I have an appointment for a review case.

927
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:15,490
I'm going to make a diagnosis and write a patient's transfer form.

928
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:19,900
Unfortunately, both of us are busy.

929
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:26,670
I think the long break will be a mess for us.

930
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,720
Forget it.

931
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:32,480
I hope today is not so busy.

932
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:36,540
Why?

933
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:37,790
Where are you going today?

934
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:40,630
To find Venus.

935
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,790
I feel sorry for you.

936
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:49,330
You've been pursuing Venus for so long, but he isn't soft-hearted at all.

937
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,900
Stop mocking me about my pursuing skill.

938
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:57,210
Venus and I are already together.

939
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:58,270
This is ridiculous.

940
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:01,190
Don't fool me.

941
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:06,870
Just wait and see.

942
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:08,290
This is ridiculous.

943
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,330
Hello.

944
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:19,790
I've transferred the money I owe you, sis.

945
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,640
Please check the balance and let me know.

946
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,340
It's okay now, right?

947
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:34,040
Don't forget to send me the receipt, sis.

948
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:36,260
Thank you.

949
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,790
It's okay, right?

950
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:42,310
Yes, it's okay.

951
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:47,580
What do you mean?

952
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:50,100
You still owe me.

953
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,530
I applied for repayment every day.

954
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,850
Don't urge me, okay?

955
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,950
I will urge you harder than this,

956
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:01,030
if you hide something from me.

957
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:04,360
I'm sorry.

958
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:05,420
I promised you.

959
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:07,680
Good.

960
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:17,160
[Mom]

961
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:17,160
Is it from your mom?

962
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:19,320
Yes.

963
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:20,800
Answer it,

964
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:21,750
or your mom will be worried.

965
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:28,160
Hello, Mom.

966
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,240
Your dad wants you to go home.

967
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:33,360
Again?

968
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:36,040
Don't sigh.

969
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:39,200
You know we worry about you.

970
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,270
There's no one in our family working out of the family business.

971
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,630
Why do you have to suffer?

972
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,570
Break up with Janus.

973
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,090
At least you'll have a better life than now when coming back home.

974
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:53,700
I'm happy with J.

975
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:57,590
J takes good care of me. Don't worry.

976
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,140
I haven't suffered much now.

977
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,240
Mom, stop forcing me to go home.

978
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:09,940
Can you encourage us to succeed?

979
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:12,200
I don't know.

980
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,830
It's up to you.

981
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:15,590
Make a choice between family and an outsider.

982
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:16,670
Mom.

983
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:18,260
Mom.

984
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:24,350
Are you okay?

985
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:30,170
I'm fine.

986
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:41,270
Oh.

987
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:43,030
Time flies.

988
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:46,770
Eh, Doctor.

989
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,750
Please write a transfer form for this patient.

990
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:06,300
Thank you.

991
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:06,950
Is everything okay?

992
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:10,760
If there's nothing else, I'm going to enjoy the lunch break.

993
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:11,700
Yes, everything is okay.

994
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:12,890
Thank you.

995
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,140
Where is he going in a hurry?

996
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:04,050
He didn't come to take care of me.

997
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:14,680
Vee.

998
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,300
Are you okay?

999
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,730
You're late.

1000
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:23,730
I'm sorry.

1001
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,360
I came as fast as I could.

1002
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,580
I even bought you porridge.

1003
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:33,670
Didn't you say you'd be here soon?

1004
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:37,620
I really came in a hurry.

1005
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,010
I bought you porridge.

1006
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,240
Here.

1007
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,260
Have some.

1008
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,110
No.

1009
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:49,050
Have some, Vee.

1010
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:51,590
I bought it for you especially,

1011
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,850
so that you can recover quickly.

1012
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:56,740
I'm fine.

1013
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:58,750
I will recover by myself.

1014
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:00,620
Doctor, you are too late.

1015
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,590
Oh, Vee.

1016
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:05,910
I have many cases today.

1017
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,610
I came right after checking them.

1018
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:11,530
Don't be mad at me.

1019
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:15,120
How about this?

1020
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:19,210
If you want to punish me,

1021
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:21,960
you can do anything you want.

1022
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:24,040
Okay?

1023
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:26,170
No.

1024
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:28,070
Then...

1025
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:32,150
you can bite my neck hard.

1026
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:33,310
Here.

1027
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:35,800
Bite my neck.

1028
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:38,230
Bite your neck?

1029
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:39,800
Yes.

1030
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:42,330
I am afraid others would see the marks if you bite other places.

1031
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:43,610
Just bite here.

1032
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,150
No one will notice.

1033
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:46,960
Okay?

1034
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:48,710
Then you'll cool down and eat.

1035
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:52,110
Okay?

1036
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,280
Do you cool down?

1037
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:04,900
A half.

1038
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:06,120
What?

1039
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:09,220
What about the remaining half?

1040
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:11,760
I don't know.

1041
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:18,190
Are you going to bite my lips?

1042
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:38,820
[Please watch Venus in the Sky (undeleted version) on iQIYI APP or iQ.com]

1043
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:30,250
Are you still mad?

1044
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,140
Still mad?

1045
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,020
Are you?

1046
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:34,980
Seriously?

1047
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:35,710
Let me see.

1048
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:39,000
Are you still angry?
