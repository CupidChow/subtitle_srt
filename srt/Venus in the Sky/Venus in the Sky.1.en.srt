Venus.

4
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,260
Where are you going?

5
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,660
Don't tell me you're running home.

6
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,100
No. I'm just going to deliver orders to customers.

7
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,780
There are a lot of customers.

8
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,060
The customers will have to wait for a while.

9
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,180
Having such a good little brother like me,

10
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,540
you are so lucky.

11
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,539
You're amazing.

12
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:10,700
You're just here to help eat food that is near expiration.

13
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,380
I really have to worship you.

14
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,220
Stop complaining.

15
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,620
I was the cashier for you yesterday.

16
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,020
And I'm in charge of the delivery today.

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,700
Well. What about the orders of my regulars?

18
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,460
I've picked them all up. I've memorized the roads yesterday.

19
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,140
They are on my way back home.

20
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,940
I can hang the order on the doorknob, and don't have to call them. Bye.

21
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,180
See you at home.

22
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,060
That's great.

23
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,580
You're going to sneak home before it gets dark.

24
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,180
Are you really going home?

25
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,660
But I'll get tired

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,539
if I work alone.

27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,060
Why is it so hot?

28
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,259
Why is it so hot in Thailand?

29
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,020
It's almost 50 degrees Celsius.

30
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,660
This is your order.

31
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,620
Thank you.

32
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,060
Is everything you ordered here?

33
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,820
Yes.

34
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,020
Thank you.

35
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,780
Same smelling.

36
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,300
Dr. FahKlai Saeng...

37
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,060
Damn!

38
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,740
Are you really going to quit?

39
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,580
Yes. Stop making a sad face.

40
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,940
You can't hold me back.

41
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,060
Oh! I just don't want you to quit.

42
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,460
Our project with Mr. Turk is not finished yet.

43
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,540
Are you really going to leave me behind?

44
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,940
I really can't stand working with someone who plagiarizes other people's work.

45
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,100
Just finish this project well and cross my name off.

46
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,020
I'm done talking about it.

47
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,580
Alright. Okay.

48
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,420
I really can't stop you, right?

49
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,180
It made me feel exhausted.

50
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,020
Please pass on my encouragement to Mr. Turk.

51
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,980
Okay. Then go all out on

52
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,780
what you want to do. I'll be there for you.

53
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,500
I've decided.

54
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,180
I'm going to my brother's house to rest for a while.

55
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,020
Then, think about it afterwards.

56
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,180
Well, it's good.

57
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,940
Well... You...

58
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,460
Well...

59
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,940
You're okay with that, right?

60
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,580
I think he works at a hospital not far from TonKla.

61
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,940
Are you okay with that?

62
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,620
Want me to ask my baby for you later?

63
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,409
It's okay.

64
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,460
They're not in the same hospital, are they?

65
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,260
But my baby and Sky often talk

66
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,260
and eat together.

67
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,490
We won't see each other.

68
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,580
There are many hospitals.

69
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,980
But I don't care if I meet him.

70
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,420
I don't have any feelings for him anymore.

71
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,380
Well, okay, it's been three years.

72
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,020
What are you going to do next?

73
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,180
When are you coming back?

74
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,300
Well, I've packed all of my stuff.

75
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,980
I have cleared all tasks.

76
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,260
I think I'll go back after helping you choose furniture.

77
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,860
-Are you really going back? -Yes.

78
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,260
Can I hug you?

79
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,340
Please come by my house if you have time.

80
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,940
J always says that he misses you.

81
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,659
Em. I'll when I have time.

82
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,020
Hey. This bed is nice.

83
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,460
It's sturdy. I don't think it'll cause back pain.

84
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,580
I'll definitely miss you.

85
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,140
After this, when I go to work,

86
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,220
the person sitting next to me is no longer you.

87
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,180
It makes me feel bad.

88
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,700
You're overacting.

89
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,860
If there is no traffic jam, it won't take more than an hour to get to my house, right?

90
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,650
You can even drive to see Kla once a week.

91
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,100
Oh!

92
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,420
Kla is my baby.

93
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,660
You know, we don't have much time for each other.

94
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,100
So, I told you to come see me when you have time.

95
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,260
I'm definitely going to see you.

96
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,220
You also need to take care of yourself.

97
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,419
Sleep well at home.

98
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,140
Okay?

99
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,020
OK. I'll sleep well for you.

100
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,460
Okay.

101
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,940
Please help me continue choosing.

102
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,620
Hey, I like this chair.

103
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,980
Yes. But I want to change the color of it.

104
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,460
Where did he go?

105
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,860
J.

106
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,100
J, are you home?

107
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,780
Not at home?

108
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,420
Where did he go?

109
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,180
Janus.

110
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,300
J.

111
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,020
Is he not here?

112
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,100
So, this is a non-toxic environment.

113
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,260
[Rock Music]

114
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,060
Oh! He's at home.

115
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,220
I'm finally back. Why are you...

116
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,180
Darn it.

117
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,580
What are you doing?

118
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,740
Damn, Vee.

119
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,380
Why did you come into my room?

120
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,660
I thought you were upstairs alone.

121
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,380
No one answered me.

122
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,700
Didn't you say you were coming tomorrow?

123
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,420
I already told you on Line this morning.

124
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,420
Why didn't you call me?

125
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,340
I did, but no one answered.

126
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,340
I...

127
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,100
Emm. Forget it.

128
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,180
Since you're here, what do you want...

129
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,740
Don't get up!

130
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,140
Bomb.

131
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,780
You can't wait to see me, right?

132
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,290
Come on.

133
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,020
Come here.

134
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,100
You'd better not.

135
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,260
Come on.

136
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,140
Come on.

137
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,420
Just go back and finish your business.

138
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,620
You can't wait to see me, can you?

139
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,020
Come here.

140
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,220
Hello? What's up, my dear friend?

141
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,620
You always call me when I'm working.

142
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,700
Or, did you change your mind and want to come back to help me?

143
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,940
No, I didn't.

144
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,700
I already have my hopes up.

145
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,900
Do you know what I saw when I got home?

146
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,100
What? Is your house a mess?

147
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,020
The house is clean. Just some furniture is out of place.

148
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,060
But it's not messy.

149
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,700
Huh? What did you see?

150
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,740
I saw J's exclusive love scene.

151
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,220
Well, you should be happy.

152
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,820
Your brother finally has a boyfriend.

153
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,260
I'm happy, but...

154
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,290
I didn't expect it to be him.

155
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,460
Who is it?

156
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,420
His best friend, Bomb.

157
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,620
Bomb.

158
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,420
Is he the guy who came to your graduation?

159
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,500
Is that the guy you once told me you were close to

160
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,940
because he pursued you, but your brother beat you to it?

161
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,900
Yes, him.

162
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,980
I don't know what position they're in now.

163
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,140
They are making noise in the room.

164
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,980
Like a sadist.

165
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,940
A sadist?

166
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,860
Come on. Hit me harder.

167
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,780
Harder.

168
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,820
Harder?

169
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,980
Want more?

170
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,260
Hold on, wait.

171
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,260
You're too hard.

172
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,940
Damn, it's cute. It's like fate.

173
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,460
Don't complain about J too much. Just let him be happy.

174
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,340
He has taken care of you for many years.

175
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,620
I don't want to complain.

176
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,020
But I think there will be something annoying in the future.

177
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,740
Okay, relax.

178
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,140
I have to go back to work.

179
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,860
I have an appointment with a client. It's almost time.

180
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,810
Talk later, friend.

181
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,940
Okay.

182
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,500
Call me if you need anything.

183
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,620
Okay, see you later.

184
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,900
Bye.

185
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,660
Bye.

186
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,940
Vee, are you okay?

187
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,860
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

188
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,380
Oh, so-so. What about you?

189
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,540
Good. J asked me to move in with him.

190
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,940
I'll be coming in and out here quite often for a while.

191
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,420
Oh, feel free to do it.

192
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,460
I'm here.

193
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,780
Why didn't you tell me that you were coming?

194
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,900
I didn't prepare anything.

195
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,980
Here, eat this.

196
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,980
Open it slowly.

197
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,100
I changed my mind this morning.

198
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,540
But I sent you a message, didn't I?

199
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,220
Then why didn't you call me?

200
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,940
I didn't have time to read it.

201
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,970
Alright, I'll call.

202
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,300
But if I come home and see something like this again,

203
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,100
you need to pay for my therapy.

204
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,260
I can still see those images.

205
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,580
My mental health is damaged.

206
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,900
Your mental health is damaged?

207
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Let's do another round in front of him again.

208
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,740
Just stop complaining and eat it.

209
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,180
Thank goodness,

210
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,300
I have frozen food in my fridge.

211
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,020
Otherwise, you'll starve to death.

212
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,900
It seems like you don't cook by yourself anymore.

213
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,579
You only buy frozen food.

214
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,740
I'm the owner of a convenience store.

215
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,180
Of course, I have to buy some in case of an emergency.

216
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,500
Besides, what's wrong with frozen food?

217
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,900
It's convenient and doesn't take long to warm up.

218
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,099
What's your plan since you came back?

219
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,420
Will you be here for long?

220
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,540
I don't know yet.

221
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,780
I think I'll take a break and think later.

222
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,140
Could it be...

223
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,500
you had a fight with your friend?

224
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,940
Is he cute?

225
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,450
Your thin friend, right?

226
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,970
Who?

227
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,650
I don't know. That thin friend.

228
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,460
Tong?

229
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,020
Yes.

230
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,980
No, we never argued.

231
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,940
Then...

232
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,940
About your boyfriend?

233
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,220
No. I'll tell you if I find one.

234
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,900
Now,

235
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,220
let me go to sleep first.

236
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,020
I work from 8 a.m. to tomorrow's 3 a.m.

237
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,060
It's still the same salary, 35,000 baht.

238
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,340
Do you have any money?

239
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,260
I have some savings. Don't worry.

240
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,540
I worked so hard that I had no time to spend money.

241
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,860
If you need anything,

242
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,220
just tell me.

243
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,340
Take a break if you want to rest.

244
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,340
We can talk about what you want to do later.

245
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,900
Okay.

246
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,020
Let's eat.

247
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,660
I put it here. Otherwise, you may regret it.

248
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,260
You'll set up the room soon. You're really an interior decorator.

249
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,820
What?

250
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,420
Are you here to cause trouble?

251
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,940
No.

252
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,580
Is everything in order?

253
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,260
Yes.

254
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,500
You came here to ask me that?

255
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,500
Did you wash your feet?

256
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,820
Oh.

257
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,300
I came to you right after I finished watering the plants.

258
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,340
Put your feet down.

259
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,900
No.

260
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,140
I'll kick your ass.

261
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,900
No!

262
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,500
Put them down!

263
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,020
Uh...

264
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,420
Vee.

265
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,020
If you're free these days,

266
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,180
would you like to come and see my new business?

267
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,460
But....

268
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,500
I need more employees.

269
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,100
You're trying to trick me into working for you, right?

270
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,820
You always know me well.

271
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,340
Please? Can you help me?

272
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,060
You can go later when you're bored and have nothing to do.

273
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,300
Please? Please?

274
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,220
Okay.

275
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,220
But...

276
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,980
I'll try it first.

277
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,740
Yes!

278
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,540
Put your feet down!

279
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,420
No.

280
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,980
Hay! I'm going to fall.

281
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,420
Hey.

282
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,820
If you have time, come and help me.

283
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,500
Okay.

284
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,780
Your feet are dirty.

285
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,140
My room is messed up.

286
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,980
I marked the last step

287
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,580
with an asterisk.

288
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,180
Decorate the milk foam, then add the cocoa powder...

289
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,820
Are you listening?

290
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,100
Are you sleepy?

291
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,940
Yes.

292
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,340
I thought you wanted me to come in the afternoon.

293
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,180
I cleaned my room until morning.

294
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,900
Of course, you must come at this time.

295
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,540
It's crowded in the afternoon.

296
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,300
I can also teach you about the job now.

297
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,580
Do you want something to drink? I can show you how to make it later.

298
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,260
But look carefully when I make it. So you can help me next time.

299
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,620
You did trick me into working for you.

300
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,620
What would you like to drink?

301
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,900
Do you want this, Thai tea frappe?

302
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,060
It's a best-seller. It's fragrant, sweet, mellow, and delicious.

303
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,820
Em. Sure.

304
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,900
Okay.

305
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,300
Stir. Stir. That's enough.

306
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,410
Enough.

307
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,540
Then pour it into the cup.

308
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,180
Is this really the recipe? You're not messing with me, are you?

309
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,940
Why would I? It's all good stuff.

310
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,300
Pour it into the cup and drink it.

311
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,700
It can refresh you so you can work for me.

312
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
Hurry up.

313
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,540
It's delicious.

314
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,100
It smells just right.

315
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,740
See? I told you.

316
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,020
This one is really good. Let me check it out.

317
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,340
Pass.

318
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,930
Hurry up and drink it.

319
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,740
Put it in the room.

320
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,620
What?

321
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,180
This box. Hurry up.

322
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,380
Do you really want me to start work today?

323
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,900
Yes.

324
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,660
Have you heard of it?

325
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,660
Learning by doing.

326
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,420
You know?

327
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,620
Can I finish this cup first?

328
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,580
Yes, hurry.

329
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,340
Hurry up. The customers are coming. Go.

330
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
Hurry, take the box out.

331
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,460
Okay.

332
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,620
You're so slow. You're not serious at all.

333
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:31,650
[Rock Music]

334
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,940
One Thai tea frappe, less sweet, please.

335
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,540
One Thai tea frappe, less sweet, right?

336
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,340
Yes.

337
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,940
Whoa.

338
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,940
Doctor.

339
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,260
Are you a doctor from a nearby hospital?

340
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,220
Yes.

341
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,140
I happened to see the newly opened 7-11 convenience store,

342
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,740
so I stopped by.

343
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,820
Welcome, Doctor.

344
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,580
But if you need to buy a lot of things,

345
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,820
you can order them on our app. My staff will send it to you.

346
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,060
It's super convenient. You don't have to come in person.

347
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,540
Doctor, take out your phone first.

348
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,090
Download the app from the App Store.

349
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,770
What is the name of the app again?

350
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,450
7-11 Delivery. Type in the name.

351
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,780
7-11 Delivery.

352
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,420
Yes, type it.

353
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,060
OK, if my house is around here, you can also deliver my order, right?

354
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,580
Yes. Just order,

355
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,420
I'll ask my staff to deliver it to you later.

356
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,460
Okay.

357
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,860
I've downloaded it.

358
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Thanks for recommending it to me.

359
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,100
Thank you so much, Doctor.

360
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,740
Wait a moment, Doctor.

361
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,500
Doctor. You don't need to wait for long. I'll skip the queue for you.

362
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,380
-The client didn’t come. So you can save time to heal the wounded. -Thank you very much.

363
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,060
-Thank you. -Okay.

364
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,900
Doctor.

365
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,530
This one, 50 baht.

366
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,100
Sorry.

367
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,380
-Here. -Thank you.

368
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,940
Thank you.

369
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,260
Don't forget to place the order, Doctor. My staff will deliver for you!

370
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,180
I've got a new customer.

371
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,820
Who are you talking to?

372
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,260
Your friend?

373
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,820
Why would I talk to my friend?

374
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,700
I was talking to a customer.

375
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,500
I think he's a doctor from the hospital nearby.

376
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,500
By the way,

377
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,380
do you get excited whenever you see

378
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,500
a handsome guy? You're a slut like me.

379
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,020
Nonsense.

380
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,820
I didn't even see his face.

381
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,780
Come here.

382
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,260
You remember how to make a Thai tea frappe, right?

383
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,380
This will also be a bestseller.

384
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,620
Chocolate frappe and chocolate Oreo frappe.

385
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,860
You need a spoonful of cocoa powder

386
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,650
and hot water.

387
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,170
You have to pour in two ounces of hot water

388
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,500
and add 2.5 grams of sauce.

389
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,100
After that, the drink must be exactly 1 cup.

390
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,380
You need Oreos. 3 Oreos per cup.

391
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,860
Listen carefully and learn.

392
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,860
Here.

393
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,340
Remember it.

394
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,260
You're going to use this blender.

395
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,060
[Many days later...]

396
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,740
Why should I be paranoid about him?

397
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,060
I think he works at a hospital not far from TonKla.

398
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,860
He probably wouldn't work around here.

399
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,620
I've been sitting here for days, but I haven't seen him.

400
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,500
I'm so handsome. Are you going to sit here and wait for him like Tong and the others?

401
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,460
Sis, what else do you want to eat?

402
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,820
Sis your ass.

403
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,220
I'm sorry.

404
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,940
Your brother told me to tease you like this.

405
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,020
Tell him if you call me sis again,

406
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,010
I'll hit.

407
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,100
Uh! Hit the boss!

408
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,820
I'll beat you first.

409
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,980
Don't hide from me.

410
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,420
Calm down. I'm sorry.

411
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,860
You are as fierce as your brother said.

412
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,660
You haven't stopped yet?

413
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,580
I'll stop.

414
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,610
I'm sorry.

415
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,300
Well...

416
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,820
Have you been working here for a long time?

417
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,820
It's been a while, about a month or so.

418
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,740
What?

419
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,050
Are there many doctors here?

420
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,580
Yeah. Our shop is next to the hospital.

421
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,140
Sis... Oh! That's a weird question.

422
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,060
Have you ever seen a doctor about this tall,

423
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,860
well-built, fair-skinned, and good-looking,

424
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,620
but looks like a cat?

425
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,210
Looks like a cat. What kind of cat is he?

426
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,180
Have you seen him before or not?

427
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,410
Are there only two answers?

428
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,100
Whoa.

429
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,140
I shouldn't have asked you.

430
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,940
I think I saw someone.

431
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,940
Really? I'll hit you if you lie.

432
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,940
Why would I lie to you?

433
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,140
Hey!

434
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,980
Why did you two get into a fight instead of working?

435
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,460
Look.

436
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,260
He's dragging me in for a chat.

437
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,860
You are the troublemaker.

438
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,380
What did he ask you?

439
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,660
Venus just asked...

440
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,460
No. He didn't ask me anything.

441
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,220
See?

442
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,820
I didn't ask him anything.

443
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,180
One of you must be lying to me.

444
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,140
You can go back to work now.

445
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,180
Yes, boss.

446
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,780
My brother is really good.

447
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,740
You just come to eat food that is about to expire and take money from customers.

448
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,940
Don't you eat it?

449
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,620
No.

450
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,540
It's delicious.

451
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,620
No.

452
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,820
-Vee, I want to pick up something. -What? Is it a regular customer?

453
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,900
What?

454
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,580
Did a regular customer order these?

455
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,090
Yes.

456
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,780
Wow, can you remember just looking at the items in the cart?

457
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,660
I've been taking this order for four days in a row now.

458
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,620
You're so cool. You're awesome. My idol!

459
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,260
You can go do something else.

460
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,780
Okay. I'll go take care of another order.

461
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,100
We have two orders?

462
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,860
Yes. We have to deliver it to them.

463
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,410
Go get the goods ready. I'll deliver them later.

464
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,580
Thank you.

465
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,100
What kind of person eats the same thing every day?

466
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,500
Same smelling.

467
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,460
What are you doing?

468
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,260
Why are you sniffing me? Get out.

469
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,020
You smell so good.

470
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,700
It's mild and not overpowering.

471
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,540
Is it the same smell as the detergent you use?

472
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,340
Yes, it's baby laundry detergent.

473
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,330
If I wash my clothes myself, I use this.

474
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,140
Try it.

475
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,780
Oh.

476
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,420
Do I have to use it a lot?

477
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,940
No.

478
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,500
Okay.

479
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,420
Will my smell be the same as yours after using it?

480
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,660
Why do you want to smell like me?

481
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:26,170
You smell good. I like it.

482
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,300
I'll be relieved after smelling that smell.

483
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,860
You're exaggerating.

484
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,020
No, I'm serious.

485
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,220
What kind of soap do you use in the shower?

486
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,220
The one you put in the bathroom.

487
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,380
Really?

488
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,860
That's great.

489
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,420
From now on,

490
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,580
my scent

491
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,700
will be the same as yours.

492
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,380
Dr. FahKlai Saeng...

493
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,140
Damn!

494
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,180
Venus.

495
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,220
Hey, Vee! What are you doing here?

496
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,300
Don't touch me.

497
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,740
Wait, Vee.

498
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,020
Did it hurt when I bumped into you just now?

499
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,340
Are you okay?

500
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,860
I'm fine. Let me go.

501
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,980
Vee.

502
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,780
Wait. Let's talk.

503
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,220
No, I don't want to. I'm going back.

504
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,100
Vee.

505
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,340
Did you come to see me?

506
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,220
Are you crazy?

507
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,340
Why would I come to see you?

508
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,140
Well...

509
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,620
You came to deliver my order?

510
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,300
-I’m going back. -Hey.

511
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,500
Where do you live? Is it far? I am worried about you.

512
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,860
I can take care of myself. Don't worry about me.

513
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,940
Vee.

514
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,500
Just forget that you met me.

515
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,940
How could I forget you? I have a good memory.

516
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,860
You're crazy?

517
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,020
Whoa, Vee.

518
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,179
But I can recommend delicious restaurants

519
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,659
around here for you.

520
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,580
I've lived here since I was a kid.

521
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,219
But there are many new restaurants opening up.

522
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,820
You just need to let me go, like before.

523
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,300
Okay?

524
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,100
Vee, wait.

525
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,420
Vee, where are you going? Is your home far away?

526
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:32,500
Will you stay here, Vee?

527
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,820
I'm sorry, Vee.

528
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,060
Vee.

529
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,620
Hello, Doctor.

530
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,900
You're early today. What would you like to drink?

531
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,340
Well...

532
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,540
Is Thai tea frappe, less sweet, as usual?

533
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,300
Yes.

534
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,450
I'll have one.

535
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,500
I'm just kidding. You can order whatever you want.

536
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,620
I'll make it for you later.

537
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,170
I want Thai tea. I like it.

538
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,260
Okay, wait a moment. I'll do it for you.

539
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,900
Okay, Doctor.

540
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,020
Done! Your Thai tea frappe, less sugar.

541
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,060
Yes.

542
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,620
Is Venus here?

543
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,340
Oh!

544
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,580
Doctor, you know Vee?

545
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,020
Vee is my brother.

546
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,300
He is your cousin?

547
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,020
Real brother. I am his eldest brother, Janus.

548
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,340
And he's my younger brother, Venus.

549
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,660
It seems that you guys have different styles.

550
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,420
Everyone says that, Doctor.

551
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,500
Even my father thought my mother had cheated on him.

552
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,300
But I've got more handsome and prettier genes than him.

553
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,860
He just inherited the height gene.

554
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,380
By the way,

555
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,140
how do you know Vee?

556
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,020
He happened to be my friend in college.

557
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,740
What's your name?

558
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,980
I can ask him.

559
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,620
Well...

560
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,340
Sky.

561
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,620
Dr. Sky.

562
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,300
Yes.

563
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,740
Or you can call me Sky.

564
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,900
Okay.

565
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,100
Yes.

566
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,220
By the way,

567
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,420
I don't think Vee can be your friend. You studied at different schools.

568
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,140
Doctor.

569
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,500
Are you listening to me?

570
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,260
Yes.

571
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,540
How did you become friends with Vee?

572
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,660
Well...

573
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,020
It was a coincidence.

574
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,300
Well...

575
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,780
My best friend and Vee's best friend...

576
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,260
They're a couple.

577
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,740
Wow~

578
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:45,380
Are you Pai Tong's lovely boyfriend?

579
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,500
Yes.

580
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,340
Did Vee ask you out?

581
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,890
Or did he do something to you?

582
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,860
Uh~ No.

583
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,620
Vee sent something to my house last night.

584
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,820
I didn't say hi as he looked in a hurry,

585
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,460
so I came to see him today.

586
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,380
Doctor,

587
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,500
he won't be here on time.

588
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,330
I think... he won't be here until dusk.

589
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,380
Well...

590
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,980
Did Vee move here?

591
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,410
Yes, he moved here from home a few days ago.

592
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:23,580
He packed his stuff, watched a drama,

593
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,780
and complained about me.

594
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,500
He was the same as before.

595
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,060
Huh?

596
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,300
What do you mean?

597
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,380
Eh, nothing.

598
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,540
Okay. Doctor, drink quickly before it melt.

599
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,500
Okay, bye.

600
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:42,100
Doctor, there you go again.

601
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,340
What?

602
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,460
It's the second time. Doctor, 50 baht.

603
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,260
Oh.

604
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,340
You're always so funny, Doctor.

605
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,460
I'm sorry.

606
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,140
Don't do this any more.

607
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,380
Thank you.

608
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,420
Who are you looking for?

609
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,220
Hey, Doctor, is it lunch break?

610
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,100
Yes.

611
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,340
What would you like?

612
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,740
My less-sugar milk shake?

613
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:32,930
Yes, I like it, but I come to buy...

614
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,980
eh...

615
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,740
a nail clipper.

616
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,540
Can I buy it here?

617
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,700
Nail clipper?

618
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,980
Your nails aren't long.

619
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,900
If you wonder what's on sale in the store,

620
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,340
click into the APP I told you to download.

621
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,260
Find what you need in advance through it.

622
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,620
Well. I forgot.

623
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,220
Venus…hasn't come yet?

624
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,340
He said he's sleepy and wouldn't come here.

625
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,540
He asked for a leave until tomorrow, Doctor.

626
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,260
He's been sleeping for too long.

627
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,100
Sometimes, I thought he was dead.

628
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,380
He sleeps a lot, Doctor.

629
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,340
Then try to contact him.

630
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,620
Oh...

631
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,300
-Text him? I forgot this way. -Yes.

632
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,700
I'll try it.

633
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,820
If he doesn't reply, it means he's asleep,

634
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,100
and I'll tell him later.

635
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,380
Thank you.

636
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,500
You want a nail clipper?

637
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,060
I'll get it for you.

638
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,500
Doctor,

639
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,220
Is it okay?

640
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,420
What for?

641
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:54,740
Huh?

642
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,700
You said you wanted a nail clipper.

643
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,500
Well,

644
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,060
yes, I need it. Thank you.

645
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,860
Pay at the front desk.

646
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,900
Okay.

647
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,380
Have a rest, Doctor.

648
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,980
Guys, take care of the customers.

649
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,340
Doctor,

650
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,730
you've been always here.

651
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,740
I just got off work,

652
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,260
and wanted to take a walk.

653
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,380
Wait. What are you doing here, Doctor?

654
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,980
For a walk.

655
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,420
For a walk? Here?

656
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,220
How many employees are working today?

657
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,060
Today?

658
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,140
Hmm, just me.

659
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,340
And two waitresses at the reception.

660
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,740
And this one,

661
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,380
packing up the products on the shelf.

662
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,860
Night workers don't get on well together.

663
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,300
I've talked with them several times.

664
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,820
Vee watches dramas and refused to help me.

665
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,180
Alas,

666
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,140
then feel free to take a walk.

667
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,820
Okay.

668
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,820
I won't bother you. Thank you.

669
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,980
Hey, Doctor!

670
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,980
Didn't you come here for a walk?

671
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,780
Ank,

672
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,740
do we have a place to take a walk?

673
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,420
Hey, Vee.

674
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,370
You scared me. I thought you were a ghost.

675
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,940
What ghost? What is it?

676
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,620
Are you going to the store tomorrow?

677
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,220
Can't I take a day off?

678
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,860
How many days haven't you been to the store?

679
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,380
Please help me.

680
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,260
Tomorrow,

681
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,460
I'm going to conduct several interviews.

682
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,140
Can you keep shop for me?

683
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,980
Nobody comes to help me at night.

684
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,250
Then let your boyfriend Bomb do it.

685
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,380
Why me?

686
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,660
Bomb has to deliver goods.

687
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,940
I don't want him to keep shop at night,

688
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,820
it's so tired,

689
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,620
and goes against my wish.

690
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,660
Mom will be heartbroken if she finds out

691
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,580
her precious son suffer so much.

692
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,090
Let me finish the movie first.

693
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:51,980
OK?

694
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,780
Please help me, please.

695
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,540
Don't disturb me, J.

696
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,180
Dear brother,

697
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,020
you can't be so cruel when I'm in trouble.

698
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,010
Please help me, please.

699
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,860
Okay.

700
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,140
I'll help you tomorrow.

701
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,580
But now, let me go.

702
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,060
Ok.

703
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,900
Oh, I almost forget it.

704
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,540
Did you reply to your friend, that doctor?

705
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,780
What message? Which doctor?

706
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,780
Dr. Sky.

707
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,740
He said he's your friend.

708
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,540
Then I asked him to send you a message.

709
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,140
Haven't you talked yet?

710
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,980
Oh, wait!

711
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,220
Did he go to the store?

712
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,860
Yes, he came every day and asked about you.

713
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,300
Is he so free?

714
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,180
He's not free.

715
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,940
He stayed there for a while at rest time,

716
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,460
and looked foggy at night,

717
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,460
He said he came here for a walk.

718
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,900
Take a walk in a shop, crazy man.

719
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,380
Then reply to his message.

720
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,140
I think he wants to see you.

721
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,300
Eh, now? Forget it.

722
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,300
Let me watch a movie first.

723
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,140
Okay, okay. I'll leave you alone.

724
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:06,400
After waking up tomorrow,

725
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,180
help me out in the shop.

726
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,220
Ok.

727
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,900
Deal.

728
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,100
How could I say hello to him?

729
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,050
I've blocked him.

730
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,140
Hey, you're so heavy. Have a good sleep.

731
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,060
You smell good.

732
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:49,620
You always like to do so.

733
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,340
What do you mean?

734
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,610
Not always.

735
00:44:54,610 --> 00:45:01,780
I got so drunk to celebrate your graduation,

736
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,460
but I have to study for two more years.

737
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,500
Can you repeat the grade in school?

738
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,940
I want friends.

739
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,090
I want to be with you.

740
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,980
But I don't want to be with you anymore.

741
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,380
Why?

742
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,460
You

743
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,620
make me think about the future.

744
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,380
Until now,

745
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,020
I don't want to maintain the status quo.

746
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,940
Don't bite your lips.

747
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,740
I love you, Sky.

748
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,580
I see.

749
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,740
I'm

750
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,060
handsome and cute,

751
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,260
and cool,

752
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,900
and attractive.

753
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,060
But you...

754
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,220
stop teasing me.

755
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,700
I won't be fooled by you.

756
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,900
I really love you.

757
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,820
Just like how someone loves another.

758
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,140
But I think,

759
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,220
all I have for you is friendship.

760
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:34,020
Friendship? Who would kiss a friend?

761
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,340
I'm sorry.

762
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,330
No need to apologize, Sky.

763
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,940
Just a kiss.

764
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,700
Don't care about my feelings.

765
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,700
You just did what you've been doing.

766
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,580
Like what I've been doing?

767
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,500
I've always cared about you.

768
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,980
I care about you all the times.

769
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,140
But just now...

770
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,100
Let me go!

771
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,460
No.

772
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,660
It's good to be friends as usual, isn't it?

773
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,380
Let's be friends.

774
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,980
Friends?

775
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,660
Would you do this to all your friends?

776
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,500
No,

777
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,540
but we can still be the same as before.

778
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,940
I'm sorry.

779
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,100
The same as before?

780
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,620
We can't be friends like before.

781
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,780
No, Vee.

782
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,100
Vee.

783
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,300
Hey.

784
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,380
How are you, guy, you look awful.

785
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,220
Is it because you were on duty for two days?

786
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,140
No.

787
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,060
I want to see someone,

788
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,580
but he was hiding from me.

789
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,940
You suddenly have a love problem.

790
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,220
Who is your love?

791
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,980
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

792
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,780
Well... fine.

793
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,580
This is the fate of a medical student.

794
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,060
Few people can get what they want.

795
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,020
Hmm, really.

796
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,140
I'm frustrated.

797
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,940
Hey, Sky.

798
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,300
Teachers always say you're the best.

799
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,460
You can't be discouraged like this.

800
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,780
Before we check OPD [Outpatient Department],

801
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,840
how about getting some coffee?

802
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,900
It may make you feel better.

803
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,140
I'll order one later.

804
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,580
Do you want some coffee?

805
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:19,740
I'll get you some.

806
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,380
Huh?

807
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,260
Well, okay, thank you.

808
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,420
Hmm. I'll buy it for you.

809
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,130
You're welcome.

810
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:30,020
Hey, why are you so attentive?

811
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,100
It's hot.

812
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,780
It's faster if I go to pick it at the shop.

813
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,860
Okay, just a moment.

814
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,740
I'll be right there.

815
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:39,260
Sky, no need. Just order it on the APP.

816
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:42,660
Sky, oh, it's too late.

817
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,340
What's wrong with him?

818
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,460
Will I run into him today?

819
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,980
No, I won't. Doctors are busy.

820
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,020
What are you complaining about?

821
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,900
Take your stuff and go. Or I'll tell J.

822
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,140
You're such a snitch.

823
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,180
Wait and see.

824
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,940
I'm leaving.

825
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,980
Vee.

826
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,340
No, you got the wrong person.

827
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,740
That's right, Vee.

828
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,100
Wait, Vee.

829
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,460
Where are you going?

830
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,090
Move!

831
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:58,980
No.

832
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:00,500
Move!

833
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,420
No.

834
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,020
Hey, where are you going?

835
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,140
I said move away!

836
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,300
No.

837
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,940
Are you going to move or not?

838
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,740
No.

839
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,420
-No? Are you sure? -Yes.

840
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,420
Okay.

841
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,220
What are you doing?

842
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:34,920
Stop! Stop!

843
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,370
Doctor!

844
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,580
Are you okay, Doctor?

845
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,380
Sit down. Have a seat.

846
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,300
Move. Move.

847
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,770
Oh my...

848
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,860
Come here.

849
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,820
Why are you fighting in front of the store?

850
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,740
I don't want to see him. He's annoying.

851
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,380
The doctor said he's your friend.

852
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,620
What kind of friend

853
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,820
you will hit with your knee?

854
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,580
Or...

855
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,060
Is he the person who made you cry?

856
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,340
Be quiet, J.

857
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,540
I have no feelings for him.

858
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:16,740
If so, then talk to him.

859
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,020
Or do you still have feelings?

860
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,020
We can talk.

861
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,580
Then have a good talk.

862
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,580
You bumped into him. Come to say sorry.

863
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,580
Why didn't you move?

864
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,410
If you did, you wouldn't have been hit.

865
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,380
What else?

866
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

867
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,300
Louder.

868
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,340
I'm sorry.

869
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,020
Good boy.

870
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,660
I'm sorry, Doctor.

871
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,140
Come on, go inside. Let me help you.

872
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,020
Thank you.

873
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,420
Really, Doctor?

874
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,980
Yes.

875
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,620
Here.

876
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:08,980
Take the milk tea to say sorry. It's melt.

877
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:15,500
And wipe the table your friend sat on.

878
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,220
No, I'll clean it when he leaves.

879
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,660
Go ahead.

880
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,940
He comes to find you three times a day.

881
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,460
You should talk to him.

882
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,660
No, I don't want to.

883
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:31,820
You need to be clear with him.

884
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,660
That will stop him from coming to you often.

885
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,460
I'm starting to doubt.

886
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,980
How much did he pay you?

887
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,700
He didn't pay me.

888
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,460
I just don't want to see you two fight here.

889
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,940
I didn't mean it.

890
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,580
He's so annoying.

891
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,420
Think of him as training your patience.

892
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,940
Imagine him as a customer.

893
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,700
Practice endurance? For what?

894
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,380
I went to college.

895
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,940
What are you complaining about?

896
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,300
Fine.

897
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,180
Go ahead.

898
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,180
Take the Thai milk tea with you.

899
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,650
Go.

900
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,820
I have interviews for job seekers.

901
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,940
Go ahead. Do not dawdle.

902
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,690
Huh?

903
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,380
Well... Go away. I need to clean the table.

904
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,780
Move over there. Not this way.

905
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,540
I'm sorry.

906
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,220
You smell the same as before.

907
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:04,540
You smell like...

908
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,820
What's that smell?

909
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,140
Cleaner for wiping tables? Here you are.

910
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,820
No, I mean you smell like...

911
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,420
Enough. I don't want to know.

912
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:23,220
How are you doing?

913
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,060
As you can see.

914
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,300
So you're not working with Tong anymore?

915
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,380
No, I'm sick of it.

916
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,620
Why?

917
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,820
You did well when you were in college.

918
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:37,020
Why? Many medical graduates became senators.

919
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,620
You're right.

920
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,480
Hey, are you feeling better now?

921
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,610
Can you go back to the hospital?

922
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,060
Gosh!

923
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,300
Are you driving away a customer?

924
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,620
Yes.

925
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,380
But I still want to talk to you.

926
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,260
Unluckily I don't want to.

927
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,220
Stay with me for a while.

928
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,260
Wait, Vee.

929
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:25,860
Have you been here long? Will you stay here?

930
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,260
There are a lot of good restaurants nearby.

931
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,220
Do you want to eat with me?

932
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:34,500
I want to invite you to dinner. Let's go.

933
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,700
No, I'm busy.

934
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,740
Use your free time to rest.

935
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,860
No, I'm not tired.

936
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,580
My spare time is all about you.

937
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,140
Can you pay and go back to the hospital?

938
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,220
And this.

939
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,180
Are you serious?

940
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,700
I'm serious. What's wrong?

941
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,580
Are you buying condoms early in the morning?

942
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,700
I'm sorry. I took the wrong one.

943
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,740
10 baht.

944
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,380
OK, 10 baht.

945
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,740
Thank you. You're welcome.

946
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,620
Gosh~

947
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,140
It still hurts.

948
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:44,260
Seriously, aren't you going back to work?

949
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,620
The patients must be waiting for you.

950
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:49,420
I'm serious too.

951
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,620
Why do you kick me out like this?

952
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,300
I just want to talk to you a little longer.

953
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,980
Than I'll go back.

954
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,860
You're in the way of other customers.

955
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,940
Which one? I didn't see anyone.

956
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,020
Just in case.

957
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:08,500
Okay, I see.

958
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,020
Then leave.

959
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,500
But I still want to talk to you.

960
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,660
But I don't want to talk to you anymore.

961
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,380
You can leave now.

962
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,780
Well, before I leave,

963
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,580
can I ask you for a favor?

964
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:28,340
Could you please

965
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:32,220
stop blocking me on Facebook, IG, Line

966
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:36,100
and other social media?

967
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,820
Then I will leave.

968
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,740
If I do so, you'll leave, right?

969
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,860
Yes, I promise.

970
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:01,540
Well, okay. You can go now.

971
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,820
Okay. Thank you.

972
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,700
I'm going to check the patients.

973
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:11,820
Remember to reply to my message on Line.

974
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,180
Bye-bye.

975
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,020
I won't reply even if you text me.

976
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,660
Thank you. My dear brother.

977
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,620
I am thirsty.

978
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,260
What's wrong with you?

979
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:00,140
I'm thirsty.

980
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:04,260
I've interviewed many men, so I'm thirsty.

981
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:12,180
Look at you. You're so sly.

982
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,060
How?

983
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,420
Everything you did.

984
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,580
You are not cute today. Give me your hand.

985
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,620
How could you do so to your friend?

986
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,620
We're not friends anymore.

987
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:32,500
Then you shouldn't have done so.

988
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,460
It's not like you.

989
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:37,380
Explain it to me.

990
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,020
Why did you behave so today?

991
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,260
Don't treat me like a child anymore.

992
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:42,820
I've grown up.

993
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:45,060
Look at what you did, you are childish.

994
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:50,020
He's so annoying.

995
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,220
He keeps following me.

996
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,420
I don't know what to say.

997
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:54,500
Since I sent something to his house,

998
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,220
he keeps following me on my way home.

999
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:00,620
I've been avoiding him all the time.

1000
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,980
I was going through a lot,

1001
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,460
but he still follows me.

1002
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:07,020
No need talk to him.

1003
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,700
It's been a long time.

1004
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,090
Why are you still so angry?

1005
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,900
I'm not saying this to make you

1006
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:22,060
become friends again, but if you let it go,

1007
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,620
you will feel relieved.

1008
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,370
You should think about it.

1009
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,020
Do you still have feelings for him?

1010
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,020
If not,

1011
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,620
you don't have to be angry.

1012
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,820
You should not act on impulse like today.

1013
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,460
Got it?

1014
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,780
You're nagging like daddy.

1015
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:44,020
Promise me that you would do so.

1016
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:47,300
Never kick him with your knees again.

1017
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:53,700
I'm not on Dr. Sky's side. But I think

1018
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,020
he really wants to talk to you.

1019
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,420
Yes, I'll try my best.

1020
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:06,460
At least, you can live in peace.

1021
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:10,180
And you and he have good memories.

1022
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:11,980
If not,

1023
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,260
you wouldn't like him, right?

1024
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,100
Are you sure?

1025
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,700
You're not on his side?

1026
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:21,780
I'm not sure.

1027
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,020
Am I on his side?

1028
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,500
Go away.

1029
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,500
I've been listening to you for so long.

1030
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,540
I'm your big brother.

1031
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,220
I'm on your side.

1032
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,340
Forget it.

1033
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,140
By the way, how about you and Bomb?

1034
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,300
Are you happy?

1035
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,250
Me and Bomb?

1036
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:45,300
We're happy.

1037
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,660
Every time I am tired at work,

1038
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,580
when I turn around and see him,

1039
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,500
I am no longer tired.

1040
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:55,180
What do you think? Am I crazy?

1041
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:58,780
Very passionate. I remember it clearly.

1042
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:03,140
Don't let me see you dating someone.

1043
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,420
Leave me alone.

1044
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,180
I'm going to study.

1045
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,100
You're weird.

1046
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,500
I forgot my phone.

1047
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:13,580
Let me have a look.

1048
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,380
Who are you talking to?

1049
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,860
You're weird.

1050
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:44,820
Hello.

1051
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:47,700
Kla, I have something to talk to you.

1052
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,980
What is it?

1053
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:51,380
Don't ask questions. I'm busy.

1054
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,740
Well...

1055
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:56,660
What to do

1056
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,300
if I want to treat a man seriously?

1057
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:02,460
Who? Who makes my friend care about love?

1058
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,740
Tell me what I to do. I'll tell you later.

1059
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,660
Just do what I did to Pai Tong.

1060
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:08,780
It's very simple.

1061
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,060
"Constant dropping wears the stone."

1062
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,220
Is there any other way?

1063
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,460
Wow, what's wrong?

1064
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,300
It's the best idea.

1065
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,860
Think about it.

1066
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,580
Tong likes you.

1067
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,120
No matter how, he likes you.

1068
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,540
But for me, he doesn't like me anymore.

1069
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:26,580
Maybe he hates me.

1070
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:28,940
Wow, is it that hard?

1071
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:32,620
Yes. I've done something bad to him.

1072
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:33,660
Think about it for me.

1073
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:37,700
I don't think you can use a simple method.

1074
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,620
You have to do something more classy.

1075
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,540
How?

1076
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:43,940
You need to be a high-pressure sprayer.

1077
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,140
You can't be a tap dripping on a rock.

1078
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,450
Then what should I do?

1079
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:52,100
First, you shall let him know you're single.

1080
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:54,740
You want me to send him a message?

1081
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:58,940
No, it's awful. You should use social media.

1082
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,660
Ah? Then I'll do as I say.

1083
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:24,190
[Lucky man, you have a chance to

1085
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:29,400
Even swindlers say hello before you.

1086
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,460
I don't know when you will send a message.

1087

[DR. Sky: This barbecue is so delicious.]

1093
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:21,100
So many new restaurants. We should try them.

1094
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,700
What took you so long?

1095
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,620
They couldn't find the bulb in your room,

1096
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,420
so it takes a while.

1097
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,300
Hurry. Or the mosquitoes will come in soon.

1098
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,060
What about Vee?

1099
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,930
Vee went upstairs to play.

1100
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:45,140
What? Are you afraid he'll bite you?

1101
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,540
Come on in. The mosquitoes will come in.

1102
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,700
I think we should go home.

1103
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:17,300
I'm worried Vee will feel uncomfortable.

1104
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:23,700
No worry. You know each other and are close.

1105
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,660
Don't think too much.

1106
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:28,979
How can I not think too much?

1107
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,340
We're not friends like before.

1108
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,500
We're a couple now.

1109
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:37,540
Vee isn't that narrow-minded.

1110
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:38,620
Though he likes to complain,

1111
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,700
he's very understanding.

1112
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:45,100
Are you sure he won't feel uncomfortable?

1113
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,020
I'm sure, my boyfriend.

1114
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:49,580
He's the same age as you.

1115
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,500
Give me a hug.

1116
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,859
Don't think too much.

1117
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,540
Let's take a shower.

1118
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:05,500
Let's go.

1119
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,260
-I changed my mind. -What?

1120
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,890
-No need to take a shower. -What?

1121
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,779
-No, J! -Right here.

1122
01:09:11,779 --> 01:09:14,140
Go take a shower first. You stink.

1123
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:23,710
[Stinky-faced Cat: Hello, Vee.]

1124
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:29,250
[Stinky-faced Cat: I checked the patients.

1125
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:30,689
Did you wait long?]

1126
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:34,640
[Stinky-faced Cat: You blocked me again?

1127
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,310
Why don't you reply?]

1128
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,930
[Sky Fahklai: So cute.]

1129
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:51,740
Is he crazy?

1130
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:50,560
[Sky Fahklai: Where are you?

1131
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:52,029
Let's go out together.]

1132
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:52,660
[Sky Fahklai: Love you.]

1133
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:59,460
[Sky Faklei: So cute.]

1134
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:02,790
[Sky Faklei: Where are you?

1135
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:05,640
Let's go out together.]

1136
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:12,460
[Sky Faklei: Love you.]

1137
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,460
He's crazy. He should do self-treatment.

1138
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,530
[Stinky-faced Cat: If you don't reply,

1139
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:19,370
I'll go to the store tomorrow.]

1140
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:26,180
Ok. I should continue to block you.

1141
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,310
[Stinky-faced Cat: If you don't reply,

1142
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:25,630
I'll go to the store tomorrow.]

1143
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:26,960
[Venus: Ok. I should continue to block you.]

1144
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:27,620
[Stinky-faced Cat: Just kidding.

1145
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:28,280
Finally I get your reply.]

1146
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,240
When do you usually sleep?

1147
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,580
Please reply. I want to talk to you.

1148
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,080
-I'll sleep when I’m sleepy.

1149
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,580
-Are you sleepy now?

1150
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:45,820
Yes.

1151
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:49,340
Well, don't go to bed so soon

1152
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,860
You're going to recharge soon.

1153
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,700
Can I talk to you for five minutes?

1154
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:57,820
Why is it quiet?

1155
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:01,540
Just five minutes, right?

1156
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:04,660
Yes, only five minutes.

1157
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,540
But you have to reply me in a second.

1158
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:08,140
Time passes soon.

1159
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,500
Okay, time starts.

1160
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,980
Will you stay here?

1161
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,740
Will you stay here for a long time?

1162
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:20,620
I'm not sure.

1163
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:22,900
But I don't want to go back to work yet.

1164
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,620
I'll probably stay here.

1165
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:26,940
Okay, good.

1166
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:29,060
Then we can see each other often.

1167
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:31,580
Where do you want to go?

1168
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:37,220
No. I just want to sleep after resignation.

1169
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:43,260
But there are many new cafes here.

1170
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:46,140
And good restaurants.

1171
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,100
I want to take you to these shops.

1172
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,220
You seem to have a lot of spare time.

1173
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,740
If I want to meet you,

1174
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:58,500
then I will have a lot of time.
