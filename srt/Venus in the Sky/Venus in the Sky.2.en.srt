00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,340
I'm waiting to eat with you.

3
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,620
You ordered a lot.

4
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,300
What's wrong?

5
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,140
You don't want to eat?

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,180
No.

7
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,980
I don't want to eat.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,940
I'm not in the mood.

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,260
Do you need to be in the mood to eat?

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,340
It's so artistic.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,220
What artistic? Haven't you ever felt like that before?

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,780
Hungry, but don't feel like eating.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,140
No.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,610
I eat when I'm hungry.

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,940
I think you're stressing out too much about your work.

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,620
So you don't want any food.

17
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,100
I can't come up with any ideas!

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,620
What project did the professor assign you this time?

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,940
To come up with an unconventional bed design.

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,580
It's so hard.

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,450
Right?

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,060
How novel can a bed be?

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,500
Alright.

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,860
I think

25
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,220
you should have some food first.

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,020
The food is getting cold.

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,860
Eat slowly and think slowly.

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,460
You'll have ideas soon.

29
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,100
Okay.

30
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,500
Here.

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,740
Have some.

32
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,979
What?

33
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,220
Why are you feeding me?

34
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,140
What's wrong?

35
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,740
There are a lot of people here.

36
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,259
Where?

37
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,420
I don't see anyone.

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,860
Eat.

39
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,740
Ah.

40
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,090
Open your mouth.

41
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,740
Ah! Open your mouth. Wider!

42
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,380
Ugh.

43
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,580
How difficult is it to eat?

44
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,740
You teased me.

45
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,220
What did I do? I just want you to eat.

46
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,420
If you don't eat, I'll feed you again.

47
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,700
Here. Do you want more vegetables?

48
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,180
No.

49
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,860
I shouldn't have come here.

50
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,420
I should have spent the time here thinking about my project.

51
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,740
Huh?

52
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,540
What's wrong with you?

53
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,060
You're really touchy.

54
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,300
I came all the way here

55
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,060
and ordered so much food for you.

56
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,100
You still think about fleeing back for your project?

57
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,060
Humph.

58
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,860
You are the one

59
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,420
who is touchy and willful.

60
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,300
Stop pulling a long face.

61
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,660
Okay.

62
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,220
Can't you just go along with me?

63
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,060
Okay.

64
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,380
Just eat.

65
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,460
Just eat slowly and think slowly.

66
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,970
You will soon have an idea.

Fine.

Well, just put down the basket. I'll wash them myself.

114

Then I'll wait to wash with you to save money.

115

How can you do that?

116
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,940
We have to

117
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,140
do our own laundry.

You're the one who's messy. After wearing them,

124

you just threw them away and piled them up. 
Now, you're blaming me for losing it.

Yeah.

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,740
How am I weird?

156
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,700
I don't know.

157
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,460
You're standing there as if you've lost your soul.

158
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,580
I lost my soul because of that patient.

159
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,900
Drink it.

160
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
I just bought it from the vending machine.

Yes.

164
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,900
Almost died.

165
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,500
Your patient?

166
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,620
Me!

167

178
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,450
Of course, I have. Who hasn't?

if doctors, like us,

182
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,100
have time for our lovers?

183
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,380
No.

184
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,820
We don't even have time to sleep.

185
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,500
Where do we find time for our lovers?

186
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,460
Most doctors are single, like me now.

187
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,580
Not many doctors

188
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,540
can meet someone who understands doctors.

189
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,620
Look at your friend, Tonkla.

190
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,620
I think he's very lucky.

Yeah.

192
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,540
Indeed.

193
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,170
What?

194
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,580
Is the person you mentioned that day still avoiding you?

195
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,620
Um.

196
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,340
Yes.

197
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,940
My case is much harder.

198
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,300
To be honest,

199
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,300
there are many patients, doctors, and nurses

200
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,060
who like you.

201
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,420
If you really can't get that person,

202
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,020
why don't you try to see someone else?

203
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,340
Are there?

204
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,540
Yes.

205
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
It's just that you didn't notice.

206
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,340
If you had paid attention,

207
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,940
you would have dated ten doctors or nurses.

208
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,540
You know nothing.

209
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,220
Many people in this hospital

210
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,420
came to me for your contact information.

211
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,580
I knew it.

212
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,060
I wondered why people kept coming to friend me.

213
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,810
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,740
I'm not good at rejecting people.

215
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,300
Then give them your contact number.

216
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,580
Fine.

217
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,260
I'll give them my number next time.

218
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,380
What are you going to do?

219
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,020
Do you want to see someone else?

220
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,210
No.

221
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,340
Maybe I'm just like you said.

222
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,540
If only I had found out

223
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,610
about my true feelings earlier.

224
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,980
I have to go.

225
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,460
I'll go home

226
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,060
after I make a round of the wards.

227
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,220
Okay.

228
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,260
Go.

229
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,700
So great.

230
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,980
I have a shift ahead of me.

231
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,380
Good luck.

232
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,530
Okay.

233
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,820
Hi, best friend.

234
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,180
Are you on duty too?

235
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,700
Yes.

236
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,260
But fortunately,

237
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,940
patients today aren't that difficult.

238
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,700
How is it? So, did my method work?

239
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,460
My inbox almost exploded.

240
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,700
See?

241
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,580
I told you, my method is the best.

242
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,020
Not at all!

243
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,170
It's just a bunch of strangers messaging me.

244
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,100
I just want...

245
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,940
Want?

246
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,890
I just want the one I like to text me.

247
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,410
Has he liked your posts?

248
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,020
No.

249
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,540
I wonder if he ever saw it.

250
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,340
It takes time.

251
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,980
Your case is difficult.

252
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,180
Yeah, that's right.

253
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,780
It's so hard.

254
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,060
But I've decided.

255
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,940
Decide what?

256
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,780
I'm gonna go after Venus.

257
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,780
Huh?

258
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,260
Hold on.

259
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,540
The one you talked about is Venus?

260
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,900
Yes.

261
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,220
I don't want to let him go again.

262
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,740
I want to have him back in my life like before.

263
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,580
I can't believe I can hear that from you.

264
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,700
Gosh.

265
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,580
You probably understand me the most.

266
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,780
What should I do next?

267
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,140
You should be prepared.

268
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,140
He's so hard to take down.

269
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,020
I don't know what to do with him either.

270
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,300
Don't shoot me down.

271
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,580
If he liked you in the past,

272
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,140
you should try it now.

273
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,100
Do you know if Venus has a boyfriend or if he is dating someone?

274
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,740
Now? I don't know.

275
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,170
Then you should observe him carefully.

276
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,020
I'll ask Tong for you so that you can go on fully.

277
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,820
How should I start?

278
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,500
I only know that Venus quit his job

279
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,580
and moved here.

280
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,460
Just this made me extremely happy.

281
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,260
Then, you should start by asking him out for a meal

282
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,780
to celebrate your reunion,

283
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,620
his resignation,

284
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,300
his returning home, or anything else.

285
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,940
Then pray that he will say yes to your meal.

286
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,980
Will he agree to go with me?

287
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,740
He won't even reply to my messages.

288
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,410
That's why I told you to pray.

289
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,940
Because I'm not sure about it either.

290
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,500
Oh!

291
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,300
But there's one thing I'm sure of.

292
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,060
If you try your best,

293
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,580
one day

294
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,580
Venus will see your efforts.

295
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,130
If you fail this time,

296
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,540
just try again.

297
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,380
That's what makes you

298
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,900
my friend.

299
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
Hey.

300
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,540
But if Venu already has a boyfriend,

301
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,580
you have to stop.

302
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,740
Okay.

303
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,220
I know.

304
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,780
Then I'll wait quietly.

305
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,660
Don't worry.

306
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:33,740
Okay.

307
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,500
I'll get back to continue writing Death cause analysis.

308
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,580
I haven't finished anything yet.

309
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,380
Yeah. Bye.

310
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,410
[Sky: Let's have dinner tomorrow. It's my treat to celebrate your resignation]

311
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,330
[Sky: I'll come to you after work. Don't run away. 
I'll wait for you in front of the store]

312
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,870
[Sky: This is a new restaurant. I'm sure you haven't been there yet]

313
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,660
Amitabha...

314
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,330
Please let him say yes!

315
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,010
Please!

316
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,460
Come on.

317
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,980
Finish this file.

318
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,460
So that you'll have free time tomorrow.

319
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,380
Fighting!

320
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:44,100
[Stinky Face: Don't run away today]
[Stinky Face: Don't run away today]
[Stinky Face: Don't run away today]

321
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,980
What's wrong with him?

322
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,620
Didn't he say he wouldn't bother me?

323
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,300
Vee, you're here!

324
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,500
What's wrong?

325
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,620
J wants you to deliver the order.

326
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,340
During off-hours, there are a lot of customers.

327
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,140
See? He called me back.

328
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,900
Yes, but...

329
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,100
Where should I send it?

330
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,500
The next neighborhood.

331
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,850
The next neighborhood?

332
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,980
I got lost there for almost half an hour last time.

333
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,250
Well, but today my car was in for service.

334
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,300
It's okay. You can ride a motorcycle. It's fast.

335
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,220
I don't know how to ride a motorcycle.

336
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,180
My ability to keep my balance on fast transportation is almost zero.

337
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,740
What should I do?

338
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,900
Can you ride a bike?

339
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,580
A bike?

340
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,260
Yes.

341
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,180
I have a bike.

342
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,700
You want me to ride a bike to make the delivery?

343
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,860
Or do you want to walk there?

344
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,540
You're irritating me.

345
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,740
Just take the order and deliver it yourself.

346
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,380
Then you count the stock.

347
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,900
It's piled up like a mountain.

348
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,740
It's okay. I'll deliver the goods.

349
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,500
Bye.

350
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,890
Hey, man.

351
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,020
Oh, yes.

352
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,060
What's wrong?

353
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,660
Is Venu back?

354
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,020
Oh, Vee went to deliver the goods.

355
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,980
He's not back yet.

356
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,180
Okay, thank you.

357
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,980
Okay.

358
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,340
Who is he? He's so handsome. Is he a celebrity?

359
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,500
He's really handsome.

360
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,860
He's like a Korean star, Oppa.

361
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,340
Who is it? Who is in front of my store?

362
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,580
And there are so many people.

363
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,260
He must be a celebrity.

364
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,580
Ahk, you scared me.

365
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,100
Why would a celebrity come to my store?

366
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,980
I don't know.

367
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,500
Where's Vee?

368
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,700
Don't tell me he went home.

369
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,860
Vee went to deliver the goods.

370
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,500
He's not back yet.

371
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,180
Well, whatever.

372
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,060
What are you doing?

373
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,700
I want to take a photo.

374
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,060
Just in case he's really a celebrity. Then I can show it off to my mom.

375
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,060
You're such a gossip.

376
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,820
Just take out the trash!

377
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,980
Roger that.

378
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,540
Take out the trash! You don't even work.

379
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,020
All you know is to meddle in other people's business. You're so nosy.

380
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,340
He's really handsome. He's like a Korean star. Oppa saranghae.

381
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,940
Who is that guy?

382
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,260
Oh! He is so sweet.

383
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,260
He's mine.

384
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,580
He should be mine.

385
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,980
-So cool. -Go to the end of the row and line up.

386
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,050
Excuse me.

387
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,180
He's not a celebrity. He's a doctor.

388
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,220
He's a regular in my store.

389
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,540
If you want to take photos with me,

390
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,020
it's okay.

391
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,300
But on one condition,

392
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
don't scream,

393
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,380
and don't tell anyone

394
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,460
about it.

395
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,900
"This guy is so handsome. He must be my boyfriend."

396
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,700
You can't do that.

397
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,260
Oh, really?

398
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,260
Do you want to take a photo with me?

399
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,420
It's good to go to the convenience store. Let's go.

400
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,740
Don't you want to take photos?

401
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,580
I'm handsome too.

402
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,300
And I'm a celebrity.

403
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,140
You have no taste.

404
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,140
Doctor,

405
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,780
are you back from someone's wedding?

406
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,340
Doctor!

407
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,860
Doctor! Doctor!

408
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,700
I'm sorry, bro.

409
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,180
I fell asleep.

410
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,460
How long did you stay up?

411
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,100
I was on duty last night.

412
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,740
Don't tell me you slept here

413
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,140
to wait for Vee.

414
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,220
Yes.

415
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,140
Is Vee here?

416
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,700
I don't know.

417
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,620
But

418
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,980
are you going to an event?

419
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,820
You are dressed like a star.

420
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,860
J, you are exaggerating.

421
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,460
I'm just going to eat with Venus.

422
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,900
Eat out?

423
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,180
Is it necessary to dress up so grandly?

424
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,940
Yes.

425
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,780
Please wait at the store.

426
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,660
It's okay, J.

427
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,980
I want to wait here. I don't want to bother you.

428
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,060
Don't be shy. We're friends.

429
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,300
Let's go inside and wait for him.

430
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,900
Thank you so much.

431
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,780
I still want to wait here.

432
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,780
Vee keeps telling me not to bother him in the store.

433
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,100
I'd feel better waiting here.

434
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,820
Did you text him?

435
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,660
He might run home by himself.

436
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,580
It's okay.

437
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,700
He should be driving.

438
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,060
I'm afraid it's not safe to send him messages.

439
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,820
So...

440
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,140
I'll text him later.

441
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,580
If he sees my message,

442
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,900
he won't break his promise.

443
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,380
Okay.

444
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,700
Whatever.

445
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,020
I'll go back to the store and start my work.

446
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,340
Okay.

447
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,020
Doctor.

448
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,380
If those guys

449
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,100
come here and ask you to take photos,

450
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,900
let them pay you first.

451
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,340
Make sure they come to my shop to buy something.

452
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,540
At least 500-1000 baht per person.

453
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,580
And I

454
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,900
will give you a free VIP code of iQIYI for 14 days.

455
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,340
Okay? Doctor, Please help me.

456
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,860
Okay.

457
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,460
At least 500 baht.

458
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,940
Remember to check their receipts.

459
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,740
Okay.

460
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,460
Don't take photos for free.

461
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,100
Did someone ask for a photo just now?

462
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,980
Yes.

463
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,780
Don't let them do it for free.

464
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,420
Hello?

465
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,380
Vee.

466
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,780
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

467
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,900
I'm fine.

468
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,660
But why are you here?

469
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,700
Oh.

470
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,500
I texted you that I would wait for you.

471
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,580
-Look. -Wait for me.

472
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,900
You didn't reply.

473
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,420
Look.

474
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,500
Oh!

475
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,620
But... where are you going

476
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,780
dressed like this?

477
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,340
I'm not telling you.

478
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,860
I'm hungry.

479
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,700
Let's go.

480
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,620
I'm not going.

481
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,900
Look at me.

482
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,540
Where are you going dressed so formally?

483
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,300
You'll know soon.

484
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,740
Let's go. Go!

485
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,180
It's on you.

486
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,140
I'm the one who always treats you.

487
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,220
What are you talking about?

488
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,380
Let's go. Get up.

489
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,700
Get off.

490
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,180
Be gentle.

491
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,460
The bike is shabby.

492
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,860
Don't break my shabby bike.

493
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,940
Look at its condition.

494
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,580
Let's go.

495
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,380
Let's go.

496
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,780
My bike is at the risk of being stolen.

497
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,460
No one will steal it.

498
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,140
You can go now. Go.

499
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,580
You two just care about yourself.

500
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,340
You don't even pack.

501
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,460
Always let me do some side work.

502
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,860
It's hard to buy this one.

503
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,860
I'll lose it if it is left here.

504
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,180
It's hard to buy.

505
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,480
[BBQ & Hotpot]

506
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,980
You look like you're going to a Michelin restaurant.

507
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,820
Seriously,

508
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,380
do you have to go this far?

509
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,620
I finally get a chance to have dinner with you,

510
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,780
so I have to dress up.

511
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,380
What's so special about having a barbecue in a suit?

512
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,780
We used to take off our clothes and eat in the dorm.

513
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,420
Eat without clothes?

514
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,380
Eat your food.

515
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,420
It'll be burnt later.

516
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,980
Okay.

517
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,700
I think you should take off your coat first.

518
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,860
No.

519
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,180
I dressed up so nicely for the sake of eating with you.

520
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,860
You look awkward in this.

521
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,980
Awkward or attractive?

522
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,620
When I went out today,

523
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,660
I looked in the mirror.

524
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,020
I thought I was handsome.

525
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,740
What are you talking about?

526
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,340
Calm down.

527
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,660
It's as hot as hell.

528
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,260
Hey.

529
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,380
Are you worried about me?

530
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,500
Are you worried that I'm too hot?

531
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,020
No, I'm worried that you might faint

532
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
and trouble me.

533
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,780
What are you talking about?

534
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,740
Here.

535
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,620
Look.

536
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,540
I roasted it for you.

537
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,100
I'll take the coat off.

538
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,060
What do you think?

539
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,020
Am I still handsome

540
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,340
after I take off my suit?

541
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,140
No.

542
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,060
And you're talkative.

543
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,100
Well,

544
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,100
it doesn't matter.

545
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,580
I just want to look good in your eyes.

546
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,020
That's not necessary.

547
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,340
Eat up vegetables.

548
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,740
I want pork belly. Why do you put vegetables in it?

549
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,500
I don't want to eat it.

550
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,540
I want pork belly. Why do you put vegetables in it?

551
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,820
I don't want to eat it.

552
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,060
Oh.

553
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,540
Don't take it if you don't want it.

554
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,180
I'll add some vegetables to make it nutritious.

555
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,700
What nutrition?

556
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,900
All vegetables.

557
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,220
Here. I'll get it for you.

558
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,730
What?

559
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,180
I've already eaten a lot.

560
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,220
Eat up.

561
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,620
See?

562
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,620
You can eat by yourself.

563
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,700
Why do I have to nag you every time?

564
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,180
Because I don't want to eat today.

565
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,020
I'll eat it when I want to.

566
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,980
Look, after vegetables are added,

567
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,700
the soup is sweeter.

568
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,900
You know what?

569
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,860
It's not sweet at all.

570
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,500
What are you talking about?

571
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,490
I want pork belly.

572
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,580
Fine, pork belly.

573
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,540
Gosh.

574
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,980
Here.

575
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,300
How is the pork belly?

576
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,940
Honey,

577
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,460
I think we should share another pot and eat alone.

578
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,380
I think so.

579
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,660
Did we come here to be their third wheel?

580
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,620
What?

581
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,420
Nothing. I said

582
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,260
I'd buy another pot next time,

583
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,620
so we can eat separately.

584
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,060
-Yes. -I want pork belly.

585
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,140
Okay. I'm sick of them.

586
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,420
Wow~

587
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,700
-I want more. -Do you want vegetables?

588
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,580
-Have some vegetables? They are nutritious. -I want vegetables and pork belly.

589
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,980
-Shall I feed you? -Hmm.

590
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,020
Wow~

591
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,740
Here, have some vegetables.

592
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,220
They are nutritious.

593
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,420
So is Meat.

594
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,620
I don't want vegetables.

595
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,580
Why do you give them to me?

596
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,900
Now I have to eat them.

597
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,660
You want meat, right?

598
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,980
It's a bit too hot.

599
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,060
You don't have to feed me. I can help myself.

600
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,860
Hey, eat up.

601
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,220
Aha.

602
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,300
How is it? Is it tender?

603
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,020
Is it delicious?

604
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,980
You don't have to be like this,

605
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,300
or I won't eat with you.

606
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,580
You know what?

607
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,740
I really want to take you to eat here.

608
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,660
Why? Is it famous?

609
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,300
No.

610
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,620
The taste of its dishes

611
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,180
is the same as that of our campus's food.

612
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,140
What do you think?

613
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,980
Is this restaurant good?

614
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,020
How would you rate it?

615
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,380
100.

616
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,540
It's very delicious.

617
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,380
100?

618
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:11,860
Yes.

619
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,220
Then it's a pass.

620
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,940
Next time,

621
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,060
I'll take you to another restaurant.

622
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,020
No need.

623
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,370
Your house is on the same street as mine.

624
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,050
Really?

625
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,180
I have no idea.

626
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,500
What a coincidence!

627
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,620
In this way,

628
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,420
I can visit you often on my way.

629
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,820
Why do you do that?

630
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,540
No need.

631
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,660
I...

632
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,580
I haven't seen you for a long time.

633
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,220
I have a lot to tell you.

634
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,820
I have nothing to tell you.

635
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,660
Go back.

636
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,020
Thank you for your ride.

637
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,780
Wait, Vee.

638
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,820
Tomorrow,

639
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,420
are you going to the store? I want to see you.

640
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:06,940
I don't know.

641
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,260
What about the day after tomorrow?

642
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,900
I'm not sure.

643
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,540
Anything else? I'm going in.

644
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,780
Hmm!

645
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,540
Ah!

646
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,820
I need to pee.

647
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,820
It only takes ten minutes

648
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,140
from here to your house.

649
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,900
Hold on.

650
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,100
Ahh, please let me in. Just a moment.

651
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,860
I really need to pee.

652
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,500
Then go back to your home quickly.

653
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,220
Just a moment.

654
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,250
Sky.

655
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,940
I'll go back.

656
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,380
But promise me. Let's eat out next time.

657
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,260
There are many new cafés around here.

658
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,900
I want to go with you.

659
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,340
Let's talk later.

660
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,940
If I have spare time, I would.

661
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,660
You can go back now.

662
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,580
I'm sleepy.

663
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,540
Make an appointment.

664
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,380
Go home.

665
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,220
Sign it first.

666
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,100
Your autograph is so cute.

667
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,940
Yes.

668
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,340
Please take it.

669
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,180
Bye.

670
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,580
Good night, Vee.

671
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,380
Go home.

672
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,780
Good night, Vee.

673
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,780
Okay, I got it. Go home.

674
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,250
[Are you home?]

675
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,340
I shouldn't have read it so soon.

676
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,540
[Venus: You deserve a beating.]

677
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,639
[Poker Face: Photos]

678
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,940
[Venus: Delete it. What nonsense is it?] -[Poker Face: emoji]

679
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,340
[Venus: Stop sending.] -[Stinky Face: Copy.]

680
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,739
Who are you talking to?

681
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,420
Gosh.

682
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:35,020
Why are you sitting in the dark?

683
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,420
Why are you so surprised?

684
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,580
I'm saving electricity.

685
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,820
By the way,

686
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,260
are you chatting with your boyfriend?

687
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,139
Why are you laughing like that?

688
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,130
Can you mind your own business?

689
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,219
So,

690
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,060
what did you eat with the doctor?

691
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,179
Barbecue & hotpot.

692
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:52,820
Huh?

693
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,820
The doctor wore a suit and went to a barbecue with you.

694
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,580
Yes.

695
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,700
Your boyfriend is so strange.

696
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,730
Then

697
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,780
are you happy

698
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,940
after eating out?

699
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,610
What?

700
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,300
Is it delicious?

701
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,810
Stop teasing me.

702
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,380
I have no feelings for him.

703
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,620
Okay.

704
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,860
I'm looking forward to the show.

705
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,740
What are you talking about?

706
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,260
Just have food.

707
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,260
What are you talking about?

708
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,060
You've been smiling happily

709
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,500
like a flower

710
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,980
bigger than my fried eggs.

711
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,180
I'm going to take a shower.

712
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,380
My hair stinks.

713
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,420
What did you do to stink your hair?

714
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,420
I'll kick you.

715
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,380
Stop pretending.

716
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,220
Huh.

717
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,180
What?

718
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,140
Hey, how's it going?

719
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,820
Did you go on a date last night?

720
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,660
What date?

721
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,660
I only took Vee to eat out.

722
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,980
What about you?

723
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,180
Aren't you busy at work today?

724
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,900
You still have time to call me.

725
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,180
The ward I'm in charge of today has nothing to deal with.

726
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,900
I want to ask you out for lunch.

727
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,970
Are you free?

728
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,060
No.

729
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,620
I need to check many cases.

730
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,220
I might be late today.

731
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,460
Okay, never mind.

732
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,010
How's your love?

733
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,620
Do you have a chance?

734
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,420
I don't think so.

735
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,140
I've tried my best,

736
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,900
but I don't think there's much hope.

737
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,900
He often ignores my messages.

738
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,180
Fine.

739
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,900
Since you've already started, stick it out.

740
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,290
I asked Tong secretly.

741
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,220
Venus doesn't have a boyfriend now.

742
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,300
Venus is in a burnout right now.

743
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,500
In my opinion,

744
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,340
you should make a beyond pursuit on him.

745
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,700
Beyond?

746
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,180
How?

747
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,540
Venus

748
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,340
is willing to have dinner with you.

749
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,740
Next,

750
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,770
find a chance to be closer to him.

751
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:16,380
Take him to a place with dim light

752
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,500
and suitable for dating.

753
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,020
Then you express your love to him.

754
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,820
Why did you bring me here, Sky?

755
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,580
I just want to be alone with you.

756
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,380
What are you doing?

757
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,140
I don't want to lose you again.

758
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,060
Vee, I really like you.

759
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,900
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

760
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,420
I'm sorry.

761
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,820
My confession is too late.

762
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,420
Hey!

763
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,930
Isn't it too fast?

764
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,580
Don't tell me

765
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,820
that's how you got Pai Tong.

766
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,020
Yes.

767
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,300
Ordinary people won't do that,

768
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,980
but you can't delay any longer.

769
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,460
Don't forget.

770
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,380
Do you mean bringing Vee to have sex in a hotel?

771
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,060
I won't. I don't believe you.

772
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,740
What are you thinking?

773
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,340
I'm asking you to take Venus to a movie.

774
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,660
Cinema is a dark and romantic place.

775
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,780
Oh.

776
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,420
Yes.

777
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,540
That is a good way.

778
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,660
But will he be willing to go?

779
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,740
If you have time, give it a try.

780
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,340
And don't forget to pray.

781
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,500
Okay.

782
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,700
I'll do it right after I hang up.

783
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,100
Go on with your work.

784
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,340
I'll go find something to eat.

785
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,180
Good luck.

786
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,020
Okay, thank you.

787
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,640
[Let's watch a movie tonight. There are so many good movies recently. It's been a while since I went to the cinema.]

788
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:13,180
[Sure.]

789
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,860
What are you so happy about?

790
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,740
Are you going on a date?

791
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,620
God, I'm sorry.

792
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,530
But I don't think you're going on a date.

793
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,620
Please work my shift today.

794
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,340
My mom is coming from another province to see me. I have to go pick her up.

795
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,860
Please.

796
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,780
Please take my shift. I'll pay you 6500 baht.

797
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,460
Really. No one wants to take my shift.

798
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,220
Because they will have to work with Jidapa.

799
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,820
I only have you now.

800
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,300
I'm really sorry.

801
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,060
Please help me this time.

802
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,700
If you want to switch shifts next time,

803
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,380
just tell me. I promise I will say yes.

804
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,860
But please help me first.

805
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
My friend.

806
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,700
I will dedicate merit for the help you provided me with today,

807
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,220
so that your love life may flourish.

808
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,460
Amitabha.

809
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,340
Alright.

810
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,740
Alright.

811
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,620
Amitabha.

812
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,460
I want 7,000 baht.

813
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,420
What?

814
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,300
6,500 baht. Don't go too far!

815
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,700
Oh...

816
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,940
Oh.

817
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,540
Okay.

818
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,220
6,500 baht is okay.

819
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,180
I hope my love life will flourish like you said.

820
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,620
Thank you so much, my friend.

821
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,260
Why are you looking at him?

822
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,260
What's interesting outside this store

823
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,300
that's making you stare like that?

824
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,210
Mind your own business.

825
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,700
Do you want to go to a movie tonight?

826
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,020
Let's go together.

827
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,580
No.

828
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,930
Who will look after the store if I go?

829
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,340
What about Bomb?

830
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,860
No, he took his mom to run errands.

831
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,700
I'm the only one left.

832
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,900
Please?

833
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,540
Fine.

834
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,780
By the way,

835
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,300
who are you going to the movie with?

836
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,780
Are you going alone?

837
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:18,690
[Vee, I can't make it today. The movie plan might have to be postponed.]
[I have to swap shifts with someone else, the other doctor happens to have something to do. So frustrating.]

838
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,380
Who is it?

839
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,020
The person who talked to you yesterday?

840
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,700
Huh?

841
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,420
Did you get stood up?

842
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,420
You care so much about me. Don't you have to work?

843
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,660
Um... you...

844
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,050
If you bring your friends to our store again,

845
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,940
it will attract a lot of customers.

846
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,020
Okay? Can you please invite your friends to come again?

847
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,540
Is that okay?

848
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,860
I'm going home. Bye.

849
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,340
By the way,

850
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,580
please clean it up.

851
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,780
Aren't you going to the movie?

852
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,660
No.

853
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,980
I'm not coming tomorrow.

854
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,300
I need to clean my room.

855
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,340
Why are you so angry?

856
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,980
I just tease you like usual.

857
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,780
Delicious.

858
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,380
I'll eat it myself.

859
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,980
I'll continue. It's delicious.

860
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,500
I have no feelings anymore.

861
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,940
I have no feelings for him anymore.

862
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,060
Hello?

863
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,420
What?

864
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,660
Hello?

865
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,460
What are you doing?

866
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,980
You always call me when I'm busy with work.

867
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,660
I'm preparing for a meeting.

868
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,980
What work?

869
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,540
At this time, there isn't any important work. Everyone has already finished work.

870
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:03,580
You can say that because you resigned.

871
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,220
What do you want?

872
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,060
I met Sky.

873
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,820
See? I told you.

874
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,300
Yes.

875
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,370
He often comes to see me.

876
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:14,980
To be honest,

877
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,660
I don't want to see him anymore.

878
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,100
He acted the same.

879
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,660
He acted like nothing had happened.

880
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,620
How could he not care about the past?

881
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,220
But how should I put it?

882
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,460
Isn't it the same for those

883
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,300
who have lost feelings for each other?

884
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,300
He has never had any feelings for me,

885
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,300
and I...

886
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,980
no longer have feelings for him either.

887
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,180
It should have been like this from the beginning.

888
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,660
Calm down.

889
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,340
Did he come to you

890
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,180
and act as close to you as before?

891
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,060
Yes.

892
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,220
I hate it.

893
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,180
Do you really hate it?

894
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,020
Yes.

895
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,940
But he invited me to a movie.

896
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,060
Did you say yes?

897
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,940
Well...

898
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,620
J said that

899
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,580
if I don't feel anything for him anymore,

900
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,500
I should be able to talk to him and meet him.

901
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,820
So I...

902
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,970
said yes.

903
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:16,700
You.

904
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,900
Sometimes,

905
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,060
what we call "not liking"

906
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,140
is actually just not realizing that we like it.

907
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,540
I remember what the boss said, it's just like you now.

908
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,140
How?

909
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,820
Just like how you know I've never liked modern houses.

910
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,460
I prefer houses with a rustic style.

911
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,930
I designed it several times and wasn't satisfied.

912
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,100
I kept making changes,

913
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,060
and it turned into a modern, comfortable, warm,

914
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,620
and convenient house.

915
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,500
You should know, since you lived with me.

916
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,500
Hey.

917
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,420
But these two things aren't comparable.

918
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,100
Hey, I'm going to hang up and get ready for the meeting.

919
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,780
I'll hang up now. Let's talk next time.

920
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,900
-I’ll call you tomorrow. -Okay.

921
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,300
Can I help you?

922
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,540
No, it's simple. I'll do it myself.

923
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,020
But it's late.

924
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,180
Will you continue to do it?

925
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:22,860
Yes.

926
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,700
I'm in a hurry.

927
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,140
Get some rest.

928
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,100
Lie here.

929
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,900
Here.

930
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,260
What's wrong with you today?

931
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,420
I'll give you a massage later.

932
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,210
So comfortable.

933
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,780
How is it?

934
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,540
Comfortable.

935
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,500
More, please.

936
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,260
Give me your hand.

937
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,970
Where? Let me see.

938
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,860
You must be tired from work today.

939
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,060
Yes.

940
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,860
More, please.

941
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,780
Are you feeling less tired now?

942
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,300
Yes.

943
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,940
More, please. Hurry up.

944
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,380
Enough. Vee might see us when he comes downstairs later.

945
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,500
Vee has no problem with it.

946
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,500
He saw us yesterday.

947
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,140
Stop quibbling and get some rest.

948
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,060
Why are you so afraid of him?

949
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,700
I'm afraid he doesn't like me.

950
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,460
Why would he not like you?

951
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,980
He must like everyone

952
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,220
I love or like.

953
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,260
Don't think too much. Don't mind it.

954
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,620
How could I? he's your brother.

955
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,980
If we continue like this, what should we do if he doesn't allow us to date?

956
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:43,540
Are you crazy?

957
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,260
He won't interfere with our business.

958
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:48,140
Just his own affairs alone are making him extremely stressed.

959
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,780
Oh.

960
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,300
Are you afraid that my brother will oppose our relationship?

961
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,740
Yes.

962
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,860
Whose boyfriend are you? You're so cute.

963
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,860
So cute.

964
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,180
Why did you let your nails grow so long?

965
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,380
They're long already?

966
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,340
Yes.

967
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,940
I haven't got time to cut my nails.

968
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,500
I've been unpacking all day.

969
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,340
Then get up. I'll cut your nails later.

970
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,300
Really?

971
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,860
Yes.

972
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,660
Sit here.

973
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:29,740
Oh.

974
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,740
Is it your knee?

975
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,140
Crazy.

976
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,820
Let me see.

977
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,420
Why are your nails so long?

978
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,620
Don't cut them too deep. I may get hurt.

979
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,860
I'm careful.

980
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,020
Please cut my toenails for me.

981
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,860
Okay.

982
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,100
Please cut my toenails for me.

983
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,980
Wow, your toenails are long too.

984
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:08,380
Cut them deeper.

985
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,300
Slowly.

986
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,300
Ouch!!

987
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,420
You used too much force.

988
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,420
Look at your nails. They are so hard.

989
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,540
Just let me cut them.

990
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,130
Don't complain.

991
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,260
I'll wound you

992
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,620
if you're bleeding.

993
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,460
Then you don't have to cut them. I'll cut them myself.

994
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,980
No.

995
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,540
I'm just not good at it.

996
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,740
Hey!

997
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,740
You kicked me!

998
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,580
What do you want?

999
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,420
-Nothing, I didn’t mean it. -What do you want?

1000
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,420
Vee is here.

1001
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:22,980
Vee, what's wrong? Why are you absent-minded here?

1002
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,180
Have you eaten yet?

1003
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,980
If you want to do anything else

1004
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,980
for next step after this sweet, please go upstairs.

1005
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,020
If you're not afraid of embarrassing yourselves in front of ghosts.

1006
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,140
I'm blushing on your behalf.

1007
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,460
Don't display affection out here. My eyes are damaged.

1008
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,580
Don't display affection out here. My eyes are damaged.

1009
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,900
What's wrong with you? Do you need a doctor?

1010
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,820
What's wrong with him?

1011
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,580
Should we take him to the doctor?

1012
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,620
Or does he hate us being together?

1013
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,300
Leave him alone.

1014
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,980
Let's keep cutting nails.

1015
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,180
Are you sure Vee can stand it?

1016
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,460
Do you want to check your brother first?

1017
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,180
He's fine.

1018
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,620
But in the afternoon,

1019
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,060
he might not be in a good mood.

1020
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,940
Earlier, he said he was going to a movie with friends,

1021
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,420
but he didn't go.

1022
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,220
It seems like he got stood up.

1023
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,100
How about asking him?

1024
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,890
What if he wants to say something?

1025
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,500
He's a grown-up now.

1026
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,020
I will observe him from a distance.

1027
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,980
Let's keep cutting nails.

1028
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,780
And this side.

1029
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,620
Okay.

1030
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,500
Hello, baby, are you asleep?

1031
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,250
I just came back.

1032
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,660
I'm still up, but I'm sleepy.

1033
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,260
I was waiting for your call.

1034
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,660
I'm sorry.

1035
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,860
I just finished the meeting.

1036
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,260
It went on from morning to evening,

1037
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,340
and I'm so dizzy. I don't know why my boss assigned so much work

1038
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,900
without hiring more people.

1039
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,820
So have you eaten?

1040
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,340
No.

1041
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,260
I'll find something to eat later.

1042
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,410
What about you? How was your day?

1043
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:20,260
I'm fine today. Today's ward is more chill.

1044
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,380
At first, I was going to ask Sky to have lunch together.

1045
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,970
But he was too busy.

1046
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,940
You know what?

1047
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,980
Sky and Vee have met.

1048
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:29,700
Yes.

1049
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,660
He called to ask me for advice.

1050
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,700
He called to ask you for advice?

1051
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,100
About what?

1052
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,660
About Venus.

1053
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:38,780
About

1054
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,300
how to get back together with him.

1055
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,060
You...

1056
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,860
Don't worry. No matter what,

1057
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,140
Venus is the one who can make the decision.

1058
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,220
I just don't want my friend to be sad anymore.

1059
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,500
Alright.

1060
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,220
At least give Sky a chance to correct himself.

1061
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,420
He didn't do well back then.

1062
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:59,700
Okay.

1063
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,380
Aren't you angry about me helping Sky?

1064
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,220
Please don't be mad at me too

1065
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,180
if I'm on Venus' side.

1066
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:08,700
I won't be angry.

1067
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,450
Anyway, they're both our friends.

1068
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,660
I didn't go to see you today.

1069
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,260
You were finally off duty.

1070
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:24,140
It's okay. Come to me when you have time.

1071
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,780
We haven't had a chance to meet much.

1072
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,300
I have many things I want to do with you.

1073
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,780
You mean...

1074
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,140
that kind of thing?

1075
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,020
Stop talking dirty.

1076
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,860
I've almost forgotten what you look like.

1077
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,620
Has it been that long?

1078
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,180
Too long.

1079
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,780
But I'm tired.

1080
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:46,660
I miss you.

1081
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,900
I miss you too.

1082
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,060
Go to bed.

1083
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:54,020
I saw that you were about to fall asleep.

1084
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:55,780
I'll go to bed now.

1085
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,780
Love you.

1086
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,020
He didn't tell me he loved me back.

1087
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:38,840
[Stinky Face: I barely slept. I'm tired.]
[Stinky Face: I just finished work. I need to go to the ward.]
[I'm hungry. I haven't eaten yet.]

1088
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:45,010
[Are you awake?]
[Call me when you wake up, okay?]

1089
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,090
Workaholic. How long has it been?

1090
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,500
8 a.m. - 8 a.m.

1091
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,980
He got off work at 4 p.m.

1092
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,700
32 hours.

1093
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:10,250
[Stinky Face: Shall we go to watch a movie today? I haven't finished all the work yet, but I'll go with you]

1094
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:17,100
He worked so hard and even asked me to watch a movie.

1095
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,580
7-ELEVEN is here.

1096
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,340
Thank you.

1097
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,180
Wait. Don't go.

1098
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,020
Okay.

1099
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,780
Did I miss something?

1100
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,740
Did Vee come to work today?

1101
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,780
No.

1102
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,460
J said that Vee want to clean the house today.

1103
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,940
Really?

1104
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:07,820
Okay.

1105
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,100
Thank you very much.

1106
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,300
Thank you.

1107
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,900
Hey.

1108
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,580
What are you doing here?

1109
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:46,020
To pick you up for a movie.

1110
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,740
What? Can you still manage to watch a movie with me?

1111
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,500
You just got off work.

1112
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,940
It's a piece of cake. Look.

1113
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,060
See?

1114
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:56,140
I changed my clothes right after finishing work to come and find you.

1115
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,380
I want to watch a movie. Let's go together.

1116
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:08,700
Let's go watch a movie together.

1117
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,820
I haven't finished sweeping the floor,

1118
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,820
and I haven't changed my clothes.

1119
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,220
It's okay. I'll help you.

1120
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,570
Go get changed.

1121
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,180
No, I'll do it myself.

1122
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,300
It's okay.

1123
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,820
It's not a big deal.

1124
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:22,860
Go get changed. I guarantee

1125
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:26,100
it will be clean when you come out.

1126
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,700
Then do it properly.

1127
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,020
I won't go

1128
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,140
if it isn't clean.

1129
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,620
Okay.

1130
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,420
Go get changed.

1131
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,700
Eat more.

1132
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:17,820
Hey, don't grab.

1133
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,500
Come here.

1134
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,820
There are a lot here.

1135
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,260
How is it? Are you tired?

1136
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,500
A little.

1137
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,580
Thank you.

1138
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,860
Why don't you go back and rest first?

1139
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,500
Today we don't need to watch movies.

1140
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,940
We can go together another day.

1141
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,260
Hey,

1142
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,820
did your magical elixir

1143
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,540
suddenly make me not feel tired anymore?

1144
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,060
What magical elixir?

1145
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,780
The water you gave me.

1146
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,100
This is just filtered water.

1147
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,340
Really?

1148
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,780
Then why, after I drank it,

1149
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,540
did I suddenly feel so energetic?

1150
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,420
I mean it.

1151
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,580
If you're tired,

1152
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,500
we can go together another day.

1153
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,500
No, I want to go today.

1154
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,420
Or you'll change your mind and won't go with me.

1155
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,740
How is it?

1156
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:26,060
I cleaned the floor

1157
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,860
very thoroughly, didn't I?

1158
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:32,380
Yes, it's clean.

1159
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,420
Hey.

1160
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:36,900
Where are you going?

1161
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,660
You want to go watch the movie, don't you?

1162
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,300
Let's go, before it's too late.

1163
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,300
-Right now? -Yes.

1164
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,730
Wait for me.

1165
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:47,220
Wait!

1166
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,500
Wait for me!
