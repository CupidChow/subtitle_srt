00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,500
By the way, how do you want me to decorate your house?

192
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,820
Whatever.

193
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,300
What color do you like?

194
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,220
What color do you like?

195
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,540
Grey, blue, beige, white.

196
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,260
I want all four colors.

197
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,220
Don't fool me.

198
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,300
Or I'll go back.

199
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,380
Oh,

200
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,020
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,700
Why are you yelling at me?

202
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,300
What kind of style do you want?

203
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,340
Well...

204
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,660
What style do you think is better?

205
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,820
I think...

206
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,460
Is minimalist style good?

207
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,220
Or modern style?

208
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,620
It should go well with you.

209
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,020
OK.

210
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,500
I want both styles,

211
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,220
minimalist style and modern style.

212
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,540
Yes, I've taken a look around your house.

213
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,740
There's a room without furniture, right?

214
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,820
Yes.

215
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,820
Yes.

216
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,660
Since I moved in,

217
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,700
I've only opened that room once.

218
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,820
I'm afraid of ghosts.

219
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,940
You must be hallucinating.

220
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,060
What are you going to do with that room?

221
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,060
Well...

222
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,300
I don't know yet.

223
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,890
What do you think that room is for?

224
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,900
As for this empty room,

225
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,140
you can use it as a second bedroom,

226
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,940
video room, or study.

227
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,460
It depends on you.

228
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,450
Don't say I'm fooling you.

229
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,660
Well...

230
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,620
I want all.

231
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,420
Can you combine all of the functions?

232
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,780
OK.

233
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,860
Give me some time to design.

234
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,380
OK, I'm not in a hurry.

235
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,060
I'll send you the quotation

236
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,500
when I finish the design.

237
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,340
OK.

238
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,980
Why are you laughing?

239
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,180
Nothing.

240
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,740
I just haven't seen you at work.

241
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,700
You look serious.

242
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,060
We have to work hard.

243
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,540
Yes.

244
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,380
You are right.

245
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,980
OK. Let's call it a day.

246
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,850
I'll send it to you

247
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,330
the designing scheme later.

248
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,300
Are you leaving?

249
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,300
Please.

250
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,340
Hey, wait.

251
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,340
I'll send you the design draft this afternoon.

252
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,260
Let me know what you like.

253
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,300
So you'll text me back, right?

254
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,060
I'll reply if it's about work.

255
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,900
Well...

256
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,180
if we're done talking about work,

257
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,540
I'd like to talk about something else. You'll reply too, right?

258
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,380
No.

259
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,020
Well,

260
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,010
I'm free all day today.

261
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,900
Can't you stay with me?

262
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,180
Let's eat together.

263
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,860
My treat.

264
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,060
OK? OK?

265
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,060
No.

266
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,140
I need to get back to work.

267
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,020
Oh.

268
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,180
If it's not about work,

269
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,340
then I'll have no chance to meet you?

270
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,820
Yes.

271
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,580
I'll see you when I hand in your design.

272
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,980
Wait.

273
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,100
OK.

274
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:51,900
Look.

275
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,500
What's that?

276
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,060
It's all color blocks.

277
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,700
It's the duty schedule.

278
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,660
Look. That's Dr. Fahklai's duty schedule.

279
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,860
And?

280
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,340
I just want to show it to you.

281
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,339
All empty places are my free days.

282
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,740
In case you want to ask me out for dinner someday.

283
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,300
Do you think I can understand it?

284
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,700
I'll let you know

285
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,540
if there's anything new in my design.

286
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,660
OK.

287
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,819
I'll take you home.

288
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,660
No, I'll go back myself.

289
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,339
How are you going home? You don't have a car.

290
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,740
You're so full of yourself.

291
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,260
What are you doing?

292
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,660
I'm doing a cause-of-death analysis.

293
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,740
Still not done?

294
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,980
When can you finish it?

295
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,970
It'll take a while. There are a lot of materials.

296
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,220
Wait, Tong.

297
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,300
I'm going to report to the teacher tomorrow.

298
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,460
But I have to go back to work tomorrow.

299
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,580
Not this time.

300
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,340
Fine.

301
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,100
What are you doing, my dear brother? You look so happy.

302
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,230
What are you talking about?

303
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,940
You shouldn't have taken me to him.

304
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,420
Oh.

305
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,820
I helped you find a new job, but you blamed me.

306
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,940
Fine, I will stop

307
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,740
for the sake of the money.

308
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,420
Here.

309
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,740
Get some energy.

310
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,900
I think it's going to expire soon.

311
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,700
You like it.

312
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,660
Hey, you're lying.

313
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,540
It's not expired yet.

314
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,620
Just take it.

315
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,780
I'm leaving.

316
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,530
Where are you going?

317
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,620
Are you going out for fun?

318
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,380
Gosh.

319
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,300
I don't have time for relaxation. Look at me.

320
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,460
Doesn't Bomb take care of you? Where is he?

321
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,060
Aren't you going to have fun?

322
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,460
He's always with me.

323
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,500
But I won't show off in front of you.

324
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,580
I'm afraid you will be jealous.

325
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,260
Go to the store now.

326
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,420
I'll stop arguing with you.

327
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,900
I have to go back to work.

328
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,300
Thank you for giving me this.

329
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:14,980
OK.

330
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,700
Bye.

331
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,450
[Do you want to select the furniture together tomorrow?]

332
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,060
Gosh.

333
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,900
It's finally done.

334
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,820
Hello?

335
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,820
Have you finished the chart analysis?

336
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,500
The nurse urged me so hard.

337
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,420
I've already handed over the analysis of one ward.

338
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,300
The other ward's analysis isn't finished yet.

339
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,340
Be careful. When are you on duty?

340
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,900
Today?

341
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,500
Yes.

342
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,340
I'm working a shift every other day this week

343
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,460
Alas.

344
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,700
Are you short of money recently?

345
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,900
Sorry, my friend.

346
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,100
I'm not on a tight budget. I'm sorry.

347
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,580
Oh.

348
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,300
I don't have time to write the summary.

349
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,660
Alas.

350
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,500
[OK. Tomorrow afternoon.]

351
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,900
Yeah!

352
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,860
Oh.

353
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,100
I'll be fine even if I'm on a seven-day shift.

354
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,180
Go!

355
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,780
But not tomorrow.

356
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,860
What are you doing?

357
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,940
A 180-degree turn!

358
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,460
Vee!

359
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,180
Vee!

360
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,900
Come out!

361
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,340
Your friend is here.

362
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,580
Oh, Doctor.

363
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,060
Hi, bro.

364
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,820
Don't you know the climate in Thailand?

365
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,140
Wait.

366
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,410
What?

367
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,860
Are you going shopping or on a date?

368
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,540
The perfume smells so bad.

369
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,580
Go feed your fish.

370
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,340
Let's go.

371
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,260
Please, young master.

372
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,060
Wow!

373
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,300
So beautiful

374
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,940
and elegant.

375
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,820
To be honest,

376
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,980
I've never been shopping here.

377
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,420
Well, most people don't know

378
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,940
it's a good choice to buy furniture here.

379
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,060
Yes.

380
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,380
These are pretty.

381
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,420
And there are many choices.

382
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,460
Awesome.

383
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,260
Let's go.

384
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,660
Wait.

385
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,500
Where should we start?

386
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,140
A simple way to choose furniture

387
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,620
is to start with the style, color and function.

388
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,420
Well,

389
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,100
what does it mean?

390
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,300
Think about what you will do when you go back home,

391
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,140
the people in the house and what they will do.

392
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,100
Something like this.

393
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,940
Well,

394
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,340
to be honest,

395
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,940
sometimes,

396
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,100
when I came home, I just lay on the sofa

397
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,380
and fell asleep.

398
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,980
My main daily activity at home

399
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,660
is to sleep.

400
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,620
Let's look at the sofa and the bed first, OK?

401
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,140
OK.

402
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,090
Take me there.

403
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,580
Let's go.

404
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,660
Please, Master.

405
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,980
You're as professional as if this is your home.

406
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,380
Of course.

407
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,340
There are many choices here.

408
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,020
OK.

409
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,820
What should we watch first?

410
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,740
The sofa bed, OK?

411
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,820
Not bad.

412
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,660
Let's go.

413
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,780
Go, go, go!

414
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,020
Oh.

415
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,940
I can't make a decision. They're all pretty.

416
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,860
Yes.

417
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,140
But according to your lifestyle,

418
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,060
I think a sofa bed is more suitable for you.

419
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,740
Yes.

420
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,540
Why?

421
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,220
If you're tired

422
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,140
after coming home from work and don't want to go upstairs,

423
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,460
you can spread the sofa bed, and you can sleep on it.

424
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,740
I'm so happy.

425
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,860
What are you happy about?

426
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,540
I'm happy that you care so much about me.

427
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,100
I'm just recommending products.

428
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,220
OK.

429
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,340
Are you going to buy it as I say?

430
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,380
Yes, I will.

431
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,290
Sir,

432
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,330
are you interested in this sofa?

433
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,620
What are you doing?

434
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,940
We have a special offer today.

435
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,820
If you want to buy this sofa,

436
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,420
I'll give you the heart of the salesman. Four ventricles.

437
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,420
Funny.

438
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,540
Wait a minute, sir.

439
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,860
Don't you want this sofa

440
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,220
nor my heart?

441
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,540
Sir, wait for me.

442
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,460
Sir?

443
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,300
Hey.

444
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,300
Alas.

445
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,300
I'm so tired.

446
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,980
Who told you to do that?

447
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,540
I want you to laugh.

448
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,420
I think this one is good. It's not soft or hard.

449
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,940
It doesn't hurt my back when I sleep.

450
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,820
Do you like it?

451
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,220
Yes.

452
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,420
I like it very much.

453
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,340
Let's check out other sofas.

454
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,860
Wait a minute.

455
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,460
I think this bed is nice too.

456
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,820
OK.

457
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,500
Put it in the guest room.

458
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,540
Ah.

459
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,580
Wow, it's comfortable.

460
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,420
Lie down.

461
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,300
How is it?

462
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,340
Not bad. It's good for your back.

463
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,900
Do you like it?

464
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,660
My home

465
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,780
needs you.

466
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,700
OK?

467
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,540
Let's finish it and go back.

468
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,500
I have other things to do.

469
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,620
Come on.

470
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,380
Be brave, Fahklai!

471
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,260
Fly, break through the clouds.

472
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,180
I'm not afraid of anything!

473
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,420
I'll overcome all the difficulties to get you!

474
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,020
Fly, fly, yeah, yeah, yeah!

475
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,740
There is too much furniture here. What do you think?

476
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,980
Yes.

477
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,340
What kind of decoration do you want?

478
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,380
Well, I haven't thought about it yet.

479
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,500
Can I go back and think about it?

480
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,900
-What? -Eh.

481
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,100
Look.

482
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,180
This belongs to the modern style.

483
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,500
This belongs to the minimalist style.

484
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,180
-And homely style. -Wow.

485
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,260
I almost forgot.

486
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,250
Let's buy a microwave.

487
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,140
What microwave?

488
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,500
Who said we're here to see the furniture?

489
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,260
Come on.

490
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,940
Since we're here,

491
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,460
we can take a look at daily necessities.

492
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,740
OK?

493
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,580
Hurry up if you want.

494
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,860
Copy that. I'll be right there.

495
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,580
What?

496
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,460
I forgot again.

497
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,540
What?

498
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,420
You should come with me.

499
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,380
Let's go.

500
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,940
Sky, let go!

501
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,860
Let's go together.

502
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,300
I think the bed you like and the sofa we watched together

503
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,700
are a good match.

504
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,380
I'll send you the design draft when I go back home. You'll see the general look.

505
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,180
Sure.

506
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,980
But

507
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,580
what style do you want?

508
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,020
Modern and cozy.

509
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,860
Modern and cozy?

510
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,940
How about this microwave?

511
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,500
It's good. It's simple.

512
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,380
Yes.

513
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,530
But I think that one is also good.

514
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,340
That microwave can cook a lot of dishes.

515
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,820
Decide by yourself. I'm going home.

516
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,540
And...

517
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,660
let go of my hand.

518
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,980
No, please choose one for me.

519
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,900
Please.

520
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,180
Well,

521
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,900
How about the white one?

522
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,940
It depends on you.

523
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,020
Well,

524
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,380
I just want to ask your opinion.

525
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,100
Gosh.

526
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,580
The white one looks nice and clean.

527
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,180
It goes well with furniture.

528
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,140
Oh.

529
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,780
Then I'll take the white one.

530
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,420
But that one is expensive.

531
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:57,700
What?

532
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,260
Not this one?

533
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,420
You don't need so many functions.

534
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,220
You just need to heat the dishes.

535
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,180
Oh.

536
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,380
Yes.

537
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,740
Then we can buy this one.

538
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,860
Wow.

539
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,180
It's hard to pick a microwave.

540
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,820
Oh.

541
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Look.

542
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,980
I didn't burn the dishes this time.

543
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,500
If you fail again this time, then you really need to reflect on yourself.

544
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,540
I don't know.

545
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,460
OK.

546
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,780
It's delicious.

547
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,420
Hey.

548
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,570
Let me try.

549
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,740
No.

550
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,460
Let me have a bite.

551
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,500
No.

552
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,780
Let me eat...

553
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,820
No.

554
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,260
Here.

555
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,010
Take one.

556
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,300
What?

557
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,139
Yes.

558
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,409
You cheapskate.

559
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,699
-Let me have a bite. -Hey.

560
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:14,980
Why are you so stingy?

561
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,900
You ate all the food I cooked that day.

562
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,820
What?

563
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,020
I was too tired that day, and I was hungry.

564
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,699
I have to study today, too.

565
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,780
What do you have to learn?

566
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,420
This?

567
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,100
-What? -Look.

568
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,179
There are so many things I have to learn.

569
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,900
I use more energy than you.

570
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,100
Humph.

571
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,300
You're so petty.

572
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,820
Let me have some.

573
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,060
No.

574
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,820
Humph, fine.

575
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,699
Well.

576
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,699
Eat it.

577
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,699
No!

578
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,420
Whatever.

579
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,980
One isn't enough, right?

580
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,740
I'll give you a whole plate of food.

581
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,260
Here.

582
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,340
A whole plate.

583
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,980
-Is that enough? -You lied to me.

584
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,780
I didn't lie to you. I said I would give you a whole plate of food.

585
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,220
Take it, and there are some scraps.

586
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,020
Eat all the food.

587
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,700
It's good to eat nutritious food.

588
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,580
Don't you want it?

589
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,140
Not enough?

590
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,700
Here.

591
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,420
Do you want more?

592
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,300
Do you want more?

593
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,540
Two?

594
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,700
You bad guy!

595
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,580
What?

596
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,700
Go to hell!

597
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,420
What are you doing?

598
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,780
Why do you always use violence?

599
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,020
-Stop it. I want to eat it. -Give it to me.

600
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,620
Stop.

601
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,220
What's wrong?

602
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,740
You look stunned.

603
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,460
No.

604
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,340
Really?

605
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,300
But I remember when we used the microwave to roast dried fish when we studied for exams.

606
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,300
It was funny.

607
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,620
If you want to buy it, go and pay.

608
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,420
I want to go home.

609
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,340
Wait.

610
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,060
Why don't we go out for fun?

611
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,860
You can play alone if you want.

612
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,340
I'm going back to work.

613
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,060
Hey.

614
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,010
Hey, Vee! I'll give you a ride.

615
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,380
-Do you like Vee? -Yes.

616
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,460
Right? I knew it.

617
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,010
It's Venus.

618
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,780
who made you distracted lately.

619
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,860
Well...

620
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,980
Hey.

621
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,420
In middle school, many people liked Venus.

622
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,300
Boys liked him, and girls went for him because he had a good personality.

623
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
Really?

624
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,140
-What about you? Do you like him? -Yes, I do.

625
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,740
Calm down. Don't think of me like that.

626
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,740
I like him as a friend.

627
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,340
That's good.

628
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,340
Are you close to Vee?

629
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,140
Yes.

630
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,860
Even though we are not in the same class,

631
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,340
we're in the same social circle.

632
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,100
Are you sure

633
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,060
you really don't have any ulterior motives for him?

634
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,140
Huh?

635
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,930
Enough.

636
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,610
What?

637
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,780
Hey.

638
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,900
Why are you laughing?

639
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,340
Huh?

640
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,700
Why are you laughing?

641
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,010
What should I do

642
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,700
to meet Venus again?

643
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,100
Just ask him out.

644
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,570
Treat him to dinner and watch a movie.

645
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,020
There are many things to do. If you have time,

646
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,020
I've tried everything.

647
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,860
Look.

648
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,220
Vee hasn't replied to my message yet.

649
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,340
Is he still working?

650
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,940
Do you want me to ask him? I have his Line.

651
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,940
Why isn't he replying?

652
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,940
[Day: Vee. Do you want to eat out tomorrow night?]

653
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,020
[Venus: OK.]

654
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,780
Hey.

655
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,220
Look, he replied.

656
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,620
God,

657
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,140
why did he reply to your message?

658
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,100
Who knows?

659
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,060
Does Venus like me?

660
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,740
Hey!

661
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,060
What the hell?

662
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,620
I'm angry.

663
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,980
Hey, you fool.

664
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,620
I helped you a lot.

665
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,690
You need to switch shifts with me for free.

666
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,500
Understand?

667
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,820
Calm down.

668
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,300
What should I do next?

669
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,500
Do you want to eat together?

670
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,940
Well...

671
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,940
It depends.

672
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,300
Hello, Day. Have you arrived?

673
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,060
I'm sorry, Vee. We have an emergency patient.

674
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,780
Oh, I see.

675
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,060
It's OK. I'll go home today.

676
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:55,980
I'll see you later.

677
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,100
But we already booked a table.

678
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,900
I'll come right after this.

679
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,340
OK, OK.

680
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,260
If you're done, come right away.

681
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,100
Yes, we already ordered.

682
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,140
Anyway, you eat first.

683
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,900
I'll come right after my job is done.

684
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,980
OK.

685
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,460
Hello.

686
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,900
Did you order the table?

687
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,540
Yes.

688
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,260
This way, please.

689
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,380
Are you ready?

690
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,780
Ready for what?

691
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,740
If I were ready, my hands wouldn't sweat that much.

692
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,980
I'm afraid he'll get mad.

693
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:33,460
Hey, Sky, why are you scared now?

694
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,420
Isn't it too awkward?

695
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,420
You can find a topic to chat with him.

696
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,500
Did you bring the thing I asked you to prepare?

697
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,220
Here.

698
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,260
-I'm ready. -Yeah, good.

699
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,380
If you really want to go for him,

700
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,570
show your sincerity.

701
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,540
Take care of him when you eat. Don't forget to pay. Understand?

702
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,540
OK.

703
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,980
Go on. Or the target will run away.

704
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,220
-Go ahead. -I'm leaving.

705
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:52,940
OK.

706
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,900
-Thank you so much. Bye. -Bye.

707
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,260
These are delicious.

708
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,780
Should I eat or wait?

709
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,740
Why don't I take a photo to Pai Tong first to show off?

710
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,060
Is the food good?

711
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,460
Hell no!

712
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,340
I'm Sky, not hell.

713
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,220
Day asked me to come.

714
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,420
Will you be angry?

715
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,340
This is for you.

716
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,500
I was passed by

717
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,100
and I bought this. It's pretty.

718
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,780
A wreath?

719
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,540
For Buddha worship?

720
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,980
Yes, it's pretty.

721
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,660
Yes, it's beautiful.

722
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,180
I'll take it to the Buddhist temple later.

723
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,340
Sure. You should go to pray,

724
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,890
then your mind will be cleaner and softer.

725
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,940
Then, I can stay away from bad guys.

726
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,460
Are you implying me?

727
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,500
No.

728
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,100
I didn't mean it.

729
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,660
OK, thank you.

730
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,660
Eat up.

731
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,500
OK.

732
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,020
I've been wondering lately.

733
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,980
Why didn't you reply to my message on Line?

734
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,540
I...

735
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,340
I helped my brother to work in the shop.

736
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,300
and helped you design your house.

737
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,860
Oh.

738
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,900
Are you tired?

739
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,540
Not tired of work.

740
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,020
But I'm exhausted by something.

741
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,820
For what?

742
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,380
You. You are so strange, messing with my head.

743
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,940
What do you mean?

744
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,460
I'm doing this because I like you.

745
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,940
Day will come later, right?

746
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,300
He will not, no...

747
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,820
I mean, he will come later.

748
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,620
He will come here after work.

749
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,140
Could it be...

750
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,300
Day

751
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,940
let me eat with you on purpose, right?

752
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,460
I think this pizza

753
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,700
is very delicious.

754
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,700
Here, eat it.

755
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,820
I'll cut it for you.

756
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,540
No need.

757
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,860
I can cut it myself.

758
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,540
I want to cut it for you. It's really delicious.

759
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,900
Sky, let me ask you seriously.

760
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,180
When will you stop doing this?

761
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,860
I told you before, didn't I?

762
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:26,620
I told you I'd change your mind.

763
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,260
You know,

764
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,180
if I decide to do something,

765
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,340
I'll do my best.

766
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,380
I won't give up easily.

767
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,820
So I'll stick to you.

768
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,780
Whatever.

769
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,140
I'm tired of talking to you.

770
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,980
What?

771
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,780
That means you allow me to do so.

772
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,580
People like you don't listen to others at all.

773
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,020
That means you agreed.

774
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,500
What?

775
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,620
The chicken is delicious.

776
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,020
Let's go pray later.

777
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,780
OK.

778
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,900
[Day: I'm sorry. I didn't make it yesterday.]

779
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,820
[Venus: It's OK. I understand.]

780
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,460
[Day: Are you free tomorrow?]

781
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,220
[Venus: What are you doing?]

782
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:45,540
[Day: Apologize for not coming yesterday.]

783
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,100
[Venus: No need. Or you'll stand me up again.]

784
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:55,380
[Day: Oh, my. I won't stand you up this time. I swear.]

785
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,700
[Venus: OK.]

786
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,580
You'd better be honest.

787
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,540
You can send me here.

788
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,420
You should rest well, too.

789
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:07,380
Don't rush. Take your time.

790
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,900
You should tell yourself. Go home and rest.

791
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,300
What?

792
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,500
I'm thirsty. My throat is so dry.

793
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,460
Aren't you going to invite me to your home and have some water?

794
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,020
No. Go home and drink.

795
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,300
You're so cruel. It's still baking outside.

796
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,300
Hey, Vee.

797
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,460
I'll make you feel the past.

798
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,300
As long as you are still single,

799
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,500
I'll keep pursuing you.

800
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,850
OK, I'll find a boyfriend now.

801
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,180
You don't have to go after me.

802
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,260
Hey.

803
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,700
Are you serious or joking?

804
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,780
Whatever. I'm going in.

805
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,980
Wait. Answer me first.

806
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,420
Do you have someone you like?

807
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,700
Thank you for riding me home.

808
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,700
Go home now.

809
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,180
No.

810
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,700
Answer me first.

811
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,660
Are you seeing someone?

812
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,140
This is my business.

813
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:02,580
Hey.

814
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,340
If you don't answer, does that mean you have one?

815
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,100
It's none of your business, even if I'm going to date ten people.

816
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,660
Go home now.

817
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,220
Vee.

818
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,500
I'm going to destroy your relationship with those ten people. Just wait.

819
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,500
Vee.

820
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,500
Damn!

821
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,340
Who are you scolding?

822
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,220
What's wrong with you?

823
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,020
You look like you're smiling.

824
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,420
Mind your own business.

825
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,220
You're suspicious.

826
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,660
Suspicious?

827
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,540
You're too suspicious.

828
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,140
Why are you making a fuss?

829
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,540
You scared me.

830
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,660
Oh my.

831
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,420
What's wrong with me?

832
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,900
It's refreshing to drink some water.

833
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,220
Thank you.

834
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,420
Did you pay?

835
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,580
Oh, I forgot.

836
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,980
Wait.

837
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,980
Stop pretending to be a gentleman.

838
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,580
Vee.

839
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,340
Excuse me.

840
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,060
Do you have cash?

841
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,340
I can't scan the QR code now.

842
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,740
I left my phone in the car.

843
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:00,820
Gosh.

844
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,300
Did you spit it out of your mouth?

845
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,380
Wow, so much?

846
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,380
You can drink now.

847
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,780
So, who bought water for whom?

848
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,780
I bought it for you but borrowed some money from you first.

849
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:26,980
OK.

850
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,500
Let me open it for you.

851
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,620
You take two boxes, and I'll take the rest two boxes.

852
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,340
Do you want me to help you with one more box?

853
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,980
No, we'll each carry two boxes.

854
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,580
It's really heavy.

855
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,780
Let me help you.

856
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,860
Let go.

857
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:09,580
Oh, my.

858
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,740
Let me know if you can't take it.

859
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,900
I can.

860
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,450
Doctor, please help me.

861
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:21,820
Carry it yourself.

862
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,660
Hurry up.

863
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,940
Follow me. Hurry up.

864
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,900
[Stinky Face: Come down. I have something for you.]

865
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,850
What?

866
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,980
Go out and see if anyone is in front of the house.

867
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,260
OK.

868
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,660
Go out and see it yourself.

869
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,180
I'm in the middle of the sex.

870
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,340
Gosh.

871
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,980
Are you crazy? I'm hanging up.

872
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,020
What is he doing?

873
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,740
Don't forget to replenish your energy at this hour. And I miss you.

874
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,620
Sky.

875
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,300
Tut-tut.

876
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,500
I knew you didn't eat much during your break.

877
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,300
You're full just talking to Vee, right?

878
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,460
It's none of your business.

879
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,580
Leave me alone.

880
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,940
Why don't you ventilate?

881
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,060
Now you think I'm nosy

882
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,300
and forget my credit, right?

883
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,260
Gosh.

884
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,570
How could I forget?

885
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,500
I won't.

886
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,820
I've never forgotten it.

887
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,340
Forget it.

888
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,020
What about now?

889
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,460
Are things going well?

890
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,820
Uh...

891
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,420
I don't know.

892
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,740
I can't figure it out.

893
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:28,620
What?

894
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,530
I don't know.

895
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,820
Vee is a kind person.

896
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,580
Well,

897
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,660
but he's a decisive person.

898
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,380
He won't open his heart to me easily.

899
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,780
It's hard to say.

900
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:43,980
It's OK.

901
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,340
I'll do my best to help you.

902
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,420
But now,

903
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,860
the patient is calling you.

904
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,340
Take care of it. It's none of my business.

905
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,620
Hello?

906
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,050
Yes, it's me.

907
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,780
Of course.

908
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,620
I'll be there in five minutes.

909
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,340
OK.

910
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,380
Done.

911
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:31,180
J, where did you take my car?

912
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,980
When I went home,

913
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,700
I tried my best to deliver goods to everyone.

914
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,100
There are too many goods to deliver.

915
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,690
Do you want me to drive you to the customers?

916
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,660
Why are you so bored?

917
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,090
I'm tired from work today.

918
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,180
You should go back and rest.

919
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,460
I can bear it.

920
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,980
I can deliver the goods for you.

921
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:09,740
But

922
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,060
do you want to keep the customers waiting?

923
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,980
The customer will complain.

924
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,340
OK.

925
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,140
Here.

926
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,220
Let me help you.

927
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,660
No need. I can lift it myself.

928
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,020
Give it to me.

929
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,980
Go and drive.

930
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,420
Let's go.

931
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,820
The customers have been waiting for a long time.
