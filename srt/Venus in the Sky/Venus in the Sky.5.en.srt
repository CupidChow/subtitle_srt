00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,560
I haven't even done my eyebrows.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,850
When is he arriving?

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,250
Can I still make it to the party?

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,520
Once he arrives, I must scold him.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,400
Isn't that...

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,140
Finally here.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,900
Is this the one?

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,280
Yes, this is it.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,380
Hold on.

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,470
Don't get off.

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,700
Huh? Why?

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,270
Just listen to me.

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,390
Hold on a second.

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,200
Come on.

18
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,620
What the hell?

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,510
Sky!

20
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,350
Crazy!

21
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,400
I'll beat you up!

22
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,840
Why?

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,540
No, I can get off the car on my own.

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,660
What now?

25
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,000
Let me help you.

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,870
I'm afraid you'll be tired.

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,630
Whatever.

28
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,990
Cough, cough.

29
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,450
Thank you.

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,539
Don't thank me.

31
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,160
Don't say I'm bullying you.

32
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,820
Is he your boyfriend?

33
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,450
What?

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,450
The little brother next to you.

35
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,450
So cute.

36
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,140
Oh, no...

37
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,789
Yes.

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,560
Thank you.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,020
I knew it.

40
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,440
I have sharp eyes.

41
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,250
I've never misjudged.

42
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:44,700
Love each other well.

43
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,310
I support you guys.

44
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,580
Thank you, sister.

45
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,350
Okay.

46
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,470
Excuse me.

47
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,600
I haven't done my eyebrows.

48
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,770
If it gets any later, I won't make it to the party.

49
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,170
Pretty?

50
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,009
Yes.

51
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,240
-Pretty, right? -Don't forget to draw the other side.

52
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,130
Okay.

53
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,160
Love each other well.

54
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,900
Okay.

55
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,830
Love each other well.

56
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,440
Okay.

57
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,330
Thank you.

58
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,630
You always talk nonsense.

59
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,490
What?

60
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,139
Wait, Vee.

61
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,380
Where are you going?

62
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,520
I'm going back to the store.

63
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,690
How are you going to go back?

64
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,730
Let me give you a ride.

65
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,150
Even if you walk back now,

66
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,380
even if you walk until your feet are sore,

67
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,350
you won't make it to the store.

68
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,280
It's non of your business.

69
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,090
Oh.

70
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,670
Vee.

71
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,960
What?

72
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,760
Vee, please come back quickly and help me.

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,060
There are too many orders.

74
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,990
Why don't you call J to help you?

75
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,000
Boss asked me to call you.

76
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,280
I'll hang up now,

77
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,730
I need to attend to the customers in the store.

78
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,820
Hey!

79
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,260
I must owe him something from my past life.

80
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,620
What?

81
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,530
Let me give you a ride?

82
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,460
Uh.

83
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,900
Let's go.

84
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,740
Don't keep the customers waiting for too long.

85
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,680
There are a lot of customers right now.

86
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,300
Please.

87
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:24,700
[7-ELEVEN]

88
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,610
ChaoSua's snacks are really selling well.

89
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,610
They are all sold out.

90
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,500
Great!

91
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,400
Come and help me.

92
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,920
Five orders came at the same time.

93
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,620
Where did J go?

94
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,080
He just came back and went out to deliver again.

95
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,990
Give it to me. I'll help you.

96
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,430
Okay. Help me make some drinks.

97
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,520
Let me help you.

98
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,140
Go home and sleep.

99
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,710
It's a piece of cake.

100
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,780
I'd love to do it.

101
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,130
You said it yourself.

102
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,420
Come with me.

103
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,380
Here.

104
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,040
Look at the formula and put ingredients.

105
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,320
Pink milk.

106
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,680
Crazy.
(In Thai, the word for milk and chest is the same)

107
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,790
You dirty dog.

108
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,680
Go home now.

109
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,410
I'm just kidding.

110
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,820
Please. I won't disrupt you anymore.

111
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,890
Hurry up.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,500
Yes, sir.

113
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,710
You haven't started yet?

114
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,420
I'm afraid it won't taste good.

115
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,060
Move aside.

116
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,860
I'll do it myself.

117
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,540
I can do this. Let me help you.

118
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,220
Here.

119
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,409
Okay. Move.

120
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,820
ChaoSua's snacks...

121
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,250
Chaosua's spicy pork skin cake...

122
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,480
Is this it?

123
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,070
Hey, what else do you need?

124
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,390
Let me help you.

125
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,660
Give me the phone.

126
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,470
It's wrong, Sky. You got the wrong flavor.

127
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,430
Not this one.

128
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,159
Huh?

129
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,530
Sorry.

130
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,720
I was a little confused, I think.

131
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,300
It's okay.

132
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,940
Their packages look similar.

133
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,150
I'll handle it.

134
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,080
Are you tired?

135
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,960
Is there anything else I can help with?

136
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,810
You are helping me if you can stay here quietly.

137
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,300
Why?

138
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,980
I just want to give you a massage.

139
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,330
If you continue to disturb me, I'll send you home.

140
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,600
Okay.

141
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,950
I'll stay here quietly.

142
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,080
Let me hold your hand.

143
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,810
No.

144
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,710
Where are you going in a hurry?

145
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,270
Here, Day.

146
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,550
You are working really hard.

147
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,620
Yeah, I have to work the night shift in the emergency room.

148
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,700
I thought you went home.

149
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,810
I happened to find a job as a driver.

150
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,340
Well...

151
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,230
Then do your best to achieve your goal...

152
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:17,750
Oh!

153
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,710
I mean work hard.

154
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,630
Idiot.

155
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,160
Don't make fun of me.

156
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,400
I'm going to die soon.

157
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,820
Okay.

158
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,260
I'm going back to work.

159
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,000
Goodbye, Vee.

160
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,620
You were smiling so sweetly.

161
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,030
I've never seen you smile like that to me before.

162
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,340
Huh?

163
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,440
Crazy.

164
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,210
Oh!

165
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,300
What's wrong with you?

166
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,400
Are you okay?

167
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,140
I'm fine.

168
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,460
I'm okay.

169
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,140
I'm fine.

170
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,950
What are you talking about?

171
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,400
Your face is so pale.

172
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,970
Here.

173
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,300
I just haven't exercised for a while.

174
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,040
Uh...

175
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,370
Take a sniff of the nasal ointment first.

176
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,880
It's refreshing.

177
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,620
I asked you to rest, but you didn't listen.

178
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,900
Because I wanted to be with you.

179
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,710
Stop it.

180
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,420
I'm so happy that you're worried about me.

181
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,420
I just want to go home.

182
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,150
Alas.

183
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,320
I'm fine. Let's go home.

184
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,750
Let's go home.

185
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,580
Hey!

186
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,620
Wait.

187
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,640
Sit here.

188
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,340
Hold on.

189
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,100
Give me 30 seconds.

190
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,360
Here.

191
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,330
Thank you.

192
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,260
Um-huh.

193
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,020
Let me take a sniff.

194
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,040
Uh...

195
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,370
I think you should get a new seatbelt.

196
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,960
It's hard to open it.

197
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,570
Well...

198
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,180
Sometimes it's hard to open it.

199
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,660
Make sure your seat belt isn't fastened too tightly.

200
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,700
Oh.

201
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,680
Let me go home.

202
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,200
Thank you for today.

203
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,250
Vee.

204
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,760
Can I come inside your house and talk about the decor style and theme?

205
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,130
Do you still remember the requirements I mentioned earlier?

206
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,650
If you're done, send it to me.

207
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,120
Oh.

208
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,350
Yes, I do.

209
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,300
But can we just talk at your house?

210
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,100
We can continue to talk about the style of the house.

211
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,290
No.

212
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,250
Today, you should go home and rest.

213
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,850
Doctor.

214
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,700
Are you here to see Vee off?

215
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,400
Yes, brother.

216
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,100
If someone here hadn't taken my car, I could have gone home by myself.

217
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,450
You're so nagging.

218
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,020
Doctor.

219
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,260
Have you eaten?

220
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,810
I just finished cooking.

221
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,740
You've been tired all day, haven't you?

222
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,980
Go home and rest.

223
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,460
You've been tired all day?

224
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,940
That means you haven't eaten anything yet, right?

225
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,770
Yes, brother.

226
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,970
Thank you so much, I'm hungry.

227
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,530
Please take care of my stomach.

228
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,120
No problem.

229
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,070
Vee.

230
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,620
Bring your friend home.

231
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,540
And throw away the trash.

232
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,480
Doctor, hurry.

233
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,650
Me? Throwing the trash?

234
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,550
I can do it too.

235
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,010
Coming.

236
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:05,980
Hot.

237
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,680
Freshly cooked hot food.

238
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,300
American-style fried rice.

239
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,090
But you can only find it in Thailand.

240
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,690
Please enjoy, Doctor.

241
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,780
Wow.

242
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,450
It looks delicious.

243
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,670
Thank you so much.

244
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,860
I haven't eaten this for a long time.

245
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:22,980
Uh.

246
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,070
Are you satisfied?

247
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,460
Eat up and leave.

248
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,220
How can you talk to your friend like that?

249
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,110
So rude.

250
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,250
Doctor.

251
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,160
Eat as much as you want.

252
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,460
I'll go to the store to help Bomb.

253
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,180
Oh?

254
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,150
Aren't you going to eat with us?

255
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,250
No.

256
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,020
Please enjoy, Doctor.

257
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,220
I've already eaten.

258
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,470
I've eaten here.

259
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,580
I've eaten here.

260
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,440
I've eaten in the seat where you are sitting,

261
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,070
lots of times.

262
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,730
Enjoy it together.

263
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,890
If it's delicious, you can make a sniffing sound.

264
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,710
If you're hungry, you can eat like a wolf.

265
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,570
Eat as much as you want, Doctor.

266
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,050
Bye.

267
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,870
Your brother looks busy.

268
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,060
Today is the least busy day for him,

269
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,650
so he had time to cook.

270
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,550
I'm starting to have some doubts.

271
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,950
Did you bribe my brother?

272
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,390
Are you crazy?

273
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
I need to save money for proposing to you.

274
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,980
What?

275
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,060
Nothing.

276
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,050
Eat up.

277
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,930
I'll inquire about your requirements and personal life later.

278
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,540
You know my private life, right?

279
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,070
Try asking something deeper than that.

280
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,520
Something you want to know.

281
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,630
It's unnecessary.

282
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,620
Why should I ask something deeper?

283
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,180
I don't know.

284
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,440
Just try to ask.

285
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,770
What if it helps with interior design?

286
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,220
Well,

287
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,080
actually, I've finished the design of your living room.

288
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,750
I only need to send you the design drawings.

289
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,940
But there's still the bedroom left, and you haven't told me your requirements.

290
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,450
Well...

291
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,310
The bedroom?

292
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,140
I fall asleep and wake up easily.

293
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,300
So I want the soundproofing to be good.

294
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,150
Then I can sleep soundly like others.

295
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,700
Do you understand?

296
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,980
I've never skipped a shift.

297
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,619
Because I didn't know what to do with my free time.

298
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,420
When I'm not on duty, I usually follow recommendations

299
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,630
from others to find good food.

300
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,000
When I get back home, I'll watch a movie,

301
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,810
then take a shower and go to bed.

302
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,050
The last time I slept soundly...

303
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,080
was probably...

304
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,550
during my time in college when I was with you.

305
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,300
Hurry up and eat.

306
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,660
The food is getting cold.

307
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,400
Don't you want to know more?

308
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,600
No.

309
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,960
Eat up.

310
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,690
There are still many things left to say.

311
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,890
What if they are useful for your interior design?

312
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,130
No.

313
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,760
Can't you let me stay a little longer?

314
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,620
Do you think you can do anything just because you're a client?

315
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,190
Huh?

316
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,210
Haven't you heard it?

317
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,240
Customers are God.

318
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,980
Customers are God?

319
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,060
I'm sorry.

320
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,810
I happen to be a Buddhist.

321
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,140
What?

322
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,180
Go home.

323
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,730
I'm sleepy.

324
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,540
I can go home.

325
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,500
But please tell J that I'm grateful to him.

326
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,700
He's a good cook.

327
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,580
I'll ask him to take care of my stomach next time.

328
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,020
Eat frozen food then.

329
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,390
Vee.

330
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,570
Uh...

331
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,380
Also, don't come bothering my brother anymore.

332
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,990
If you bother my brother again,

333
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,000
just let him design your house.

334
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:36,950
I'll quit.

335
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,790
I'll go on strike.

336
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,580
If you don't go back,

337
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,030
I won't design your house anymore.

338
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,550
I still have to be on duty tomorrow.

339
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,100
I won't be able to see you for 32 hours.

340
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,250
Can you please let me stay a little longer to watch you?

341
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,640
You've been watching me all day today, haven't you?

342
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,180
I'm tired of it.

343
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,500
I know why

344
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,680
you are so cruel to me.

345
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,960
Sometimes you respond to me and sometimes you don't.

346
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,090
Because you're still mad at me, right?

347
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,150
I think I've told you.

348
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,210
Because I only respond to work-related matters.

349
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,190
Only respond to work-related matters?

350
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,290
Okay.

351
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,200
Okay.

352
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,010
But I'll work harder.

353
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,740
I will definitely make you rediscover your old feelings for me.

354
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,260
Just wait and see.

355
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,680
Whatever.

356
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,800
Now,

357
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,910
please go back.

358
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,020
Otherwise, you'll faint again.

359
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,470
Can you give me 5 more minutes?

360
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,380
Then open your eyes wide and watch me carefully. Go!

361
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,840
Vee.

362
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,810
Vee.

363
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,180
Give me 5 minutes!

364
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,140
Five minutes, Vee!

365
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,560
Vee!

366
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,870
Vee!

367
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,160
Vee!

368
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,640
Open the door!

369
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,140
[7-ELEVEN]

370
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,420
Almost there.

371
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,550
Almost there.

372
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,540
Almost...

373
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,680
Almost there.

374
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,190
Hey.

375
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,380
Let me help you.

376
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,950
No, thanks.

377
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,400
It's a piece of cake.

378
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,470
Are you sure you can do it?

379
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,170
Of course.

380
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,230
No need.

381
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,490
I can do it myself.

382
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,410
What's wrong with you?

383
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,610
My hands slipped.

384
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,420
I'll go to the hospital with you tomorrow.

385
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,110
No need.

386
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,720
Just one plaster will do.

387
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,720
But...

388
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,700
Stop it.

389
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,740
Just go.

390
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,910
I'll do it myself.

391
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,260
Just go. It's a piece of cake.

392
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,430
Gosh.

393
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,000
My back hurts.

394
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,420
I used to have back pain.

395
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,220
Who had back pain before me?

396
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,660
Gosh.

397
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,200
I just checked the duty roster.

398
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,270
I have to work for two more days.

399
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,820
And last night, I had to handle a lot of patients.

400
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,140
There was no one to assist me with the yellow and pink cases.

401
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,510
Gosh...

402
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,310
Really?

403
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,740
Yes.

404
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,910
How much would it take to hire you?

405
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,970
I've been working for almost 30 hours,

406
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,270
but it feels like I've worked for 48 hours.

407
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,530
I want to die.

408
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,310
So you want me to take your shift, right?

409
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,540
Yes.

410
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,020
Can you?

411
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,060
I'm begging you.

412
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,060
Please?

413
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,540
Last night, three patients experienced sudden cardiac arrest simultaneously.

414
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,990
I stayed in the intensive care unit until 5 in the morning.

415
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,460
Okay.

416
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,450
You can transfer however much money you'd like.

417
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,600
You used to cover shifts for me quite often before.

418
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,480
Let's consider it even now.

419
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,190
Thank you, man.

420
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,470
Otherwise, I will be the fourth person with a sudden cardiac arrest.

421
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,200
Are you okay?

422
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:27,420
[Sky Fahklai: I forgot to check the duty roster. When I opened it, I was shocked to find out that I have to work for two consecutive days.]

423
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,980
[Sky Fahklai: However, I have already transferred my duty to someone else. Otherwise, it would have been tough. Doctors need a life too.]

424
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,820
[Sky Fahklai: Did you eat the food I sent you? Was it delicious? I have to go for the evening rounds now. I miss you!]

425
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,080
Hello?

426
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:50,920
Doctor,

427
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,260
the Grandma in the ICU is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding.

428
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,020
Okay.

429
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,200
I'll be right there.

430
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,190
I'm leaving.

431
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,050
I'll call you when I'm done.

432
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,100
I'd like to entrust the patient in bed 504 to your care as well.

433
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,170
Is that okay?

434
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,010
Okay. Fine.

435
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:14,630
Go.

436
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,420
Good luck.

437
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,860
Hey, buddy.

438
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,400
Would you like some water?

439
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:21,930
I'm okay.

440
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,260
I can make a V-gesture to gather energy, 
and I'll keep going.

441
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,820
Can he do it?

442
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:37,300
[7-Eleven]

443
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,380
Here you go.

444
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,030
Here's the receipt.

445
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,720
Please come again.

446
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,810
[Sky Faklai: I forgot to check the duty schedule. When I checked it, 
I was shocked to see that I had to work two days in a row]

447
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,800
[Sky Faklai: But I already asked others to take my shift.
Otherwise, it would be bad. Doctors need to live too.

448
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,580
[Sky Faklai: Did you eat the food I sent you?
I have to do my night ward round. Miss you]

449
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,540
Oh.

450
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,340
What's going on?

451
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,620
Did you go to the Songkran Festival?

452
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,660
You're all soaked.

453
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,050
It's all sweat.

454
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,800
It's too hot.

455
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,640
You know what? I stood there, waiting for customers. I almost died.

456
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,570
Give me a drink.

457
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,110
Here.

458
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,760
Thank you.

459
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,250
But the drinks are selling well on a hot day like this.

460
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,770
Yes.

461
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,230
By the way, where's J?

462
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,450
Oh.

463
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,940
He also went to deliver orders.

464
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,180
But it's somewhere around here.

465
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,650
He should be back soon.

466
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,520
Are you okay?

467
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,020
Of course.

468
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,390
It's just...

469
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,220
that I made a super bad decision.

470
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,040
Make the delivery on foot under the sun.

471
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,990
How're you holding up?

472
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,860
You're sweating all over.

473
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,890
I'm fine.

474
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,170
But I want to take a break.

475
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,980
Okay.

476
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,150
Here.

477
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,650
You can feel better after smelling it.

478
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,760
Thank you.

479
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,210
Do you feel better?

480
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,960
Much better.

481
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:38,960
Here.

482
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,870
Thank you.

483
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,180
What happened today?

484
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,590
What?

485
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,550
What's wrong?

486
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,740
Nothing.

487
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,650
I'm fine.

488
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,590
Where's the Act?

489
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,150
Is he back?

490
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,470
Oh.

491
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,620
He rode a bike to deliver orders to the customers,

492
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,100
but he hasn't come back yet.

493
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,920
Anyway, it's good that you're back.

494
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,680
An order came in. I'll deliver it.

495
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,110
You cover the shop.

496
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,550
Are you sure you're going?

497
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,560
Ask Act to send the order when he comes back.

498
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,770
It's okay.

499
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,580
I can go.

500
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,720
The hospital isn't far.

501
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,440
Okay. Whatever.

502
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,970
Go on with your date.

503
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,690
Let me feel better too.

504
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,320
J.

505
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:50,920
Give me some encouragement.

506
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,190
We're in a 7-11 Store.

507
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,790
-Go away. -It's our shop too.

508
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,650
Go away.

509
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,440
That's all.

510
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,440
Please check if everything you ordered is here.

511
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,020
Yes.

512
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,280
Thank you.

513
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,200
There are many people in the hospital today.

514
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,750
They queued up to buy water.

515
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,200
So, I think it's better to order online.

516
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
It's convenient.

517
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,060
Yes.

518
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,650
It's so hot today.

519
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,420
Ice-cold water is a must.

520
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,250
You can place orders anytime.

521
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,800
Oh, not for now.

522
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,780
I won't have to take care of the patients tomorrow.

523
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:33,940
Thank you.

524
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,650
You're welcome.

525
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,500
The patient in Room 402 can be discharged home tomorrow.

526
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,820
As for that grandma, follow this.

527
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,540
Okay.

528
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,120
The patient with DKA. Did the professor go check on him?

529
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,180
Yes, the professor just went in for a check-up.

530
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,900
Doctor, would you like to take a break?

531
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,690
You haven't rested today.

532
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,740
I'm okay.

533
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,120
We only need to check the last three patients.

534
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,060
Okay.

535
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,860
Thank you.

You look so pale, and you're still worried about others?

543

There's one chicken left.

544

Pineapple pie...

Are you thirsty?

550
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,460
Just a moment.

551
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,550
Just let me stand here for a moment.

552
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,570
Is there any order?

553
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,010
Where are you going in such a hurry?

554
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,670
There's no order.

Vee!

556

You haven't paid for it yet!

557
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,250
Come back and pay for it, Vee!

558
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,460
I lost another 50 baht.

559
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,740
Excuse me.

560
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,930
Is Dr. Sky here?

561
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,940
May I ask what this is about?

562
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,650
I'm here to deliver a drink to him.

563
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,630
Oh, the doctor is on his ward rounds.

564
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,990
But you can give it to me,

565
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,780
and I'll give it to him when he gets here.

566
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,800
Forget it.

567
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,060
Okay.

568
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:34,940
It's okay.

569
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,480
Is it going to melt?

570
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,300
Oh.

571
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,110
Are you okay, doctor?

572
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,060
I'll be sick soon.

573
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,630
Someone is waiting for you.

574
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,449
Who?

575
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,989
He said he came to deliver a drink to you.

576
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,630
He's been waiting for you for a while.

577
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,199
He's sitting right there, doctor.

578
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,590
Vee?

579
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,010
Is he asleep?

580
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,520
Vee.

581
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,440
Why are you sleeping here?

582
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,730
Are you here to deliver something to a customer?

583
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,230
Oh.

584
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,340
Yes.

585
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,650
I've been waiting for him for a while. He hasn't come yet.

586
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,370
I'm glad you came.

587
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,720
Drink it.

588
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,630
But...

589
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,050
It has all melted.

590
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,990
I'd better throw it away.

591
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,180
Hey, isn't it bland?

592
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,830
It tastes so good when I drink from your hand.

593
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,580
Thank you

594
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,590

595
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,570
Okay.

596
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,970
Wait.

597
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,370
Since you're here,

598
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,330
can I ask you for something?

599
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,490
What is it?

600
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,300
Can you give me some encouragement?

601
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,950
I'm so tired today.

602
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,900
Uh...

603
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,870
Okay.

604
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,040
Keep going.

605
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,890
Can I hug you?

606
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,220
No.

607
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,010
This is a hospital.

608
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,630
Hey, where are you taking me?

609
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,180
[Fire Exit]

610
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,880
Why did you bring me here?

611
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,290
I'm so tired today, you know?

612
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,950
Why didn't you reply my to messages?

613
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,820
Because there are a lot of customers in the store.

614
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,870
Okay.

615
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,360
Give me a hug.

616
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,530
No.

617
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,940
Just a hug.

618
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,540
Okay.

619
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,060
Just a hug.

620
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,140
Is it enough?

621
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,260
I've missed you.

622
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,390
I've missed you so much.

623
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,480
I'm exhausted today.

624
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,090
I'm so happy to see you.

625
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,700
Thank you for the drink.

626
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,260
No, I didn't.

627
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,380
You can let go of me now.

628
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,950
Let me hug you for ten more minutes.

629
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,740
Ridiculous.

630
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,740
That's too long.

631
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,340
Then let me hug you for another minute.

632
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,090
30 seconds.

633
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,570
Okay.

634
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,970
It's been 30 seconds.

635
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,210
Oh...

636
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,370
Why does time pass so quickly?

637
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,600
It's not at all like when I was on duty.

638
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,080
Stop buying more time for yourself.

639
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,140
Let me go.

640
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,400
You grabbed my clothes.

641
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,030
No.

642
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,150
Okay.

643
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
Let's have dinner together after I finish work.

644
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,870
No.

645
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:47,920
I don't want to go.

646
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,390
Your decoration hasn't made much progress yet?

647
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,050
Let's just eat and talk.

648
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,380
Please.

649
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,690
Please come with me to dinner.

651
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,210
Please.

652
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,060
Okay.

653
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,340
Come to my house if you can.

654
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:09,920
Okay.

655
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,510
Pinky swear.

656
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,050
We have a date.

657
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,060
You're too close.

658
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,190
Really?

659
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,280
Yes.

[7-11 Convenience Store]

661
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,420
Hey.

662
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,120
What are you doing?

663
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,840
Get up.

664
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,490
Hey.

665
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,230
It's okay.

I'm not tired.

667
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,900
No.

668

Go get more rest.

669
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,610
But your back hurts, right?

670
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,160
I'm fine now.

671
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,840
But...

672
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:03,890
Bomb!

673
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,820
Go back and rest.

674
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,220
Go.

00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:22,830
Aha.

685
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,120
You told me to call you.

686
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,160
I'm drawing the window. Wait.

Not yet.

00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,650
Why don't you find something to eat?

691
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,880
I'll find something to eat after talking to you.

692
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,040
I'm sorry.

But I have an urgent job today.

695
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:48,900
I'm busy too.

696
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,900
I barely touched my phone today.

697
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,840
I might not be able to call you tonight.

698
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,880
I'm too sleepy.

Oh.

701

You're always tired,

702
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,840
but we still call each other.

703
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,320
You're busy too, aren't you?

704
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,070
It should be fine if we don't call each other for a day or two.

705
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,410
We always talk on the phone when we're busy.

Hey, Tong.

713
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,400
Do we have to talk on the phone before going to bed?

714
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,170
Don't you want to talk with me?

715
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,090
No.

716
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,580
Usually, we haven't talked for five minutes,

717
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,320
and we're out of words.

718
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,200
Just once today.

719
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,270
I want to talk to you even for five minutes.

720
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,790
I'll call you later.

721
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,970
You won't listen to me.

722
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,350
I can't think of anything.

723
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,760
He ignored everything I sent to him.

724
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,420
I don't know what he sent.

I wasn't waiting for you.

00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,450
It's better if you don't come.

729
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,680
I should clean the house.

730
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:33,360
Oh!

731
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:36,190
What are you doing?

732
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,810
What's that sound?

733
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,080
I'll go take a look.

734
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:45,120
No need.

735
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:45,900
Stay here.

736
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,350
I'll check it out.

737
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,030

What are you doing? You're busy.

742

Where?

744
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,240
I just cleaned it up yesterday.

745
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,450
Maybe there is some dust you can't see.

00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,090
I'll go take out the trash.

750
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,270
Where?

751
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,730
I just threw out the trash this evening.

752
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,030
What's wrong with you?

753
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,810
I'd better go back to sleep.

754
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,800
I don't think he'll come.

755
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,020
Kwangtung.

756
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,270
Pakbung.

757
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,430
What's this one's name?

758
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,570
What did J name these fish?

759
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:07,140
♫I can't think straight when you do that♫

760
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:11,690
♫Like to come close to me and work magic with your eyes♫

761
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,160
♫If you really like it♫

762
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,060
♫Just stop playing♫

763
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,730
Why are you sitting here and singing like a mosquito?

764
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,880
What are you doing here?

765
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,460
Been waiting long?

766
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,440
No.

767
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,960
You're hurting me with your words again.

768
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,330
If you weren't waiting for me,

769
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:44,460
why are you sitting here?

770
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,210
I...I just can't think of anything about work.

771
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:49,390
So, I came out to relax my mind,

772
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,320
couldn't I?

773
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,280
Why are you smiling?

774
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,050
Nothing.

775
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:57,200
It's fine if you can't.

776
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,500
Have you eaten?

777
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,480
I bought some food.

778
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:07,980
Let's eat at your home.

779
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,850
Why aren't you eating at your own house?

780
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,490
I went to your house before coming to my place.

781
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,580
Please let me in to eat, please.

782
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:22,950
Wait.

783
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,050
Sing that song for me again.

784
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,230
Do you want to eat or not?

785
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,800
Okay.

786
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,160
[Tonkla: I'm going to bed. I can't take it anymore.]

787
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:52,680
[Tonkla: I'm going to bed. I can't take it anymore.]

788
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,150
[Baitong: Okay. We can talk tomorrow]

789
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:19,160
[Baitong: Okay. We can talk tomorrow]

790
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,160
Oh.

791
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,050
Why did you eat so quickly?

792
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:23,760
I'm sorry.

793
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:28,000
I've been so busy eating that I haven't had a chance to look up and talk to you.

794
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:30,120
It's okay.

795
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,270
Where did you buy the food?

796
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,680
I don't have time to eat today.

797
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,740
I just finished my duty and worked on something else for a long time.

798
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:42,930
After the handover,

799
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:45,920
I came to you immediately.

800
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,230
You don't have time to eat,

801
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,210
but you have time to order food for me.

802
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,450
Yes.

803
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:55,570
What?

804
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,520
I just want you to try that restaurant.

805
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:02,750
No.

806
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:08,080
I mean, why didn't you use the time you order something for me to eat?

807
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,360
It only takes a short while to place an order.

808
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:13,290
What do you think?

809
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:14,970
Do you like the food there?

810
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,750
Yes.

811
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:39,930
What's wrong?

812
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,210
Did I make you angry?

813
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,280
Or you don't like the food there?

814
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:48,860
You can just tell me.

815
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:50,850
No.

816
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:52,240
It's delicious.

817
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:56,740
Let's go to the restaurant next time.

818
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,700
Okay.

819
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,400
Why are you so nice today?

820
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,140
What nice?

821
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,140
Eat up.

822
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:10,160
Then you can see my design drawing earlier.

823
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:11,010
Or it'll be too late.

824
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,440
Okay.

825
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,480
Is this okay?

826
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,530
I think this place looks a bit weird.

827
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:45,180
Would it be better if you moved it from here to here?

828
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:47,560
Yes.

829
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:48,850
I think so too.

830
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,080
I think I've lost my touch.

831
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,720
Don't worry.

832
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,490
You can take your time.

833
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,050
What?

834
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,990
People only want to finish their jobs quickly.

835
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,830
I don't want you to feel pressured.

836
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,930
How about this?

837
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,640
That's enough for today.

838
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,070
You're already tired.

839
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:23,910
Let's do it tomorrow.

840
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,820
Okay.

841
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:27,730
Sure.

842
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,720
Sing me a song.

843
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,160
No.

844
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,480
Why?

845
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,010
Please.

846
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,320
Just for a while.

847
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:46,950
So I can sleep well when I get home.

848
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:49,440
Please.

849
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,620
Okay.

850
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,010
But I can't quite remember the melody.

851
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,130
It's okay.

852
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,920
What should I sing?

853
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:02,320
Well...

854
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,260
The song that you often sang.

855
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,900
Please.

856
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:13,410
Okay.

857
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,190
I'll try.

858
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:24,920
♫I can't think straight when you do that♫

859
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,270
♫Like to come close to me and work magic with your eyes♫

860
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,860
♫If I am thinking too much, don't do it♫

861
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:40,420
♫If you really like it♫

862
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,350
♫Just stop playing♫

863
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:54,960
Are you really asleep?

864
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,790
When you're not talking so much, you look pretty cute.
