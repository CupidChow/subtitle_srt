1
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,280
The company is currently working with Longchuan Group

2
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,040
to sign a project cooperation agreement.

3
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,000
It's expected that next month

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,330
Longchuan Group will officially move in.

5
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Has this agreement

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,520
been signed by all shareholders?

7
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes.

8
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,800
Who is it?

9
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,280
Uncle.

10
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,960
What's the deal with that cooperation agreement

11
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,220
with Longchuan Group?

12
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,520
Xiao Ye.

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,880
It's a long story.

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
We're taking an indirect approach.

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,640
If we don't sign,

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,680
Longchuan Group will continue buying our shares.

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,520
I think in that case,

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,960
we might as well cooperate with them.

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,320
Maximize our benefits

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,539
and achieve a win-win situation.

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,960
Okay.

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,600
I understand.

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,000
Damn it.

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,160
Mr. Lu

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,200
Geisha coffee from Alps Estate.

26
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,840
Just shipped from Panama.

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,840
Your favorite Alps Estate Geisha.

28
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,720
Just imported from Panama.

29
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,680
That's what Mr. Lu Tongchen said.

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,720
I have something urgent.

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,380
I need to go.

32
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,280
Oh, by the way.

33
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,560
I've quit coffee.

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,760
Please bring me tea instead from now on.

35
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,210
What do you want from me?

36
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,680
Come in first and we'll talk.

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,050
Director Lu is here.

38
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,400
Mr. Li,

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,080
what brings you here?

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,440
Everyone's worried about Nanshui tea sales.

41
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,500
You're a director,

42
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,680
so I thought you might have some good ideas.

43
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,560
I don't know much about tea.

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,800
What exactly do you need me to do?

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,360
Director Lu,

46
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,440
take a look at this.

47
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,520
Tomorrow in our city,

48
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,850
there's a charity gala.

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,360
I heard it'll be full of celebrities, wealthy people, and entrepreneurs.

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,680
If we could bring this tea to the gala

51
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,160
and promote it through the entrepreneurs' connections...

52
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,320
It might work.

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,560
You don't seem

54
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,040
to understand this very well.

55
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,280
If you want to promote a product,

56
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,440
you need to go to trade shows.

57
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,160
These charity galas

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,960
are essentially for networking

59
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
and making connections,

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,160
not really practical for what you want.

61
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
What should we do?

62
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,680
Since Mr. Li is already here,

63
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,079
let's give it a try.

64
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
It's okay, sir.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
Even if it doesn't work,

66
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,400
at least we tried.

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,200
That's right.

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,060
Let's try then.

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,280
But...

70
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,600
but how do you want to try?

71
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,680
How is it?

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Does it look good?

73
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,040
It's okay.

74
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,940
Feels like something's missing.

75
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,280
Sir, wear this.

76
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,340
Perfect, perfect.

77
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,810
This outfit will definitely work.

78
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,120
Mr. Li,

79
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,540
maybe I should get you an erhu too.

80
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,560
I can take you to Tianqiao for a spin tonight.

81
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,120
You know what,

82
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,480
how does that look like someone who plays erhu?

83
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,800
Why are you looking at me?

84
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,760
Looks.

85
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,600
Really looks like it.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,880
Looks like what?

87
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,720
Like a boss.

88
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,180
Like a rich man.

89
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Just doesn't look like a tea farmer.

90
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,340
That's exactly the point.

91
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,810
We need everyone to believe it's real.

92
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,680
Events like this

93
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,290
are by invitation only.

94
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,650
Without an invitation,

95
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,280
you can't attend.

96
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,040
Not in the office during work hours.

97
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Where have you been?

98
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,560
I was discussing something at a friend's place.

99
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,620
Get ready quickly.

100
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,560
There's a charity gala tomorrow night.

101
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,290
You'll represent the company.

102
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,160
Isn't Lu Ye available?

103
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,040
Why can't he go?

104
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,090
Can you use your brain for once?

105
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,240
Don't you know this gala is an opportunity for you?

106
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,500
Listen.

107
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,370
There will be many media outlets at this gala.

108
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,159
When you appear as a representative of Jindu Group,

109
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,080
it will make people believe

110
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,610
that you're the future leader of the company.

111
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,409
Understand?

112
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,280
I understand.

113
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,080
Blockhead.

114
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,640
How did it go?

115
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Did you get them?

116
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,720
What's wrong? Say something.

117
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,480
You

118
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,440
really know how to keep us in suspense.

119
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,160
I happen to have a celebrity friend.

120
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,320
He had a scheduling conflict and couldn't go,

121
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,520
so he gave these to me.

122
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,680
However,

123
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,660
I only got two tickets.

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,920
Then you two go.

125
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
My appearance

126
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,010
isn't really suitable.

127
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,560
I'll stay home and look after the children.

128
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,210
Thank you for your help, uncle.

129
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,120
Don't worry.

130
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,880
I'll definitely promote our Nanshui tea.

131
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,640
Don't think things are so simple.

132
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,159
Those outfits of ours

133
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,360
are fine for a graduation party.

134
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,820
But for that kind of event,

135
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,200
you need formal wear

136
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,330
and evening attire.

137
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,610
Evening attire?

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,800
You're back.

139
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
We had such a productive day today.

140
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,360
Come in.

141
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,680
Are you happy?

142
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,760
It's quite good.

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,080
You've been to so many places today.

144
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,960
You must be tired.

145
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,720
Let's put everything down.

146
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,050
Okay.

147
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,400
All the children are asleep now.

148
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,370
What's this?

149
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,120
These are TV shows I've carefully selected.

150
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,000
Let's learn

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,040
about the procedures and etiquette for formal banquets.

152
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,900
What's there to learn about that?

153
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,200
Of course we need to take this seriously.

154
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,640
Like how to drink wine with others,

155
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,250
how to socialize properly.

156
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,360
If you want to learn, you don't need to

157
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,820
learn from Korean dramas.

158
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,760
Fine, study it.

159
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,440
Look at this woman,

160
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,600
she's not even as pretty as you.

161
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,320
Why are you watching her?

162
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,960
Be serious.

163
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,600
Okay.

164
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,360
This one.

165
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,640
What are you doing?

166
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,840
You don't need to learn this.

167
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,040
You need to learn how to kiss properly.

168
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
Kissing needs practice.

169
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,240
Stop fooling around.

170
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,290
Park Ji-hwan

171
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,900
