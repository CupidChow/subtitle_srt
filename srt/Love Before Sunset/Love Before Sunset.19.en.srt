1
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,200
By the way,

2
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,080
the company received

3
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,560
a legal complaint against you today.

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,320
Suing me?

5
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,480
Who?

6
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,810
Who else could it be?

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,520
That female model.

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,240
After she was blacklisted by the company,

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,370
she decided to hire a lawyer to sue you.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
She claims you caused her

11
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,940
defamation and emotional distress.

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,980
She wants you to pay her 6 million.

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,920
6 million.

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,680
People these days.

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,250
They're really something,

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,980
turning the tables like that.

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,920
Anyway,

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,280
this kind of matter

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,480
should be left entirely to the lawyers.

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,280
You don't need to worry about it.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,720
What you need to do now

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
is to move forward

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,600
with your plan, step by step.

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,520
I'll be behind you,

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,050
supporting you all the way.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,800
What's meant to happen will happen eventually.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,720
It's me, Anduo.

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,280
Are you okay?

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,160
That's how things stand.

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm not sure

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,080
about the contract I signed.

32
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,560
But many villagers

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,360
have been tricked into signing.

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,280
Okay.

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,000
I understand.

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,760
Don't worry.

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,400
I'll take care

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,480
of the rest.

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,360
Mr. Lu.

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Get out of the way!

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,840
Brother Ye.

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,130
You're here.

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,220
Let's play a round.

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,280
Lin Anduo.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,860
The contract with the villagers.

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,850
What's going on?

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,880
This is just standard procedure

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,560
before project development.

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,600
No need to get so angry.

50
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,850
You call this kind of

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
deceiving Lin Anduo

52
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,210
and the villagers a despicable tactic

53
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,560
a standard procedure?

54
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,920
Really?

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,200
Despicable?

56
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,880
Brother Ye.

57
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,520
In this world,

58
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,960
only profit is eternal.

59
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,760
Your so-called noble character

60
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
is worthless in the business world.

61
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,600
Have you forgotten?

62
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,330
That's what you used to tell me.

63
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,040
Fine.

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,840
Let me make this clear.

65
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,840
If you dare hurt Lin Anduo,

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,920
I'll kill you.

67
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,840
It seems I've found

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,480
your weakness.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,800
Mr. Lu.

70
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,400
You wanted to see me?

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,640
The deal with Long Baiqi

72
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,920
is complete.

73
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,720
You know about it.

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,020
Using my intelligence

75
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,720
to pay for your mother's hospital bills.

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,800
This deal

77
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,080
is worth it.

78
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,640
Lu.

79
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,320
At that time,

80
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,440
when my mother was sick

81
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,040
at the hospital,

82
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
I happened to meet Long Baiqi.

83
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,560
From Jindu Group.

84
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,680
You know me?

85
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,440
You look familiar.

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,200
I asked a friend about it.

87
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,520
Your mother's illness

88
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,490
requires quite expensive treatment.

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,320
Here's 200,000.

90
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,680
Mr. Long,

91
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,260
I can't accept this money.

92
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,290
I'll find a way to handle it myself.

93
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,800
Take it first.

94
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,530
Your mother's treatment is the priority.

95
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,400
How is

96
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,660
Chairman Lu Heguang of your group doing?

97
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,600
I heard he's still in the ICU

98
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,200
receiving emergency treatment.

99
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,159
And Mr. Lu

100
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,050
has rushed back from overseas.

101
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,880
Lu Ye.

102
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,480
From now on,

103
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
all information about Jindu Group,

104
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
including Lu Ye's next moves,

105
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,040
you must report to me immediately.

106
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,840
Ms. Long,

107
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,040
perhaps we should...

108
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,720
Xiaoxue.

109
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,440
I've paid for your mother's

110
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,680
follow-up treatment costs.

111
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,210
If you have any emergencies

112
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,980
in the future, tell me.

113
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,560
I'll return the money to Long Baiqi right now.

114
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,720
No need.

115
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,600
Her money

116
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,010
is there for the taking.

117
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,120
Besides,

118
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,880
the information you sold her.

119
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,610
It's not really useful anyway.

120
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
I've known about

121
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,720
the relationship between you two from the beginning.

122
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,090
I asked you to come today

123
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,980
because I feel that lately

124
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,220
we've been getting along quite well.

125
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,980
You're also very capable.

126
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,280
If

127
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,159
you're willing to help me,

128
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,120
I'll let bygones

129
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,880
be bygones.

130
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,720
Mr. Lu,

131
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
please go ahead.

132
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,360
As long as I can do it.

133
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,600
Good.

134
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,760
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

135
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,960
Before we start,

136
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,210
let me introduce you to an old partner.

137
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,160
How touching!

138
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,440
You fat bastard,

139
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,040
didn't you quit your job?

140
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,280
I didn't expect you'd get promoted.

141
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,680
You scared my tears right back in.

142
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,320
Okay.

143
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,400
Let's not talk about what happened before.

144
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,460
We're like the three musketeers now.

145
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,210
The new company's project,

146
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,920
I'm entrusting it to you two.

147
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,800
No problem.

148
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
Best partners.

149
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,840
Cheers.

150
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,520
What are we going to do next?

151
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,400
Come on.

152
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,520
First.

153
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,120
This...

154
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,159
This is quite a risky move.

155
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,040
Will it work?

156
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,720
What we need to do now

157
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,080
is to fight back with everything we've got.

158
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,420
Fight back with all we've got.

159
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,440
Don't say anything.

160
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,240
Let's do it.

161
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,440
I'm driving.

162
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,840
He's driving.

163
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,380
Keep drinking.

164
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,799
Drink up.

165
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,840
Cheers.

166
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,049
What are you looking at?

167
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,520
Come on.

168
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,520
Here.

169
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Let's have a drink.
