1
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,480
I'm sorry,

2
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,760
the number you've dialed is temporarily unavailable.

3
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,120
Tomorrow's competition

4
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,160
will be divided into multiple groups running simultaneously.

5
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,120
Then each group

6
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,720
will be accompanied by a teaching assistant.

7
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,920
The children will draw on-site,

8
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,380
and judges will score their work afterward.

9
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,160
Please fill in

10
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,720
the child's name and age

11
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,850
and the name of the kindergarten here.

12
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
Is that okay?

13
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
Yes, that's fine.

14
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,600
Is there anything else I should be aware of?

15
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,250
Just make sure you don't miss the time.

16
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,120
And have your child bring their art supplies tomorrow,

17
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,520
like paper and brushes.

18
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,440
Don't worry.

19
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,720
Thank you.

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,480
No problem.

21
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,720
Sorry,

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,000
the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

23
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,840
Let me tell you all,

24
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:47,760
this trip really opened my eyes.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,760
The scene, the grandeur,

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,220
it's not something folks from our village get to see every day.

27
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,360
Tell us more,

28
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,240
come on!

29
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,170
You want to hear?

30
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,120
Yes!

31
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,240
Of course!

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,640
The grand banquet hall was magnificent.

33
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
The lights,

34
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,520
so bright you could barely keep your eyes open.

35
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,060
And those waitresses,

36
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,960
fair-skinned beauties with long legs,

37
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,720
dressed like those foreign girls we see on TV.

38
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,720
There was also an auction at the banquet.

39
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,760
Do you know what an auction is?

40
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,480
Famous paintings and calligraphy,

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,410
precious jewelry and such things,

42
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,680
the bids were frighteningly high.

43
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,720
All in the millions,

44
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,800
supposedly to donate to children in poor mountain areas.

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,440
I was thinking,

46
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,620
I couldn't just go there for nothing.

47
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,000
So I donated 200 yuan as well.

48
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,320
Old Li, you have such high standards.

49
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,280
That's why we sent you there.

50
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,240
By the way,

51
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,520
did you hand out all the tea you brought?

52
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,920
How did the promotion go?

53
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,720
Of course I handed it all out.

54
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
Whether I knew them or not,

55
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,780
I gave one package to each person.

56
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,040
I told them,

57
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,800
this tea

58
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,000
is from our Nanshui Village,

59
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,000
you can't find it anywhere else.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,330
Something's happened!

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,680
Something's wrong!

62
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,480
Slow down.

63
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,450
What's going on?

64
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,280
Don't panic.

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,320
Who is this?

66
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,740
Isn't this the director who was filming in our village?

67
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,780
How can he be from Jindu Group?

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,440
It's all been reported in the news,

69
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,560
it can't be fake.

70
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,090
What's going on?

71
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,920
Mr. Li.

72
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,320
Anduo, where are you?

73
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,880
Just finished filling out registration forms for the kids.

74
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,600
Is that guy Luye with you?

75
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,440
No.

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,840
Listen to me.

77
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,159
We've all been deceived.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,520
That guy Luye works for Jindu Group.

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,480
Hold on.

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,200
I'm sending you a news article. Take a look quickly.

81
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,330
I need to hang up now.

82
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,480
Okay.

83
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,680
Yes, yes, yes.

84
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,330
Why didn't you answer my calls?

85
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,760
Are you mad?

86
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,720
Yesterday's project meeting

87
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
ran too late, so I couldn't make it.

88
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,920
Mr. Lu must be extremely busy.

89
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,120
What's with the 'Mr. Lu' talk?

90
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,880
Why are you being so sarcastic?

91
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
We've been bothering you these past few days

92
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,120
and almost interfered with your important business.

93
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,580
Why are you talking like this?

94
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,780
Was last night's entertainment enjoyable?

95
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,320
What entertainment?

96
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,360
It's not what you think with Anduo.

97
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,890
This is your personal life.

98
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,660
You don't need to explain anything to me.

99
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,440
Mr. Lu.

100
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,520
Don't go.

101
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,640
Don't touch me.

102
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,000
Why did you lie to me?

103
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,920
Lying to everyone in the village.

104
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,600
Claiming to be some director.

105
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,760
Your real purpose for coming to the village

106
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,360
was just to use us, wasn't it?

107
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,720
Don't bully Teacher Anduo.

108
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,840
Say something.

109
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,680
Why are you so angry?

110
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,920
What is it?

111
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,420
What's the matter?

112
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,760
I was about to ask you the same thing.

113
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,890
Did you see the news?

114
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,800
You just came back from abroad

115
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,560
and caused such a big scandal.

116
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
How could this happen?

117
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,920
He's being completely outrageous,

118
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,450
hanging up on you like that.

119
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,240
This means it's working.

120
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,060
You've handled this matter well.

121
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,320
That female model

122
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,960
is a guest invited by the company.

123
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,920
His personal behavior

124
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,780
has already caused negative impact on the company.

125
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,020
Let's see how he explains this to the shareholders.

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,800
Exactly.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,480
Let him struggle to save himself first.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,800
Does Long Baiqi know about this?

129
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,880
Yesterday I timed it perfectly

130
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,340
so Long Baiqi could see everything clearly.

131
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,480
Good. Now

132
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,120
send this news to her again.

133
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,780
If we're going to burn him,

134
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,480
let's make it burn harder.

135
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,040
Understood.

136
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,120
Mr. Long,

137
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,320
here's an urgent document

138
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,850
that needs your attention.

139
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,720
Get out!

140
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,120
Get lost!

141
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
You disgusting men are all the same.

142
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,240
Xiaoxue.

143
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,240
Boss.

144
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,120
Find all the dirt on this model

145
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
immediately.

146
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,000
You know what to do without me telling you, right?

147
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,860
Understood. I'll get right on it.

148
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,120
For future major exposés like this,

149
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,850
you could notify me in advance.

150
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,560
So I can have our PR department

151
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,250
guide the public opinion beforehand.

152
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,600
It's so obvious

153
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,000
someone is setting me up.

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,200
None of this matters.

155
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,320
What matters is

156
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,120
your reputation within the company will be damaged.

157
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,400
My reputation doesn't matter.

158
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,680
The most urgent issue now

159
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,180
is our agreement with Long Baiqi.

160
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,040
One month will pass quickly.

161
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,280
That's just the first issue.

162
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,680
Second, the company's focus

163
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,320
is shifting toward

164
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,360
the new project with Long Chuan Group.

165
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,880
So...

166
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,280
I'll handle this matter,

167
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,040
but I need time.

168
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,090
Time is running out.

169
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,920
Make your decision soon.

170
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,600
Here come the boys!

171
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,200
Let's drink! You've had a tough couple of days.

172
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,560
Have some food.

173
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,320
Eat up.

174
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,610
Let me tell you guys.

175
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,400
Back in my day.

176
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,600
Guys like this.

177
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,000
I could take on ten of them by myself.

178
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,320
Big brother, you're awesome!

179
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,570
Let's toast to our big brother.

180
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,560
Brother.

181
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,120
You're on Boss Qian's list now.

182
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,260
You think you can fucking escape?

183
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Think fast.

184
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,280
Do you have any relatives or friends?

185
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,240
Call them now.

186
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,780
The sooner you pay, the sooner you leave.

187
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,380
I don't have any money.

188
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,120
And you've only got one life.

189
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,320
Don't worry.

190
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,380
