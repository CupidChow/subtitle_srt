1
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,840
This is interesting.

2
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,320
Let's go.

3
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,800
Our ancestors

4
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,120
cultivated these

5
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,880
thousands of acres of tea gardens with their bare hands.

6
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,720
How can we give them up

7
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,960
just for some quick profit?

8
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,759
Anduo is right.

9
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,600
We shouldn't trust them.

10
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,880
Once we sign,

11
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,640
we'll lose everything.

12
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,420
That's exactly what she said.

13
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,040
In my opinion,

14
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,040
she's the real leader of these villagers.

15
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,500
We need to deal with her first.

16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
Take her down.

17
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:09,960
Agency.

18
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,360
Fix it.

19
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,120
How are you going to handle this?

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,480
Throwing money at it won't work.

21
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,600
That's where you're wrong.

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,240
What's your plan?

23
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,200
What do women desire most?

24
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,680
They want designer bags.

25
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,000
Love.

26
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,440
Women in love are most easily misled.

27
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,880
What?

28
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,920
Why are you looking at me?

29
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,000
I have a foolproof plan.

30
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,130
Director Lu.

31
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,120
It requires sacrificing your good looks.

32
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,250
How about you pursue Lin Anduo?

33
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,440
Stop it. What kind of ridiculous idea is this?

34
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,360
It will definitely work.

35
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,960
Look.

36
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,200
You see.

37
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,820
First, seduce her with your handsome looks.

38
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,960
Then we follow up with the next step.

39
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,880
The hero saves damsel in distress routine.

40
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,320
Once this works,

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,329
our mission will be accomplished.

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,280
Just like that?

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,210
Director Lu.

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,100
You need to believe in your charm.

45
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,040
Besides,

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,520
we'll be your support.

47
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,890
This round will definitely be a comeback.

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,520
This plan will succeed.

49
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,960
Definitely.

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,400
Hi.

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,320
Hi.

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,079
Hi.

53
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,840
What do you want from me?

54
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,680
I...

55
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,320
We're going to visit that town today.

56
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
But we're not familiar with the way.

57
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,680
Would you be our guide?

58
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,800
Do you have time?

59
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,480
Sure.

60
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,560
Really?

61
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,360
I'll go change my clothes.

62
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,520
Great.

63
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,720
Go ahead.

64
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,320
Wait for me a moment.

65
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,400
You.

66
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,330
You look so much like yourself.

67
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,760
How do I look like myself?

68
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,480
Tear it down.

69
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,600
Smash it over here.

70
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,920
I didn't expect your village

71
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,040
to have such beautiful night scenery.

72
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,960
Of course.

73
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,900
What are you doing?

74
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,400
Cut the crap.

75
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,300
If you don't pay up, we'll smash everything.

76
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,040
Smash it!

77
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,520
Smash!

78
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,500
Everyone stop!

79
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,130
Leave this to me.

80
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,200
Who the hell do you think you are?

81
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,650
The plot is quite well-developed.

82
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,080
Talk to me.

83
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,160
Stop with all the cursing.

84
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,600
I'm your boss.

85
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
You're tired of living, aren't you?

86
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,680
What are you standing there for?

87
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,480
Get him!

88
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,120
Damn!

89
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,840
You guys are serious?

90
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
Attack!
