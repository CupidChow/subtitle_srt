1
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,260
Stop fighting.

2
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,120
Stop it.

3
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,240
Oh no.

4
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
It's Director Lu.

5
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,360
Watch me.

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,920
I'll win them over with virtue.

7
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,800
Go get them!

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,320
Back off!

9
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Stop! Get back!

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,600
Fight!

11
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,000
Wait a second!

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,440
You!

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,480
Get them!

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,720
Hurry!

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,500
Don't just stand there! Help!

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,640
Get away!

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,720
Run!

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,160
Get lost!

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,480
Don't run! Stop!

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,360
Scared you!

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,720
Are you okay?

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,600
I'm fine.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,200
Come back!

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,680
Bear with it.

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,479
It hurts a bit.

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,120
Director Lu and his team are from Xinsheng Pawn Company,

27
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,160
which is under Mr. Qian's corporation.

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,960
Mr. Qian?

29
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,160
Qian Xinfa?

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,960
Yes.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,320
How do you know them?

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,600
I...

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,600
I run a kindergarten.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,610
It's been losing money.

35
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,760
I...

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,200
I borrowed money online.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,200
If it's losing money,

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,740
why do you keep running it?

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,680
If I don't take over this kindergarten,

40
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,690
the children in the village

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,280
won't be able to continue their preschool education.

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,079
I...

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,400
In my opinion,

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,800
these children

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,460
are the future of Nanshui Village

46
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,320
and its hope.

47
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,880
I

48
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,090
I'm pretty silly, aren't I?

49
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
You know what?

50
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,800
My biggest wish

51
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,920
is to build a school in the village.

52
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,120
When these children grow up,

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,480
they have to go to schools far away from home.

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,000
Those from poor families

55
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,040
might simply stop going to school altogether.

56
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,100
A village without a school

57
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,320
is like a family without children,

58
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,360
it has no future.

59
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,300
What about you?

60
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,200
Why have you never talked about your family?

61
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,040
When I was 15,

62
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,860
my mother passed away.

63
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,040
My father,

64
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,650
he was busy with work

65
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,010
and rarely looked after me.

66
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,770
He only knew how to set goals for me.

67
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,120
He

68
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,380
is someone who only cares about results.

69
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,200
When I'm with him,

70
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,180
I feel like just a tool.

71
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,880
Later,

72
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,159
to get away from him,

73
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,400
I went abroad on my own.

74
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,180
You're better off than me,

75
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,020
at least your father is still around.

76
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,960
My father,

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,240
it makes little difference whether he's there or not.

78
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,000
He's never given me any help.

79
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,580
Whatever problems I face,

80
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,690
he makes me solve them on my own.

81
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,760
We rarely communicate.

82
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,780
He doesn't even know what grade I'm in

83
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,800
or when my birthday is.

84
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,610
We're quite similar, you and I.

85
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,050
Happy birthday.

86
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,880
Thank you.

87
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,380
How did you know I was here?

88
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,240
That was easy.

89
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,640
Just needed to spend some money.

90
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,360
Go ahead.

91
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,210
What do you want from me?

92
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,380
I want to ask you

93
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,140
to do me a favor.

94
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,480
Hello.

95
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,810
Who are you looking for?

96
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,680
Where is your boss's office?

97
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,360
May I ask your name, please?

98
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,890
Do you have an appointment?

99
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,610
Here we go again.

100
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,960
Call Qian Xinfa.

101
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,880
Tell him Lu Ye is here to see him.

102
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,540
One moment, let me make a call.

103
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
There's someone here looking for Mr. Qian.

104
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,380
Says his name is Master Lu.

105
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Ye.

106
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,810
Ye as in 'maybe.'

107
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,940
Not 'master,' but 'ye' as in 'maybe.'

108
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,130
Ye as in 'maybe.'

109
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,600
Right, not 'master.'

110
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,520
Okay.

111
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,760
Hello, Mr. Lu.

112
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,880
Mr. Qian is waiting for you inside.

113
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,080
Let me take you to him.

114
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
This way, please.

115
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,890
Mr. Qian is in that room.

116
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,360
Come in.

117
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,240
Mr. Lu.

118
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,500
Sorry for not greeting you properly.

119
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,600
What brings you

120
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,520
to my office today?

121
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,300
An ill wind.

122
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,560
You're

123
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,040
just joking with me.

124
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,520
What did you want to see me about?

125
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,240
Mr. Lu,

126
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,640
here are two documents

127
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,100
that need your signature.

128
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,760
Get out.

129
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,360
Mr. Lu,

130
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,640
it's urgent.

131
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
I'll handle this.

132
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,080
You don't need to worry about it.

133
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,410
Everyone come to me.

134
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,720
Everyone.

135
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,520
I just told you to get out.

136
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,360
Didn't you hear me?

137
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,560
Get out!

138
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,360
Yes.

139
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,240
Mr. Qian.

140
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,490
You wanted to see us?

141
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,840
Who's this?

142
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,520
Who is he?

143
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
Nephew.

144
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,600
We meet again.

145
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,440
You...

146
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,130
What are you doing here?

147
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,080
Mr. Lu.

148
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,720
He's my best friend.

149
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,060
How do you want to handle this?

150
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,050
This... this...

151
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,360
No, Mr. Lu.

152
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,130
That day I...

153
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,520
I really didn't know you were in Nanshui Village.

154
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,480
I truly had no idea.

155
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,280
She... she...

156
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,800
She's your person?

157
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,200
Mr. Lu.

158
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,880
No, no, no.

159
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,880
Sir.

160
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,640
Please be magnanimous and forgive our mistakes.

161
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,040
Don't hold it against us.

162
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,440
I was wrong. I truly know I was wrong.

163
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,690
Is this acceptable?

164
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,640
I was blind.

165
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
I didn't know my place.

166
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,840
I was blind.

167
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,240
How much does she owe you?

168
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,280
This... I don't...

169
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,160
Stop stalling.

170
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,290
Mr. Lu is asking you.

171
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,480
100,000.

172
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,850
I have 200,000 here.

173
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,360
This... this...

174
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,760
I don't dare take it.

175
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,800
Mr. Lu, you're embarrassing me.

176
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,820
I don't like owing favors.

177
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,920
If I need anything in the future,

178
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,850
I'll come to you.

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,560
Thank you.

180
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,480
Just say the word if you need anything.

181
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Thank you, Mr. Lu.
