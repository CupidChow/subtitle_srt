1
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,920
Forget it.

[Mute Alarm] [Waveform] [Record] [Blood Pressure] [Main Menu]

3
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,120
Doctor!

4
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,680
Doctor!

5
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,180
We did our best.

6
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,320
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,600
Mom!

8
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,640
Mom!

9
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,880
Mom!

10
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,040
Mom!

11
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,520
Where is your father?

12
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,450
We need a family member to sign.

13
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,960
The child's father is abroad.

14
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,120
What should we do?

15
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,080
I'll sign it.

16
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,120
Sign here.

17
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,880
Mom!

18
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,000
Mom!

19
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,280
No!

20
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,360
Mom!

21
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,640
Mom!

22
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,320
Okay.

23
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,160
Mr. Zhao.

24
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,890
I will definitely handle this.

25
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,200
Good.

26
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,960
I'll resolve it personally.

27
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,520
Dad!

28
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,040
I will definitely.

29
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,960
Don't worry.

30
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,820
Just calm down.

31
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,920
I'll take care of it right away.

32
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,360
Right away, right away.

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,200
I'll do it today.

34
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,560
Good.

35
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,840
Immediately.

36
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,040
Doctor,

37
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,760
how is it?

38
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,320
The patient is still in critical condition.

39
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,180
They need continued monitoring.

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,120
For the resort project,

41
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,720
I'm giving you three more days.

42
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,519
Compete fairly.

43
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,810
Use whatever methods you have.

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,720
We only care about results.

45
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,050
Whoever has the ability should handle it.

46
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,120
Everyone,

47
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,940
does anyone have any objections?

48
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,720
I have no objections.

49
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
I don't have any objections either.

50
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,560
This is Yaoyao's.

51
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,480
This is Chenxi's.

52
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,520
This is Pipi's.

53
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,280
Ms. Anduo.

54
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,280
Now that the competition is over,

55
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,080
are we going back home?

56
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,400
Yes,

57
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,800
we're leaving tomorrow.

58
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,360
Ta-da!

59
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,960
Look what I have here -

60
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,040
certificates!

61
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,160
You all did amazing.

62
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,920
Everyone performed exceptionally well.

63
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,800
I'm really proud of all of you.

64
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,180
By the way, Yaoyao,

65
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,920
why did you paint the spaceship

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,280
all green?

67
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,560
Uncle Lu Ye told me

68
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,200
to use green.

69
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,560
Green represents life and hope,

70
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,440
just like our tea garden.

71
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,760
Fine.

72
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,160
But don't mention him again.

73
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,800
Jindu Group

74
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,960
Ms. Anduo

75
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,000
What's wrong?

76
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,520
Nothing.

77
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,560
Go ahead and eat.

78
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,240
Okay.

79
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,120
I eat faster than you.

80
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,720
Why did he stop here?

81
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,320
Don't worry,

82
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,600
I'm a man of my word.

83
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,000
Give me three more days and a car.

84
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,760
I'll trust you one last time.

85
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,360
I expect to see it in the news.

86
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,440
Damn it!

87
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,780
They're splitting up.

88
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,880
I'll follow Lu Yi,

89
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,280
you follow that guy.

90
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,000
Hello.

91
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,880
Hello.

92
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,760
I'm Lu Yi from Jindu Group.

93
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,600
We've met before.

94
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
What do you want?

95
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,720
I wanted to talk to you

96
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,560
about investing in Nanshui Village

97
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,020
to build a charity school.

98
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,780
Investing in a school?

99
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,120
Yes.

100
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,740
Let's discuss the details in person.

101
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,120
It's you.

102
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,240
I'm Lu Yi, Lu Ye's cousin.

103
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,360
We met before at the charity dinner.

104
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,010
What do you mean about establishing a school?

105
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,120
Yes.

106
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,600
I have a proposal.

107
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,120
It can not only protect the tea gardens in Nanshui Village,

108
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,960
but also boost

109
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,480
the economic development of Nanshui Village.

110
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,520
This proposal

111
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,799
includes funding for Nanshui Village

112
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,929
to establish a public welfare school.

113
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,039
Why don't

114
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,169
we go inside to talk?

115
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,679
Miss Lai Anduo.

116
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,240
My proposal

117
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,160
is based on the tea mountains

118
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,620
to develop rural tourism.

119
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,160
Without damaging Nanshui Village's

120
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,720
existing environment,

121
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,960
villagers can not only profit

122
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,160
from the tea gardens,

123
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,280
but also increase their income

124
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,680
through accommodation, dining,

125
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,800
and selling specialty agricultural products.

126
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,640
However,

127
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,100
Lu Ye rejected my proposal

128
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,960
for his own profit.

129
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,040
So I advise you

130
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,090
not to believe what he says.

131
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,650
Because everything he does

132
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,000
is to trick you

133
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,660
into signing this agreement.

134
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,480
The development project of Nanshui Village

135
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,680
cannot be suspended.

136
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,920
As it stands now,

137
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,760
only my proposal

138
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,890
is more suitable for Nanshui Village.

139
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,040
Miss Anduo.

140
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,720
Miss Anduo.

141
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,040
The four commanderies of Huihe are actually controlled by the Di people.
