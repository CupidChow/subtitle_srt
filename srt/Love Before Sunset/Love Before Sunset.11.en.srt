1
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,800
Great.

2
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,840
Here's to a successful partnership.

3
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,970
Looking forward to working together.

4
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,400
Then tomorrow, come to our company

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,460
to draft our cooperation agreement.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,400
You're from Jindu Group?

7
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,360
You are...

8
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,700
A villager from Nanshui Village.

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,440
A villager?

10
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,480
Your Jindu Group

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,320
has been developing a tourism project

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,360
in our Nanshui Village

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,640
that has destroyed

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,100
the ecological environment of our village.

15
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,600
What's going on here?

16
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:23,960
Miss,

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,280
thank you for your concern about our Jindu Group.

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,080
Please allow me to clarify.

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,400
Our group's tourism development...

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,200
It's being conducted to promote

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,759
rural economy and environmental protection

22
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,820
as prerequisites.

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,600
If you have any concerns,

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,520
I sincerely invite you and your villagers

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,440
to participate in our project design

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,560
and discussions.

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,479
To supervise and guide us

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,880
on how to better develop and construct.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,360
Miss,

30
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,320
you just said you're from Nanshui Village.

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,160
May I ask how you got in here

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,280
and if you're qualified to attend?

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,360
How did you obtain

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,280
the invitation to this charity dinner?

35
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,840
I.

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,520
What are you doing with that tea?

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,060
Don't tell me you're here to sell something.

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,210
It's none of your business.

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,200
All the guests here today

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,880
are charitable people with big hearts.

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,320
At a charity dinner like this,

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,120
trying to sell your own products

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,120
seems rather inappropriate, don't you think?

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,640
Enough.

45
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,680
Ye.

46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,400
Duoduo.

47
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,440
Let's go.

48
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,060
What did you say to him just now

49
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,000
that made him so nervous?

50
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
I didn't say anything.

51
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,480
Maybe it's because

52
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,000
this outfit I'm wearing has such a strong presence

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,079
that I scared him just by standing there.

54
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,760
Hmph.

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,440
As if.

56
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,850
Did you two know each other before?

57
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,480
I previously

58
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,000
shot a promotional video for Jindu Group.

59
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,400
And they

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,130
owe me a large sum of money that they haven't paid.

61
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,160
He's probably afraid I might

62
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
bring this up

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,200
in front of everyone and embarrass their company.

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,930
Then you should ask them for it.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,720
People from Jindu Group

66
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,140
really aren't good people after all.

67
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,120
It's not that absolute.

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,180
But today was pretty perfect.

69
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,800
We successfully fooled everyone.

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,200
We defended our Nanshui Village's dignity

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,460
in front of all those Jindu Group people.

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,000
Duoduo.

73
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,880
Actually, I...

74
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,250
That place is so beautiful.

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,000
Do you know?

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,680
Promoting Nanshui tea

77
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,400
is our entire village's greatest wish.

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,240
Today

79
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,680
we've bravely taken the first step.

80
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,770
So what are you planning to do next?

81
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,800
Next,

82
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,320
I want to focus on young people's tastes

83
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,159
and develop some innovative unique products.

84
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,600
Like milk tea, fruit tea,

85
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,159
herbal tea and such.

86
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,640
Both healthy and trendy

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
fast-moving tea beverages.

88
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,800
We can also make

89
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,360
portable tea bags.

90
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,050
Or open a tea experience shop directly

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,160
where people can mix drinks to their own taste.

92
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,800
That's a great idea.

93
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,410
Why don't you do it then?

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,120
You're a director,

95
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,280
you should know

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,920
turning ideas into reality

97
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,440
requires a team

98
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,040
and financial backing.

99
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,160
Otherwise many ideas

100
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,360
remain just ideas.

101
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,540
What were you about to say?

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,800
Nothing.

103
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go.

104
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,330
Let's head home.

105
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,680
Excuse me,

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,940
let me through please.

107
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,560
Brother.

108
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Sorry, excuse me.

109
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,240
The reception is over.

110
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,600
They're cleaning up inside.

111
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Please leave now.

112
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,340
Well...

113
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,730
With you, I'm always too late for everything.

114
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,930
Blame me if the car was slow.

115
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,280
Mr. Lu still not answering?

116
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,500
Couldn't get through.

117
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,400
Director Lu.

118
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,570
Director Lu.

119
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,200
We have an urgent matter to report to you,

120
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,440
extremely urgent.

121
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,160
I'll send you my location, come find me.

122
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,620
Alright, we're on our way.

123
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,770
Let's go.

124
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Director Lu.

125
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,600
What's wrong?

126
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,480
Are you okay?

127
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,360
Have a seat.

128
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm fine. What happened?

129
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,400
Found this in your room.

130
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,640
Who did this?

131
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,440
The guy from room 103.

132
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,640
Right after you left,

133
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,930
he left the village.

134
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,320
I see.

135
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,800
You all

136
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,800
put it back exactly as it was.

137
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,480
Now they're hidden while we're exposed.

138
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,610
We need to stay alert

139
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,080
and lure the snake out of its hole,

140
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,000
then follow the trail to catch them all.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,280
Great idea!

142
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,210
Let's turn their plan against them

143
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,860
and catch them all at once.

144
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,040
I wish you success.

145
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,930
Let's go.

146
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,640
Okay.

147
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,320
I brought you

148
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,170
two pounds of fresh tea from Nanshui Village.

149
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,360
Don't you often have excess liver heat?

150
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,640
You should drink more of this

151
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,100
to reduce your liver heat.

152
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,280
Really?

153
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,680
Then I must try it

154
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,720
to see if it really reduces liver heat.

155
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,480
Young man.

156
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,080
You made this move rather hastily.

157
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,200
The outcome

158
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,360
will be clear soon.

159
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,760
Good move.

160
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,500
The game is still long.

161
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,120
It's too early

162
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,880
to declare a winner now.

163
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,480
You young people

164
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,720
are always too confident.

165
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,780
Sometimes your moves are too aggressive

166
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,440
and leave vulnerabilities. Look here.

167
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,120
Well,

168
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,800
when did you leave me this opening?

169
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,800
It's an opportunity.

170
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,530
It depends if you

171
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,040
are willing to take it.

172
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,880
In a match between masters,

173
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,200
victory is determined in an instant.

174
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,940
Sometimes what appears to be an opportunity

175
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,520
is actually a trap.

176
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,380
Come to my company.

177
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,560
I need to discuss something with you.

178
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,120
Okay.

179
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,300
You've finally reached out to me.

180
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,330
Seems you've already placed someone by his side.

181
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,000
What you're showing me means...

182
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,720
I think it's time.

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What's your plan?

184
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,320
You'll replace Lu Ye.

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,920
Take the project from him.

186
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,740
Undermine his authority.

187
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,680
But it's a bit difficult now.

188
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,360
The board has already agreed

189
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,840
to give him one month.

190
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,480
We can't replace him before the deadline.

191
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,960
Besides, haven't we already signed

192
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,400
the cooperation agreement?

193
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,930
