1
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,530
Director Lu.

2
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,560
Here's the information about Nanshui Village.

3
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,040
The village currently has 501 households.

4
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,280
The per capita income is about 10,000 yuan.

5
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,960
Currently,

6
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,920
90% of the villagers' main income

7
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,280
comes from tea cultivation.

8
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,680
They have over 3,000 mu of tea plantations.

9
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,640
Our plan for this time,

10
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,600
I'm sure you all understand it.

11
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,960
We need to create a viral hit.

12
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,520
I can't hold on anymore.

13
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,720
Yes.

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,280
How's the accommodation?

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,400
There are a couple of farmhouses in the village.

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,560
The conditions aren't as good as in the city.

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,039
If you're not comfortable staying there...

19
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:35,400
No problem. Work comes first.

20
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,280
Car!

21
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,640
Keep playing your games.

22
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,700
I'll be right back.

23
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,600
Okay.

24
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,329
How are you driving?

25
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,440
You fat idiot, always staring at pretty women.

26
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,450
I don't know what happened, it just got stuck.

27
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
What's going on?

28
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,960
Hurry!

29
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,440
Snake!

30
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,360
I'll bite it.

31
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,640
Everyone has seen the financial report for the first half of the year, right?

32
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,370
Yes, we have.

33
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,360
Everyone,

34
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,560
If we don't come up with strategies soon

35
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
we won't last more than a few months.

36
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,130
I believe the three consecutive days of stock price decline

37
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,840
is due to problems with

38
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,280
the golf course resort project.

39
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,680
If necessary, we should consider postponing this project

40
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,080
and redirect those funds

41
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,680
to support other more urgent projects.

42
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,120
Otherwise,

43
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,640
Jindu Group

44
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,159
will face the risk of massive layoffs.

45
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,000
I disagree with suspending this project.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,200
The decision to develop the resort

47
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,800
was made to expand our group's industries

48
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,240
and implement our key strategy for diversified revenue.

49
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,560
But we can't afford to

50
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,680
risk the entire Jindu Group for this project.

51
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:58,960
You!

52
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,170
What did I...

53
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,320
Yes, that's right.

54
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,600
Give me one month.

55
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,880
One month.

56
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,000
Chairman.

57
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,160
If...

58
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,880
If I can't turn

59
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,960
this project around,

60
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,840
I will resign

61
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,860
from my position as Chairman.

62
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,720
Chairman.

63
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,000
Chairman.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,080
Are you okay?

65
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Chairman.

66
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,480
If Chairman Lu saw you all

67
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,920
looking so dejected,

68
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,120
he'd probably jump out of his bed in anger.

69
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
Long Baiqi.

70
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,560
What's someone from Long Chuan Group doing here?

71
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,680
Come to laugh at us?

72
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,370
Please don't misunderstand, gentlemen.

73
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,320
I'm just here to visit Uncle Lu.

74
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,240
Xiaoqi.

75
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,280
Hello.

76
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,840
Since you took over Long Chuan Group,

77
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,500
you've made impressive progress these past few years. The young are truly formidable.

78
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,280
You're too kind, Mr. Lu.

79
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,960
My father always reminds me that

80
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,640
Jindu Group has always been the industry leader

81
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,840
and the benchmark that Long Chuan Group strives to catch up with.

82
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,880
As a junior or a competitor,

83
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,220
I should humbly seek your advice.

84
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,600
You're too polite.

85
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,320
I'm well aware of your current situation.

86
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,160
Right now, only I can save Jindu Group.

87
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,240
Tell me your conditions.

88
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,020
As expected of a businessman.

89
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,560
You know what I want.

90
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,240
Here comes Mr. Lu.

91
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,080
Mr. Lu.

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
Mr. Lu, would you please say something?

93
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,960
Mr. Lu, regarding your future business strategy,

94
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,040
do you have any plans?

95
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,320
You've rushed back from overseas.

96
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Does this mean...

97
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,240
Uncle.

98
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,680
Uncle.

99
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,280
Uncle.

100
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,200
Little Ye.

101
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,880
You came back without giving any notice.

102
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,800
I could have sent someone from the company to pick you up.

103
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,640
Uncle.

104
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,520
What kind of CEO are you?

105
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,920
How come you're not as informed

106
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,520
as those reporters outside?

107
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,320
Really?

108
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,200
How did they find out?

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,120
Who knows who leaked the information.

110
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,240
You know,

111
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,200
by the way.

112
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,820
Have you been to the hospital?

113
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,280
Yes, I have.

114
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,200
The doctor said he's out of danger now.

115
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,800
That's the best news

116
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,680
I've heard today.

117
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,120
Xiao Ye.

118
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
You have no idea

119
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,080
how busy I've been

120
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,810
while your father's been away.

121
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,200
Running around everywhere.

122
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,440
So many things waiting for me to handle.

123
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
The most difficult issue now

124
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,160
is the golf course resort

125
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,000
project.

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,730
If we shut it down immediately,

127
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,600
it might trigger a series of chain reactions.

128
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,160
I've looked into the project briefly.

129
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,920
If we stop it urgently,

130
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,680
we can hardly bear the negative impact.

131
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,160
So what do you think we should do?

132
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,760
If possible, take Xiao Yi with you

133
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,720
so he can learn from you.

134
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,440
About work,

135
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,600
let's not rush.

136
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,000
If you don't mind,

137
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,820
let me think about it more.

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,730
That's fine.

139
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,720
Now that you're back,

140
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,940
take some time to relax first.

141
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,900
We'll discuss this matter later.

142
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,940
Let's talk about it later.

143
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,440
Please prepare a file on Nanshui Village and send it to me.

144
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,960
Yes,

145
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,000
Ye.

146
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,400
You're finally back.

147
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,080
I've missed you so much these three years you've been abroad.

148
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,800
What's wrong?

149
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,960
Are you still hung up on what happened back then?

150
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,640
Back then?

151
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,090
What are you talking about?

152
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,880
You mean the Bright project?

153
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,560
I've always had a question about that project.

154
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,600
What tactics did Longchuan Group

155
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,040
use behind the scenes to win the bid?

156
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,200
If someone hadn't tipped off Long Baiqi,

157
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,600
how would she have known

158
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,280
our business operation model

159
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,440
and bidding price?

160
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,880
It is indeed suspicious.

161
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,480
We still haven't found out

162
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,080
who leaked the information.

163
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,140
It shouldn't be hard to investigate.

164
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,360
Why don't you take charge of this?

165
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,320
By the way.

166
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,360
I'll take over the golf resort project.

167
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,680
I'll settle things with the villagers within a month.

168
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,560
How much?

169
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,970
I guarantee it'll be clean and efficient.

170
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:50,880
Lu Ye

171
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,200
Lin Anduo

172
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,560
Lin Anduo

173
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:51,840
Lu Yi

174
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,160
Long Baiqi

175
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,760
Long Baiqi

176
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,480
Yuan Xiao

177
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:53,720
Yuan Xiao

178
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,120
Pang De

179
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,760
Park Ji-hwan

180
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,000
Fei Bi

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,720
Lu Heguang

182
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,360
Lu Tongchen

183
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:56,680
Mr. Li

184
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:56,960
Ma Zhong

185
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,280
Dr. Zhu

186
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,600
Long Baiqi's Assistant

187
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:57,920
Long Baiqi's Assistant

188
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,200
Lu Yi's Assistant

189
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,920
Old Lady in Red

190
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,160
Manager Sun

191
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,880
Director Shen

192
