1
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,320
There's only one month left.

2
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,520
It's coming up soon.

3
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,890
When the time comes,

4
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,440
you can continue to acquire

5
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,370
Jindu's shares.

6
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,690
I won't stop you.

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,980
You think I don't dare?

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,680
Mr. Lu,

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,040
if I don't want to spend

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,080
a penny to acquire a company,

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,920
what should I do?

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,490
Your shares in Longchuan Group

13
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,920
were set up by your father

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,180
in a separate company.

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,680
And you're the sole legal representative of that company, right?

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,480
That's right.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,800
First,

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,120
you borrow some shares

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,880
from your private company.

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,960
For example,

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,020
shares worth 20 million on paper.

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,020
With these shares as collateral,

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,720
you can apply in your own name

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,200
at any major bank

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,560
for a share pledge

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,210
and get a loan of 10 million.

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,039
And then?

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,920
So far,

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,400
do you understand?

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,880
Go on.

31
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,180
You'll have to pay for the lesson.

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,380
I never thought

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,320
you would use the method I taught you

34
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,680
to acquire our Jindu.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,760
Lu Ye,

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,800
business is like a battlefield. How do you still not understand that?

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,720
Back then with the Bright project,

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,160
you lost because you trusted others

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,440
too easily.

40
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Isn't that right?

41
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,880
Don't forget you still promised me something.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,130
That'll have to wait until you beat me.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,760
Alright, alright.

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,360
You've had too much to drink.

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,680
What?

46
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
You care about me?

47
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,920
You care about me, Lu Ye.

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,200
Waiter.

49
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,840
Hello.

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,200
Please get this lady

51
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,920
a designated driver

52
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,160
to take her home safely.

53
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,820
Certainly.

54
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,800
Lu Ye.

55
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,280
Is your mind

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,080
filled only with that Lin Anduo?

57
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,040
I've met her.

58
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,770
She's nothing special.

59
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,160
I really don't know what you see in her.

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,240
I'm warning you.

61
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,050
Don't mess with her.

62
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,520
You, Lu Ye.

63
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,740
Ladies and gentlemen.

64
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,040
Please gather around.

65
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,440
Next,

66
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,280
Mr. Lu from Jindu Group

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,480
will say a few words.

68
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,079
Good.

69
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,880
Mr. Lu.

70
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,880
Don't rush.

71
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
Dear villagers of Nanshui Village.

72
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,800
I've come here today

73
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,920
specifically to introduce

74
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,440
our upcoming rural development plan.

75
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,840
This includes

76
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,980
compensation matters for the tea plantation land.

77
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,080
Compensation.

78
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,320
According to our development plan,

79
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,000
we will be using a portion of the tea gardens for development.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,800
Therefore,

81
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,019
for the benefit of all villagers,

82
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,560
we would like to offer the following proposal.

83
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,680
The tea garden area

84
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,360
multiplied by its economic value,

85
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,920
multiplied by double compensation,

86
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,320
will be provided as financial assistance.

87
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,360
To put it simply,

88
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,280
those who sign contracts with us,

89
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,200
with Jindu Group first,

90
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,960
will receive 50,000 yuan for work interruption

91
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,420
and relocation expenses.

92
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,159
50,000?

93
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,520
Read along with me.

94
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,610
Yaoyao, let me test you on how to read this.

95
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,280
Very good. Sit down.

96
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,200
Anduo.

97
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,400
Anduo.

98
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,080
Something's wrong! You need to go check.

99
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,320
People from Jindu Group are here.

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,880
They're persuading everyone to sign contracts.

101
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,560
So soon?

102
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,760
What are they saying?

103
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,240
They say it's for the future development of our village.

104
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,520
They want to use part of the tea gardens.

105
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,440
And they're offering compensation.

106
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,680
Alright, Uncle. I understand.

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,610
I'll go with you.

108
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,120
Children, play by yourselves.

109
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,360
I'll be back soon.

110
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,280
Be good, okay?

111
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,320
Uncle.

112
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,400
Have all the villagers signed?

113
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:29,960
Not yet.

114
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,520
I think they're still gathering information.

115
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,960
If they're going to sign, they need to understand the situation first.

116
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,840
Let's hurry over and see what's happening.

117
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,370
Let's go.

118
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,360
I promise here and now.

119
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,850
We can provide the compensation money

120
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
to the tea garden owners in advance.

121
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,520
And for villagers who lose their tea gardens,

122
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,960
we will provide employment resources

123
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,000
and entrepreneurship guidance.

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,240
So every villager can benefit.

125
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,680
That sounds pretty good.

126
00:05:59,159 --> 00:05:59,520
Here,

127
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,730
everyone take a look at this contract.

128
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,620
It's been signed by Miss Lin Anduo from our village.

129
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,160
She has already agreed

130
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,960
to transfer her tea garden to us.

131
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,240
Because she sees the hope,

132
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,120
she sees our Nanshui Village's

133
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,320
future development.

134
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,120
What's going on here?

135
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,840
How could Anduo have signed?

136
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,560
Yes,

137
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,960
she kept telling us not to sign,

138
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,620
but she signed first herself.

139
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,020
Don't you understand?

140
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,480
It's every man for himself.

141
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,520
Everyone looking out for their own interests.

142
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,640
When it comes to money,

143
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,500
actions speak louder than words.

144
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,040
So what should we do?

145
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,280
Should we sign or not?

146
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,600
If you think it's good, then sign.

147
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,480
Didn't he say

148
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
there's a 50,000 yuan bonus

149
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,120
for signing first?

150
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,200
That's right.

151
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,680
The first to sign

152
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,920
gets 50,000 yuan in compensation.

153
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,560
So it's first come, first served.

154
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,880
Miss this chance and it's gone.

155
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,400
Miss Lin Anduo has already signed.

156
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,000
What are you all waiting for?

157
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,200
I'll sign.

158
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,360
I'll sign too.

159
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,240
I'll sign too.

160
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,640
Wait!

161
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,460
Let me through.

162
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,360
Let me through.

163
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,960
Lin Anduo.

164
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,420
What are you doing?

165
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,020
Don't cause trouble here.

166
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,650
What's going on?

167
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,360
Everyone, please don't rush to sign.

168
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,040
That contract is fake.

169
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,560
It's fake.

170
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,480
I never signed any contract with you.

171
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,240
His contract

172
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,200
is forged.

173
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,960
Don't be deceived by him.

174
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,600
You

175
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,680
are going too far.

176
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,440
Miss Lin Anduo,

177
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,320
you put your fingerprint on this right in front of me.

178
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,650
If you don't believe me,

179
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,159
we can verify the fingerprints.

180
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,760
This contract

181
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,440
is legally binding.

182
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,400
I did meet with you,

183
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,080
but I never agreed to anything

184
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,080
and certainly never signed anything.

185
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,320
What's going on here?

186
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,360
That's right, I just signed.

187
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,280
What should I do?

188
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,400
The contract is invalid.

189
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:15,840
Right.

190
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,360
They're committing fraud.

191
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,160
Fraud.

192
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
Everyone, get your contracts back.

193
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,120
Mr. Lu, be careful!

194
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
A bunch of troublemakers!

195
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,880
Call the police!

196
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,480
Have them all arrested!

197
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,720
Everything that's happened lately

198
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,400
That's all.

199
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,090
So you're saying

200
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,520
Lu Ye hasn't been advancing the project

201
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,200
but instead has been dating this girl Lin Anduo?

202
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,880
Pretty much.

203
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,720
The reason Mr. Lu is desperately protecting Nanshui Village

204
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,120
is all because of this Lin Anduo.

205
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,360
A village girl?

206
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
How could she possibly attract him?

207
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,040
Lu Ye

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
must have some other motive.

209
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,600
Things I can't have

210
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,000
that remain

211
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,140
are just eyesores.

212
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,040
It seems

213
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,400
you've successfully pushed Lu Ye out.

214
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,820
Couldn't have done it without your help.

215
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,200
These are the documents on Nanshui Village.

216
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,720
They contain Lu Ye's preliminary

217
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,180
investigation findings about the village.

218
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,520
Seems you've planted

219
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,380
quite a few people in our company.

220
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,530
Those photos from last time

221
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,120
were taken by the same person, I assume?

222
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,090
It's just a necessary measure.

223
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,960
I need you to do something for me.

224
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,560
I need Lu Ye to

225
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,160
lose all his actual power in Jindu Group.

226
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,280
That's easy.

227
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Since I took over,

228
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,680
he's already been sidelined.

229
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,820
The things Lu Ye wants to protect most

230
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,170
are exactly what I want to destroy.

231
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,050
Don't worry about that.

232
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,400
I'll handle it personally.

233
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,160
These are Longchuan Group's

234
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,560
business documents and equity structure.

235
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,740
I had a hard time getting them.

236
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,960
Top secret.

237
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,920
By the way,

238
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,920
today the company received

239
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,400
a legal lawsuit against you.
