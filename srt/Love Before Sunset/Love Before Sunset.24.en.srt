1
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,210
What are you all being paid for?

2
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,900
You didn't even know Lu Ye stole our project.

3
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,400
How should I proceed

4
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,240
with the Longchuan Group partnership?

5
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,120
Lu Ye has stolen all our projects.

6
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,160
Answer me.

7
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,690
We can't proceed with the new project.

8
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,620
Don't we still have the golf resort project?

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,260
You're in charge of this project.

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,760
Tell everyone

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,380
how it's progressing.

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,240
Mr. Ma.

13
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,140
What are you implying?

14
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,770
I'm not implying anything.

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Now is not the time for mutual blame.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,780
Our priority is to keep Longchuan Group satisfied.

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,800
As long as they don't withdraw their investment now,

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,160
we still have hope.

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,840
I think our most urgent task

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,360
isn't to appease Longchuan Group,

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,680
but the direction of our company's development.

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,520
Right now,

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,650
I can't see any hope for the future.

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,479
That's right.

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,479
Our current market value

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,960
is almost at rock bottom.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,759
So,

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,820
I'm considering pulling out.

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,479
What are you guys talking about?

30
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,080
Mr. Ma,

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,560
whose side are you on?

32
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,759
If you don't look out for yourself, no one will.

33
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,200
At a time like this,

34
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,920
everyone should think about their own interests.

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,800
This is indeed

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,200
a way to save yourself.

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,720
You're kicking someone when they're down.

38
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,960
Don't worry.

39
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,600
I'm still here.

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,080
This is our company's internal board meeting.

41
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,410
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,600
Excuse me.

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,840
I've decided to increase my acquisition efforts.

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,960
As of 10 minutes ago,

45
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,620
I am now the largest shareholder of Jindu Group.

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,120
Tell me,

47
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,970
do I have the right to sit in this position?

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,280
According to the company bylaws,

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,040
I should now be

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,760
the shareholder with the largest stake in Jindu Group.

51
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,090
Less than 30% of company shares are available on the market.

52
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,000
Even if you acquired all of them,

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,880
your stake wouldn't be the largest.

54
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,920
What if you count both of ours?

55
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,280
Chairman,

56
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
you sold all of your shares

57
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,960
to Longchuan Group.

58
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,080
Yes.

59
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
From now on,

60
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,240
all Jindu Group's business

61
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
has nothing to do with me.

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,720
Lu Yi.

63
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,200
You can't sit in this position yet.

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,280
The shares I hold in Jindu Group

65
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,960
don't actually belong to me.

66
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,320
But to him.

67
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,280
Lu Ye.

68
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,960
Long Baiqi, explain yourself clearly.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,400
What exactly do you mean?

70
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,079
Uncle.

71
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,720
Let me tell you.

72
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,240
Jindu Group now

73
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,690
is nothing but a shell company.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,860
No matter how foolish Mr. Long is,

75
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,200
why would he spend a fortune

76
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,520
to acquire an empty shell company?

77
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,279
Wait.

78
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,760
In exchange,

79
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,420
you need to agree to one thing.

80
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,560
What is it?

81
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
Dare to make a bet?

82
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,920
Bet on what?

83
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,160
One month.

84
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,920
If you can revive Jindu Group,

85
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,720
you win.

86
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,000
If you lose,

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,540
not only will the company be mine,

88
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,240
but you will also belong to me.

89
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,159
What if

90
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't agree?

91
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,760
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

92
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,560
Jindu Group probably won't last a week.

93
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,159
Lu Ye,

94
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,100
you're shorting Jindu Group.

95
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,480
Yes.

96
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,300
What are you doing?

97
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,440
I want to beat you.

98
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,360
Don't we

99
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
still have a bet?

100
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,500
You still have a chance to win.

101
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,960
Jindu Group now exists in name only.

102
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,360
Most of its partner companies

103
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,200
are already working with me.

104
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,200
Your investment gap will only grow larger.

105
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,000
However,

106
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,360
I have a way to help you get out of this

107
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,160
and transfer 40% of my new company's shares

108
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,280
to you.

109
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,640
What are you up to?

110
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,440
But

111
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,280
in exchange,

112
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,440
I have one condition.

113
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,340
That is to exchange all the Jindu shares you hold

114
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,159
for shares in my new company.

115
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,360
You...

116
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,840
Think about it.

117
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
After three days,

118
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,280
Mr. Long's stocks will be transferred to me.

119
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,080
To be precise,

120
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,200
the future chairman of Jindu Group

121
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,960
is me.

122
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,360
Long Baiqi.

123
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,620
You've got quite an appetite.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,040
I only talk to the final winner.

125
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,120
Besides, being able to escape from Jindu Group,

126
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,160
that massive pit,

127
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,130
I'm already extremely fortunate.

128
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,860
I'm not losing out either.

129
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Lu Ye promised to offer

130
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,240
40% of Nanshui Beverage Company's shares as an exchange.

131
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,570
But what do you have?

132
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
You're completely worthless to me.

133
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,680
Did you plan all this?

134
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,440
Of course.

135
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,480
From the very beginning,

136
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,840
I had it all planned out.

137
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,000
The reason I slowed down the Nanshui Village project

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,680
was to accelerate

139
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,720
the acquisition of Longchuan Group.

140
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,560
Once Longchuan Group took the bait,

141
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,620
they had no choice but to keep buying.

142
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,600
I must thank our Director Long here

143
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,960
for not letting Jindu's assets

144
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,960
fall into someone else's hands.

145
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,320
This was all your trap.

146
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,520
The key to this move

147
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,840
was Lin Anduo.

148
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,560
Without her,

149
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,480
my plan wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

150
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,540
Director Long and Lu Yi wouldn't have been provoked

151
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,280
and pushed to the outcome I wanted.

152
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,640
Long Baiqi.

153
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,080
It seems

154
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,850
you two have been working together all along.

155
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,840
If you want to blame someone,

156
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,970
blame yourselves for coming too late.

157
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,530
Don't worry about that.

158
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,280
I'll help you get some shares

159
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,440
of Jindu Group.

160
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,159
But I have one condition.

161
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,800
You help me become the chairman of the group.

162
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,200
That's easy.

163
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,280
But I have a project to launch,

164
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,720
so we need the board's approval.

165
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,000
These old men are nothing to worry about.

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,600
This...

167
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,490
I have my own ways to deal with them.

168
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,320
These things are fake.

169
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,560
I never said any of this.

170
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,020
This is AI face-swapping.

171
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,760
Bro.

172
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,080
You may have won,

173
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,680
but I don't accept it.

174
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,120
If you hadn't used these despicable methods,

175
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,840
you wouldn't have won.

176
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,500
Inside this are

177
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,520
Lu Tongchen

178
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,240
and Lu Yi.

179
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,360
All evidence of embezzlement

180
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,840
and document forgery.

181
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,500
This card contains

182
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,800
all the money they transferred to me.

183
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,260
I haven't touched a penny.

184
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,600
These are all company assets.

185
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,640
Thank you,

186
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,760
Mr. Ma.

187
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,400
This is what I should do.

188
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
The chairman has treated me well.

189
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,600
Leave the rest

190
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,920
to me.

191
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,320
Alright.

192
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,420
I need to ask you

193
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,450
what's the story behind these photos.

194
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,360
Are you out of your mind?

195
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,560
Are you fucking crazy?

196
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,420
If I'm crazy, you made me this way.

197
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,960
My entire life,

198
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,740
I've done everything according to your wishes.

199
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,240
You told me what to study,

200
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,040
what to do, even what to like.

201
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,760
All according to your ideas.

202
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,520
I just want to be myself.

203
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,120
Why is that so difficult?

204
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,440
Why do you always

205
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,240
compare me with Lu Ye?

206
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,920
I just want to be myself.

207
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,840
I just want the freedom to choose.

208
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,200
I truly regret it.

209
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,850
I really regret having the surname Lu.

210
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,960
Say that again

211
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,200
and I'll slap you.

212
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,440
You...

213
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,600
Hello, are you Mr. Lu Yi?

214
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,040
You are suspected of contract killing,

215
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,480
embezzlement, contract forgery,

216
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,760
and occupational encroachment among other serious crimes.

217
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,080
Please cooperate with us

218
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,010
and come with us.

219
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,300
Wait, officer.

220
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,890
There must be some mistake.

221
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,840
That's right.

222
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,960
Are you Lu Tongchen?

223
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,760
I am.

224
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,440
I have an investigation order for you here.

225
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,180
Please come with us for questioning.

226
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,040
The basic situation

227
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,920
is as follows.

228
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Our company's future goal is

229
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
to create

230
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,440
a new approach to tourism development.

231
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,620
Now, Mr. Pang will explain the details to everyone.

232
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,600
Our project

233
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,120
preserves the natural beauty of the village

234
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,400
while also promoting

235
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,730
local economic and tourism development.

236
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,360
Let's take a look.

237
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,880
Have some tea.

238
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,560
We still need to follow the proper procedures.

239
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,610
Are you really sure about this?

240
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,840
You are now

241
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,480
the largest shareholder of Jindu Group.

242
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,490
I want to live differently.

243
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,120
And I think I've found

244
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,420
something more valuable than inheriting the company.

245
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,360
What is it?

246
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,200
Love.

247
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,240
And my true self-worth.

248
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,440
Lu Ye.

249
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,720
You've really grown up.

250
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,440
Thank you.

251
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,360
Dad.

252
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,640
Hey.

253
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,240
Okay.

254
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,530
Everyone can still work in this tea garden

255
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,880
thanks to you.

256
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,440
This place

257
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,960
is where we first met.

258
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,600
I hope it stays here forever.

259
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,280
Before I met you,

260
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,080
my life was monotonous.

261
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,080
But now,

262
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,080
I've found my purpose in life.

263
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,720
What purpose

264
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,040
in life?

265
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,280
It's you.

266
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,400
Here's your tea.

267
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,960
Mom.

268
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,240
Drink up, Mom.

269
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,760
How did I brew it?

270
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,680
Mom's good boy.

271
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,160
Mom.

272
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Old Lady Wang is selling tea,

273
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,200
three Guanyins come to drink tea.

274
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,920
Mom,

275
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,160
what would you like to eat?
