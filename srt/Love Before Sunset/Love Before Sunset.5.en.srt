1
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,640
This young man.

2
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,960
Li, it's not what you think.

3
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,160
Why did you hit me?

4
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,200
Get out of here!

5
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,840
Here.

6
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,090
Your tea is really good.

7
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,200
That's why I came to ask for more.

8
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,160
Hmph.

9
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,000
Let me ask you something.

10
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,320
Was your village haunted before?

11
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,440
What haunting are you talking about?

12
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,200
An old lady wearing red clothes with hair about this long.

13
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,800
Mother.

14
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,760
Why are you doing this? You've been hitting and scaring me all night.

15
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,690
Who told you to be so easily scared?

16
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,400
You saw her?

17
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,480
Yes, she chased me all the way here like a madwoman.

18
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,720
So you didn't come to borrow tea.

19
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,760
I met her on my way here.

20
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,320
That old woman lost her husband when she was young.

21
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,200
A few years ago,

22
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,780
her son died in a car accident.

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,640
She couldn't handle the devastating blow.

24
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,240
So she developed dementia.

25
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,120
That explains it.

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,440
Why she kept calling me 'son' all the way.

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,960
She's so pitiful.

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,920
Since you've had a fright, have some tea to calm down.

29
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,440
Director Lu.

30
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,680
What are you doing?

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,520
This is our new filming theme.

32
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,120
If there's nothing else, we'll head back now.

33
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,320
Sorry for the disturbance.

34
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,000
We don't need the tea.

35
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,800
Get some rest. Sorry for bothering you.

36
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,960
So it's dementia.

37
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,840
Luckily the rope broke by itself.

38
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,840
Otherwise,

39
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,010
I would've been reporting to the King of Hell.

40
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,800
Even the King of Hell wouldn't take you.

41
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,050
Alright, alright. Good that you're fine.

42
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,930
Can we use what we just shot?

43
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,800
The fixed camera position should have captured it.

44
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,760
Good.

45
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,760
Let's edit it quickly tomorrow

46
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,170
and post it on all social media platforms.

47
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,200
The title will be

48
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,920
'Ancient Village Haunting!'

49
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,120
Fatty.

50
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,040
I heard music can improve memory function

51
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,880
and treat dementia.

52
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,040
Why don't you buy her a phone?

53
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,280
Let her take more photos.

54
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,160
She can take pictures of things she can't remember.

55
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,480
Give me a break.

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,160
Didn't Director Lu say

57
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,010
we're afraid it might trigger memories of her past misfortunes

58
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,760
and only add to her suffering?

59
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,280
Maybe her current state as a grandma

60
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,360
is actually the most carefree

61
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,240
and happiest time of her life.

62
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,120
Done.

63
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,640
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends.

64
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,500
I've arrived at Nanshui Village.

65
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,800
Now I'm going to take everyone

66
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,730
to see the local specialties here.

67
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,520
What's going on here?

68
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,450
Why is it getting more popular?

69
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,320
From a technical perspective,

70
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,160
it can be considered a success.

71
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,960
Success?

72
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,280
What success?

73
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,760
Successfully promoting Nanshui Village!

74
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,560
If the villagers have tasted success, how will they move out?

75
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,159
How can our project proceed?

76
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Director Lu, please don't be angry.

77
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,880
I...

78
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,320
I have another plan to fix this.

79
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,200
I have something to do.

80
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,840
I'm heading back to the office first.

81
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,120
When I come back,

82
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,380
I don't care what methods you two use,

83
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,060
I only care about results.

84
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,080
Alright, no problem. You can go with peace of mind.

85
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,410
Actually, I was still successful.

86
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,360
Successful my ass!

87
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,280
Jindu Group

88
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,360
will utilize Nanshui Village's

89
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,200
varied terrain

90
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,280
to build two 18-hole golf courses.

91
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,720
Everyone please share your thoughts.

92
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,360
If they build it, they'll demolish something.

93
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,240
Demolish what?

94
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,760
Houses.

95
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,540
What are you thinking?

96
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,880
That tiny plot of yours

97
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,810
isn't even big enough for a toilet.

98
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,810
They'll be using

99
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,730
the hillsides instead.

100
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,000
The tea gardens.

101
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,360
But the compensation Jindu Group is offering

102
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,620
is quite substantial.

103
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,200
If we refuse,

104
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,840
what will we do afterward?

105
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Keep growing tea?

106
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Our ancestors have been growing tea here for generations.

107
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,970
Has anyone gotten rich from it?

108
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,560
So according to you,

109
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,360
you're agreeing to it?

110
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,520
I didn't say that.

111
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,960
That's what you said.

112
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,060
Ladies and gentlemen.

113
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,240
Please hear me out.

114
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,730
This tea plantation

115
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,760
brings us more than just

116
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,000
economic income.

117
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,920
It's also the spiritual wealth

118
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,760
that our ancestors from Nanshui Village

119
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,880
left for us descendants.

120
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,760
Our ancestors

121
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,240
cultivated with their bare hands

122
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,200
these thousands of acres of tea gardens.

123
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,040
How can we sell them off

124
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,880
for some short-term profit?

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,920
Anduo is right.

126
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,340
We can't sign this.

127
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Once we sign,

128
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,600
we'll have nothing left.

129
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,520
Let's listen to Anduo.

130
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,039
After all, she's

131
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,080
the only college graduate in our village.

132
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,559
That makes sense.

133
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,100
Let's just follow Anduo's advice, okay?

134
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,000
Fatty.

135
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,480
I found it.
