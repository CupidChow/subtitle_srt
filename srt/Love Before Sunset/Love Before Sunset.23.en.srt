1
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:47,920
Neighbor.

2
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,080
Excuse me, do you know if anyone in your village

3
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,920
still knows how to make Laolin traditional tea?

4
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,920
Does anyone still know that method?

5
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,450
I don't know about that.

6
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,000
Well,

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,800
you should try over there.

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,520
Thank you.

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,920
Neighbor.

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,840
Do you know if anyone in the village

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,170
knows how to make Laolin traditional tea?

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,400
Do you know?

13
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,940
Traditional tea-making.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,960
Excuse me, gentlemen.

15
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,560
Could I ask if you know anyone in the village

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,720
who knows the Laolin traditional tea-making method,

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,440
you know, the way they pan-fry it?

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,039
No idea.

19
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,640
The old traditional method.

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,600
Don't know.

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,740
Thanks anyway.

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,259
No problem.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,920
Hello there.

24
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,000
May I ask you

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,520
about the traditional tea-making in your village?

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,600
Do you know who can do it?

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,080
The Laolin traditional tea-making method.

28
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,160
I don't know either.

29
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,080
You don't know, right?

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,800
Thank you.

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,560
Neighbor.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,080
Do you know who in Nanshui Village

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,840
knows the Laolin traditional tea-making method?

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,520
No idea.

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,320
We really don't know about this.

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,050
Why don't you ask someone else?

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,280
Thanks.

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,640
Anduo's father's skill is almost lost.

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,090
Nobody in the village can make tea with that flavor anymore.

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,079
Uncle Li.

41
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,120
Could you please think about it again?

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,440
Who else might know?

43
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,690
Even the smallest clue would help.

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,240
The village is small.

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,940
There are no secrets here.

46
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,560
If one family loses a chicken,

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,600
you can find it at another family's house.

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,760
If anyone knew,

49
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,120
they wouldn't keep it from you.

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,400
Anduo told me

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,960
that you're actually the one who purchased this batch of tea.

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,600
The villagers sold tea at such a high price for the first time.

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,079
They're all grateful to you.

54
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,880
Son.

55
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,680
But I still want something better.

56
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,520
Son.

57
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,720
Son.

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,840
Go find your son over there.

59
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,160
We're discussing important matters.

60
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm not your son.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,600
I already told you last time.

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,680
She's become obsessed with missing her son, you see.

63
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,720
You're talking nonsense.

64
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,040
He is my son. Come home with mother.

65
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,420
Come home with mother.

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,280
Come home with mother.

67
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,079
Please sit down.

68
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,600
My mother-in-law is a very nice person.

69
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,079
Here.

70
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,520
Mom bought you these new clothes.

71
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,440
Try them on.

72
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,400
Stop bothering.

73
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,360
He's not your son.

74
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,420
He won't wear them.

75
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,040
He is my son.

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,960
You must be thirsty.

77
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,320
I'll make you some tea.

78
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,600
Don't mind her.

79
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,040
She misses her son.

80
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,240
Tea's ready.

81
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,060
He's not drinking tea.

82
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
We need to discuss business.

83
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,300
Stop interfering.

84
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,040
Try it.

85
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
It's fine, Mr. Lu.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,200
You don't need to drink this.

87
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,330
I'm not even sure if this bowl is clean.

88
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,600
Where did you get this tea?

89
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,899
It's exactly like the tea Anduo's father makes.

90
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,760
Isn't it obvious?

91
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,160
Must have been swiped from Anduo's house.

92
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,840
No.

93
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,240
I made it myself.

94
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,200
You made it?

95
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,440
Don't be ridiculous.

96
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,920
Since when do you know how to make tea?

97
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,720
I do know how.

98
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,720
Son.

99
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,720
Look. These are all from your mother.

100
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,640
Son.

101
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,000
Son.

102
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
When Grandma dragged me to their house that day,

103
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,400
I was terrified.

104
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
I thought she was having another episode.

105
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,040
At their house, she offered me tea she had made.

106
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,160
Uncle Li told me not to drink it.

107
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,120
'Don't drink it, it's dirty,'

108
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,040
I thought to myself,

109
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,360
Grandma is so pitiful, and I was already there,

110
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
so I should try it to be polite.

111
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,290
When I tasted it,

112
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,000
the flavor was identical.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,760
Really?

114
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,480
I never expected that Grandma

115
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,680
had learned tea-making from my father.

116
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,040
So,

117
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,120
fate is so mysterious.

118
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,720
The person you've been desperately searching for

119
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,920
has been right in front of you all along.

120
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,480
My father

121
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,159
never mentioned it.

122
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,040
By the way,

123
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,240
Pang De,

124
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,960
get Manager Sun and the technical staff now

125
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,640
and meet at Nanshui Village immediately.

126
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,040
Yes, right now.

127
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,680
We'll adjust according to this data later.

128
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,900
The resulting taste and flavor shouldn't differ much.

129
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,120
I think our tea's

130
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,440
main promotional efforts

131
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,640
should focus

132
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,360
on social media marketing.

133
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,400
I must say this tea tastes really good.

134
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,130
It has a nice aroma and leaves a sweet aftertaste.

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,240
Not bad. It tastes quite good.

136
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,720
Yes.

137
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,250
It really is delicious.

138
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,440
I love this flavor.

139
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,760
I'll bring some for my family to try.

140
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,360
Good idea.

141
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,720
Let's take a photo here.

142
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,920
Hello everyone, welcome to my livestream.

143
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,520
Although it's a bit hot today,

144
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,640
my mood is super great.

145
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,200
Because today I'm bringing you

146
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,480

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,090

151
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,960

Today I want to recommend

a Nanshui tea drink.

155
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,760
It uses all-natural Nanshui tea leaves as a base

156
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,080
paired with fresh fruits.

157
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,840
Every sip offers a pure and natural taste.

158
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,680
It contains no preservatives

159
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,920
or artificial coloring.

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,200

The tea and fruit aromas blend perfectly.

164
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,160
It's not overly sweet,

165
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,320
yet very thirst-quenching.

166
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
It's truly a summer essential drink.

167
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,800
Additionally,

168
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,120
it also comes in milk tea,

169
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,200
original tea flavor and many other varieties.

Order now for lots of discounts!

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,080
Such a small beverage company.

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,720
How could they try to steal

175
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,850
other projects from your Jindu Group?

176
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,580
That's exactly the issue.

177
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,680
I've already investigated.

178
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
The owner of this company is named Yuan Xiao.

179
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,920
Just a few months ago, he was

180
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,970
a junior employee in our project department.

181
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,360
Yuan Xiao?

182
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,530
He's not important.

183
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,460
What matters is who's behind him.

184
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,800
Lu Ye.

185
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,240
Lu Ye?

186
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,280
How is that possible?

187
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,680
Jindu Group was founded by his father.

188
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,640
Besides, he owns shares too.

189
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,480
Who knows what he's up to.

190
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,600
However,

191
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,200
the holiday resort project

192
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,400
still has potential.

193
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,800
Even if it falls through,

194
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,490
we have other projects we can collaborate on.

195
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,400
Mr. Long.

196
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,520
When did this happen?

197
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,480
One hour ago.

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,040
What happened?

199
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,280
Okay.

200
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,360
Pleasure working with you.
