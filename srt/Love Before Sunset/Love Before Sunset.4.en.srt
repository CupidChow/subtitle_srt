1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,000
Why

2
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,010
did you go to the village

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,800
without caring about your appearance?

4
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,360
Seems like you know

5
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,480
quite a lot about my whereabouts, Ms. Long.

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,280
About you,

7
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,360
there's still a lot I don't know.

8
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,400
It seems you've spent

9
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,560
quite a bit of money on me.

10
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,220
How about this:

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,200
you give me the money,

12
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,250
and I'll report my whereabouts

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,050
to you 24 hours a day.

14
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,240
Fine.

15
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,160
Have a cup of coffee.

16
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,500
Just shipped from Panama.

17
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,240
Your favorite Geisha from Alps Estate.

18
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,320
How is it?

19
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,500
It tastes good.

20
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
But recently I've

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,940
started to prefer tea.

22
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,080
I don't have any tea here.

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,210
That's not what I meant.

24
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,760
Why are you acquiring

25
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,200
Jindu Group's shares?

26
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,320
To make money.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,880
This is clearly

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,360
a losing investment.

29
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,210
What's wrong, Lu Ye?

30
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,600
Even you have lost faith

31
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,640
in Jindu Group?

32
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,160
I came to see you today

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,160
to ask for one month's time.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,640
You can't do much in such a short time.

35
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,480
One month is enough.

36
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,560
Fine.

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,290
I'll give you one month.

38
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,040
Wait.

39
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,440
In exchange,

40
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,170
you need to do something for me.

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,360
What is it?

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,730
The chairman has treated me well all these years.

43
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,250
For this small amount of money,

44
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,579
I really feel like I'm betraying my conscience.

45
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,520
I didn't realize you were still playing your part, Mr. Ma.

46
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,980
I'm telling the truth.

47
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,290
I understand what you mean.

48
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,000
You think it's not enough money.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,860
How about this,

50
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,380
you take this money first.

51
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,690
After it's done,

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
I'll give you a bigger bonus.

53
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,450
Alright.

54
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,840
Then I'll wait for your news.

55
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,370
What are you doing, mister?

56
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,640
Damn it!

57
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,420
Can you turn off the music?

58
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,220
It's giving me the creeps.

59
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,440
Creation requires inspiration.

60
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,160
Makeup is also a form of creation.

61
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,840
Cut it out and turn it off now.

62
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,520
You're scared of ghosts yet you're dressing up as one.

63
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm not scared if I can't see myself.

64
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,400
Wait.

65
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,960
How is it? Feel anything?

66
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,920
Let me show you with a mirror.

67
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,080
No, no, no!

68
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,890
I don't want to look.

69
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,090
As long as you look scary to others.

70
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,360
I feel like

71
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,480
you're scarier without makeup.

72
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,200
What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,040
I...

74
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,100
I'm telling you, you'll be the first one I take away.

75
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,290
Damn it, you fat idiot! You scared me to death!

76
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,580
How's it going?

77
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,170
Why isn't this person here yet? My legs are getting numb.

78
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,120
Awesome!

79
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,880
What's wrong? Have we been discovered?

80
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,640
Where's Dezi?

81
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,760
Say something!

82
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,800
It's over.

83
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,059
No, talk to me. What's wrong with you? Why are you like this?

84
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,520
Take a deep breath. Slow down.

85
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,929
We're almost there.

86
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,840
My son.

87
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,040
