1
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,320
Little girl,

2
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,080
why are you alone?

3
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,490
My teacher is over there and hasn't come back yet.

4
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,920
When will your teacher be back?

5
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,160
I don't know.

6
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,040
Yaoyao.

7
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,600
Ms. Anduo.

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,160
You are?

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,930
Just passing by.

10
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,880
The child is quite adorable.

11
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,920
Thank you.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,600
Yaoyao.

13
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,160
When you're outside,

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,120
don't talk to strangers.

15
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,160
Understand?

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,160
See?

17
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,380
What are you watching?

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,880
I'm watching

19
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,840
'You, Us, Them.'

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,520
Duoduo.

21
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,280
Yaoyao.

22
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,920
Go play with Pipi and the others,

23
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,680
okay?

24
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,680
Go on.

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,360
Hello, sir.

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,220
Yaoyao, be a good girl and go play.

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,580
What do you want to tell me?

28
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,360
Duoduo.

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,520
I was wrong.

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,880
I shouldn't have lied to you and the villagers.

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,860
The Nanshui Village project.

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,450
I only have three days left,

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,200
so...

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,280
Could you please

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,450
be the first to sign?

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,480
I promise

37
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,720
I'll do everything in my power to protect the village.

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,560
Look,

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,380
I have a contract here.

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,880
If you sign it,

41
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,200
I'll pay you and the villagers

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,320
four times the original price.

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,200
This is the best deal

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,660
I could negotiate for you.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,240
If you don't sign,

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,520
and this project falls into Lu Yi's hands,

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,360
he'll use terrible methods against all of you.

48
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,690
The consequences would be unimaginable.

49
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,520
So

50
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,160
can you trust me?

51
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,920
Is that all you wanted to tell me?

52
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
Do you think I would still trust you?

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,520
Do you think

54
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,200
money can buy everything?

55
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
You rich boys,

56
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,480
do you only see money

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
and profit?

58
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,200
In the end,

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,200
in your eyes,

60
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,840
I'm just a tool.

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,730
Why would you think of me like that?

62
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,600
If I didn't care about you,

63
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,320
why would I be here?

64
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,360
Then you can tell me.

65
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,160
Tell you what?

66
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,579
What's really troubling you?

67
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,680
You can tell me.

68
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll tell you now.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I was set up.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,460
I was wrongfully accused.

71
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,320
Set up?

72
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,600
You're still full of lies.

73
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,720
This place is quite nice.

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,120
Let's go back to that store we just saw.

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,480
Okay.

76
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,420
I want to buy that dress I was looking at earlier.

77
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,400
Sure.

78
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,200
Let's go back.

79
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,200
It'll be easier to call then.

80
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,640
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,400
Seriously.

82
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,520
Who is this?

83
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,400
It's me.

84
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,650
Whose phone is this?

85
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,680
Don't worry about it.

86
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,400
Where are you?

87
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,460
I'll come find you.

88
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,240
I'm starting to doubt

89
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
your professionalism.

90
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,800
You must be looking for someone else, right?

91
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,960
There's been a problem.

92
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,120
But I've gotten away.

93
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,520
The mission can still be completed.

94
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,760
Just give me two more days.

95
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,520
No.

96
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,460
Let's discuss this in person.

97
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,000
Where are you?

98
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,050
I'll send you the location.

99
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,320
Feels like I haven't been back for ages.

100
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,800
Suddenly I miss working.

101
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,520
Living like a servant, taking orders from others.

102
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,520
What's wrong?

103
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,850
Did you always want to stay in the village?

104
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
What's up?

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,180
Why are you hiding?

106
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,380
Because of him.

107
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,280
He doesn't get along with Mr. Lu.

108
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,140
He definitely won't be nice to us.

109
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,760
You have a point.

110
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,320
I always feel he's a bit effeminate.

111
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,120
Do you think he's gay?

112
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,080
What?

113
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,160
You can tell?

114
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,800
Just observe his daily outfit

115
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,240
and behavior, you can figure it out.

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,760
See how he likes to be clean

117
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,120
and takes extra care of his appearance.

118
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,600
This type of person also likes to wear perfume.

119
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,400
Look!

120
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,520
I told you so.

121
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,560
90% of people like this are gay.

122
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,760
Don't you believe me?

123
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,960
Let's make a bet.

124
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,880
The person he's meeting must be a man.

125
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,640
Do I look like that to you?

126
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,420
Well, if you put it that way...

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,760
He's gone!

128
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,440
Quick, follow him!

129
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,680
Mr. Lu.

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,000
How is his condition now?

131
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,320
He's here with me.

132
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,760
Don't worry.

133
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,840
However,

134
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,880
The rehabilitation fees

135
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,080
and medical expenses here

136
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,600
aren't cheap at all.

137
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,120
Money is not an issue.

138
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,080
You must give him the best medicine available.

139
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,920
Treating an illness requires addressing its root cause.

140
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,720
Understood.

141
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,520
Doctor.

142
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,440
Bed number 3

143
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,650
is recovering well.

144
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,960
Please inform the patient's family

145
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,320
that they'll be moved to a regular ward this afternoon.

146
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,240
Yes, Doctor.

147
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,600
What's wrong?

148
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
The project isn't going smoothly.

149
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,340
The Nanshui Village project.

150
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
In the short term,

151
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
it might bring us

152
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,720
some economic benefits.

153
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,680
But it will damage the local ecosystem

154
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,080
and cause losses for the villagers.

155
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,920
In the long run,

156
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,720
it would be detrimental to our company's image

157
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,450
and sustainable development.

158
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,940
Both would suffer.

159
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,560
I know.

160
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,520
None of this is easy.

161
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,840
But the current situation of our group

162
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,480
is not optimistic.

163
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,960
Longchuan Group has been watching us like a hawk.

164
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,400
If we show any weakness,

165
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,360
they will show us no mercy.

166
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,780
I understand everything you're saying.

167
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,680
You've changed.

168
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,800
You used to only care about results.

169
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,200
Don't move around.

170
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,280
This is pethidine hydrochloride for pain relief.

171
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,880
Sometimes,

172
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,240
emotions and career

173
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,120
need to be kept separate.

174
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,680
In business,

175
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,360
we must remain rational.

176
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,080
Because every decision you make

177
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,600
affects the livelihood of thousands of employees

178
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,080
and the future of the company.

179
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,800
Personal feelings should never become

180
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,920
factors that influence decisions.

181
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,320
Otherwise,

182
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,560
you'll lose your way.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,880
Remember,

184
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
treat everything

185
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,340
as a learning experience.

186
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,880
Only then can you grow.

187
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Are you finished?

188
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,440
Have you ever considered that I

189
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,800
didn't come here today to hear all this?

190
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,280
All my life,

191
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,520
all you've cared about is your work and your ambitions.

192
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,450
Is there nothing else in your life?

193
