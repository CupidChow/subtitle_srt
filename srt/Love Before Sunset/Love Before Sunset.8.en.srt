1
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,080
Uncle.

2
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,440
Why are you all here?

3
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,160
What's wrong?

4
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,560
What happened? What's wrong with the teacher?

5
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,720
Teacher, what happened?

6
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,560
The teacher fainted.

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,200
Where did the teacher faint?

8
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,920
What's the situation, doctor?

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,560
Well,

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,120
the patient fainted on the street

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,760
and was brought to the hospital by a Good Samaritan.

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,360
The nurse

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,320
found a note in her pocket

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,520
with your phone number on it,

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,720
so we called you here.

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,080
How is she doing now?

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,010
She's awake now,

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,000
but her blood sugar is a bit low.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,800
She needs further examination.

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,080
Okay, thank you.

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,940
No problem.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,360
Let's go find the teacher.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,820
Come on.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,240
How are you feeling? Any better?

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,000
Teacher!

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,840
Sweetie!

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,800
Teacher!

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,680
It's okay, don't cry. Don't cry.

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,479
Stop crying, it's alright.

30
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,160
Don't cry.

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,920
It's okay.

32
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,120
You...

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,360
Wait.

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,289
Why didn't you tell me you were coming to the city?

35
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,360
There's a painting competition next week.

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,200
I thought I'd bring them to the city early to look around.

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,000
So

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,720
I got your number from Pang De.

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,680
I didn't expect them to call you.

40
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,040
That was so dangerous.

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,660
Good thing they called me.

42
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,479
I'm sorry

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,720
for causing you trouble.

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,199
This...

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,860
What trouble? It's no problem at all.

46
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,240
Director Shen?

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,980
I'd like to ask for your help with something.

48
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,680
Aren't you organizing an art exhibition recently?

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,320
I have three children who are learning to paint.

50
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,980
They'd like to learn from you.

51
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,079
What do you think?

52
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,680
When would you be available?

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,040
Yes.

54
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,880
Sorry to trouble you with this small matter.

55
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,520
Great.

56
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,940
So we'll definitely see you then.

57
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,440
You're so sick

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,130
yet your appetite is still so good.

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,400
It's nothing.

60
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,700
Do you know what I've heard

61
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,640
most often since I was a child?

62
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,160
What?

63
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,200
Fortunately, I was brought to the hospital in time,

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,460
otherwise it would have been dangerous.

65
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,660
What can I do with such an unreliable father?

66
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,360
But honestly,

67
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,480
I have blamed him before.

68
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,320
But later I understood.

69
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,120
My father devoted all his heart and soul

70
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,400
to that tea garden.

71
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,720
My father would

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,079
get up in the middle of the night to research.

73
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,840
He would travel everywhere

74
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,720
to learn from experts

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,720
about plans for the tea garden.

76
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,800
I remember he

77
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,880
revised and tested over and over again.

78
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
But fortunately,

79
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,040
he finally figured out

80
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
the dark tea production technique.

81
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,160
After hearing you talk like this,

82
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,620
I think I understand a bit.

83
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,780
I understand why you can't leave the village

84
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,410
and can't bear to part with the tea garden.

85
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,440
Look at how much you're eating.

86
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,040
By the way,

87
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,940
I found a place for you to stay.

88
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,920
Kids,

89
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,000
in a couple of days,

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,040
aren't you going to participate in the competition?

91
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,279
I happen to know

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
a famous painter.

93
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,600
So I thought I'd take the children there

94
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,920
to get some guidance from him

95
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,040
and some special training.

96
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,440
Let's see if we can help them

97
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,100
improve their performance in the competition.

98
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,360
Won't that be too much trouble for you?

99
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,620
It's no trouble at all.

100
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,080
Thank the uncle now.

101
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,240
Thank you, uncle. Thank you, uncle.

102
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,700
Let me have a bite quickly. Let me have a bite.

103
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,360
Anduo.

104
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
Teacher, teacher, what's wrong, teacher?

105
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,080
Call a nurse quickly!

106
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,200
Teacher, teacher, what's wrong, teacher?

107
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,000
It's nothing.

108
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,320
Let's go.

109
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,650
Let's check over there.

110
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,280
Mr. Lu.

111
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,000
Director Lu.

112
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,860
Welcome, welcome.

113
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,120
Welcome.

114
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Let me introduce you.

115
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,640
This...

116
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,160
This is the renowned artist, Mr. Shen.

117
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,160
Hello, Mr. Shen.

118
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,280
It's an honor to meet you.

119
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,880
Hello.

120
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,800
Hello, Mr. Shen.

121
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,160
Hello, children.

122
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,280
Hello, Mr. Shen.

123
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,360
This is Lin Anduo.

124
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,000
Ms. Lin.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,320
Hello, Ms. Lin.

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,730
Director Lu.

127
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,810
He's been my friend for many years.

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,680
He told me about the situation.

129
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,320
You're bringing the children here for a few days.

130
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,040
To learn.

131
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,240
To improve their skills.

132
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,500
Sorry for the trouble.

133
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,480
Let's skip the formalities.

134
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Come, I'll show you around.

135
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
Let the children...

136
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,640
Experience the artistic atmosphere.

137
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,680
Alright.

138
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,440
Let's go, children.

139
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,840
Thank you for your hard work.

140
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,040
Come, children.

141
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,159
Look at this,

142
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,960
there are many paintings, right?

143
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,720
Do you like them?

144
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,240
Yes, they're beautiful.

145
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,000
Come,

146
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,840
let's look at this painting.

147
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,960
Children, look.

148
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
In this painting,

149
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,040
green is not just a color.

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,320
It symbolizes vitality and hope.

151
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,440
Like new sprouts in spring,

152
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,720
signaling the revival of life.

153
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,480
Look.

154
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,490
These green mountains,

155
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,400
don't they give you a feeling

156
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,160
of tranquility and anticipation?

157
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,480
Yes, indeed.

158
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,200
Just like the tea mountains in our village.

159
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,880
In this painting,

160
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,680
you've found homesickness.

161
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,159
Right?

162
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,440
Yes, yes.

163
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,720
Good.

164
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,120
Let's go see over there.

165
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,920
This painting is beautiful.

166
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,200
This one looks nice.

167
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,120
This is good.

168
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,520
I like this one.

169
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,159
This one

170
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,800
is beautiful.

171
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,920
Ms. Anduo,

172
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,320
why is your face so red?

173
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,640
My face isn't red.

174
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,200
Of course it is.

175
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,880
Even the doctor said so last night.

176
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,200
Don't get too excited.

177
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
I like it.

178
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,130
What do you know?

179
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,920
Go now.

180
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,860
Listen to the teacher.

181
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,530
What are you talking about?

182
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,360
Can you hurry up?

183
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,690
I can't hold it anymore.

184
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,610
We must have eaten something bad at lunch.

185
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,440
And also, when you're using the toilet, can you please

186
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,800
stop looking at your phone?

187
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,280
It takes me longer if I don't look at my phone.

188
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,760
Go to Director Lu's room.

189
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,040
The key is on the table.

190
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,240
Go, go, hurry up.

191
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,240
That feels better.

192
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,080
I was about to burst.

193
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,250
Something's wrong.

194
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,960
Just now, right there.

195
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,970
It was flashing.

196
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,500
I don't know what it is.

197
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,559
Right here.

198
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,650
Look at this.

199
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,320
A camera.

200
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,040
With built-in infrared lighting.

201
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,890
Could Director Lu have installed it himself?

202
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,280
To monitor himself?

203
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,010
What's there to see?

204
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,960
Is he a voyeur

205
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,290
or a narcissist?

206
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,320
This device

207
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,280
has a receiving range of no more than 10 meters.

208
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,680
I found it.

209
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,160
This little thing

210
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,500
costs 50,000 yuan.

211
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,700
It's professional grade.

212
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Something this professional

213
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,570
couldn't possibly be installed by the hotel.

214
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,520
Ten-meter receiving range.

215
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,810
With Director Lu's room as the center,

216
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,480
that only includes our room 102

217
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,160
and room 103.

218
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,720
Who?

219
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,040
You.

220
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,280
Are you out of your mind?

221
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,600
How could you suspect me?

222
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,000
Among the three of us, only you know something about photography.

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,680
Get lost.

224
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,320
Who could it be?

225
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,320
Could it be

226
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,240
him?

227
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,250
How's the progress?

228
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,930
Under close surveillance.

229
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,400
What surveillance?

230
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,860
They've already gone downtown. Are you capable or not?

231
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,440
Hurry!

232
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,480
Close it!

233
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,960
Check the bed.

234
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,880
Nothing here either.

235
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,820
There's a bag here.

236
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,320
This one.

237
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,240
This...

238
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,340
What's this stethoscope for?

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,060
There's a box here.

240
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:53,960
Are all

241
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,680
these

242
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,080
cameras?

243
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,960
They look so realistic.

244
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,920
You can't even tell they're cameras.

245
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,320
This is just a lighter.

246
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,280
These devices are compact and convenient.

247
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,720
Most importantly,

248
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,660
they're 4K high-definition.

249
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,980
Seems this person has quite the background.

250
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,690
I need to report to Director Lu right away.

251
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,040
Director Lu,

252
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,120
is there anyone around you?
