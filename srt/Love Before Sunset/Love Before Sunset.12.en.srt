1
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,050
Be more careful with your work.

2
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't make me clean up your mess.

3
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,320
Who knows how Lu Ye found out about this.

4
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,920
He's already investigating

5
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,320
the financial matters.

6
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,880
What should we do now?

7
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,520
Since he wants to cause trouble,

8
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,770
let's give him something to keep him busy.

9
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,920
How's that matter I assigned to you?

10
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,440
I've arranged the person and the time.

11
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,210
It's set for tonight's business meeting.

12
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:53,160
Make sure Long Baiqi sees it too.

13
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,400
Women,

14
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,000
they're always ruled by emotions.

15
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,720
Understood.

16
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,360
Let's eat.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,930
This is what you're treating me to?

18
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,500
You don't know about this?

19
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,680
Real delicious food

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,960
is hidden in these street food stalls.

21
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,800
Is this sanitary?

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,960
Don't get a stomachache after eating.

23
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,560
Just try it and you'll see.

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,640
Yaoyao.

25
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,640
Uncle, have one too.

26
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,960
It's really delicious.

27
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,280
It's very tasty.

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,010
What is this?

29
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,050
It's intestine.

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,600
Try it quickly.

31
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,980
Let me pick one for you.

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,440
Is it good?

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,760
I didn't lie to you, did I?

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
It's delicious.

35
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,440
Really good.

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,480
Try some pig's trotters.

37
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,960
Let me do it myself.

38
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,580
See how much uncle is enjoying it, right?

39
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,680
Let me give you some intestine.

40
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,540
Will you eat it?

41
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Have another one.

42
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,600
I really can't eat anymore. I'm stuffed.

43
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,760
I haven't eaten this much greasy food in a long time.

44
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,440
That's what happens when you eat so fast.

45
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,900
It was just too delicious.

46
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,680
You have a competition in a few days.

47
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,760
How about I take you to see a movie tonight?

48
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,000
Great.

49
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,160
It's good to relax before the competition.

50
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,360
After the movie, go home early to rest.

51
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,920
And prepare for the competition.

52
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,160
Okay.

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,360
Good kid.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,720
Let's just enjoy our meal.

55
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,400
Brother Ye.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,560
There's a business meeting tonight

57
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,820
and you need to attend.

58
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,079
I can't make it today.

59
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,810
I have something to do outside.

60
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,320
You really have to go.

61
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,440
This meeting

62
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,680
is jointly organized by us and Longchuan Group.

63
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,560
Many decisions need your approval.

64
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,680
Then why wasn't I notified earlier?

65
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,240
It was also a last-minute notice.

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,840
Because the delegation from Fujian Chamber of Commerce

67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,000
just arrived today.

68
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,610
Alright, I understand.

69
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,970
Do you have something to do?

70
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,440
I have an urgent project meeting.

71
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,769
I might need to go there.

72
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,920
What time is it?

73
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,380
Eight o'clock.

74
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,380
Eight o'clock?

75
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,720
Then you go ahead.

76
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,600
I'll take the kids to the movies.

77
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,120
Okay.

78
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,520
I'll just make an appearance.

79
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,280
I'll be back by 8:40 sharp.

80
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,320
Kids,

81
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,159
I need to go out for a bit.

82
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,560
But at 8:40,

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,120
I'll be back on time to watch the movie with you.

84
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,840
Okay?

85
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,720
Okay.

86
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,159
Will you listen to Miss Anduo?

87
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,480
Yes.

88
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,700
Go ahead with your work. Important matters come first.

89
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,200
Let's eat.

90
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,980

91
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,560

is to combine our investment efforts to promote development.

96
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,360
We hope that with the strong support

of everyone here, we can achieve win-win cooperation

98
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,800
and create more opportunities and wealth.

99

Mr. Lu Ye.

103
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,080
Hello.

104
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,560
Nice to meet you.

108
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,640
Let's go have a drink.

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,520
Mr. Lu.

110
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,440
Excuse me, who are you?

111
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,840
What?

112
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,840
Mr. Lu doesn't recognize me.

113
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,600
You...

114
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,250
I don't quite remember.

115
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,770
That's perfect.

116
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,680
Take this opportunity to refresh your memory.

117
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,480
I have something urgent to attend to.

118
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,010
Let's skip today and meet another time, okay?

119
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,720
Mr. Lu, have this drink first.

120
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,850
Drink before you go.

121
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,680
I'm driving today.

122
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,720
It's really not convenient.

123
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,840
Sorry, sorry.

124
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,440
Do me this favor.

125
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,890
Mr. Lu, let me drive you.

126
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,080

127
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,220
June 20. Coming with panda power.

128
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,040
When is uncle coming?

129
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,400
Miss Anduo,

130
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,120
the movie is about to start.

131
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,760
Why hasn't Uncle Luye come back yet?

132
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,680
He should be here soon. Let's wait a bit longer.

133
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,400
They've all gone in. Let's go in too.

134
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,400
They've all gone in. I want to go in too.

135
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,520
Yes.

136
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,340
Please come in.

137
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,760
Alright.

138
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,920
Let's go in and wait.

139
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,840
Okay.

140
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,240
Go ahead.

141
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,000
Mr. Lu,

142
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,360
are you okay?

143
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,840
Time's up.

144
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,240
It's too late.

145
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,120
What are you talking about?

146
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,650
This is just the beginning.

147
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Let me help you up.

148
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,040
Isn't that Ye's car?

149
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,370
What's going on?

150
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,280
Lu Ye.

151
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,240
Fine.

152
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
You're ruthless.

153
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,880
Mr. Long.

154
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,330
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

155
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,320
Not bad, right?

156
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,160
The strongest in the Zero Defense Force is Zero.

157
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,640
No, it's Steel Number Nine.

158
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,200
No, it's definitely Zero.

159
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,320
I'll give him a call.

160
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,120
