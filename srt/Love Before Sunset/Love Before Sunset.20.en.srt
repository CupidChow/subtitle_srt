1
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,160
He's dead.

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,800
Damn it.

3
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,000
Who told you to kill someone?

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,240
What do we do now?

5
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,039
Let's get out of here.

6
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,720
Nanshui Village.

7
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,200
The chairman's health condition is excellent.

8
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,280
Jindu Group.

9
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,800
I'll trust you one last time.

10
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,260
I want to see it in the news.

11
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,680
Mr. Lu.

12
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,640
Don't kill me.

13
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,320
For this current project,

14
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,360
we need to stay motivated.

15
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,120
However,

16
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,240
certain groups and companies

17
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,520
have also set their sights on this lucrative opportunity

18
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,050
and want to compete with us.

19
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,160
Therefore,

20
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,560
I hope everyone

21
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,660
can pull together as one this year

22
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,210
and make this project successful.

23
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,920
Let's beat them.

24
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,320
Alright.

25
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,800
Boss.

26
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,920
No.

27
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,740
Let's go eat somewhere else then.

28
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,400
Let's go.

29
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,120
I want to focus on young people's tastes

30
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
and develop some

31
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,540
innovative and unique products.

32
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,079
Like bubble tea,

33
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,960
fruit teas, herbal teas and such,

34
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,240
trendy and healthy fast-moving tea beverages.

35
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,680
We can also make

36
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,320
portable tea bags

37
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,010
or open a tea experience shop directly

38
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,000
where people can mix drinks to their own taste.

39
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,600
Pang De.

40
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,000
You and Yuan Xiao need to check immediately

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,839
all the leading tea drink brands

42
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,800
currently on the market

43
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,720
and their market shares.

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,840
Yes, Mr. Lu.

45
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,280
Good.

46
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,340
I'll wait for your update.

47
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,400
Sir,

48
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
you're in good shape today.

49
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,360
Keep it up.

50
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Miss,

51
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,360
could you please turn up

52
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
the volume on this TV?

53
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,060
You can only watch for 30 minutes.

54
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,480
Hello, Ms. Anduo.

55
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,880
This time you brought three children from Nanshui Village

56
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,140
to compete in the city.

57
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,400
And they achieved

58
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
an excellent second place overall.

59
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,730
Do you have anything to say about this?

60
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,820
Actually, I want to say

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,680
this competition wasn't just about winning or losing.

62
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,080
I wanted everyone to know that

63
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,600
the people of Nanshui Village

64
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,120
are stubborn at heart

65
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,200
and not afraid of challenges.

66
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,080
No matter how difficult the road ahead is,

67
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,120
as long as we're of one mind

68
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,220
and work together,

69
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
I believe

70
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,940
we can overcome

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,120
any difficulty.

72
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,280
Nanshui Village.

73
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,800
The doctor said you need to eat something light.

74
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,200
I specially asked the chef to prepare some.

75
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,200
Lu Ye

76
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,720
I feel you've changed.

77
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,420
How have I changed?

78
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,480
I can't quite explain it.

79
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,060
Maybe it's from interacting with the villagers

80
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,980
and being influenced by them.

81
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,040
Perhaps.

82
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Before,

83
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,280
I could never understand

84
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,960
why the villagers

85
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,440
refused to relocate.

86
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,440
Until just now,

87
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,820
I finally understood.

88
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,280
The villagers of Nanshui Village have deep feelings

89
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,360
for this land.

90
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,520
I also discovered through interaction

91
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,330
that every tree in the village,

92
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
every river,

93
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,640
carries their memories.

94
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,530
The reason they don't want to leave

95
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,980
is because their roots are there,

96
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,360
their home,

97
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,760
where generations of their ancestors have lived.

98
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,760
You've learned to listen too.

99
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,280
The villagers' simplicity

100
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,810
and love for their homeland

101
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,680
deeply moved me.

102
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,520
Perhaps...

103
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,120
I used to be

104
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,840
stubborn and only focused on results.

105
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,440
Maybe our project

106
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,520
was wrong from the beginning.

107
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,800
The original intention of your project

108
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,880
isn't wrong.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,280
I just think

110
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,120
we can improve the plan

111
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,620
to achieve a win-win with the villagers.

112
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,820
It's been a long time since I've tasted this flavor.

113
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,360
Actually, our Jindu,

114
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,200
as a corporate group,

115
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,320
if we don't want to

116
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,560
be crushed by heavy economic burdens,

117
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,040
must constantly expand,

118
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,480
diversify acquisitions and business,

119
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,200
or be devoured by competitors.

120
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,440
Longchuan Group is the same.

121
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,680
Yes,

122
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,480
it's a war where life and death hang by a thread.

123
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,200
Indeed,

124
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,400
business is like a battlefield.

125
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,800
There are many things

126
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
you can't learn in school.

127
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,080
The current Jindu Group

128
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,340
has already begun to rot from within.

129
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,800
Long Baiqi, that predatory vulture,

130
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,680
has been coveting us for a long time.

131
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Jindu Group

132
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,890
was built by your own hands.

133
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,720
Trust me,

134
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll help you protect it.

135
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,820
The master is back.

136
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,080
He said he wanted to wait for you

137
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,560
to celebrate his birthday together.
