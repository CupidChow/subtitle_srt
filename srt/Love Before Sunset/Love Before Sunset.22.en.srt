1
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,720
Let's go! Fight them!

2
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,650
The number you have dialed is powered off.

3
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,320
All of you,

4
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,960
look at this carefully.

5
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,640
These contracts were all signed by you.

6
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,090
Calling the police won't help.

7
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,920
Because these contracts

8
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,840
are legally binding.

9
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,680
Your current actions

10
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,539
have already violated

11
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,020
our company's interests.

12
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,320
Bullshit!

13
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,120
That contract of mine

14
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,479
was signed because you tricked me.

15
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
It doesn't count!

16
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,479
Right! It doesn't count!

17
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,160
What good does it do if you say it doesn't count?

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,080
Guards!

19
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,200
Bulldoze the tea garden!

20
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,479
Just you dare!

21
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,759
If you've got the guts,

22
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,759
run me over with your bulldozer!

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,440
Mr. Lu, what should we do?

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,360
Mr. Lu,

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,560
if you drive through, someone will die!

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,600
Useless!

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,130
Get out of my way!

28
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,199
Guards!

29
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,240
Drag them away!

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,320
Lu Yi!

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,079
How can you do this?

32
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,940
Move again and we won't be polite!

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,079
Lu Yi, what are you doing?

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,420
What are you doing?

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,840
Didn't Lu tell you?

36
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,320
All of you

37
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,840
are beyond salvation now.

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,520
Anduo.

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,960
Don't waste words on him.

40
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,000
You bastard!

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,960
You little punk!

42
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,490
Grandma!

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,040
Grandma, don't go over there!

44
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,900
You rotten kid!

45
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,760
Your mother has been searching for you so desperately all these years.

46
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,200
Get them out of here.

47
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,800
Hurry!

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,680
Stop them!

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,280
Go!

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,200
What are you doing?

51
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,520
Do something now!

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,240
Anduo!

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,480
Anduo!

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,840
Anduo!

55
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,400
Anduo!

56
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,200
Anduo!

57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,160
Get lost!

58
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,280
Get out of my way!

59
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,160
You're President Lu from Jindu Group, right?

60
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,290
You're exactly who we're looking for.

61
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,680
Whose side are you on?

62
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Why did you hit me?

63
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,120
Are you crazy?

64
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,640
Run!

65
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,520
Doctor!

66
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,600
Doctor!

67
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,480
This way!

68
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,960
Wait a moment!

69
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,640
Quick! We're short on blood supply. What's your blood type?

70
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,400
Type O.

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,460
Good. Come with me.

72
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,600
How much blood do you need to draw?

73
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,360
For one surgery, we need

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,840
two to three units of blood.

75
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,960
200 ml per unit.

76
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,000
Fine, take all from me.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,240
Are you trying to kill yourself?

78
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,320
One person can't donate more than 400 ml of blood.

79
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,600
It could be life-threatening.

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
It's fine, take it all from me.

81
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,280
Which way?

82
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
Over here.

83
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,080
Doctor, how is she?

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,920
Ms. Lin is out of danger now.

85
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,320
But she needs immediate heart surgery.

86
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,159
We need a family member to sign the consent form.

87
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,159
Heart surgery?

88
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,800
Yes.

89
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,440
Right now?

90
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,040
Yes.

91
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
She has no family.

92
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Can I sign for her?

93
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,780
What's your relationship to her?

94
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,540
I'm her boyfriend.

95
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,440
All right.

96
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,280
But if anything happens,

97
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,240
you'll have to take responsibility.

98
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,120
Okay.

99
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,640
Where do I sign?

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,300
Right here.

101
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,500
Thank you, doctor.

102
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,850
Please take care of her.

103
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,640
That place is beautiful.

104
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,800
Today,

105
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,400
we've bravely taken the first step.

106
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,640
How did it go, doctor?

107
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,080
The surgery went very smoothly.

108
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,620
Thank you, doctor.

109
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,120
Thank you, doctor.

110
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,320
When will she wake up?

111
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,320
The anesthesia hasn't worn off yet.

112
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,380
It will take some time for her to regain consciousness.

113
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,160
Thank you.

114
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,280
You're welcome.

115
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,360
In the next few days,

116
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,200
her minimally invasive incision

117
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
may cause some discomfort and pain.

118
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,720
These are all normal reactions.

119
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,050
You don't need to worry.

120
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,200
Thank you, doctor.

121
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,960
Thank you.

122
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,640
As you can see,

123
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,020
our project is progressing well.

124
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,520
I expect that within this year,

125
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,240
we will achieve a 15% profit growth.

126
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
Mr. Lu!

127
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,760
What the hell!

128
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,400
Playing dirty, aren't you?

129
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,160
Come at me. I'm ready for you.

130
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,200
What right do you have to question me?

131
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,880
I am the one in charge of this project.

132
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,440
Get out of my way!

133
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:02,720
I...

134
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,280
Ye.

135
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,100
What are you doing?

136
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,620
This is the board meeting.

137
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,050
This is not a place for your insolence.

138
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,040
Fine.

139
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,480
Very well.

140
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,600
From today on,

141
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,330
I'll play your game.

142
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,240
Don't regret it.

143
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,720
What are you all doing?

144
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,920
Why did you let him in?

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Get out!

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,720
It's alright now.

147
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,600
Everyone, please sit down.

148
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,530
Let's continue.

149
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,760
[Mute Alarm Waveform Record Non-invasive Main Menu]

150
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,090
[Mute Alarm Waveform Record BP Main Menu]

151
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,040
You're awake.

152
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,040
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,920
I'm late.

154
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,760
Don't move.

155
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,040
How is everyone?

156
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Everyone is fine.

157
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,520
We're all waiting for you to recover

158
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,250
so we can go back to the village.

159
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,080
I thought

160
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,480
I would never see you again.

161
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,160
Silly child.

162
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,900
How could that happen?

163
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,680
Waking up

164
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,320
and seeing you here

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,800
feels so good.

166
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,890
I'll always be here from now on.

167
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,640
It's Pang De.

168
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,440
Mr. Lu.

169
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,320
The test results for the new batch of tea processing are out.

170
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,720
Still not satisfactory.

171
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,200
Okay, I understand.

172
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,250
You go ahead with your work.

173
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,560
Be good.

174
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,130
Wait for me to come back.

175
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,920
Okay.

176
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,520
Take good care of her.
