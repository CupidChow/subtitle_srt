1
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,640
It's raining.

2
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,120
That's what you get for stealing tea.

3
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,280
Fatty!

4
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,240
Mr. Li!

5
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,200
Anduo!

6
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,920
I didn't see clearly it was you guys.

7
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,200
Why are you using this like a water gun?

8
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,520
Sorry, I didn't see clearly.

9
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,720
It's fine.

10
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,000
Um...

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,120
We need this sign for our shoot.

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,400
Could you sell it to us?

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,200
We'll pay 2,000.

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,480
Director Lu, what are you doing?

15
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,320
You want this?

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,920
Take it.

17
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,800
No need to pay that much. It only cost 200.

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,360
He sprayed us for nothing.

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,220
Alright, just give him the money.

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,479
Okay.

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,729
Are you alright?

22
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm fine. Are you okay?

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,280
Um,

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,979
let's go back and change our clothes.

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,280
Mr. Li.

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,280
I'm sorry, Anduo.

27
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
Anduo.

28
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,980
Got 200 yuan. Let's have hot pot tonight.

29
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,200
We're here.

30
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,180
I should have brought more money.

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,680
What are they doing here?

32
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,720
They're up to no good.

33
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,800
Come on.

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,400
Right here.

35
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,840
Come.

36
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,940
They live here.

37
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:11,940
Shilan.

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,280
Call them out.

39
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,920
Yeah, tell them to come out.

40
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,320
Yes, come out.

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,850
Let's go.

42
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,360
Come out now.

43
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,850
What's going on?

44
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,290
What's happening here?

45
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,960
I heard from Li

46
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,760
that they need this for filming,

47
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,720
and each piece is worth 200 yuan. Is that true?

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,480
Lu.

49
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,960
Do you want this too?

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,240
Take everything, don't leave anything behind.

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
Okay.

52
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,600
Come on.

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,320
Line up, don't rush.

54
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,980
Cooperating with Longbaiqi.

55
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,360
Yes.

56
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,160
Why are we cooperating with Longchuan Group?

57
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,490
If the chairman were here, he definitely wouldn't approve.

58
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,200
Right.

59
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,040
I think there's no reason for anyone to hesitate.

60
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,700
Given the current situation.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What's wrong, Ma?

62
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,580
Everyone, take a look at this.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,530
Long Baiqi is attempting a hostile takeover.

64
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,680
Once she acquires 20% of our shares,

65
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,120
we'll have to merge our financial statements

66
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,580
with the Long Chuan Group.

67
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,480
What do you want to do?

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,800
Activate the poison pill strategy

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
and dilute the shares immediately.

70
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,720
Is there really no other way?

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,650
There is one contingency plan.

72
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,050
It would require all shareholders

73
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,880
to buy back shares and then cancel them.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,320
Do I really need to explain this?

75
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,160
Isn't there a win-win solution?

76
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,720
I think

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,640
it's quite challenging.

78
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,560
From my interactions these past few days,

79
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,220
I've found these villagers are quite stubborn.

80
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,400
Stubborn.

81
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,180
We need to find a way

82
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,610
to get the villagers to sign voluntarily.

83
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,000
As it stands now,

84
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,000
the tea garden is the villagers' livelihood.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,440
To get them to sign,

86
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,320
either the company buys at a high price,

87
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,320
or we negotiate a partnership for joint development.

88
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,240
Cooperation is better than competition.

89
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,040
This is called using others' strength to your advantage.

90
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,760
Rather than competing with others,

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
it's better to cooperate with them.

92
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,360
The situation is very clear now.

93
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,500
Longchuan Group has us cornered.

94
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,159
If we don't want to dilute our equity,

95
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,400
and avoid buybacks and cancellations, cooperating with them

96
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,000
will maximize our benefits.

97
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,780
Long Baiqi's proposal is that

98
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,240
as long as we cooperate with them

99
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,240
to secure that 5-billion provincial project together,

100
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,800
she'll consider stopping the acquisition.

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,260
Our Jindu Group's plan...

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,040
What cooperation are we even talking about?

103
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,900
They're clearly threatening us.

104
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,300
It's a classic diversionary tactic.

105
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,240
We at Jindu have the technology.

106
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,520
While Longchuan Group has several major financial consortiums backing them.

107
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,580
They have abundant capital. Cooperating with them...

108
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,360
We'll definitely secure the project

109
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,160
and split the profits as agreed.

110
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,370
It's beneficial for both parties.

111
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,880
Everyone,

112
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,570
what are your thoughts?

113
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,650
Why don't we just beat them up and drive them away?

114
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,420
What era are you living in?

115
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,200
Are you in a gang or something?

116
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,280
Violence won't solve the fundamental problem.

117
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,080
How can you be so primitive?

118
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,480
If you ask me,

119
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,010
we should make them leave on their own.

120
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,170
What, you want to set fires too?

121
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,300
Get out of here.

122
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,640
What I mean is,

123
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,650
let's use one of the 36 stratagems.

124
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,560
We can dress up as ghosts and scare them away.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
Even if we can't scare them away,

126
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,650
once rumors spread that this village is haunted,

127
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,250
who would dare to come here?

128
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,320
Mr. Ma,

129
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,740
I'd like to hear your thoughts first.

130
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,440
At this point,

131
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,400
there's no better solution.

132
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,360
If we cooperate with Longchuan Group,

133
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,890
regarding the chairman...

134
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,120
As long as everyone agrees,

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,040
we can follow the normal procedures.

136
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,240
We just need the board's approval.

137
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,560
As for the chairman,

138
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,260
I'll obtain his authorization when the time comes.

139
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,050
Don't worry about that.

140
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,920
After all, our group

141
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,980
is in a very difficult situation now.

142
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,080
Yes.

143
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,840
Yes.

144
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,090
In that case,

145
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,640
please sign the agreement.

146
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,440
You're so mean.

147
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,920
No.

148
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,260
Are you two trying to scare me?

149
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,400
Put it away quickly.

150
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,159
Hope we're not interrupting.

151
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,760
No, no. We just finished eating and were chatting.

152
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,090
I can't hold it anymore.

153
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,690
I told you not to eat so much.

154
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,640
Is he okay?

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,600
He's fine.

156
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
He has a sensitive stomach and needs the bathroom when he eats too much.

157
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,280
Here.

158
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,040
Take this.

159
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,880
As I promised you last time,

160
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,940
I brought you some Nanshui tea to try.

161
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
Thank you. I'll try it in a bit.

162
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,680
Why do you seem so happy today?

163
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,740
Of course I have something to be happy about.

164
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,760
What is it?

165
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,320
See for yourself.

166
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,240
What's wrong?

167
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,880
Longchuan Group has officially announced

168
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,440
that they hold 19.5% of Jindu's shares.

169
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,170
How many times do I have to say no entry?

170
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,440
Why didn't you wait for me in the office?

171
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,330
Mr. Long,

172
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,800
this man doesn't have an appointment,

173
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,520
so I didn't dare let him in.

174
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,520
Listen carefully.

175
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,650
This is Mr. Lu from Jindu Group.

176
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,240
If you dare stop him again next time,

177
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,760
pack your things and go home immediately.

178
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,280
Yes.

179
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,240
Did you hear me?

180
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,040
Yes, yes, yes.

181
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,160
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,520
It's fine.

183
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,370
Can you please work on your temper?

184
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,160
They're just doing their job properly.

185
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,120
So it's my fault.

186
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,240
For not notifying them in advance.

187
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,920
Let's go.
