1
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,200
China's tea beverage market revenue

2
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,960
increased from 97.9 billion yuan in 2021

3
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,920
to

4
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,840
142.8 billion yuan.

5
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,759
By 2025, it is projected that

6
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,680
the tea beverage market revenue

7
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,400
will reach 300 billion yuan.

8
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,759
The industry's compound growth rate

9
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,520
is expected to reach 2%.

10
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,560
So,

11
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,690
what are the market trends?

12
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,600
The market competition is fierce now.

13
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,880
Products are updated rapidly.

14
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,440
Many brands in the market are engaged in price wars

15
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,120
and frequently launching promotional activities.

16
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,039
So what we need to consider now is

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,240
whether our Nanshui Tea

18
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,520
should abandon its high-end positioning

19
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
and move toward a more affordable price range

20
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,050
to respond to competition.

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,680
I believe our products

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,280
should meet young consumers'

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,479
desire for novelty

24
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,940
and their need for health.

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,120
I think sugar-free

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,080
and low-sugar Chinese tea beverages

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,560
are a good entry point.

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,880
We can refine our product categories,

29
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,540
make the design more upscale,

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,680
and offer two price tiers: medium and high.

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,800
I've contacted several contract manufacturers.

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,600
Once our product takes off,

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,240
we can directly acquire

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,810
their complete production lines.

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,000
The main issue now is

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,200
with the processing technique of Nanshui tea.

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,960
Anduo says

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,090
Nanshui tea is currently inexpensive

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,920
because its processing methods are relatively simple.

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,280
The tea from Nanshui Village

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,360
is currently only sold as raw tea or semi-finished tea.

42
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,520
So how do other

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,800
tea factories process it?

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,560
The industrial process is too heavy,

45
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,560
which fails to bring out Nanshui tea's unique flavor.

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,520
We'll need to discuss this with Anduo later

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,720
to see how to solve it.

48
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,080
Is the initial investment sufficient?

49
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,120
It's enough.

50
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,170
The projects that Jindu previously monopolized

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,120
have now been secured by us.

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,640
I've also found several companies to handle operations.

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,720
The profits will be sufficient

54
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,000
for the development of our tea beverage project.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,600
Good.

56
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,360
But, Mr. Lu,

57
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,600
won't this hurt Jindu?

58
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,079
My goal

59
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,000
is to simultaneously block Longchuan Group

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,530
and all partner companies under Jindu Group.

61
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,560
Start by taking over the small projects they don't care about.

62
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,600
By the time they realize what's happening,

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,660
it will be too late.

64
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,560
Wait.

65
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,700
I understand about Longchuan Group,

66
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,240
but...

67
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,720
Jindu is our own company, isn't it?

68
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,600
I have my own plans for that.

69
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,410
In the next few days,

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,600
I want you two to make another trip to Nanshui Village

71
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,000
to purchase some tea samples.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,720
We need to

73
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,410
conduct a processing test.

74
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,800
By the way,

75
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,240
what's going on with Jindu Group?

76
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,440
They've gone quiet.

77
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,600
Do they dare to come back?

78
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,800
If they do, we'll chase them away again.

79
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm not worried about them coming.

80
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,680
I'm worried about the contract I signed.

81
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,040
What if they really come back

82
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,240
and take my tea garden?

83
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,279
If they want to take it, let them have it.

84
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,959
Didn't you agree to sell when you signed the contract?

85
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,200
I only signed that contract

86
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,560
because Anduo signed it.

87
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,760
I thought you all were going to sign too.

88
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,280
Recently, there's a company

89
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,440
coming to our village every day to check the tea.

90
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,400
The price of raw tea is going to increase.

91
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,640
You should ask for more when the time comes.

92
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,040
Now that you mention it, I just remembered.

93
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,020
Some people visited my tea garden a few days ago.

94
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,920
They wanted a large quantity.

95
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,600
And the price was reasonable.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,530
We've never had this price in previous years.

97
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,000
They're paying almost the same as semi-finished tea prices.

98
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,080
Since old Lin left,

99
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,050
the tea prices in the village haven't gone up.

100
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,600
Back then, Lin

101
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,920
begged you all to learn tea roasting from him.

102
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,280
None of you wanted to learn.

103
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,880
Now you regret it, don't you?

104
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,300
Do you think Lin Anduo might know?

105
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,800
Old Lin probably passed it down to her.

106
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,360
If she knew how,

107
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,360
she would have taught us already.

108
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,760
She has the same temperament as her father.

109
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,240
It's a craft passed down for thousands of years,

110
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,040
and in our generation,

111
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,560
it's lost forever.

112
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,520
What a shame.

113
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,880
This is probably our last time picking tea.

114
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,600
Our tea garden

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,800
might not even be here next year.

116
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,810
I never expected

117
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,600
we'd get such a good price at the very end.

118
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
It's fate.

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,600
Indeed.

120
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,720
Try this

121
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,880
and see which one tastes better.

122
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,100
This was roasted by my father.

123
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,440
Take it and compare the taste.

124
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,400
The tea aroma is delightful.

125
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,880
The flavor is much richer.

126
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,700
It has a sweet aftertaste.

127
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,640
No bitterness at all.

128
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,840
The roasting time.

129
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,040
The temperature control.

130
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,770
The moisture of the tea leaves.

131
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,850
What's the difference?

132
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,130
Unfortunately.

133
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,520
My father didn't leave any notes.

134
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,520
Did he ever take any apprentices?

135
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,840
Apprentices?

136
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,960
I only know that with the traditional tea roasting technique,

137
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,320
if you miss even one step,

138
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,920
the taste will be different.

139
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,320
The elderly in the village now

140
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,409
mostly only know the basic roasting methods.

141
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,919
If you want to perfectly recreate

142
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,049
the traditional taste of Nanshui tea,

143
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,090
it's probably very difficult.

144
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,040
It's not a big deal.

145
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Look at you all, so discouraged.

146
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,600
I'll go

147
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,000
and consult with some tea experts.

148
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,840
I don't believe that

149
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,760
some traditional tea-making technique from Nanshui Village

150
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,890
could be completely lost to the world.

151
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,730
Mr. Li, something terrible happened!

152
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
Mr. Li, it's an emergency!

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,680
Mr. Li!

154
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,280
What's going on? Why are you so panicked?

155
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Jindu Group is driving bulldozers into our village!

156
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,200
Jindu Group's vehicles.

157
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,130
Hurry up and call everyone!

158
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,560
Jindu Group

159
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,980
is driving bulldozers into our village!

160
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,000
Jindu Group!

161
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,720
Jindu Group!

162
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,240
Get up quickly!

163
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,560
Hurry, get up!

164
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,920
Damn it!

165
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,320
Jindu Group

166
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,770
is coming to the village with bulldozers!

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,840
We can't let them enter the village.

168
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,120
What's happening?

169
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,080
Hurry!
