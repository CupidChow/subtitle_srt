1
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,600
You're awake.

2
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,600
Don't worry.

3
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,260
The village elder applied medicine for you.

4
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,240
I heard

5
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,920
you came to the village to shoot a documentary.

6
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,840
Yes.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,600
What happened to my clothes?

8
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,240
Please apply these herbs on him.

9
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,720
Okay.

10
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,280
It might hurt a bit, try to bear with it.

11
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,050
Director Lu,

12
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,039
she says it might hurt a bit.

13
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,100
Try to bear with it.

14
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,560
No.

15
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,400
This location is pretty nice.

16
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,160
Yes,

17
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,920
it looks great.

18
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,460
It's just a bit hot though.

19
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,720
Too hot.

20
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,760
I need to take this call.

21
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,360
You two take the drone

22
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,800
and fly it further out to get more exterior shots.

23
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Okay.

24
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,640
Can Fatty fly it?

25
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,640
Champion of the No. 2 Elementary School remote control car competition.

26
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,840
As long as it doesn't crash, we're good.

27
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Can you handle it?

28
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,020
This view isn't good. Move it over there.

29
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,360
Let me see how it looks.

30
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,360
Good,

31
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,920
not bad.

32
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,140
This...

33
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,960
No!

34
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,560
I hit something!

35
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,080
I crashed it!

36
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,810
How were you flying that thing?

37
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
Air raid!

38
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,680
Air raid!

39
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,159
Go find it! Hurry!

40
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,620
Find it quickly! Find it quickly!

41
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,920
Got it! Got it!

42
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,159
I got it!

43
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,040
Which one of you troublemakers did this?

44
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,000
I did it.

45
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,720
No, I did it.

46
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,320
I did it. You missed.

47
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
It was definitely me.

48
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,200
Why are you fighting to take credit?

49
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,530
Whoever broke it pays for it, understand?

50
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,320
Do you know how expensive this thing is?

51
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,180
Even if I sold all of you, it wouldn't cover the cost.

52
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,850
Talk nicely to the kids.

53
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,700
Get your parents here.

54
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm sorry, I'm their guardian.

55
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,600
You three, apologize to the gentleman now.

56
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,160
Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.

57
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,960
No.

58
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,560
This...

59
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,960
Are these three your children?

60
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,620
I'm their kindergarten teacher.

61
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,660
So I'm kind of their guardian too.

62
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,680
I was wondering.

63
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,650
I thought you couldn't possibly have already...

64
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
Already what?

65
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,840
So early...

66
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,970
Already married with kids.

67
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,000
Well...

68
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,320
You saved me last time.

69
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,560
Let's forget about this time.

70
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,420
It's not a big deal. No need to talk to kids like that.

71
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,580
How many times have I told you?

72
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,080
Mind your manners in public.

73
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,600
Yes.

74
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,460
You should mind your manners too.

75
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,440
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,880
Hey,

77
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,220
pay attention.

78
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,400
You three are causing trouble again. Stand still!

79
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,080
Let's go home.

80
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,960
Take more photos over there.

81
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,090
Take more shots.

82
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,800
What are you doing here?

83
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
I often bring them here to paint.

84
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
About yesterday,

85
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm really sorry.

86
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,400
It's fine.

87
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,600
This place is beautiful.

88
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,200
You made the right choice filming here.

89
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,400
Yes, it's truly beautiful.

90
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,080
How about I take you to see the tea garden?

91
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,280
Great!

92
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,090
I'd be delighted. These two kids of yours,

93
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,320
why don't you two go play with these gentlemen?

94
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,400
Okay.

95
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,960
Come.

96
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,240
Go play with the uncles,

97
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,880
let's go have some fun.

98
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,720
Be careful.

99
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,600
Uncle will take you to play.

100
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,880
Come, let's go.

101
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,260
Please.

102
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,690
Where's the slingshot?

103
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,740
Be careful.

104
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Watch out.

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,960
For generations, the people of Nanshui Village

106
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,360
have been growing tea for hundreds of years.

107
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,290
The tea from here was once sent to the imperial palace

108
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,540
as tribute tea.

109
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,040
Yes, that's exactly why we came here.

110
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,720
Take a smell.

111
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,260
See how different the tea here is from other places.

112
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,770
Your Nanshui Village has a high elevation

113
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,720
and significant temperature differences between day and night, so the tea produced here

114
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,040
stays tender from early spring to late autumn.

115
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,400
Compared to ordinary tea,

116
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,260
it has a special fresh fragrance.

117
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,850
You know a lot about tea.

118
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,280
I did some research before coming here.

119
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,039
I usually drink more coffee than tea.

120
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,169
Director Lu,

121
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,840
there's something up ahead.

122
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,200
Go take a look.

123
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,200
Okay.

124
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,600
Hurry!

125
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,080
This is it.

126
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,800
This is the sign.

127
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,160
Do the villagers have some grudge against them?

128
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,170
In Nanshui Village,

129
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,720
never mention the words 'Jindu Group.'

130
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,040
Why?

131
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,120
If anyone dares to mention Jindu Group,

132
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,440
the villagers

133
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,280
will smash their cars.

134
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Smash their cars?

135
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,280
Cars.

136
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,680
Look,

137
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,850
this whole area is Village Chief Li's tea garden.

138
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,480
You silly kid,

139
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,200
daring to steal tea.
