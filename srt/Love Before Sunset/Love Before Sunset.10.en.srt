1
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,280
What are we supposed to do now?

2
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,080
Don't rush.

3
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,730
There should be a free mingling session soon.

4
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,000
I feel so uncomfortable.

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,240
Just relax and do whatever you want.

6
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,770
Eat and drink as you please.

7
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,800
Didn't you skip dinner tonight?

8
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,130
This is perfect timing.

9
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,400
You're right. Might as well eat.

10
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,120
Delicious.

11
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,720
Don't eat too much or your dress will feel tight later.

12
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,400
Here you go, Mr. Chen.

13
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,160
Try our tea from Nanshui Village.

14
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,600
I've been drinking it myself lately.

15
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,720
Here you are, Mr. Wang.

16
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,320
Thank you.

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,560
This tea from Nanshui Village...

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,420
Has always been hand-processed.

19
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,440
Because of the high altitude in that area,

20
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,560
The temperature difference between day and night is significant,

21
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,039
So the tea leaves grow in early spring and late autumn,

22
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,039
While maintaining their tenderness

23
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,970
And having an exceptional flavor.

24
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,960
Both of you,

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Please try our Nanshui Village tea.

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,160
Here's another package for you.

27
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,560
If you like it, please help spread the word.

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,600
Nanshui tea is also an intangible cultural heritage.

29
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,730
The hand-processing technique makes it worth tasting.

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,540
You're really playing the part well.

31
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
This hand-processing craftsmanship

32
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,960
Has almost been lost.

33
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,620
So I sincerely hope everyone can help us promote it.

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,380
You're really something.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,480
Distinguished guests,

36
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,000
welcome to the Light of Hope Charity Gala.

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,800
On this special evening,

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,560
let us join hands

39
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,640
and demonstrate boundless love through our actions.

40
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,240
Let every contribution

41
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,600
become a ray of light illuminating others' lives.

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

43
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,920
Still can't get through?

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
No one's answering.

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,880
Do you think Mr. Lu might be in danger?

46
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,980
I hope nothing's happened to him.

47
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,200
Let's go.

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,760
Ladies and gentlemen.

49
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,800
Now we come to the highlight of tonight's charity gala,

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,760
the exciting charity auction.

51
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,760
Precious artworks,

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,440
limited edition luxury items,

53
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
and personal items donated by celebrities

54
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,040
will be presented one by one.

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,280
And now, let's welcome

56
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,680
our first auction item.

57
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,880
The Yongle Ruyi-shouldered

58
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,360
double-dragon plum vase with floral and fruit patterns.

59
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,200
Starting bid: 710,000 euros.

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,480
The bottle is broken.

61
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,240
Sir, please don't leave yet.

62
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,600
Could our staff please

63
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,399
escort this gentleman backstage

64
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,640
to discuss compensation matters.

65
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,769
Take him to the back.

66
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm sorry about this.

67
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,720
That's expensive, isn't it?

68
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,280
This won't affect the next segment.

69
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,360
Of course a Yongle blue and white porcelain from the Ming Dynasty is expensive.

70
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,320
But this person,

71
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,600
why does he look so familiar?

72
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,000
Do you know?

73
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,159
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,690
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

75
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,600
Sir.

76
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,600
The item you just broke is quite expensive.

77
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,400
It sold for 710,000 euros.

78
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,960
710,000 euros?

79
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,600
That's 5.6 million yuan.

80
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,130
Will you be paying by card or...

81
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,680
Sir.

82
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,040
You can't leave without paying.

83
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,660
I don't have the money.

84
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,640
Where are you?

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Is this what you call professional?

86
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,680
Hello.

87
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,360
Your employee has broken

88
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,320
our artwork worth 710,000 euros

89
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,050
into pieces.

90
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,490
We need to discuss compensation with you.

91
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,290
What compensation are you talking about?

92
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,930
Aren't you his boss?

93
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,090
What boss? What are you talking about?

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,130
Sir, it's like this.

95
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,320
Employment relationships

96
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,920
are protected by labor laws.

97
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,200
Any damages caused

98
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,600
during his working hours

99
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,050
You must bear part of the responsibility.

100
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,080
What responsibility?

101
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,409
Are you out of your mind?

102
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,409
Good at ruining things, bad at getting them done.

103
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,690
What do we do now?

104
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,010
Since he refuses to pay,

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,440
there's nothing we can do.

106
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,500
Call Manager Qian.

107
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,610
Mr. Qian,

108
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,320
we have an order here.

109
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,400
Yes.

110
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,370
The client has no money.

111
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,000
Right.

112
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,240
So for the follow-up,

113
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,970
please help us keep an eye on it.

114
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,420
Sure thing.

115
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,280
The next artwork we're introducing is

116
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,800
called 'Light of Hope'.

117
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,320
It was created by the renowned artist

118
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,880
Master Shen Jianhua.

119
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,080
This piece is valued at 300,000 yuan.

120
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,760
The bidding starts now.

121
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,200
This is the painting by Director Shen we saw last time.

122
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,840
We look forward to your generous contribution.

123
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,880
That's impressive.

124
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,600
You like it?

125
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,700
I'll have him paint one for you later.

126
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,200
That's not appropriate.

127
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,900
We'll talk about it later.

128
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,050
He'll definitely do me this favor.

129
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,040
300,000.

130
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,360
300,000.

131
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,720
We have a bid of 300,000 here.

132
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,600
350,000.

133
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,960
350,000.

134
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,960
400,000.

135
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,560
400,000, do we have any higher bids?

136
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,360
400,000, going once.

137
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,240
400,000, going twice.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,530
Is there anyone bidding higher than 400,000?

139
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,280
1 million.

140
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,130
