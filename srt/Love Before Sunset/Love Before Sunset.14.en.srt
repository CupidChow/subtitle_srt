1
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,360
Ms. Anduo.

2
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,680
Yaoyao, why are you awake?

3
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,360
Ms. Anduo.

4
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,240
Are you angry with Uncle Luye?

5
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,560
But it's okay.

6
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,560
It will all pass.

7
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,079
Don't worry, Yaoyao.

8
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,120
This is...

9
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,720
This is from Uncle Luye for you.

10
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
I forgot to give it to you yesterday.

11
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,410
Are you happy today?

12
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,280
Yes.

13
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,320
Alright, come down now.

14
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,200
I'm tired.

15
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,680
I saw you earlier.

16
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,920
What did you do after school?

17
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,959
Nothing much.

18
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,079
You're all being so good today.

19
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,540
Would you like some candy?

20
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,200
Yes.

21
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,080
One for each of you.

22
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,600
Here you go, Yaoyao. And one more for you.

23
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,080
Yaoyao.

24
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,720
I gave you candy.

25
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,450
Can you help me with something?

26
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,480
Sure.

27
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,080
What's this?

28
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,920
It's tea leaves.

29
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,120
Do you think if we give this to Ms. Anduo,

30
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,600
will she like it?

31
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,400
She will.

32
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Then can you

33
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,440
help me give this to Ms. Anduo?

34
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,600
Yes.

35
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,400
You can?

36
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,800
Thank you.

37
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,010
I'm counting on you.

38
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,440
Good girl.

39
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,200
Ms. Anduo,

40
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,040
does Mr. Lu like you?

41
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
I don't think so.

42
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,000
Even we children can tell.

43
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,480
When he looks at you,

44
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
there are stars in his eyes.

45
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Please don't be angry anymore.

46
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,800
I'm angry

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,680
because he lied to me.

48
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,200
I know.

49
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,880
You're angry because

50
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,810
there's another woman around him.

51
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,080
It's like your most precious thing

52
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,940
has been touched by someone else.

53
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,760
You little girl,

54
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,409
have you been watching too many short videos?

55
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,000
It's getting late. Go to bed now.

56
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,680
Mr. Long.

57
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,460
What's the situation with Jindu?

58
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Jindu Group claims that

59
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,340
they have cash flow problems.

60
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,080
Draft a

61
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
formal notice to them immediately.

62
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,360
If the project cannot

63
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,760
proceed smoothly within a month,

64
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,360
according to our agreement,

65
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,600
they must transfer their shares to us.

66
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,330
Understood.

67
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,280
I've given them enough face.

68
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,360
Whatever happens next is their own doing.

69
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,080
Also, I've already reached an agreement

70
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,800
with that female model's agency.

71
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,920
All her activities will be suspended for five years.

72
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,780
She won't have any opportunity to appear in public.

73
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,760
You may go now.

74
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,400
Everyone.

75
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,890
This is an official notice from Longchuan Group.

76
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,480
With the chairman absent from our board,

77
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,600
we must make a decision quickly

78
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,080
on whether to launch the new project.

79
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,880
Otherwise, our Jindu Group

80
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,240
will face breach of contract penalties.

81
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,480
This golf resort project

82
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,600
still has no results from Lu Ye's end.

83
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,320
Starting a new project now,

84
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,920
isn't that too risky?

85
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,640
Longchuan Group's funds

86
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,360
have already been received.

87
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,200
It's sufficient for the initial project launch.

88
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,920
What if Lu Ye resolves the issues?

89
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,280
Will the group run both projects simultaneously?

90
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,560
We initially agreed to cooperate with Longchuan Group

91
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,880
to slow down their equity acquisition.

92
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,080
If this project doesn't launch,

93
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,960
they'll still demand equity compensation.

94
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,280
No matter how you look at it,

95
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,120
Longchuan Group wins either way.

96
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,960
What can we do when we're short on funds?

97
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,290
When you're under someone's roof, you have to bow your head.

98
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
We have no choice.

99
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,770
That's all we can do.

100
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,960
What else can we do?

101
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,890
Don't you agree?

102
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
What we're facing now is

103
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,480
that we only have one option:

104
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,520
to cooperate with Longchuan Group.

105
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,640
So I suggest

106
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,600
we put this new project on the agenda today.

107
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,120
I disagree.

108
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,680
According to our agreement,

109
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,880
I still have one week.

110
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,960
Lu Ye,

111
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,000
time waits for no one.

112
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,520
The slow progress of this project has already

113
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,780
caused significant impact on our group.

114
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,280
Besides, Longchuan Group is

115
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,400
pressuring us constantly.

116
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,760
How can we wait for you another week?

117
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,360
For the overall benefit of our group,

118
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,020
we must resolve the current situation quickly.

119
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,200
But withdrawing from the resort project

120
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,680
is not the only solution.

121
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,680
I propose that I take over this project.

122
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,320
With my market analysis expertise

123
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,380
and project management experience,

124
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,860
I can optimize the project

125
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,400
and speed up progress within three days.

126
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,480
I guarantee results.

127
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,400
Fine,

128
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,480
if you can handle it.

129
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,960
Let's make the handover now.

130
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,520
Brother Ye, to be honest,

131
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,800
I think your approach

132
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,840
is too soft.

133
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,800
For these difficult villagers,

134
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,400
we must use tougher methods.

135
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,530
For example, bypass the villagers

136
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,320
and directly obtain the tea garden development lease.

137
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
And the villagers who lose their tea

138
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,800
will naturally leave.

139
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,160
What you're doing would harm

140
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,760
the interests of all villagers.

141
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,420
Aren't you afraid of causing bigger conflicts?

142
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,440
I'm confused, Brother Ye.

143
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,600
Are you really on Jindu Group's side

144
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,480
or are you with Nanshui Village?

145
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,520
I actually think

146
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,050
you should manage your personal life better.

147
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,240
Don't let those

148
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,000
gossip stories about your model girlfriends

149
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,130
become an embarrassment to our group.

150
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,800
The gossip about you and your brother

151
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,480
must be even more colorful than mine.

152
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,000
Don't be so ungrateful.

153
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,240
Enough!

154
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,560
For the resort project,

155
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,530
I'm giving you two three more days.

156
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,120
Compete fairly

157
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,000
and use whatever means you have.

158
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,680
We only care about results.

159
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,290
Whoever is more capable will run the project.

160
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,280
Everyone,

161
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,440
any objections?

162
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,700
No objections.

163
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,480
I have no objections.

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,960
Neither do I.
