1
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,320
Mr. Lu,

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,600
something big happened. Come quickly!

3
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,210
I'll send you the location.

4
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,360
Go to hell!

5
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,520
I will definitely settle this score with you.

6
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,360
Just you wait.

7
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,480
Duoduo!

8
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,720
Duoduo!

9
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,400
Let's go.

10
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,850
How are you feeling?

11
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,520
Where am I?

12
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,560
My place.

13
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,360
Your place?

14
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,800
Before.

15
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,579
You scared me to death.

16
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,720
Without my permission,

17
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,320
don't meet with anyone from the company.

18
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,380
Do you understand?

19
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,440
I...

20
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,780
Lie down first.

21
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,800
Rest well here.

22
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,490
I'm going to the office.

23
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,120
Please keep an eye on things here.

24
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,380
I'll be out for a while.

25
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
That's enough.

26
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,120
You've had too much to drink.

27
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,920
I'm not drunk.

28
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,120
Enough.

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,120
I know all these years

30
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,380
you've been suppressing your feelings.

31
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,240
This isn't the life I wanted.

32
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,440
What can I do?

33
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,520
It's time to let go.

34
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,960
Some things,

35
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,400
once they've begun,

36
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,440
can't be stopped.

37
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,380
Since I've made my choice,

38
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,140
I'll see it through to the end.

39
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,360
Since I've chosen this path,

40
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,400
I must go all the way.

41
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,400
Feeling better now?

42
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,720
Damn it.

43
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,080
I originally wanted to create an accident

44
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,560
so you could die quietly.

45
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,560
But you're too damn lucky,

46
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,960
escaping every time against the odds.

47
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,800
Damn it.

48
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,880
This time,

49
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
you won't be so lucky.

50
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,720
Hurry!

51
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,440
Quick!

52
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,440
Beat him!

53
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,880
I told you before,

54
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,520
once you're on Mr. Qian's list,

55
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,980
there's no escape for you.

56
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,720
Mr. Lu,

57
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,060
quickly, untie Mr. Lu!

58
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,520
Damn.

59
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,760
Mr. Lu, what do you say

60
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,200
we do with this guy?

61
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,920
Tell me who sent you.

62
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,159
Don't worry, Mr. Lu,

63
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,120
when it comes to interrogation,

64
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,250
we have plenty of ways to make him talk.

65
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,800
Yes.

66
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,120
Yes.

67
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,600
It was Lu Yi.

68
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,960
Don't kill me.

69
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,440
Mr. Lu, why did you come all the way here to meet?

70
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,730
I wanted to see you today

71
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,120
for nothing special,

72
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,760
just wanted to show you

73
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,640
something.

74
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,720
This...

75
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,200
This...

76
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,560
Mr. Li,

77
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,960
you've been my father's subordinate for many years.

78
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
I've always respected you greatly.

79
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,740
But abusing your position

80
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,560
for personal gain...

81
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,640
If this gets out,

82
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,450
it wouldn't sound very good, would it?

83
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,360
Have some tea.

84
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
This photo...

85
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,080
if your wife sees it,

86
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,520
you know what the consequences would be.

87
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,720
Mr. Lu, just tell me

88
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,160
what you want me to do.

89
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,920
No rush. When I need you,

90
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
I'll contact you.

91
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,280
Just tell me

92
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,120
what you want me to do.

93
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,920
Lu Tongchen and Longchuan Group's

94
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,980
shady dealings...

95
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,940
I know everything about them.

96
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,440
He just wants Lu Yi

97
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,820
to replace you, right?

98
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,720
Nobody's stupid.

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,480
Everyone sees what's happening,

100
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,120
but most people

101
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,480
are in cahoots with him.

102
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,360
There are benefits involved.

103
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,159
What if

104
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,720
I can offer them enough benefits?

105
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Then at that time,

106
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,800
those same people

107
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,200
will be running around

108
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,440
serving you instead.

109
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,440
Come in.

110
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,960
Mr. Lu, you wanted to see me?

111
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,600
How long have you been with the company?

112
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,080
Less than a year.

113
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,450
Starting tomorrow,

114
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,730
you don't need to come to work anymore.

115
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,960
What did I do wrong?

116
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,919
I've registered a new company

117
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,400
and want to transfer you there

118
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,730
as the person in charge.

119
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,400
So I'm getting promoted?

120
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
I guess so.

121
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,560
Shouldn't it be Pang De?

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,680
Why would you choose me?

123
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,320
I've thought about it

124
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,050
and feel you're more suitable.

125
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,480
So,

126
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,880
go to HR to process your resignation later.

127
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,120
Starting tomorrow,

128
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,380
you'll no longer be an employee of Jindu.

129
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,400
This matter

130
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,120
stays between us.

131
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,360
Don't tell anyone,

132
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,160
understand?

133
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,690
Understood, Mr. Lu.

134
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,520
I have something to attend to later.

135
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,040
You and Pang De

136
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,800
take Anduo and the children back to the village.

137
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
Be careful on the way.

138
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,010
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

139
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,380
Process your resignation first.

140
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,520
We've won this project bid every year.

141
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,120
Why did it fail this year?

142
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,130
What's going on?

143
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,400
Mr. Zhao just called to inform us

144
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,250
that they're suspending cooperation this year.

145
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,280
What did you say?

146
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,920
Suspending cooperation.

147
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,720
Notify all executives in the group

148
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,000
for an immediate meeting.

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,960
Yes, Mr. Lu.

150
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,400
Is everyone here?

151
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,320
Lu Ye hasn't arrived yet.

152
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,040
We won't wait.

153
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,840
Recently, our group's

154
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,920
companies have been facing one problem after another.

155
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,960
The projects we always secure have failed to attract bids.

156
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,520
Our regular partner

157
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,960
has announced a suspension of cooperation.

158
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,560
If we don't resolve this soon,

159
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,490
you can all prepare for bankruptcy and liquidation.

160
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,000
So in your opinion,

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
what should we do?

162
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,880
We've been too picky in the past,

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,330
and neglected our smaller subsidiaries.

164
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,520
Now we're

165
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,440
going to pay a heavy price.

166
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
If all else fails,

167
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,800
we'll have to sell the factories at a low price.

168
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,410
We don't have any orders for next year anyway.

169
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,880
If we close the factories,

170
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,720
the local government will definitely make us pay back

171
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,050
all the tax exemptions from recent years.

172
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,880
Um, Anduo,

173
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,840
there's something

174
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,720
I really need to tell you.

175
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,320
Actually, Director Lu and that female model,

176
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,200
nothing happened between them.

177
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,960
This was all a setup by Lu Yi

178
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,280
to frame Director Lu.

179
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,160
How do you know?

180
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Well, let me tell you,

181
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,050
but you can't tell Director Lu.

182
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,560
I got this information from Lu Yi's side.

183
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,920
Thank you.

184
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,920
No problem.

185
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,720
Anduo.

186
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,940
There's something I want to tell you.

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,880
Mr. Lu was truly wronged.

188
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,760
The information I got

189
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
from Longchuan is absolutely true.

190
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,080
Also, about this matter,

191
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,320
don't tell Mr. Lu.

192
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,280
I hope you two can be happy together.

193
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,160
Don't worry. I won't tell him.

194
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,120
Really?

195
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,600
Thank you.

196
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,730
I'm leaving now.

197
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,360
Are you alone, beautiful?

198
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,680
Want to have a drink together?

199
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,700
Let's drink up.

200
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,440
I'm fine with drinking this.

201
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,560
But after we finish,

202
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
should we go somewhere else?

203
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,080
Where to?

204
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,080
Come with me.

205
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,920
Get lost.

206
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
No fun at all.

207
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,600
Here you are.

208
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,440
It's rare for you to have time to join me for a drink.

209
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,240
Here.

210
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,400
Go ahead.

211
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,200
What did you want to see me about?

212
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,080
Nothing special.

213
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,440
I just wanted to tell you

214
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
to stay away from those questionable women.

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,320
It affects your image.

216
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,290
There's only one month left before the deadline.

217
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,920
When the time comes,

218
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,560
you can continue acquiring Jindu's shares.

219
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,520
I won't stop you.
