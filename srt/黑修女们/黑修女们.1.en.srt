00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,110
<i>The one who protected
and saved the three holy children...</i>

3
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,670
Speak!

4
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:14,155
Speak! Why have you come here?!

5
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,010
You called me here!

6
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,330
Protect us from the power
and curse of demons!

7
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,170
I’m from the Sisters of Liberation.

8
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,640
<i>Marco!</i>

9
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,280
Sister Giunia!

10
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
<i>Father!</i>

11
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,770
Where do you think you are, daring to come here?

12
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,900
Such arrogance and recklessness!

13
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,490
You must be cleansed first.

14
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,500
Is that all holy water?

15
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,970
A woman like you isn’t even allowed to perform exorcisms!

16
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,800
Mother’s whip hurts the most, doesn’t it?

17
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,680
A woman shrouded in dark energy!

18
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,060
You can’t pull it out.

19
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,480
Wait until the exorcism is over.

20
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,440
Prepare a Franciscan bell for me.

21
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,150
You lowly creature!

22
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,820
Ring the bell and continue praying.

23
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,700
Who performs an exorcism so carelessly?

24
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,950
You coward, daring to possess
the body of a child...

25
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,460
Reveal your identity.

26
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,960
Protect us from the rulers of this dark world

27
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,000
and from the evil spirits under heaven.

28
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,010
Come to the aid of humanity,

29
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,260
whom You redeemed at a great price from Satan.

30
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,390

Amen.

55
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,140
the glorious archangels
and the saints of God.

56
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,850
Amen.

57
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,260
You will die.

58
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,160
You will experience the most painful death
a human can endure.

59
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,130
In a sea of fire, you will weep
and curse the Lord.

60
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,460
The blood of the demons
you slaughtered with your own hands

61
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,670
will echo in the womb like drums.

62
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,847
Stop it, what is your name?

63
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:36,900
My servants,
whom you cast into hell,

64
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,360
sent me to tell you
you won’t live to see spring!

65
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,990
This is nonsense.

66
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,080
Father! Father!

67
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,700
It’s hiding again.

68
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:21,088
<b>THE DARK NUN</b>

69
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,034
<i>No.</i>

70
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,884
The boy doesn’t look like a patient.

71
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:31,145
Thank you for sharing the room.

72
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:34,253
We’ll move him to a private room as soon as possible.

73
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:36,580
It’s fine.

74
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,840
Whether the boy is possessed or not,

75
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,326
this hospital is under God’s protection.

76
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,360
Father Paolo will be the new attending physician
for patient Choi Hee-joon.

77
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:06,948
A doctor who denies possession...

78
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:09,183
What do you think, Sister Michela?

79
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,070
Does possession not exist?

80
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,420
They say evil exists to prove the existence of good.

81
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:23,920
It’s a combination of

82
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,680
multiple personality disorder
and borderline personality disorder.

83
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:31,413
If treated regularly in a stable environment

84
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,140
and with consistent medication,
the patient can fully recover.

85
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:40,988
We have enough data

86
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:44,245
from similar clinical cases.

87
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:45,780
Wow.

88
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,249
Father Paolo’s disciple is different.

89
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,490
Alright, I understand.

90
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,580
Are you even human?

91
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,700
You seem like an AI.

92
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,960
Cold as ice.

93
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:02,027
Did you also ask the temple for help?

94
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:08,839
I heard there’s a famous monk in Busan...

95
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,800
I think I should try every possible way...

96
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,850
Hee-joon’s mother.

97
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,940
Unexplainable events
beyond human understanding

98
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,230
can sometimes happen.

99
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,320
What if you flip a coin ten times
and it lands on heads every time?

100
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,120
A coincidence too hard to believe, right?

101
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,120
But instead of flipping a coin,

102
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,580
this misfortune has befallen
someone close to us.

103
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,710
Weak humans deny coincidence
and call it superstition, mystery,

104
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:54,090
or the conspiracy of heretics.

105
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,510
God is testing us.

106
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,980
Testing our faith in Him.

107
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,520
<i>Psychoanalysis and the Treatment of Possession</i>

108
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,480
What your son needs

109
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,360
is psychological counseling
and medication, that’s all.

110
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,087
But even Father Andrea...

111
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,000
and the Sisters of Liberation...

112
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,750
A nun?

113
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,710
An unordained nun performing exorcisms?

114
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,710
{\an8}<i>Ordination: A ritual in Catholicism to confer priesthood.
(Women cannot be ordained.)</i>

115
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,568
<i>We must hurry.</i>

116
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,840
I need to contact Father Kim in Rome.

117
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,840
Or Father Choi if he’s available.

118
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:41,208
Personally, I don’t oppose exorcism,

119
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,947
but everything must follow procedure.

120
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,578
A nun is a bit...

121
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:52,610
Father Andrea himself asked for my help.

122
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:56,298
He even allowed me to perform the exorcism that day.

123
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,261
I don’t oppose it, but...

124
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:01,843
the current situation is a bit...

125
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,375
The Archdiocese of Seoul doesn’t approve either.

126
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:08,420
You’re being harsh, Father.

127
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,072
Hey!

128
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,526
Sister Giunia!

129
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,003
Sister Giunia.

130
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,283
Why don’t you return to the convent and wait?

131
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:22,068
The longer we avoid it, the harder it will be to handle.

132
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:25,165
Sister Giunia.

133
00:11:25,623 --> 00:11:31,583
Abandoning the possessed
is no different from killing them.

134
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,620
Father Kim has a talented disciple.

135
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:44,963
But they say
her prayers are quite effective.

136
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,860
Still, she’s just a nun...

137
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,163
<i>What will you do after returning home?</i>

138
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,200
<i>I plan to teach English to the people there.</i>

139
00:11:57,706 --> 00:11:58,746
This is Hee-joon’s.

140
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:08,925
So the boy attempted suicide.

141
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,380
He must think death is the end.

142
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:22,153
How does he know death
won’t destroy the evil spirit?

143
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,250
The spirit inside that child...

144
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,510
isn’t simple or easy to deal with.

145
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,621
Did the boy draw these?

146
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,470
Yes.

147
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,860
There was a similar case like this before.

148
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:47,947
An unofficial case, as you know.

149
00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:50,859
All records of the exorcism were destroyed.

150
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,740
Demons deny God and commit evil acts
through humans,

151
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,500
it’s definitely one of the 12 Evil Spirits.

152
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,800
You don’t look like you get regular check-ups.

153
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:51,562
Just tell me.

154
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,028
Do you feel...

155
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,350
anything unusual in your uterus?

156
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,052
The cancer has spread throughout your body.

157
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,600
Doctor.

158
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,948
Yes, go ahead.

159
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:11,687
Am I going to die?

160
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,517
Sister!

161
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,080
The next appointment...

162
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,290
I have a meeting with Father Paolo.

163
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,827
Exorcism is a cultural practice
formed according to the needs of the times.

164
00:14:28,303 --> 00:14:29,973
It has long been corrupted.

165
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:33,972
Those who believe
they have spiritual powers

166
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:36,220
and can defeat evil

167
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,566
or call themselves
"Warriors of Light," right?

168
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,358
I’ve also heard a very special nickname:

169
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:46,623
"The Dark Nun."

170
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:54,430
I came to discuss, not to be lectured.

171
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:57,871
Mystics believe they are special

172
00:14:57,895 --> 00:15:00,329
and have a stronger ego than ordinary people.

173
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:03,788
An ego bordering on obsession
and fixation,

174
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,199
sometimes creating illusions
people call miracles.

175
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:14,945
I’m not well-educated, so this is hard to understand.

176
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,598
Hee-joon created those illusions himself

177
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:20,240
during his experience
with school violence and bullying.

178
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,580
He’s not possessed.

179
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,220
Madam...
<i>- Hello?</i>

180
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,130
<i>Is this Hee-joon’s mother?</i>

181
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,263
Call it a demon or an illusion,

182
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,560
saving the child is what matters most.

183
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,890
He’s writhing in pain.

184
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:49,054
Hee-joon needs healing,
not an exorcism.

185
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:53,102
Without proper medical records,
we can’t approve an unofficial exorcism,

186
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,810
The boy has had enough psychiatric treatment.

187
00:15:56,132 --> 00:15:58,331
I regret taking Hee-joon’s case so late,

188
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:01,078
but thankfully, treatment has already begun.

189
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,370
Any delay could endanger him.

190
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,129
A rushed exorcism is just as dangerous.

191
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,216
This has happened before, hasn’t it?

192
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:11,960
<i>Do you know what day it is today?</i>

193
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,510
Yes...

194
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,800
<i>Are you going to pay or not?</i>

195
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,510
Yes, I will!

196
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,010
<i>If you keep this up,
I’ll have to take legal action!</i>

197
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,945
Please give me until the end of this month.

198
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:23,890
I’m trying to borrow from elsewhere...

199
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,761
<i>You keep saying that!
Is it true this time?</i>

200
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,020
Of course, Madam.

201
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,820
<i>You shameless woman!</i>

202
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,650
<i>First you ruin your husband, now your son.</i>

203
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,599
<i>Sister.</i>

204
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:39,276
There are boundaries you shouldn’t cross.

205
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,540
Have you heard of the 12 Evil Spirits?

206
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,830
Sister Giunia!

207
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,303
<i>Sell your body or your organs, you whore!</i>

208
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,000
<i>I pity you because of your mentally ill son!</i>

209
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,957
Fundamentally, you and Hee-joon
are the same.

210
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,808
God is not with either of you.

211
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,970
He only exists in heaven.

212
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,620
I need to confirm once again, Sister Giunia.

213
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,015
As long as Hee-joon is my patient,

214
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,080
an exorcism won’t be easily approved.

215
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,050
You should learn to respect
the Church and its teachings.

216
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,205
Sister Michela!

217
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,260
I’m sorry, Father.

218
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:46,373
Patient Choi Hee-joon...

219
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,100
...jumped from the rooftop.

220
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,290
How is the boy?

221
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,740
He’s been sedated.

222
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,370
To prevent self-harm after waking up,

223
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,750
make sure the nurses take turns watching him.

224
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,080
Yes.

225
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,298
Unclean spirit,
I command you in the name of the Lord:

226
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,049
Leave this place at once.

227
00:19:00,713 --> 00:19:03,359
And do not return.

228
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,072
Do not trouble us anymore.

229
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,750
This body has no place for you,
be gone.

230
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,939
Let’s go together.

231
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,260
What?

232
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:53,829
I’ll give you a ride to the funeral.

233
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,150
I’m hearing impaired.

234
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:20,450
Born this way,
but only on the right side.

235
00:20:20,777 --> 00:20:24,902
It’s hard to hear music or the phone
without a hearing aid.

236
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:31,181
But I can hear
the whispers of evil spirits.

237
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,632
Some see them,
others feel heat or cold,

238
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:39,367
or just have a premonition.

239
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:45,260
Is that "psychic ability"?

240
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,990
What do you mean...

241
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,969
What about you? Do you hear or see them?

242
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:03,776
I know you’re like me.

243
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:07,926
You also have a divine gift.

244
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:12,608
Those who don’t follow
the path of shamanism

245
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,508
often choose to become nuns.

246
00:21:14,996 --> 00:21:18,246
Were you told that working at a hospital
would help compensate for it?

247
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:21,148
You’re overstepping!

248
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,929
We must exorcise the boy
before the funeral ends.

249
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:29,747
His mother’s death
will distract Father Paolo for a while.

250
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:33,094
Why are you going this far?

251
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:37,600
The boy will die if left alone.

252
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,852
I can’t do this alone.

253
00:21:47,247 --> 00:21:50,006
You’re Father Paolo’s disciple.

254
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:52,316
What do you need from me?

255
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,080
At least he won’t suspect you.

256
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,703
Father Paolo often says...

257
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,506
possession isn’t real.

258
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,219
Nonsense.

259
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,670
What?

260
00:22:19,726 --> 00:22:21,700
No one forced you to perform an exorcism.

261
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:24,236
Just help me get the boy out of there.

262
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,229
Consider this after seeing this.

263
00:22:46,046 --> 00:22:46,886
This is insane...

264
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:49,860
Who do you think you are?

265
00:22:54,146 --> 00:22:55,360
<i>You demon!</i>

266
00:22:55,846 --> 00:22:57,115
<i>Reveal your name!</i>

267
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:58,522
<i>I am...</i>

268
00:22:58,862 --> 00:23:01,901
<i>your stepfather, your mother’s enemy,</i>

269
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:05,570
<i>the source of your faith, you scum!</i>

270
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,030
<i>Don’t listen to the demon’s temptations!</i>

271
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,620
<i>Marco, snap out of it!</i>

272
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,726
<i>Psychoanalysis and the Treatment of Possession</i>

273
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:05,973
The Hanged Man.

274
00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:11,727
Do you think this person
can free themselves?

275
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:17,067
Su-young, you can free yourself too.

276
00:24:21,182 --> 00:24:22,461
You like drawing, right?

277
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,253
Keep it.

278
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:27,483
But don’t let the sisters find out.

279
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:31,668
Especially Father Paolo.

280
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:39,303
Who’s there?

281
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:16,356
<i>Do you know what they call people like us?</i>

282
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,430
<i>"Demon spawn."</i>

283
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,310
<i>Cursed children,
the result of humans and demons.</i>

284
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,313
Who’s there?

285
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:47,390
<i>Did you have a nightmare?
What’s with the crying?</i>

286
00:26:49,052 --> 00:26:50,132
<i>Did you dream of goats too?</i>

287
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,990
<i>I guess so.</i>

288
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,960
<i>Did you think it was over?</i>

289
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,473
Why won’t you tell me where we’re going?

290
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:08,669
Juan District in Incheon.

291
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,598
Hyo-won Street.

292
00:27:12,016 --> 00:27:12,857
What?

293
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,614
Hyo-won used to live with me in the convent,

294
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:22,697
but now she’s a skilled shaman
with much experience.

295
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:24,653
A shaman?

296
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:27,716
Are you out of your mind?

297
00:27:29,741 --> 00:27:34,520
To others, you, me,
and shamans are all lunatics.

298
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,193
Unbelievable.

299
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:40,283
Is there anything you wouldn’t do?

300
00:27:41,263 --> 00:27:43,093
As long as it helps with the exorcism.

301
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:02,090
W-w-what name should I use for the appointment?

302
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,249
A nun’s habit looks out of place here.

303
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:05,992
So many people are staring.

304
00:28:07,513 --> 00:28:09,313
Was she really a nun?

305
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,850
<i>Was he also chosen by the spirits?</i>

306
00:28:16,702 --> 00:28:18,976
He’s an orphan taken in by the temple,
his mother was a shaman,

307
00:28:19,536 --> 00:28:22,980
so she took him in, but he has no spiritual roots.

308
00:28:24,248 --> 00:28:28,242
Not mute, but he stutters badly.

309
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:30,853
His divination skills are weak too...

310
00:28:32,648 --> 00:28:35,346
What about the girl over there?

311
00:28:37,253 --> 00:28:39,650
She hasn’t accepted her spiritual roots yet.

312
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,018
Go have a smoke.

313
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,614
Rice cake.

314
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,411
H-h-his name.

315
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,828
<i>Rice Cake</i>

316
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:30,046
The Four Pillars show,

317
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,854
at first glance, it resembles a snake,

318
00:29:35,426 --> 00:29:39,306
but also the Dragon God General
from the Dragon Palace.

319
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,010
A fallen spirit...

320
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,200
Yes, this is definitely an evil spirit.

321
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,315
Even if we succeed in exorcising it,

322
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,332
the spirits of its family
will possess him.

323
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,403
There’s no way out.

324
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,340
It’s destined, like a Demon Spawn.

325
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,222
"Demon Spawn"?

326
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:05,232
A child conceived
while the mother was possessed.

327
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:07,003
Destined to be a shaman.

328
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,570
That’s better than dying...

329
00:30:14,087 --> 00:30:18,217
This one isn’t like that,
it’s just fate.

330
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:28,403
Who are you to judge
and conclude so casually?

331
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,000
You’re right.

332
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,120
We were too hasty.

333
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:41,432
Born from water,
it must be treated with water.

334
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,430
Should we call Shaman Dam-eon?
We’re running out of time.

335
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,140
He looks decent enough.

336
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,690
Put on the ceremonial robe
and the ritual will go smoothly.

337
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,830
Silence the evil mantra!

338
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,500
Turi, turi, maha turi!

339
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,159
Sung-ae.

340
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,820
What’s wrong?

341
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:49,210
Nuns get free health check-ups, right?

342
00:31:50,496 --> 00:31:54,116
So what?
Is Death lurking around you?

343
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,620
Go get checked, kid.

344
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,973
I thought you were blinded by money,
but you’re still sharp.

345
00:32:10,355 --> 00:32:12,195
I’m losing my touch.

346
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:18,350
Bow respectfully to the five directions,
internal and external, comfort the family spirits.

347
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,270
Om beng qua chiến thắng sa bà ha.

348
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,040
Begin the ritual!

349
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:46,710
Will you save this Choi child?

350
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Yes, don’t worry.

351
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,173
The poor child, weak and sickly,

352
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,720
I will soothe the restless ancestors and expel

353
00:32:56,866 --> 00:33:02,706
the spirit possessing him
so he may find peace!

354
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,327
Begin the ritual!

355
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:40,730
Water from the East Sea, West Sea,
South Sea, and North Sea!

356
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,850
Is it the Four Sea Dragon Kings?

357
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,150
The Seven Star Dragon King reigns in the sky!

358
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,230
Stop it... Stop!
The Mountain Gods and the Dragon King!

359
00:33:48,408 --> 00:33:49,400
It hurts, Sister!

360
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,320
The Dragon King parts the waters, the Dragon King rises.

361
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,530
The people are on the blackened land,
My Lord, my God.

362
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,490
they are no longer my people.

363
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:02,870
Today, I will dispel
the clouds shrouding your mind,

364
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,840
calm and clear your spirit!

365
00:34:42,904 --> 00:34:44,750
You foolish nun!

366
00:34:44,964 --> 00:34:47,040
Do you think you can expel us?

367
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,710
Oh no! Hee-joon!

368
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,893
The boy has fainted.

369
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,580
But it won’t last long.

370
00:35:28,242 --> 00:35:30,112
Father Paolo will take care of him.

371
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:36,427
If we leave him at the hospital,
others will be in danger.

372
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,014
Do you want to play the hero?

373
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:48,183
Why are you so fixated on exorcism?

374
00:35:50,272 --> 00:35:54,860
Do you need a reason to save someone?

375
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:05,200
You know I can’t help you anymore.

376
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,380
<i>I’m truly disappointed in you.</i>

377
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,800
Where did you take Hee-joon?

378
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:22,633
I thought he should at least
see his mother one last time.

379
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:24,168
Are you in charge of the funeral?

380
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,180
I’m sorry, Father.

381
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:29,742
Of course, we are all clergy.

382
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:33,257
But we are also medical practitioners!

383
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:39,610
Don’t tell me you’re going to see that nun?

384
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:45,262
That’s practically a cult
started by Father Kim.

385
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:50,553
Sister Michela also drew
things like this.

386
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,650
Tell me the truth.

387
00:36:55,818 --> 00:36:59,300
Do you think Hee-joon is like you?

388
00:37:18,617 --> 00:37:19,747
You’re having...

389
00:37:22,669 --> 00:37:24,669
hallucinations again?

390
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,333
No, not at all.

391
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,630
Michela.

392
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,702
Hee-joon will make it through.

393
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:41,714
I will definitely save him.

394
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:43,674
Yes.

395
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:48,140
You are proof of that.

396
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,860
Sister Michela.

397
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,528
I’ll go to my son in Chungju.

398
00:38:12,827 --> 00:38:14,074
Really?

399
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,330
Thank you, Sister.

400
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,850
Park Myung-ja...

401
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,560
Park Myung-ja...

402
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,320
Patient Park Myung-ja
passed away at 10:15.

403
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,060
<i>The midday temperature reached 42ºC.</i>

404
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:20,480
<i>Bats can hardly withstand
the high temperature and ash.</i>

405
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,160
<i>Some find shelter
within palm fronds,</i>

406
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,902
<i>while others seek shade elsewhere.</i>

407
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,960
<i>That’s why they often fight each other.</i>

408
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,145
<i>The bats, exhausted
from hunger and fighting,</i>

409
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,498
<i>may move to nearby water sources.</i>

410
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,560
Help... Help me...

411
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:57,930
Father Paolo... took Hee-joon
to the sealed-off convent...

412
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,251
Convent?

413
00:41:01,062 --> 00:41:04,310
He wants to treat him
with the monks there.

414
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,998
But the situation isn’t very stable.

415
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:15,466
You’ve been there before, haven’t you?

416
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,192
Over 15 years ago.

417
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,230
It used to be a chapel.

418
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:31,410
Father Paolo!

419
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,160
Michela...

420
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,200
Where is the boy?

421
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,380
Possession isn’t real,
yet you’re so eager to block the door.

422
00:44:16,216 --> 00:44:19,176
You dare return
with two streams of dark energy?

423
00:44:23,683 --> 00:44:27,513
Do you think I’ll be a lab rat
like that woman?

424
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,760
Do you think a bigger cross
will have any effect?

425
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,770
Did you meet your friend
on the way here?

426
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:46,981
You deceitful creature!

427
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,198
It asked me to say hello.

428
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,240
And to ask how you’re doing.

429
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,421
Michela.

430
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,040
Hee-joon will make it through.

431
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,959
I will definitely save him.

432
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,045
You are proof of that.

433
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:18,528
You glorify yourself
through my non-existence.

434
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:23,676
You will soon lose the wretched name
you fear the most.

435
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,690
Your nephew will die while deserting,

436
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,360
his head blown off by a stray bullet.

437
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,514
Your sister will hang herself
the very next day!

438
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,078
Just like that woman.

439
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:43,160
And you will go mad like your mother!

440
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,290
Father Paolo!

441
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,630
Please, snap out of it!

442
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,710
Father Paolo!

443
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,130
Father Paolo!

444
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,180
Father Paolo!

445
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,510
Please, snap out of it!

446
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,520
Father...

447
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,690
Father, please!

448
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,020
Father!

449
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,446
With just one drop of the blood of Jesus,

450
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,660
we believe
the whole world can be saved.

451
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,640
Is this child’s body so precious?

452
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,270
Sister Giunia!

453
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,610
You cursed fiend!
Leave the child’s body...

454
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:56,559
It’s okay, it’s over now.

455
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:00,136
Sister...

456
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:04,469
Kill me...

457
00:48:06,243 --> 00:48:08,003
Please, kill me...

458
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,158
Don’t give up, Hee-joon.

459
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,890
Don’t give up, okay?

460
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:20,941
No... I can’t take it anymore.

461
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:24,780
I want to follow my mother.

462
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:30,200
No, I won’t abandon you.

463
00:48:35,009 --> 00:48:37,410
We can do this.

464
00:48:37,576 --> 00:48:41,166
Just a little more effort.
Please, Hee-joon.

465
00:48:43,866 --> 00:48:45,236
I want to live.

466
00:48:49,277 --> 00:48:51,527
I really want to live...

467
00:49:31,986 --> 00:49:33,299
Is smoking prohibited here?

468
00:49:51,077 --> 00:49:53,877
This must be the talisman that saved the boy.

469
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:08,550
Why are you so stubborn?

470
00:50:20,493 --> 00:50:21,873
Monster...

471
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,230
Just like a monster...

472
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:35,490
You’re a monster just like me.

473
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:43,000
Only God knows why we were born as monsters.

474
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:55,010
I’ve come this far...

475
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:01,930
I’ve run away and survived...

476
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,162
Face it head-on.

477
00:51:24,412 --> 00:51:25,977
What’s the key?

478
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,710
The key to completing the exorcism.

479
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,300
Confession.

480
00:51:44,169 --> 00:51:46,005
The true name of the monster.

481
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:52,130
I am Sung-ae, Kang Sung-ae.

482
00:52:03,786 --> 00:52:06,282
Card 5 of the Major Arcana, The Hierophant.

483
00:52:07,378 --> 00:52:11,434
Under the Hierophant
are two priests.

484
00:52:11,907 --> 00:52:14,500
Each card has dozens of keywords,

485
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:17,990
but the Hierophant often appears
in restricted situations.

486
00:52:18,377 --> 00:52:19,810
Restricted situations?

487
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:20,636
Yes.

488
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,510
The original meaning of this card
doesn’t necessarily refer to the Hierophant...

489
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:27,140
but to those with spiritual abilities.

490
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,230
This is the Golden Dawn Tarot deck.

491
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:35,610
Used by monks studying mysticism
in medieval churches.

492
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,270
Similar to the Order of the Rosy Cross.

493
00:52:38,162 --> 00:52:38,912
Watch this.

494
00:52:41,163 --> 00:52:42,485
If you look here

495
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:46,900
when the Knight of Wands appears,
the Emperor may have already died.

496
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,530
But the Hierophant is still alive
and resisting.

497
00:52:50,929 --> 00:52:52,177
The Knight of Wands...

498
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:57,979
When the Emperor dies, the one with
spiritual abilities will rise against it?

499
00:53:03,256 --> 00:53:04,506
You’ve studied well.

500
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,810
Moreover,

501
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:14,150
under the Hierophant’s feet
is the Key to Heaven.

502
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,884
Card 4, The Emperor...

503
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:20,990
Card 5, The Hierophant...

504
00:53:21,872 --> 00:53:23,332
Then what’s Card 6?

505
00:53:29,963 --> 00:53:32,391
Card 6 is The Lovers.

506
00:53:32,646 --> 00:53:34,566
This card symbolizes unity and completion.

507
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:44,037
Sister! Where are we going?

508
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,010
The Hierophant and two baptized men,

509
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:48,520
meaning we need one more person.

510
00:53:50,786 --> 00:53:52,889
Don’t tell me it’s that shaman?

511
00:53:55,179 --> 00:53:57,099
Is there an exorcist priest nearby?

512
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,190
You’re not serious, are you?

513
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:18,090
<i>Hail Mary</i>

514
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:24,800
<i>full of grace</i>

515
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:40,940
<i>the Lord is with thee.</i>

516
00:54:52,197 --> 00:54:55,461
Didn’t you plan to teach them English?

517
00:54:56,507 --> 00:54:58,922
People easily fall ill when they stop midway.

518
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:01,717
Just follow what
Father Kim taught you.

519
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:05,840
What do you need from a coward like me?

520
00:55:07,607 --> 00:55:12,180
You said the 12 Evil Spirits reside
in animal forms.

521
00:55:18,374 --> 00:55:20,840
The snake represents Satan,

522
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:24,740
the goat represents the scapegoat...

523
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:31,450
In the end,
perhaps they aren’t demons.

524
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:43,000
Whether saint or demon,
never trust the manifestations

525
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:46,058
of beings that are not human.

526
00:55:46,111 --> 00:55:47,090
Giunia!

527
00:55:47,337 --> 00:55:51,180
Because those manifestations are just clues.

528
00:55:54,524 --> 00:55:55,952
You taught me that.

529
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,866
A person as rude as you...

530
00:56:02,921 --> 00:56:05,251
shouldn’t expect to become a proper clergy.

531
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,190
Thank you for teaching me.

532
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:12,477
Father Andrea.

533
00:56:13,947 --> 00:56:18,648
<i>The one given power by God
and the mission to crush Satan’s head,</i>

534
00:56:19,174 --> 00:56:22,764
<i>ask the great Queen of Heaven,
the Mother of Angels,</i>

535
00:56:23,531 --> 00:56:28,816
<i>I humbly ask You
to send the heavenly army</i>

536
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:33,810
<i>to drive the demons to hell,
pursue them to the ends of the earth,</i>

537
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:36,181
<i>subdue their arrogance,</i>

538
00:56:36,261 --> 00:56:39,810
<i>and finally, cast them into hell.</i>

539
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,163
<i>Amen.</i>

540
00:57:14,018 --> 00:57:18,140
Father Kim and Father Choi
cannot be present to conduct the ritual.

541
00:57:18,413 --> 00:57:20,713
I regret to inform you of this.

542
00:57:27,827 --> 00:57:30,003
They have been sent on a mission,

543
00:57:30,028 --> 00:57:33,651
I cannot reveal more
due to confidentiality.

544
00:57:42,407 --> 00:57:44,779
Both Father Kim and the Order of the Rosy Cross

545
00:57:44,804 --> 00:57:49,760
believe that the entity possessing
the boy is one of the 12 Evil Spirits.

546
00:57:53,707 --> 00:57:56,217
This is a message from Father Kim.

547
00:58:00,819 --> 00:58:04,319
"The 12 Evil Spirits will continue to appear.

548
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:15,450
Save the child at all costs."

549
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,731
Can you participate in the exorcism?

550
00:58:19,776 --> 00:58:21,816
You’re a priest
of the Order of the Rosy Cross, right?

551
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,550
I’m sorry, but I cannot.

552
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,100
A servant must obey
the arrangements of God.

553
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,350
To seal the 12 Evil Spirits,
we need the Key to Heaven,

554
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:46,900
and the Gospel of Saint Peter.

555
00:58:57,994 --> 00:59:00,001
Those are holy relics.

556
00:59:00,026 --> 00:59:02,580
And they are kept in the Vatican.

557
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,210
These entities can manipulate even priests.

558
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,810
I will do my best to assist.

559
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,209
That bastard Kim Beom-sin...

560
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,250
He’s your teacher, right?

561
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:48,040
You’ll curse me too someday.

562
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,242
Yes...

563
01:00:13,296 --> 01:00:14,995
The first day of the lunar month, midnight,

564
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,245
that’s when all forces
must gather to purge it.

565
01:00:19,076 --> 01:00:21,204
Everything must be done before 1 AM.

566
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:25,080
Otherwise, it will become terrifying.

567
01:00:27,338 --> 01:00:28,870
Should we call Shaman Dam-eon?

568
01:00:30,363 --> 01:00:31,283
No...

569
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:40,130
That day is election day,
so all shamans are fully booked.

570
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:46,868
Are you serious?

571
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,725
How can you say that?

572
01:00:56,946 --> 01:01:00,297
That’s the day when ancestors
of every family are busy.

573
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,085
Let’s go.

574
01:01:08,186 --> 01:01:10,786
I’m sorry, Sung-ae.

575
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,080
Sister Giunia!

576
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:30,935
Have you decided on the ritual location?

577
01:01:31,505 --> 01:01:33,875
I plan to do it at the boy’s house.

578
01:01:34,045 --> 01:01:36,225
It’s quite secluded.

579
01:01:36,566 --> 01:01:39,161
The Archdiocese of Seoul has approved

580
01:01:39,185 --> 01:01:42,214
the unofficial exorcism
of Choi Hee-joon,

581
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:45,818
with the participation of Father Paolo.

582
01:01:46,055 --> 01:01:48,738
But he doesn’t have the authority!

583
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:53,522
The Archdiocese has permitted it as
the bishop here, I approve of it.

584
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:56,114
Father Paolo has been granted

585
01:01:56,207 --> 01:02:02,877
the authority to preside over
the unofficial exorcism of Choi Hee-joon.

586
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:06,631
He doesn’t even believe in exorcism!

587
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:10,430
Even so, a nun
is not qualified.

588
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:16,421
Father Paolo is a priest of deep faith
and knowledge.

589
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,622
Not to mention he’s also a doctor.

590
01:02:20,813 --> 01:02:24,523
Did you send a letter to Father Kim?

591
01:02:26,436 --> 01:02:29,133
I only wanted to request the holy relics
for the exorcism.

592
01:02:29,297 --> 01:02:33,257
No one would blindly hand over holy relics
for an unofficial exorcism.

593
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:39,360
Father Paolo will personally deliver
and oversee them.

594
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,616
This is madness...

595
01:02:41,706 --> 01:02:43,956
Remember, from this moment on,

596
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:47,961
all your actions
will be considered a violation of canon law.

597
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:50,414
The only one who can attest to your abilities

598
01:02:50,438 --> 01:02:52,769
and spirituality is Father Kim,

599
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:56,140
you’re not even part of
the Order of the Rosy Cross.

600
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,520
If I contact the Order of the Rosy Cross,

601
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:03,227
would they directly
hand over the relics to me?

602
01:03:05,766 --> 01:03:08,430
Compared to an exorcism,
that’s even harder.

603
01:03:21,776 --> 01:03:25,179
<i>The Day of the Exorcism</i>

604
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:17,325
That’s Father Kim’s personal opinion,

605
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,060
the Order of the Rosy Cross
has a different view on this matter.

606
01:04:20,326 --> 01:04:23,033
We will do our utmost to assist,

607
01:04:23,209 --> 01:04:29,259
in return, the evil spirit must be
completely destroyed.

608
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:30,660
This is

609
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:33,330
our request.

610
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:37,870
Even if it means sacrificing the child?

611
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,230
Malodore.

612
01:05:50,045 --> 01:05:52,788
The foul stench characteristic of the possessed.

613
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:56,827
It means the demon inside
has rotted to its core.

614
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:59,536
Isn’t it too early to say that?

615
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:03,793
Would saying it earlier help?

616
01:06:04,834 --> 01:06:07,049
That stench is almost impossible to cleanse.

617
01:06:07,382 --> 01:06:10,774
That’s why the possessed
are often abandoned.

618
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:16,400
Thankfully, among the five senses,
smell is the weakest in humans.

619
01:06:18,617 --> 01:06:20,537
You know everything.

620
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:24,780
You’re on par with me, huh?

621
01:06:31,059 --> 01:06:33,565
You should quit smoking.

622
01:06:34,356 --> 01:06:36,656
Making others inhale secondhand smoke
is worse.

623
01:07:00,943 --> 01:07:03,316
It’s quite cold today.

624
01:07:36,756 --> 01:07:37,998
What about the manual?

625
01:07:38,277 --> 01:07:39,352
Are we preparing for surgery or something?

626
01:07:39,376 --> 01:07:41,457
The Dark Nun doesn’t have
a manual, does she?

627
01:07:42,143 --> 01:07:42,938
Yes.

628
01:07:43,571 --> 01:07:45,724
This exorcism
has only one principle:

629
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:48,123
use every possible means.

630
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:11,443
It’s time to begin.

631
01:09:13,273 --> 01:09:14,277
What’s that?

632
01:09:15,509 --> 01:09:16,626
Cotton flowers.

633
01:09:18,698 --> 01:09:20,545
Symbolizing the Three Goddesses.

634
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:21,694
Huh?

635
01:09:21,788 --> 01:09:25,732
The Three Goddesses are the ancestors
who brought Hee-joon into this world.

636
01:09:26,567 --> 01:09:28,782
He’s chosen to be a shaman.

637
01:09:29,473 --> 01:09:31,639
Blessed and protected by his ancestors.

638
01:09:32,946 --> 01:09:34,706
So is he a shaman or a nun?

639
01:09:39,674 --> 01:09:42,849
Don’t overlook any information
about the possessed.

640
01:09:42,962 --> 01:09:45,390
But we’re nuns, aren’t we?

641
01:09:45,744 --> 01:09:49,776
In Europe, they still summon
guardian spirits during exorcisms.

642
01:09:50,749 --> 01:09:54,009
No matter where, exorcisms
are rarely approved.

643
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:23,590
Lord,
no matter how we act,

644
01:10:23,884 --> 01:10:27,140
we remain faithful to You,
have mercy on us.

645
01:10:38,839 --> 01:10:40,245
Check again.

646
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:41,738
Huh?

647
01:10:43,204 --> 01:10:44,881
Aren’t you a doctor?

648
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:46,248
Yes.

649
01:11:25,746 --> 01:11:27,310
The demon knows.

650
01:11:29,746 --> 01:11:31,296
It knows what we fear.

651
01:11:57,933 --> 01:11:59,168
It will make us hallucinate.

652
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:03,325
It will make us relive our pain,

653
01:12:04,483 --> 01:12:06,103
make us want to die.

654
01:12:19,204 --> 01:12:22,790
And you, child of humanity,
do not fear them,

655
01:12:24,412 --> 01:12:27,130
do not waver at their words,

656
01:12:27,658 --> 01:12:31,299
for they are rebels
and faithless surrounding you,

657
01:12:32,612 --> 01:12:37,850
and even if you live
among scorpions and thorns.

658
01:12:39,057 --> 01:12:42,539
Do not fear their faces,

659
01:12:42,846 --> 01:12:45,320
for they are the cradle of rebellion.

660
01:13:19,713 --> 01:13:24,919
<i>May your faith save this child.</i>

661
01:13:25,839 --> 01:13:28,669
<i>May God bless you.</i>

662
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:33,959
<i>Bach Cantatas BWV140 -
Awake, the voice is calling us</i>

663
01:13:36,826 --> 01:13:38,160
Ready?

664
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,810
Once we know its name,
it’s game over.

665
01:13:41,965 --> 01:13:42,920
Yes.

666
01:13:43,411 --> 01:13:45,737
Try not to look directly into its eyes.

667
01:13:46,424 --> 01:13:50,358
If you hallucinate, hide behind the fire

668
01:13:51,384 --> 01:13:53,090
or behind me.

669
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:54,780
Yes.

670
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:01,666
Start praying.

671
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:13,790
Lord, have mercy.

672
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:17,120
Lord, our God,
eternal King, Almighty Father,

673
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:21,000
who created all things
and changes all things

674
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:22,510
by Your will...

675
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:24,420
who in Babylon
turned the blazing flames

676
01:14:24,754 --> 01:14:25,987
Sister...

677
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:27,760
Thank you, Sister...

678
01:14:27,845 --> 01:14:29,760
of the furnace into morning dew...

679
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,590
I’m okay now...

680
01:14:37,946 --> 01:14:39,366
Where’s my mom?

681
01:14:40,193 --> 01:14:42,523
I want to see her...

682
01:14:43,382 --> 01:14:46,621
Lord, have mercy.

683
01:14:47,376 --> 01:14:49,280
I want to go to my mom...

684
01:14:50,023 --> 01:14:51,275
Sister...

685
01:14:55,834 --> 01:14:57,420
I’m so uncomfortable...

686
01:14:58,163 --> 01:15:00,873
Can you untie me?

687
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:03,859
Sister Kang Sung-ae...

688
01:15:07,437 --> 01:15:10,333
You’ve never told us your name before.

689
01:15:13,322 --> 01:15:14,575
You bitch!

690
01:15:17,074 --> 01:15:18,342
Lord, Savior of all,

691
01:15:18,366 --> 01:15:20,400
and purifier
of all sorcery and witchcraft,

692
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,790
may Your servants sing with gratitude
under Your protection and faith.

693
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:31,700
I hate...

694
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:36,760
I hate not being able to move my limbs...

695
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,592
I’m so scared...

696
01:15:39,741 --> 01:15:40,953
Please let me go...

697
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,500
They’re chasing me!

698
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,500
Please save me...

699
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:53,050
Lord, Almighty
and eternal King,

700
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:56,100
who created all things
and changes them

701
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,180
by Your will.

702
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:01,060
who saved and protected the three holy youths

703
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:07,030
from the blazing flames of Babylon...

704
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:08,940
- Healer of our souls
- No... I can’t take it...

705
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:12,476
- and Savior of those who seek You.
- No, no, no, no,!

706
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:25,033
Get lost, you filthy bitch!

707
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:34,040
Turn on the circuit breaker and relight the candles.

708
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:46,090
Turn it off!

709
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:47,590
Yes.

710
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,230
Sister...

711
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:04,065
That’s not a demon...

712
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:06,790
It protected me...

713
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:09,623
It killed my mother.

714
01:17:10,656 --> 01:17:12,435
It hurt my friend.

715
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:15,959
It’s my guardian spirit...

716
01:17:17,576 --> 01:17:21,620
You know that, don’t you?

717
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,890
It’s a demon.

718
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,760
It never protected you.

719
01:17:27,014 --> 01:17:30,800
Do not doubt,
you will not be disappointed.

720
01:17:32,494 --> 01:17:34,649
You still crave me, don’t you?

721
01:17:34,975 --> 01:17:43,785
I killed your mother.

722
01:17:43,996 --> 01:17:46,666
You filthy bitch! You whore!

723
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,770
How long has it been since you slept with a man?

724
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,490
Disgusting! Filthy!

725
01:17:57,490 --> 01:18:01,040
Get your hands off me! You’re disgusting!

726
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,170
You bitch!

727
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:04,330
Get your hands off me!

728
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,460
You’re useless!

729
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:16,710
How dare you!
Savior of those who seek You.

730
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:18,050
We pray to You...

731
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:24,270
You deceitful woman,
lying about being raped!

732
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,430
You bitch! Filthy!

733
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,810
May Your servants humbly sing
under Your protection and faith.

734
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:40,958
Protect us
from all curses,

735
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:43,693
from the evil eye of the wicked!

736
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:46,790
And from all evil committed
against Your servant!

737
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:49,250
Stretch out Your mighty and great hand,

738
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:51,460
come and overshadow me,

739
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,080
and pour upon me
Your merciful blood,

740
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:56,460
a powerful protector
for soul and body.

741
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:28,254
You’re trash beneath Jesus’ feet!

742
01:19:28,649 --> 01:19:31,819
You crave slaughter
every time you see children!

743
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,590
Demon, I command you
to reveal your name.

744
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:39,132
Demon, I command you!

745
01:19:39,319 --> 01:19:40,956
Tell me your name!

746
01:19:41,016 --> 01:19:43,889
You’re already asking for my name?

747
01:19:44,153 --> 01:19:47,403
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command you to reveal your name!

748
01:19:47,428 --> 01:19:50,918
In the name of Jesus Christ,

749
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:52,951
tell me your name!

750
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:57,230
In the name of Jesus Christ,

751
01:19:58,617 --> 01:20:00,577
tell me your name!

752
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,150
Still not awake yet?

753
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:05,869
Your little tricks won’t fool me.

754
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,740
You’re just a snake
slithering out of the sea.

755
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:12,450
You’re about to die!

756
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:21,782
The son of Mary died
when crucified on the cross,

757
01:20:22,726 --> 01:20:27,849
and you will die
with a tumor in your womb,

758
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,760
never able to bear a child.

759
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,960
Taking over the body of a faithless child,

760
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,690
you pathetic creature
can only bully the weak!

761
01:20:45,003 --> 01:20:47,263
Lord, have mercy on us.

762
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:50,330
Pretending to submit to the cross,

763
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:54,542
only to hide like a loach.

764
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:58,669
You’re just a deceitful and petty creature!

765
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:01,257
Possessing the soul of a lowly beast!

766
01:21:18,536 --> 01:21:19,616
Sister!

767
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,188
We’ve waited 233 years.

768
01:21:23,986 --> 01:21:29,315
I was there in 1791, 1846, and 1866.

769
01:21:29,786 --> 01:21:32,996
We had a hand in the deaths
of the 103 martyrs you revere.

770
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,760
And now...

771
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:38,864
we will take the lives of children!

772
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:43,040
Starting with this child,
we will kill 292, then 471,

773
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,295
until the number reaches 2,340!

774
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:49,670
Children will die on land,
on mountains, and in the sky.

775
01:21:50,996 --> 01:21:54,366
Remember my words:
this child is just the beginning.

776
01:21:55,325 --> 01:21:58,165
The beginning of your miserable failure.

777
01:22:01,686 --> 01:22:02,726
"We"?

778
01:22:04,396 --> 01:22:06,128
It’s just you.

779
01:22:06,803 --> 01:22:09,893
We are one and all.

780
01:22:10,883 --> 01:22:12,393
You foolish woman!

781
01:22:12,915 --> 01:22:14,780
Keep clinging to
those pitiful prayers...

782
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:17,700
You pitiful humans
are brainless fools!

783
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:21,291
A beast protected
by a filthy army!

784
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,720
Tell me your name!

785
01:22:24,683 --> 01:22:27,590
All you do is command,
never beg!

786
01:22:27,749 --> 01:22:29,089
You arrogant bitch!

787
01:22:30,316 --> 01:22:32,736
Reveal your name!

788
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:38,890
Do not fear, my son,

789
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:41,340
for I am your father.

790
01:22:42,007 --> 01:22:44,146
Then say it with your own mouth.

791
01:22:45,173 --> 01:22:46,593
What is your name?

792
01:22:47,407 --> 01:22:51,545
If you command me,
then show me your authority!

793
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:55,830
Do you dare face me?

794
01:22:56,023 --> 01:22:59,715
Who gave you the right to pray?
Kneel before me!

795
01:23:00,346 --> 01:23:02,448
I am the god you must bow to!

796
01:23:06,695 --> 01:23:08,340
You might as well worship me!

797
01:23:08,595 --> 01:23:10,130
Shut up and reveal your name!

798
01:23:11,041 --> 01:23:13,439
Did God create humans?

799
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,666
What a joke!

800
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:20,600
Is this the masterpiece of the Almighty?

801
01:23:20,778 --> 01:23:25,480
A bunch of pitiful fools,
obsessed with power and killing each other?

802
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:39,080
Don’t act like you care about us,
reveal your name.

803
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,540
Who are you, and why are you here?

804
01:23:42,853 --> 01:23:44,813
Didn’t I already tell you?

805
01:23:46,279 --> 01:23:48,800
I hate you.

806
01:23:50,591 --> 01:23:52,728
I hate you!

807
01:23:53,275 --> 01:23:57,536
I hate you! I hate you!

808
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,970
I hate you!

809
01:23:59,946 --> 01:24:01,566
I hate you!

810
01:24:02,013 --> 01:24:03,643
I hate you!

811
01:24:04,226 --> 01:24:07,646
I hate you! I hate you!

812
01:24:34,433 --> 01:24:36,263
Get me the Bible
and the Key of Saint Peter.

813
01:24:37,719 --> 01:24:38,786
Hurry.

814
01:24:51,353 --> 01:24:52,523
Why are you standing there?

815
01:25:01,899 --> 01:25:03,490
What should we do now?

816
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:09,043
You’re a shaman
who was supposed to die in a ritual,

817
01:25:10,457 --> 01:25:14,000
why are you here
in Jesus’ tattered robes?

818
01:25:15,215 --> 01:25:18,625
You soulless wretch, huh?

819
01:25:19,187 --> 01:25:23,335
Why don’t you ask the cards
you worship more than God?

820
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,830
Shut up!

821
01:25:30,002 --> 01:25:31,560
It’s not over yet.

822
01:25:32,017 --> 01:25:33,610
It can’t end like this.

823
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:36,570
I beg you,
tell me what I need to do!

824
01:25:36,570 --> 01:25:40,200
I’ll do whatever you ask!

825
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:43,190
No creature born
from a woman’s womb...

826
01:25:43,215 --> 01:25:44,070
I beg you!

827
01:25:44,095 --> 01:25:46,130
can stand against us!

828
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:53,340
<i>The profound Dharma, rare and hard to encounter.</i>

829
01:25:53,340 --> 01:26:00,068
<i>Fortunately, I have found it.</i>

830
01:26:00,415 --> 01:26:04,550
Who is that useless shaman?
Make him shut up!

831
01:26:04,603 --> 01:26:07,020
<i>I seek the truth of the Tathagata.</i>

832
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,880
Do you want to save the world with me?

833
01:26:19,878 --> 01:26:20,867
What?

834
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:24,340
Do you remember Hee-joon?

835
01:26:26,971 --> 01:26:31,640
To exorcise the demon,
I need one more person.

836
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:34,127
M-m-me?

837
01:26:34,693 --> 01:26:39,650
Isn’t the essence of prayer
from the heart?

838
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,990
Honestly, this is my first time too.

839
01:27:08,249 --> 01:27:09,459
D-don’t die!

840
01:27:11,498 --> 01:27:12,445
Hee-joon!

841
01:27:13,002 --> 01:27:16,480
I... d-don’t know how to draw talismans...

842
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:18,810
So... s-so...

843
01:27:19,265 --> 01:27:21,860
at least t-t-take this...

844
01:27:30,316 --> 01:27:35,660
Khai Pháp tạng Chân ngôn, Om Aranam Arada.

845
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:39,830
Om Aranam Arada.

846
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:42,414
You insects!

847
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:45,380
Shut up
before I tear your mouths apart! Shut up!

848
01:27:47,155 --> 01:27:50,220
Great mountain, small mountain, mountain ghost deity.

849
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:53,970
Great separation, small separation, mountain ghost deity.

850
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:56,310
Great evil, small evil, vanish into nothingness.

851
01:27:56,497 --> 01:27:58,497
Not a single word was missed.

852
01:28:01,963 --> 01:28:03,836
Those with divine abilities,

853
01:28:05,019 --> 01:28:06,139
three people.

854
01:28:14,086 --> 01:28:16,750
Bow before the guests, the deity of the land.

855
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:20,000
Quiet! Shut your stupid mouth!

856
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:24,698
Bow to the mountain deity, let go of your attachments.

857
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:28,013
<i>Soul of the land, sacrifice yourself for protection!</i>

858
01:28:35,655 --> 01:28:39,940
<i>Today, right now, we pray for blessings to move forward.</i>

859
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:44,110
<i>Everywhere and anywhere, crossing thousands of miles.</i>

860
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:51,110
<i>Do not return, you who do not belong to this world.</i>

861
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:57,910
<i>Take the next step in the cycle of reincarnation, Svaha!</i>

862
01:29:01,757 --> 01:29:03,420
The Lord is the one who loves humanity.

863
01:29:04,290 --> 01:29:06,322
The protector of soul and body.

864
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:09,550
Please send the angels of peace and strength,

865
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:13,730
come and overshadow this child, created in Your image.

866
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,850
In the name of the Son and the Holy Spirit...

867
01:29:34,442 --> 01:29:37,492
Your life was ruined not by me!

868
01:29:39,633 --> 01:29:42,423
I am your savior!

869
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:46,797
Did he steal the scripture and run away?

870
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:52,170
Master, should I send someone to catch that bastard?

871
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:54,430
Let it go.

872
01:29:56,970 --> 01:30:01,135
Anyone present there will die anyway.

873
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:17,990
This crazy woman...

874
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:20,990
Bow before the guests, the deity of the land.

875
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,660
Protected by the sacrifice of the family.

876
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:53,570
Today, right now, we pray for blessings to move forward.

877
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:57,080
Holy and glorious Mother of God,

878
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,330
Ever-virgin Mary and the shining Archangels,

879
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:03,432
I pray in the name of Your saints.

880
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:06,809
Stand with us always and everywhere.
Shut up!

881
01:31:07,145 --> 01:31:08,585
In the name of the Father, the Son,
Shut up now!

882
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:09,820
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

883
01:31:15,223 --> 01:31:16,223
I ask you,

884
01:31:17,343 --> 01:31:18,933
what are your names?

885
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,680
The first murderer.

886
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,220
Where are you from?

887
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:28,118
In the barrels of guns you humans point at each other,

888
01:31:28,223 --> 01:31:30,085
in polluted wells,

889
01:31:30,109 --> 01:31:32,866
and in cities built on deserts...

890
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,860
wherever there is gravity, there we are beside you.

891
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:45,500
Oh humans, blind to the law of attraction,

892
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,040
I am God...

893
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,520
It hurts... Save me...

894
01:32:12,433 --> 01:32:16,353
Sister... Save me...

895
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:21,897
The Lord is my shepherd, with Him, who can harm me?

896
01:32:22,029 --> 01:32:25,489
I fear not with the Lord by my side, my Lord.

897
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,130
Sister... Save me...

898
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:33,507
You are right.

899
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:38,522
I will imprison you in my belly.

900
01:32:42,183 --> 01:32:43,393
How dare you...

901
01:32:45,202 --> 01:32:49,640
force me into that filthy place?

902
01:32:53,852 --> 01:32:58,320
The foul place you promised to keep pure?

903
01:32:59,915 --> 01:33:03,577
Consider it an honor, worthless horse-headed one.

904
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:10,728
You crazy woman, I challenge you!

905
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:14,630
Come to me! I will be reborn as a demon!

906
01:33:14,896 --> 01:33:17,516
I will honor you as my mother!

907
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,850
West mountain deity and south mountain deity!

908
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,030
Great mountain deity and small mountain deity!

909
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:41,351
Great separation deity and small separation deity!

910
01:33:41,633 --> 01:33:42,553
Great evil and small evil...

911
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:47,116
What is your name, demon?

912
01:33:50,576 --> 01:33:52,015
Sister...

913
01:33:52,706 --> 01:33:53,690
Your name.

914
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,960
Call me 'Destruction.'

915
01:33:56,227 --> 01:33:59,602
You are the bacteria that makes rotting fruit rot even more.

916
01:33:59,715 --> 01:34:00,670
Name!

917
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:04,630
I have existed everywhere since the beginning.

918
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:07,691
Those who fear us call us the 12 Evil Spirits.

919
01:34:08,713 --> 01:34:11,590
You dare call yourselves the 12 Evil Spirits?

920
01:34:23,070 --> 01:34:26,450
Hee-joon... Hee-joon...

921
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:36,580
Hee-joon! Don't give up!

922
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:40,050
The spirits descend, the spirits descend!

923
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:49,440
A cowardly soul hiding inside a weak child! Pitiful bastard!

924
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:52,488
You are nothing but a bug,

925
01:34:52,513 --> 01:34:54,060
crawling in every corner!

926
01:34:54,367 --> 01:34:58,351
An invisible shadow at night, a lowly slave of the 12 Evil Spirits!

927
01:34:58,491 --> 01:35:02,030
A servant of evil must bow before an unordained nun!

928
01:35:02,367 --> 01:35:03,820
Marbas' dwarf horse!

929
01:35:04,089 --> 01:35:08,692
How dare you belittle me...

930
01:35:09,239 --> 01:35:11,370
You, among all humans...

931
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:15,660
Arrogant bastard... Filthy woman!

932
01:35:18,574 --> 01:35:21,040
I am the Grand Duke of Hell!

933
01:35:21,339 --> 01:35:22,509
Say your name.

934
01:35:23,494 --> 01:35:27,158
Declare your name and make me tremble!

935
01:35:27,338 --> 01:35:32,060
I am the Grand Duke of Hell.

936
01:35:33,579 --> 01:35:35,499
I am Gamigin!

937
01:35:51,613 --> 01:35:55,175
You, whom God has given the power and mission to crush Satan's head,

938
01:35:55,434 --> 01:35:58,080
oh great Queen of Heaven, Mother of Angels,

939
01:35:58,344 --> 01:36:02,907
I humbly pray for You to send the heavenly army

940
01:36:02,932 --> 01:36:07,094
to drive the demons to hell, chase them to the ends of the earth,

941
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:09,185
subdue their arrogance,

942
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:12,420
and finally, cast them into hell.

943
01:36:12,686 --> 01:36:13,436
Amen.

944
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:20,524
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I command you,

945
01:36:20,784 --> 01:36:24,359
Gamigin! Get out of there now!

946
01:36:58,173 --> 01:37:02,303
<i>Lord, no matter how much the heart suffers...</i>

947
01:37:08,793 --> 01:37:12,053
<i>the ocean remains as blue as ever.</i>

948
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:31,012
<i>Thank you, Sister.</i>

949
01:37:33,383 --> 01:37:35,463
<i>You've worked hard.</i>

950
01:37:42,584 --> 01:37:45,425
Lord, please hear our prayers.

951
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:48,071
Saint Michael, please hear our prayers.

952
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:50,710
Saint Gabriel, please hear our prayers.

953
01:37:50,896 --> 01:37:53,356
Saint Raphael, please hear our prayers.

954
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:56,240
Lord, please hear our prayers.

955
01:37:56,766 --> 01:37:58,306
Saint Michael, please hear our prayers...

956
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:03,960
Sister...

957
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:07,463
Are you okay, Sister?

958
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:11,380
Well done.

959
01:38:48,593 --> 01:38:50,143
Take Hee-joon first.

960
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,659
Take the boy to the nearest church.

961
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:25,669
Gamigin will try to reclaim Hee-joon.

962
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:27,920
Hurry, go.

963
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:29,510
What about you, Sister?

964
01:39:31,923 --> 01:39:35,067
Ring the church bell three times.

965
01:39:35,430 --> 01:39:36,662
So I can hear it.

966
01:39:36,783 --> 01:39:38,453
What about you, Sister?

967
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:50,325
Dear God...

968
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:53,978
Go, there's no time left.

969
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:56,790
We must save Hee-joon.

970
01:39:56,790 --> 01:40:02,000
No... I don't want to.

971
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:03,960
Don't... Let's find another way,

972
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:06,275
There must be another way, right?

973
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:09,699
Save Hee-joon.

974
01:40:13,276 --> 01:40:15,526
Sister has gone mad...

975
01:40:18,102 --> 01:40:21,442
You crazy woman!

976
01:40:45,444 --> 01:40:50,948
In the name of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary,

977
01:40:51,882 --> 01:40:56,180
I command you, leave immediately.

978
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:05,600
Dear Lord...

979
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:11,347
Please delay judgment and grant me the wisdom to save those around me.

980
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:14,660
Please grant us salvation.

981
01:41:15,696 --> 01:41:20,536
Please protect us.

982
01:42:20,970 --> 01:42:23,060
Move aside! Please move aside!

983
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,230
I'm sorry!

984
01:42:24,270 --> 01:42:25,770
Sorry! Let me through!

985
01:42:25,770 --> 01:42:27,810
Move aside!

986
01:42:27,810 --> 01:42:28,650
Move aside! Please understand!

987
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:29,650
Move aside!

988
01:42:30,119 --> 01:42:31,329
Damn it!

989
01:42:32,137 --> 01:42:32,978
Is this nun crazy?

990
01:42:33,003 --> 01:42:33,718
Let me go!

991
01:42:33,743 --> 01:42:35,380
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

992
01:42:36,613 --> 01:42:37,283
Damn it!

993
01:42:37,949 --> 01:42:38,949
Are you guys insane?

994
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,880
I'm fine...

995
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:08,590
Sister, hurry and go!

996
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:11,260
Go quickly!

997
01:43:20,116 --> 01:43:21,666
<i>Leave us,</i>

998
01:43:22,767 --> 01:43:24,857
<i>and never return to this place again.</i>

999
01:43:26,546 --> 01:43:29,546
<i>Do not touch us.</i>

1000
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:33,090
<i>And do not touch any child.</i>

1001
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:38,483
<i>Lord Jesus Christ, Virgin Mary,</i>

1002
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:44,080
<i>and Saint Michael the Archangel, please fight for us.</i>

1003
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:07,130
Sorry...

1004
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:08,460
Sorry.

1005
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,050
Wait!

1006
01:45:16,166 --> 01:45:17,046
Hee-joon!

1007
01:45:20,237 --> 01:45:21,247
Hee-joon!

1008
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:40,580
Take Hee-joon to the hospital.

1009
01:45:41,370 --> 01:45:45,210
I must go to Sister Giunia.

1010
01:45:45,542 --> 01:45:46,901
N-no, you can't!

1011
01:45:47,136 --> 01:45:49,716
I must go to her!

1012
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:56,680
Are you okay, Sister?

1013
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:58,336
I'm fine, really.

1014
01:46:32,090 --> 01:46:33,890
<i>Oh Immaculate Mother,</i>

1015
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:37,496
<i>angels and archangels,</i>

1016
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:41,260
<i>all saints in heaven,</i>

1017
01:46:42,930 --> 01:46:44,770
<i>please descend upon me.</i>

1018
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:51,381
<i>Melt me, rebirth me,</i>

1019
01:46:52,610 --> 01:46:57,302
<i>cast evil into the fires of hell,</i>

1020
01:46:58,370 --> 01:47:02,410
<i>fill me with Your presence and use me as Your instrument...</i>

1021
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:07,136
<i>So they can no longer harm</i>

1022
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:10,290
<i>any living being on earth.</i>

1023
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:17,010
<i>Protect us.</i>

1024
01:47:41,450 --> 01:47:45,496
<i>In the name of the Father and the Son,</i>

1025
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:49,080
<i>and the Holy Spirit.</i>

1026
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:55,210
<i>Amen.</i>

1027
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:18,176
<i>Parish of the Rosary Cross</i>

1028
01:48:18,367 --> 01:48:21,536
I didn't think Father would come here personally.

1029
01:48:22,323 --> 01:48:26,573
I am the one presiding over this ritual.

1030
01:48:27,597 --> 01:48:29,427
How is the boy?

1031
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:31,480
I heard you personally took care of him.

1032
01:48:32,123 --> 01:48:38,873
He's recovering quickly but still needs more time.

1033
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:42,840
Ah! Right...

1034
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:46,870
Yes?

1035
01:48:47,296 --> 01:48:52,596
I suppose you don't have much goodwill toward us...

1036
01:48:56,720 --> 01:49:01,100
You could say we are very cautious with this ritual.

1037
01:49:03,753 --> 01:49:05,633
I'm just joking...

1038
01:49:06,860 --> 01:49:11,910
We all have the right to choose.

1039
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:14,700
You, me,

1040
01:49:14,993 --> 01:49:17,163
and Sister Giunia.

1041
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:28,862
Kang Sung-ae
Sister Giunia

1042
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:25,889
Where are we going now?

1043
01:50:27,803 --> 01:50:31,933
Anywhere the 12 Evil Spirits are present.

1044
01:50:36,656 --> 01:50:38,576
Can I handle it?

1045
01:50:42,657 --> 01:50:44,407
You've learned what you needed to learn.

1046
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:51,470
I heard Sister Giunia passed on everything you needed to know.
