1
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,297
I'll leave.

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,885
So, Mia and Takuzo,
you two can become a married couple.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,179
That will solve all problems.

4
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:16,057
Why would you say that?

5
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:21,438
My brother is moving to Korea for work.

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,109
He asked me to go with him.

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,115
He's supportive of my dance career too.

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,620
I was over the moon.

9
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,333
So, I was really torn.

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,504
And, like Mia,

11
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,800
I couldn't figure out the answer.

12
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,847
But...

13
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,060
I just decided.

14
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,688
I'm going with him.

15
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,817
So you two should get married.

16
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,278
Are you serious?

17
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,279
Of course.

18
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,616
Then, this is ridiculous.
I won't let you do that!

19
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,618
But you want a child, right?

20
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,412
This won't work without you.

21
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,958
I mean, Mia and I didn't work out before.

22
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,628
You two have changed since then.

23
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,006
I think that now, the two of you

24
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,134
will do fine as a married couple.

25
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,264
<i>This is a story</i>
<i>about these three and their marriage.</i>

26
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,478
Two Husbands One Wife.

27
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,481
<i>It's the last episode already!</i>

28
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:53,071
I'll go stay at a hotel or something,
so take some time to think about it.

29
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,615
I think we should talk about this.

30
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,867
Well, whatever is in the soup, right?

31
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,869
The proof is in the pudding?

32
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,037
That's it.

33
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,081
Anyway, I'm off.

34
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,751
Oh.

35
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,463
If the situation feels right,
you two can go ahead and do it. Okay?

36
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,091
Isn't it unbelievable?

37
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:18,179
Not really. If you think about the child,
I think that's the best option.

38
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:23,017
I know that. But it's like,
why did we go through all the trouble?

39
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,730
You found the option of marrying your ex
because you went through all that.

40
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,775
We don't need that option.

41
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,986
It was so awkward this morning.

42
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,363
Ah, so you are aware of him.

43
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:39,242
Are you pushing me towards
a two-person marriage by any chance?

44
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,287
Well, yeah. That's way better
than a three-person marriage.

45
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,331
I thought you were all for
a three-person marriage.

46
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,167
That's because
you said that's the only choice.

47
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:53,131
If you can have a two-person marriage,
there's no hassle or judgment.

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,925
That's great, then.

49
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,719
What's great about it?

50
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:04,142
As Shinpei said,
that'll solve all your problems.

51
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,977
It's a win-win-win.

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,395
How so?

53
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,272
Shinpei sacrificed himself.

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,151
But he's close to his brother, right?

55
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,195
It's not a sacrifice.
Maybe this is what he really wants.

56
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:25,371
Plus, you're crazy about Mia.

57
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,376
The child issue is solved too.

58
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,921
See, it really is a win-win-win.

59
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,297
Everyone wins.

60
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,345
Welcome back.

61
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:41,888
Hi.

62
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,974
I just got home too.

63
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:46,893
Yeah?

64
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,731
Oh, have you eaten?

65
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,150
No.

66
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,152
You?

67
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,196
I haven't either.

68
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,829
It's Shinpei's turn to make dinner today.

69
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,458
When you weren't here,

70
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,921
we had <i>gyoza</i> every single day.

71
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:20,593
He wanted to have your favorite dish
ready in case you came back.

72
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,054
I tore it.

73
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,311
You guys can be sweet.

74
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,569
Do you think he meant it?

75
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:39,988
About?

76
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,615
That he wants to live with his brother.

77
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,292
I don't think it's a lie.

78
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,796
Right.

79
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,011
But I also think...

80
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,642
that it's out of kindness.

81
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,229
Right.

82
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,151
What do you think about this?

83
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,820
Our two-person marriage.

84
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,540
I'm not sure.

85
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,502
It wasn't an option.

86
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,505
Yeah.

87
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:42,925
What about you?

88
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,100
It does solve the child issue...

89
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,646
that's a fact.

90
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,526
But...

91
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,534
I'm not sure either.

92
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:27,970
BIG BRO

93
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,430
<i>I did some research.</i>

94
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,352
KOREA DANCE AUDITION

95
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,271
KOREA DANCER/ARTIST AUDITION

96
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,360
I haven't said I'm going yet.

97
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,255
<i>Nothing was resolved,</i>
<i>but it's already Sunday.</i>

98
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,716
What are we supposed to do?

99
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,512
<i>Don't ask a rabbit.</i>

100
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,771
Takuzo.

101
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,566
- It's my mom.
- What?

102
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,069
You said you want to talk to me.

103
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,863
Open the door.

104
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,366
I asked her schedule
to officially tell her about the marriage.

105
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,245
Wh-What should we do?

106
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,333
Oh, I want two salted bean<i> daifuku</i>.

107
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,918
Yes, ma'am.

108
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,299
You didn't answer my text,
so why did you suddenly show up?

109
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,343
I tried to ignore it, but I was concerned.

110
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,555
So I decided to stop by
since I'm going to a concert. The end.

111
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,432
The end?

112
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,894
It's probably not good news anyway, is it?

113
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,979
I'm reluctant to hear it.

114
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,899
Oh, can I have two?

115
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
- Right, sorry.
- No worries.

116
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,654
Where's that cute boy today?
Has he gone out?

117
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,974
His clothes aren't here.

118
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,644
Um, well...

119
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,314
What's going on?

120
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,444
To tell you the truth...

121
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,740
Did you think about it?

122
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,452
Yeah, I thought hard with my empty brain.

123
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,037
And?

124
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,999
Here.

125
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:02,917
Thank you.

126
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:04,961
Don't worry.

127
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,797
I'm not like Dad.

128
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:13,427
If I say I'll watch over you,
that means I'll never abandon you.

129
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,024
Was Dad a bad guy?

130
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,737
A good dad won't leave his children.

131
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,155
That's true,

132
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,449
but I've been thinking...

133
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,704
Maybe Dad wasn't a bad guy,

134
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,581
it's just that

135
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,543
he didn't match the norms of society.

136
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,921
And your answer?

137
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,549
Before I answer,
I want to show you something.

138
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,762
I see.

139
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,726
What do you think we should do?

140
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,396
You're asking me?

141
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:09,817
Sorry.

142
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,157
But, this Shinpei boy.

143
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,326
He's smart.

144
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:25,041
Marriage is obviously
meant to be between a man and a woman.

145
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,298
You'll never solve the child issue either.
It was unrealistic to begin with.

146
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,468
- Right.
- Yes.

147
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,055
That said...

148
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,896
Why would you quit just because
you can't figure out what to do?

149
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,153
You've never met anyone
from my side of the family, have you?

150
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,157
Oh, that's true.

151
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,286
You said you lost touch with them.

152
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,080
They've disowned me.

153
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,415
What?

154
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,336
I got pregnant with you
when I was dating your father.

155
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,089
They didn't allow me to have the baby.

156
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,383
We lived in the sticks.

157
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:20,179
We'd be judged by those around us
for marrying because I got pregnant.

158
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,474
Should I choose my family?

159
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,977
Or the child inside me?

160
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,606
I racked my brain and agonized over it.

161
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,902
But however much I think about it,
I couldn't figure it out.

162
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,867
In the end, it was an impulse.
Whatever, I'll just have the baby!

163
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:49,417
And now, I'm so glad I had you.
Best decision ever.

164
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,129
That's how it is.

165
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,422
An answer?

166
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,467
You won't get one until you make a move.

167
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,889
But look at you two right now.

168
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,686
All you do is whine and hesitate.

169
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:13,065
Do you really want to be happy?

170
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,651
Thinking doesn't help.

171
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,529
If you want to be happy,

172
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,031
you gotta go with a bang.

173
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,161
Make up your mind with a bang
and take that step.

174
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,830
Bang. Bang, bang!

175
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,000
Just keep moving forward.

176
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,711
Focus and get in the zone.

177
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,839
Nothing will start
if you don't make a move.

178
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,133
Mom.

179
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,051
I...

180
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,220
I'm gonna go.

181
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,730
You went through
so much to give birth to me.

182
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,358
I need to be happy.

183
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,828
Oh, no... I gave him a push.

184
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,881
Are they your fans?

185
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,925
So many of them.

186
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,014
Watch me perform
and see if I'm worth it, okay?

187
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,829
No answer.

188
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,414
Hey, look.

189
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,374
It's last-minute,

190
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,877
<i>but I'll do a street performance</i>
<i>near the stairs at Shibuya's west exit.</i>

191
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,920
That way!

192
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,698
Thanks, everyone.

193
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,826
As a special treat,
I'll do one more song today.

194
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,256
What did you think?

195
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,801
I don't know much about dancing.

196
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,557
I'm supporting you because it's something
you want to do. Isn't that enough?

197
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,476
Shinpei!

198
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,776
Shinpei.

199
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:08,282
If you want to go with your brother,
we'll support your choice

200
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,160
and we won't get married.

201
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,663
But...

202
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,335
If we do, it has to be the three of us.

203
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,547
There's... no other option.

204
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,926
What about the child issue?

205
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,513
I don't know.

206
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,976
I still don't know,
but we'll move forward with a bang

207
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,479
and figure out the answer.

208
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,980
The three of us together.

209
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,410
It's strange, huh?

210
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:58,874
I was the one who suggested all this,
but now you're trying to convince me.

211
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,876
Exactly!

212
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,419
Yeah.

213
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,800
I guess you can't tell
what the future holds.

214
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,897
I'm sorry.

215
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,066
I...

216
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,527
I can't go with you.

217
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,948
I really appreciate your offer.

218
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,327
But, I want to live with
people who need me.

219
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,247
Not someone who'll watch over me.

220
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,840
I guess you are like our dad after all.

221
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:53,429
You're someone
who doesn't match the norms of society.

222
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,851
I...

223
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,689
I'll step down as your caretaker.

224
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,655
You take care of yourself from now on.

225
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,615
I will.

226
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,802
I'm so glad you two came to get me!

227
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,808
I tried to act cool and left,
but I missed you so much.

228
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,852
You're telling us that now?

229
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,104
Why didn't you just come home?

230
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,648
- I couldn't.
- Geez.

231
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,443
Hey, give me a reverse hug from behind.

232
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,944
- What?
- What is that?

233
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,154
- Like this.
- This?

234
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,324
Reverse hug from behind is a normal hug!

235
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,034
There.

236
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,205
I'm home.

237
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,373
- Welcome home.
- Welcome home.

238
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,045
Perfect.

239
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,213
- Okay.
- Nice.

240
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,673
<i>A few months have passed.</i>

241
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,427
<i>This is what they look like now.</i>

242
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,348
Please take a look.

243
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,433
<i>They prepared an agreed contract</i>

244
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,896
<i>and agreed that the three of them will</i>
<i>share responsibility for the children.</i>

245
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,652
We've submitted the agreed contract.

246
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,861
Congrats!

247
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,325
<i>Only a few friends</i>
<i>and family know about it.</i>

248
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,953
<i>They'll inform others...</i>

249
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,579
What about work?

250
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,040
In due time.

251
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,875
<i>So he says.</i>

252
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,212
That's so weird.

253
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,213
Who cares.

254
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:57,511
<i>There are still lots of issues</i>
<i>to be solved and obstacles to overcome.</i>

255
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,141
Wait. Being in the middle looks like
I'm showing you two off. It's not good.

256
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,058
Does it?

257
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,854
But if I'm in the middle,
wouldn't I look like your matchmaker?

258
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,566
- Why?
- Yeah, this works best.

259
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,651
Wait. Then, let's do this.

260
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,486
Here. And like this.

261
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,445
And turn.

262
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,530
- Turn?
- Why?

263
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,865
Then there's no middle.

264
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,116
That's true, but...

265
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,744
<i>But it'll be fine.</i>

266
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,331
<i>The three of them will work things out!</i>

267
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,627
- Let's go.
- You're going too fast.

268
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,815
