<i>This man, who's glaring at Mapo Tofu,</i>

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,552

00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:11,886
TAKUZO MITSUDA
FIRST-CLASS ARCHITECT/SINGLE

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,055
<i>He is a protagonist of this story.</i>

5
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,269
<i>They didn't order any </i>gyoza<i>,</i>

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,564
<i>and his other favorite dish</i>
<i>is getting cold.</i>

7
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,566
<i>But there's a bigger problem.</i>

8
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,818
You love Chinese food, right?

9
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,696
But we can't order this much
if there's only two people.

10
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,615
If three of us get married,
it's three times the fun.

11
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,577
But we only carry a third
of the responsibilities and burdens.

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,870
Isn't that great?

13
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,205
<i>It's this conversation.</i>

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,333
How about having a trial?

15
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:43,835
What do you think?

16
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,714
Is this some kind of

17
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,467
suspicious solicitation?

18
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,762
No, I'm being serious.

19
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,890
If that's true, then this is just crazy.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,895
Isn't it an awesome idea?

21
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,730
Are you serious too?

22
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,190
Huh? Um...

23
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:10,111
Well, if Shinpei wants to, why not?

24
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,947
But why me?

25
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:17,160
That's because we both like you.

26
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,495
- Right?
- What?

27
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,248
W-Well... maybe? Oh!

28
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,251
You seemed lonely by yourself.

29
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,925
Oh, I see.

30
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,595
So, basically

31
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,975
this crazy idea is his way of telling you
he doesn't want to get married.

32
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,521
You don't want to admit that,
so you're going along with it.

33
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,690
And conveniently decided to use me.
I get it now.

34
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,609
You've got it all wrong, Takuzo.

35
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,111
Take my advice,

36
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,946
wake up and face the reality.

37
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,031
You know,

38
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,784
we're both
at the age to take life seriously.

39
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,789
Shut up. It's none of your business.

40
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,250
You dragged me into this.

41
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,877
What's the problem anyway?
Just go along with it!

42
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,047
You'll never be able to get married
any other way!

43
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:11,965
What?

44
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,258
Mia, relax.

45
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,175
But...

46
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,511
Hey. Let me make this clear.

47
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:22,308
I'd rather be alone
than to get married this way.

48
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,108
He left.

49
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:36,364
<i>This is a story of these three,</i>
<i>who had a bad start, and their marriage.</i>

50
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,783
What's their problem?

51
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,872
<i>Two husbands, one wife.</i>

- Hi.
- Good morning.

54
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,389
<i>Since then, he's been irritated.</i>

55
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,518
Oh, come on.

56
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,063
Sorry, Manager. I broke it again.

57
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,858
Times sure have changed.

58
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,028
<i>Very very irritated.</i>

59
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,280
- Excuse me.
- Oh, Ms. Tenma.

60
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,532
This is our next client's information.

61
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,576
CLIENT: FAMILY OF THREE

62
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,495
Thanks.

63
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:28,917
Takuzo.

64
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,837
Do you want to do it after work today?

65
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,591
Sounds good.

66
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,636

SAYO TENMA
SECOND-CLASS ARCHITECT/SINGLE

71
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,327
<i>She's Takuzo's junior co-worker</i>

72
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,914
<i>and his building block buddy.</i>
<i>They made a large-scale piece together.</i>

73
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,752
<i>By the way, she believes in</i>
<i>friendship between men and women.</i>

74
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,841
Oh, you saw Mia?

75
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,303
Yeah. I invited her to Pakkun's funeral.

76
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,181
Is she doing well?

77
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,432
Yup.

78
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,393
She's well, but...

79
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,144
But?

80
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,356
She was selfish as usual.

81
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,610
She brought her new boyfriend with her
to make me jealous.

82
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,570
So much drama.

83
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,114
On top of all that,

84
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,575
she yelled at me
saying I'll never be able to get married.

85
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:50,123
No one in the world is as selfish as her.

86
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,961
She's a human faulty housing
born with a construction defect.

87
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,796
You sound pretty pissed.

88
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,423
That's because I am.

89
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,803
But you still like her, huh?

90
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,264
What?

91
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,725
Were you listening?

92
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,771
You get worked up about things you like

93
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,025
but you pay no attention
to things you're not interested in.

94
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,818
I'm the same.

95
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,488
That doesn't mean...

96
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,577
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>his irritation turned into confusion.</i>

102
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,519
Huh?

103
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,438
About Takuzo.

104
00:05:56,397 --> 00:06:00,359
I know he declined, but wasn't there
something more you wanted to tell him?

105

You'll never be able to get married!

You still like her, huh?

109
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,652
I've made my decision, Pakkun.

00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,363

129
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,192
- First, introduce yourselves!
- I can do this.

131
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,202

132
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,536

I'm Kana Ohno.

00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:20,791
Um.

136
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,792
Yes?

137
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,755
Once you're married,
what kind of family do you want to build?

138
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,842
Oh, you don't waste time, do you?

139
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,303
You're an architect?

140
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,471
Yes.

141
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,680
Wow.

142
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,184
Why did you become an architect?

143
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,101
Huh?

144
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,647
Why did I... become one?

145
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,400
One moment please.

146
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,447
I like building things.

147
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,200
No, then I could've chosen carpenter.

148
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,745
Building blocks. My hobby became my job?

149
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,000
Time to promote yourselves!

150
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:12,635
Building blocks are known to be
the best educational toys for children.

151
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,805
But the best part is that
you can create anything you imagine

152
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,391
such as buildings or huge robots,

153
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,728
a whole city, or a monster.

154
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:27,400
You can make whatever you want
through trial and error.

155
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,570
It took me three months to make this.

156
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,032
It felt as if something hidden in
my subconscious mind had been discovered.

157
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,785
Like I've met
a version of myself I never knew before.

158
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,831
That is truly... an amazing thing.

159
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,838
You might think that

160
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,424
building blocks are just toys--

161
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,341
Hey,

162
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,971
you should talk about yourself
rather than building blocks.

163
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,730
The weather is great today.

164
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,399
Yes, it is.

165
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,568

<i>His ex-girlfriends' words</i>

Takuzo, you're so boring.

176
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,106
He was annoying.

177
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,148
Boring.

178
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,900

Can we talk for a bit?

183
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,595
Hey, you look pale.

184
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,973
Huh? Hey, Takuzo?

185
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,517
Takuzo!

186
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,437
Takuzo, come on.

187
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,407
Thirty-six point four? Totally average!

188
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,491
Sorry.

189
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,495
I'm relieved you're not ill or anything.

190
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:31,000
But you went there on an empty stomach
and no sleep? How nervous were you?

191
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,084
Sorry.

192
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,172
I asked Shinpei to go grocery shopping
to cook for you, okay?

193
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:37,965
Sorry.

194
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,758
Don't apologize so much.

195
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,303
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,721
Stop it.

197
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:44,722
I think

198
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,224
you were right.

199
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,604
It seems

200
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,356
I really can't get married.

201
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:57,985
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,946
I went too far that day.

203
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,159
When I was in grade school,

204
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,163
there was a boy called Hiro in my class.

205
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:14,502
I thought he was my best friend,
so I was always with him.

206
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,924
But one day,

207
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,926
my parents said...

208
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,848
"Don't follow Hiro around so much."

209
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,813
Apparently, his parents
called the school about it.

210
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,942
That I was bothering him.

211
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,865
I'm just not good at it.

212
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,745
Like how to read
people and relationships,

213
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,541
or understand boundaries
and everything like that.

214
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,672
It's the same with Pakkun.

215
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:04,552
I didn't think
I'd love or miss them so much.

216
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,352
Actually,

217
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,106
I think you were right about me.

218
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,321
I think I used you

219
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,117
because I wanted to marry Shinpei.

220
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:31,912
But,

221
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,750
it's also true
that I thought it might work

222
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,295
if it's the three of us.

223
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,132
How should I put it?

224
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,969
There were things
that were too much for me alone,

225
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,891
but I think I can handle it if
there's another person to share it with.

226
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,519
The distance we couldn't fill

227
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,439
could be bridged by someone else,

228
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,649
if another person stepped in...

229
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,484
Takuzo, are you okay?

230
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,903
Oh, yeah.

231
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,195
Do you have a fever?

232
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,572
It was 36.4 degrees.

233
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,241
What? Is your
normal temperature like, 34.2 degrees?

234
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,160
- No.
- Of course not!

235
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,745
What are those flowers for?

236
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,164
I bought it. A get-well-soon gift.

237
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,249
It says <i>Bukka</i>.

238
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,209
What's that?

239
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,921
These are flowers you offer at funerals.

240
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,505
There's flowers for that?

241
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,674
Geez, talk about back luck.

242
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,177
Go and make some udon noodles.

243
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,179
Open.

244
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,390
Ta-da. Looks good.

245
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,976
Thank you for the meal.

246
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,615
How is it?

247
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,368
It's really good.

248
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,036
Thank goodness.

249
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,080
You should eat while it's hot too, Mia.

250
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:56,997
Yeah.

251
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,999
- There.
- There.

252
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,918
And mine, too.

253
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,589
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

254
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,720
- I'll serve.
- Thanks.

255
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,350
Wow, it looks so yummy.

256
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:17,935
Nice.

257
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,437
<i>Right now, Takuzo is thinking...</i>

258
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,481
I haven't had your <i>udon</i> in a while.

259
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,440
You're right.

260
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,151
<i>"Having them take care of me</i>
<i>when I'm unwell</i>

261
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,488
<i>makes me think</i>
<i>it's nice to have someone around.</i>

262
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,574
<i>I'm so predictable."</i>

263
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,746
Ready? Rock, paper, scissors.

264
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,749
- Aw, why me?
- Yes!

265
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,793
Fine, I'll do it.

266
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,794
Thank you.

267
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,879
Sure, no problem.

268
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,089
You need help?

269
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,632
- No, it's fine.
- Really?

270
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,925
Leave it to me.

271
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,176
- Thanks.
- Sure.

272
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,196
You feel better?

273
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,407
Yeah.

274
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:14,992
Thanks.

275
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,618
Good.

276
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,665
Shinpei.

277
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,335
I think

278
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,839
she really wants to marry you.

279
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,510
This might be weird coming from me.

280
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,015
But I really want you to consider it.

281
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,030
I have. And that's my answer.

282
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,326
I'm... scared.

283
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,954
Of married life,

284
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,500
and of parenting, if we have a child.

285
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,754
I don't think the two of us can handle it.

286
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,674
I'm not reliable

287
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,011
and Mia isn't great
with responsibilities either.

288
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,226
If we have someone like you by our side,

289
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,062
it'll be super reassuring.

290
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,273
Someone like me?

291
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,489
You're responsible

292
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,117
and full of kindness.

293
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,579
Plus, you're just fun to be with.

294
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,010
Let me think about it.

295
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,346
What?

296
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,016
Give me six months.

297
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,186
No. Let's see.

298
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,647
I need at least a year.

299
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,775
Y-You mean

300
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,196
you'll try it out for a year?

301
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,615
- What?
- Thank you, Takuzo!

302
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,825
No, no. Hey.

303
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,868
Wait. Hey!

304
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:21,827
Mia!

305
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,495
- Mia.
- No, wait!

306
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,205
He said he'll give it a try.

307
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,041
- What? Really?
- Yay! Hooray!

308
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,334
No, that's not it!

309
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,629
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

310
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,006
- What's this?
- Happy dance.

311
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,090
No way.

312
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,843
- Happy dance?
- Happy dance.

313
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,345
A three-person marriage?

314
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,560
This is too much twirling.

315
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,733
Th-Then, um... Go to a hot spring.

316
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,067
A hot spring?

317
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,527
<i>The three of us.</i>

318
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,154
In the end, I got dumped.

319
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,364
<i>You're the one she chose.</i>

320
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,158
- That really is creepy.
- What?

321
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,119
- They're so fluffy.
- So fluffy.

322
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,495
