1
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:08,717
Oh man, what's going on?

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,260
<i>They took over your room.</i>

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,220
- Coming through!
- W-Watch out!

4
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,471
It's so heavy.

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,390
Did you wipe the box? Is it clean?

6
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,351
Yes and yes.
I thought my fingers would rip off.

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,729
- Watch out.
- Be careful.

8
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:21,813
There.

9
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:25,024
Hey, don't slam it down like that.
I have neighbors downstairs.

10
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,277
- Sorry.
- Shinpei, where does this go?

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,988
Just put it near that Hikone-like figure.

12
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:30,905
Where?

13
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:31,823
Here?

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,575
- Stop!
- What?

15
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,160
- Watch it!
- Fine, sorry!

16
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,703
H-Hey!

17
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,542
Oh, no.
Could you put this somewhere over there.

18
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,460
Got it.

19
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,089
A NEW CHALLENGE IN BED

20
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,175
A NEW STAGE: THREESOME

21
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,845
So heavy.

22
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,014
There.

23
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,891
My lower back is killing me.

24
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,517
We have more?

25
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,979
<i>This is a story about</i>
<i>these three and their marriage.</i>

26
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,733
Two Husbands One Wife

27
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,707
We have no place to go back to.

28
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,960
We didn't renew our contract
for our apartment.

29
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,005
You idiots.

30
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,174
Sorry.

31
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,469
Think of it as a part of the trial.

32
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:38,014
We'll look for a new place,
so let us stay for a little while.

33
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,767
Living together
will only end up in disaster.

34
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,435
You don't know that!

35
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,437
Oh, I know for sure.

36
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,066
Okay, for example.

37
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,239
Shinpei.

38
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,367
What do you think of this?

39
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,035
What do I think?

40
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,703
<i>You went to toilet earlier.</i>

41
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,081
<i>Why did you leave it like this?</i>

42
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,418
<i>Why didn't you change</i>
<i>the toilet roll for the next person?</i>

43
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,003
There's some left.

44
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,296
Hear that? This is why.

45
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,801
<i>This is too little for one sitting, right?</i>

46
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,720
This isn't enough
to wipe your butt, is it?

47
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,681
That depends on each person.

48
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,560
One more thing.
It's been bugging me since the trip,

49
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,103
but when you leave the toilet

50
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,398
you don't close the toilet lid.
Why is that?

51
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,950
<i>It is so that</i>
<i>others could smell your excretions?</i>

52
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,743
- No.
- No?

53
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,078
No, right?

54
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,872
Then why leave it open?

55
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,623
U-Um...

56
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:47,917
Shinpei.

57
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:52,547
A person's true colors
really show in how they use the toilet.

58
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,299
There is your weird toilet theory.

59
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:58,344
You see, during the two and a half years
I dated Mia, I was constantly troubled

60
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,221
by her arrogant selfishness.

61
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,558
That's why I gave in
and followed your rules, didn't I?

62
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,853
You gave in reluctantly.
That doesn't mean you changed.

63
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,855
I promise.

64
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,858
I'll change the toilet roll
and close the lid.

65
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,859
We'll see.

66
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,611
It's easier said than done.

67
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:19,407
Oh, then how many times a week
do you do your laundry?

68
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,576
When it piles up?

69
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,578
See! That's what I'm talking about!

70
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:27,332
Why do you have to wait
for it to pile up? Wash it everyday.

71
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,541
Wait. Then,

72
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,045
what about the dishes?
When do you do them?

73
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,880
When they pile up.

74
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,925
Why? Why do you let them pile up?

75
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,594
You don't earn any reward points for it.
Right?

76
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,804
When do you clean the room?

77
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,056
When it gets dirty.

78
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,559
Don't let it get dirty.

79
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,604
You idiot!

80
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,356
Don't call him an idiot!

81
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,858
Idiot. You're both idiots.

82
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,986
I bet you two live in a messy room
like nothing's wrong.

83
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,906
<i>You sleep on garbage bags</i>
<i>as you get bitten by ticks.</i>

84
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,491
Oh, then.

85
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,454
How many times a year
do you wash your bedding?

86
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,622
Bedding?

87
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,625
We have to wash them?

88
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,087
This can't be happening.

89
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,839
This is a nightmare.

90
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,010
Okay, that's it.

91
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,555
I'm assigning you chores
for each day of the week right now.

92
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,392
You have to stick with it, okay?
Do it every day!

93
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,478
<i>If you're assigning chores,</i>

94
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,731
<i>that pretty much means</i>
<i>you've accepted to live with them.</i>

95
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,778
I'm so tired.

96
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,781
I didn't think
it'd take five hours to set rules.

97
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,951
Do not underestimate Takuzo.

98
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,215
Wait.

99
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,467
We shouldn't do it today.

100
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,429
Come on. I just want to cuddle.

101
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,153
Don't you two dare make out in my room.

102
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,739
We won't!

103
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,411
Goodness sake.

104
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,794
So, just out of curiosity,

105
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,549
if we're doing the three-person marriage,

106
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:46,012
are the three of us
going to have sex together?

107
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,806
Yeah, about that.

108
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,810
I thought that might be a possibility too,

109
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,897
so I've been gathering information on it.

110
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,110
But let's take our time to decide on this.
It's a sensitive topic after all.

111
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,947
I see.

112
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,244
So until we decide on it,
the two of us can't have sex either?

113
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,247
Well,

114
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:17,043
judging by the way he was,
I think we should show some respect.

115
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,674
- Wha...
- I forgot something.

116
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,929
Nothing. We're not doing anything.

117
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,847
Two Husbands One Wife.

118
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,365
<i>Feeling aroused.</i>

119
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,828
<i>Very aroused.</i>

120
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,998
<i>Very very aroused.</i>

121
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,970
<i>Even more aroused.</i>

122
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,067
Stay strong.
A samurai glories in honorable poverty.

<i>turned to disgust.</i>

Game of tag with our fingers.

127
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,964
With your requirements,

128
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:49,635
we can only
offer you a one-room apartment.

129
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,722
If it's a wooden building,
the neighbors could hear...

130
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,015
<i>Very disgusted.</i>

131
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,767
Hey, don't say that here.

132
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,811
<i>Very very disgusted.</i>

133
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,444
Sorry, I have something stuck in my teeth!

134
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,030
- We just had lunch.
- Yes, that's right.

135
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,448
Something's stuck.

136
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,093
- Hey, Takuzo.
- Yeah?

137
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,596
Have you ever had a threesome?

138
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,893
My friend with benefits
wants to give it a try.

139
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:42,855
But I'm not really into adventurous sex,
you see.

140
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,821
A NEW STAGE: THREESOME

141
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,282
No.

142
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,620
I could never do stuff like that.

143
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,548
Well... There's no way I can.

144
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,716
This conversation is over.

145
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,260
What?

146
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,516
I'll go get a coke.

147
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,155
<i>Takuzo, you say</i>
<i>"I'm home" when you come home.</i>

148
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,370
- Welcome home, Takuzo.
- Hi!

149
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,621
I-I'm home.

150
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,832
- Come and sit.
- Come on.

151
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,584
Wait, I haven't washed my hands.

152
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,168
- Wet towel.
- Thanks.

153
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,545
Sit down.

154
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,005
- Hurry.
- What is this?

155
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,090
Shinpei, did you make all this?

156
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,843
I've been cooking
since I was a kid. Go on and eat.

157
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,094
- Hurry.
- Right.

158
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,346
Then, thank you for the meal.

159
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,863
Th-This is so good.

160
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,366
What is this?

161
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,328
Oh, I just bit into something very tasty.

162
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,787
Oh? What was it?

163
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,248
I used whatever was left in the fridge.

164
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,875
- Leftover ingredients?
- Yeah.

165
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,126
To make this?

166
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,920
That's impressive.

167
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,714
You're really amazing.

168
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,134
You're praising me so much?
You'll make me blush.

169
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,553
- We should eat too.
- Let's eat.

170
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,390
Ready?

171
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,893
- Let's dig in.
- Let's dig in!

172
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,353
Okay.

173
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,029
It really was tasty.

174
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,949
<i>Huh? You seem to be enjoying this.</i>

175
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,661
<i>Maybe everything will work out well.</i>

00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,100
- You're drying them outside today?
- Yes.

182
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,769
I like how the clothes feel more fresh.

183
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,021
I know what you mean, I like it too.

184
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,023
I'll help.

185
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,777
Sure. If you want.

186
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,032
Takuzo, your phone is ringing.

187
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,580
Hello? What's up?

188
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,292
What?

189
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,587
Sounds like I should deal with it.

190
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,006
Okay. I'll be there in a bit.

191
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,884
- Is it work?
- Yeah.

192
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,887
I need to go to the office.

193
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:07,017
I haven't done
any of my chores today though.

194
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,189
Don't worry about it.
You have to go to work, right?

195
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,109
Yeah. Thanks.

196
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,569
Sorry.

197
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,824
- Hey, Shinpei.
- Hmm?

198
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,286
The TV's remote control
isn't working properly.

199
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,954
Which is the right one?

200
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,632
They ended up going with the initial plan.

201
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,345
I'm going to take it as a compliment
that my blueprint was perfect.

202
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,848
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,811
How about I treat you to dinner
after this? To make up for today.

204
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,818
- Welcome home, Takuzo.
- Hi!

205
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,576
Thanks, but I'll go home today.

206
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,328
Really?

207
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,537
That's a surprise.

208
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,955
Right?

209
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,212
See you.

210
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,923
You're leaving already?

211
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,390
<i>You even bought cakes for them.</i>

212
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,893
<i>You must have liked</i>
<i>being welcomed home by them.</i>

213
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,110
We're home.

214
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,820
Hi, we're back.

215
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,822
Was everything okay at work?

216
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:45,950
Where were you?

217
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,952
At a dance event.

218
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,870
He performed at the last minute.

219
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,871
Just a little.

220
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,332
What about dinner?

221
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,669
You haven't eaten? We ate on our way home.

222
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,629
What's that?

223
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,589
It's nothing.

224
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,176
- You want tea?
- Yes.

225
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,513
Do we have enough?

226
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,348
There isn't much left.

227
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,934
I wrote it on the shopping list.

228
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,314
When I was leaving
you said not to worry about the chores.

229
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,942
Huh? Yeah.

230
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,653
If you're busy, you can do it tomorrow.

231
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,407
A normal person would think
that you'd take over the chores

232
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,659
from the conversation
we had earlier today.

233
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,995
But it's your turn.

234
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,956
A normal person would be
considerate enough to help.

235
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,208
What normal person?

236
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,919
You could've just
asked us to do it for you.

237
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,256
Actually, I thought
we should take over for him.

238
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,925
What? Now you tell me?

239
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,927
I thought we'd do it when we got home.

240
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,139
And that?

241
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,850
Oh, I forgot.

242
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,686
Are you kidding me?

243
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,023
I said I'm sorry. I'll do it now.

244
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,359
It's fine. I'll do it.

245
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,528
You go dance, okay?

246
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,446
Hey.

247
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,740
- What's with you?
- Who cares?

248
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,700
Why don't you two just play around?

249
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,285
- I'll do it.
- Stop!

250
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,496
- Hey, what are you doing?
- There's no point doing it now!

251
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,006
Did you buy those... for us?

252
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,510
They're ruined.

253
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,776
Mia?

254
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,373
It's good.

255
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,586
I want one too.

256
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,338
Thank you.

257
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,102
It's delicious.

258
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,236
Open up.

259
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,824
What?

260
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,202
Take a bite.

261
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,205
Come on.

262
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,352
It's so sweet.

263
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:06,942
Takuzo.

264
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,197
I'm sorry.

265
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,498
Me too.

266
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,419
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,180
I'm sorry too.

268
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,147
Then...

269
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,028
Let's shake hands and make up.

270
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,459
Are we good?

271
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,005
Yeah.

272
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,593
<i>Do you think</i>

273
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:19,098
<i>we'd have worked out</i>
<i>if we just apologized like that back then?</i>

274
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:23,685
We used to get stubborn
over trivial things, didn't we?

275
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,981
It's just a little, but I thought

276
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,653
that maybe
this three-person thing is not so bad.

277
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,407
Okay.

278
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,703
Then, can I ask you one more thing?

279
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,330
What is it?

280
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,878
What should we do about sex?

281
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,011
This is just one of the options, okay?

282
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,974
What are your thoughts on

283
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,977
having a threesome?

284
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,272
What about you?

285
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,025
Can you do it with me?

286
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,406
Does that mean, you can't?

287
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:23,912
Sorry.

288
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,290
To be honest, I don't know.

289
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,963
Well, of course.

290
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,883
We can take our time to figure it out.

291
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,884
Right.

292
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,720
Damn it.

293
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,471
I won.

294
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,101
- One more game?
- Why?

295
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,312
- Why not?
- You're too obvious.

296
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,106
<i>You don't get jealous?</i>

297
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,567
<i>Why would I? They're both men.</i>

298
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,194
Friendship is love too.

299
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,487
I want to know how you felt.

300
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,824
<i>It's hard for me to be around you.</i>

301
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,912
