1
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,050
<i>Home alone.</i>

2
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:10,844
<i>Morning alone.</i>

3
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:17,058
<i>An unmarried man, having a coffee</i>
<i>he made for himself, on his own.</i>

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,351
<i>Takuzo Mitsuda.</i>

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,020
TAKUZO MITSUDA
FIRST-CLASS ARCHITECT/SINGLE

6
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,355
<i>He is a protagonist of this story.</i>

7
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,277
<i>He's trying to think about marriage</i>
<i>like a grown-up.</i>

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,528
DIVERSIFIED MARRIAGE

9
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,071
THE CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE
HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY

10
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:34,617
<i>Domestic partnership, same-sex marriage,</i>
<i>weekend marriage, and roommate marriage.</i>

11
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,204
<i>His thoughts on marriage are...</i>

12
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,708
It's become so diverse.

13
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,085
<i>Nothing original.</i>

14
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,838
<i>He's not interested at all.</i>

15
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,215
<i>Well, not yet, at least.</i>

16
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,808
<i>Let's shift our focus to her.</i>

17
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,979
ANAGUMA REAL ESTATE

18
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,899
Now, the contract is complete.

19
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:06,816
Great.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,234
Thank you very much.

21
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,195
Thank you, too.

22
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,947
<i>She, Mia Yanoguchi, is also unmarried.</i>

23
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,032
MIA YANOGUCHI
REAL ESTATE AGENT/UNMARRIED

24
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,909
<i>She's sort of the protagonist too.</i>

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,369
This is for everyone.

26
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,913
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

27
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,539
Thank you so much!

28
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,665
Hope you like it.

29
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,294
<i>The first episode</i>
<i>is mainly from her point of view.</i>

30
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,296
I'm so glad I met you, Ms. Yanoguchi.

31
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,925
Your words just extended my lifespan
by ten years!

32
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,760
<i>She's pretty good at her job.</i>

33
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,806
A customer gave us curry bread.

34
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,140
I'll make coffee.

35
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,600
Thanks.

36
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:44,229
<i>She's the type</i>
<i>to enjoy the latest trends as well.</i>

37
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,523
But aren't you a vegan?

38
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,150
No, I'm a flexitarian.

39
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,194
Let's eat!

40
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,155
<i>But...</i>

41
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,201
CELEBRATING YUKI

42
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,244
FINALLY, THIS WEEK

43
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,662
SHE'S GETTING MARRIED TOO, HUH

44
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,915
<i>When it comes to relationships</i>
<i>and marriage, she's no good.</i>

45
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,835
<i>She suddenly becomes outdated and useless.</i>

46
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,587
Here.

47
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,839
Thanks.

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,424
Something wrong?

49
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,760
<i>That's the problem with you.</i>

50
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:20,431
<i>To be frank, our group hasn't disbanded</i>
<i>because Keiko is here.</i>

51
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,475
<i>It's all thanks to her.</i>

52
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,560
<i>That's true.</i>

53
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,063
<i>Don't fight.</i>
<i>For starters, our group name is...</i>

54
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,858
<i>Useless Mia is dating a younger man.</i>

55
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,902
<i>A dancer with an annual income</i>
<i>of 2.4 million yen.</i>

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,283
Shinpei.

57
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,701
Huh?

58
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,747
I have my friend's wedding this weekend.

59
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,082
I know.

60
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,293
You told me.

61
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,964
I'm sorry I'm spending
a lot on wedding gifts recently.

62
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,383
Everyone seems to be getting married.

63
00:02:55,466 --> 00:03:00,138
<i>Sending a "maybe we should too" beam</i>
<i>to her uninterested boyfriend.</i>

64
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,850
<i>Oh, by the way,</i>
<i>he's also one of the protagonists.</i>

65
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,685
<i>Shinpei Satomura.</i>

66
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,603
SHINPEI SATOMURA
DANCER/UNMARRIED

67
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,854
Isn't it rare?

68
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,440
Not many people get married these days.

69
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,821
Yeah. They're all so old-fashioned.

70
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,157
I mean, hello? It's the 21st century.

71
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:25,330
<i>I know.</i>
<i>Marriage isn't the only way to happiness.</i>

72
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,417
<i>I've heard that a million times.</i>

73
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,586
<i>I really do get it.</i>

74
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,046
<i>But...</i>

75
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,298
<i>But still.</i>

76
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,052
Hey, Shinpei.

77
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,638
Are you free this Saturday?

78
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,348
Huh?

79
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,724
Yeah.

80
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,310
WELCOME
YUKI AND EMIKO

81
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,020
OUR WEDDING RECEPTION

82
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,148
Now, please exchange your rings.

83
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,121
Congratulations, Yuki!

84
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,707
- Congratulations, Yuki!
- Congratulations!

85
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,835
They're beautiful. And they look so happy!

86
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,588
<i>Take the hint.</i>

87
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,299
<i>Feel the pressure.</i>

88
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,344
You two are now a married couple.

89
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,474
<i>It's a little different, but that's that.</i>

90
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,270
This is amazing.

91
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,647
Right? They look happy.

92
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,985
How does this work legally?

93
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,738
It's pretty formal.
They sign contracts and everything.

94
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,740
- Contracts?
- Yeah.

95
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,826
It's called an agreed contract.

96
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,246
They decide what to do
with their assets or if they have a child

97
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,290
and submit it to the city hall.

98
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,460
So, marriage is pretty flexible.

99
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,464
That's right.
It's like signing a contract for a house.

100
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,467
Marriage is not a burden.

101
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,469
I see.

102
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:16,482
Whatever happens in the future,
let's face it together hand in hand.

103
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,526
So that I can protect your smile

104
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,573
and to live our lives happily ever after.

105
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,826
With all my love.

106
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,162
I look forward to our lives together.

107
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,373
Mia.

108
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,502
I've come up with an incredible idea.

109
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,842
I might be able to handle marriage,
if it's not two people.

110
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,011
What?

111
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,016
If it doesn't have to be male and female,
it doesn't have to be two people, right?

112
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,352
Um. Wh-What kind of logic is that?

113
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,981
An odd number is better, right?

114
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,777
I wouldn't want too many people, so...

115
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,072
Three.

116
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,657
A marriage of three might work for me.

117
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,952
Yeah? Congrats on your great discovery.

118
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,913
Yeah. That will work.

119
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,668
I don't think I can support you by myself,
but I can if there's another person.

120
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,756
That way we'll also
be more stable financially, right?

121
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,927
Um, hang on.
Are you actually serious about this?

122
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,678
Of course.

123
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,223
I mean, you want to get married, right?

124
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,683
What? Did I say that?

125
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,353
You didn't, but I can sense your beams.

126
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,522
I'm struck by them every day.

127
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,528
Just so you know,
I want to get married too if I can.

128
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:44,862
Really?

129
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:49,617
But a two-people marriage is so hard.
There's so many responsibilities.

130
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,912
Wouldn't you be scared
to trust your life to me?

131
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:53,996
Think about it.

132
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,707
But if it's three people...

133
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,377
Yeah, I see it.

134
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,712
I can see the light.

135
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,382
- What? No.
- It'll work.

136
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,759
No, no.

137
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,969
Why--

138
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:08,886
Huh?

139
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,726
Congratulations!

140
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,062
Congratulations!

141
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,858
Congrats!

142
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:26,028
Let's look for someone
who's willing to get married to us.

143
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,080
I'm home.

144
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,426
<i>And so...</i>

145
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,678
- Let's find someone. Yeah?
- What? No, no.

146
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,722
Someone who'll marry us.

147
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,890
<i>This is a story</i>

148
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,934
<i>about these three and their marriage.</i>

149
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,985
<i>Two husbands, one wife.</i>

150
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,705
Three people? What does he mean?

151
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,335
<i>She's been distressed since that day.</i>

152
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,343
What's wrong with him?

153
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,011
<i>Very distressed.</i>

154
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,263
RENTAL APPLICATION FORM

155
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,229
What kind of situation is that?

156
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,564
<i>Very distressed.</i>

157
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,527
<i>Very very distressed.</i>

158
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,951
They do say

159
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,247
two heads are better than one.

160
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,209
I can understand the logic.

161
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,216
No, I don't! This is crazy!

162
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,801
We don't need you!

163
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,595
Who are you anyway? Geez!

164
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,576
What?

165
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,876
- Hey.
- Yeah?

166
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,797
My ex-boyfriend just messaged me.

167
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,591
Okay.

168
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:56,596
His pet died
and he's holding a funeral tomorrow.

169
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,431
Oh, I see.

170
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,558
I'm sorry to hear that.

171
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:05,062
Um, I took care of it
when I was with him. So...

172
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,565
Oh, of course. You should go.

173
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,482
What?

174
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,651
Y-You don't mind?

175
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,237
Not at all. You should go say goodbye.

176
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,699
Oh, right. Yeah.

177
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,785
<i>Ten percent of me thinks he's kind.</i>

178
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,497
<i>Ninety percent is thinking,</i>
<i>show some jealousy!</i>

179
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,209
<i>And so.</i>

180
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,297
MITSUDA

181
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,299
<i>I brought him with me.</i>

182
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,678
It's been a while.

183
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,639
Yeah.

184
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,309
Oh, he's the guy I told you about.

185
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,852
I'm Shinpei Satomura.

186
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,855
Hello.

187
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,608
Hello.

188
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:55,029
<i>Maybe he'll get jealous</i>
<i>if he actually meets my ex. Or not.</i>

189
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,366
Sorry. He really loves animals
so he wanted to pay his respect.

190
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,700
I-I do?

191
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,911
Can we come in?

192
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,830
- Sure.
<i>- Then maybe</i>

193
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,001
<i>he'll change his mind</i>
<i>about that idiotic idea.</i>

194
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,551
<i>I'm happy you came, Mia.</i>
<i>Even if you have such ulterior motives.</i>

195
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,263
It's been in the hospital
for about a month.

196
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,432
I see.

197
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:29,438
But it was almost 100 years old
in human years. It lived a good long life.

198
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,233
<i>Apologies for the late introduction.</i>

199
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,068
<i>I'm the rabbit, Pakkun.</i>

200
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,194
PAKKUN
RABBIT

201
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:39,448
<i>For a while, I've been watching over</i>
<i>Takuzo, Mia, and Shinpei</i>

202
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,325
<i>from up above in heaven.</i>

203
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,871
<i>The opening footage</i>
<i>is a video of me when I was still alive.</i>

204
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,377
<i>Thanks to Takuzo,</i>

205
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,630
<i>I was able to live a happy life.</i>

206
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:01,053
<i>Now, let Mia's</i>
<i>I'll-make-him-feel-jealous plan begin.</i>

207
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,598
Why did you choose a rabbit?

208
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:10,729
Because Ushijima in
<i>Ushijima the Loan Shark</i> had a pet rabbit.

209
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,022
Right?

210
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,649
<i>Jealous yet?</i>

211
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,817
I see.

212
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,862
Who'd think that after reading that comic?

213
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,864
You're such a weirdo.

214
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,741
- <i>Jealous yet?</i>
- Oh, shush.

215
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,911
<i>Where's the jealousy?</i>

216
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,248
But I like the rabbit scenes too.
It's kind of therapeutic.

217
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,835
- Don't force yourself to be nice.
- No, I really mean it.

218
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,296
<i>Zero jealousy.</i>

219
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,968
What? You made all these?

220
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,637
Well, I wouldn't say I made them.

221
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,015
I just paint and modify them.

222
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,184
Wow.

223
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,770
You've always been
good with your hands. Right, Takuzo?

224
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,855
Takuzo?

225
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,901
<i>Complimenting and calling my ex</i>
<i>by his given name. How's that?</i>

226
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:00,988
I really admire you, Takuzo.
I'm terrible at these things.

227
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,157
Can you show me more?

228
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,116
<i>It didn't work.</i>

229
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,034
Okay.

230
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,579
I've had my eyes on the one over there.

231
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,622
Which one?

232
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,626
<i>H-He's warming up to him instead.</i>

233
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,087
<i>One hour later.</i>

234
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,840
I prefer the SEED series too.

235
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,551
Right? I'm so happy to hear that.

236
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,721
Everyone seems to have
a different opinion on that.

237
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,973
Why did it turn out like this?

238
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,353
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>she's distressed. Very distressed.</i>

239
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,397
Hey, Mia.

240
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:36,815
What?

241
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,652
Why did you
break up with such a great guy?

242
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,153
Excuse me?

243
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:45,241
Well, he's funny and reliable.
He's awesome.

244
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,452
Hey, um...

245
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,913
You shouldn't say that.

246
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,790
Why not?

247
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:53,707
Well...

248
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:58,212
Hearing you say that
kind of makes me feel bad.

249
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,464
Huh? What do you mean?

250
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,886
Because he was annoying.

251
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,226
He always came to pick me up
in his car if I was out drinking,

252
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,646
or when I missed my last train
no matter how far it was.

253
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,399
He drove in the rain
to come get me with an umbrella.

254
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,359
He always came to pick me up!

255
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,319
I really hated that!

256
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,988
That's why I broke up with him!

257
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:27,867
Huh?

258
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,785
I don't get it.

259
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,161
Don't get what?

260
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,079
Um...

261
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,207
That's just being kind. Isn't it?

262
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,545
No.

263
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,299
I'm too much.

264
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,093
I get that a lot.

265
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,103
<i>Even in this situation,</i>
<i>Takuzo offered to drive them home.</i>

266
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,981
Takuzo is such a nice guy.

267
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,363
Say, Shinpei.

268
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,703
Did you say that
because you don't want to get married?

269
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,875
The three people thing?

270
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,669
What else?

271
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,342
It's the opposite.

272
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,223
I want to be with you forever,
so I want to figure out a way to do that.

273
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,728
I want to carry my weight
as much as I can.

274
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,610
I said it on a whim,
but I've been thinking about it since.

275
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,529
And now...

276
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,117
I'm pretty serious.

277
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,247
Oh, he's here.

278
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,471
What happened?

279
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,726
Sorry, this happens a lot these days.

280
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,228
What?

281
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,188
Well, obviously.

282
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,441
Look at your mileage.
It's over 180.000.

283
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:26,860
Sorry.

284
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,285
Should we call road service?

285
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,746
Let's push it to an car-repair shop.

286
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,081
What?

287
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,543
There's one nearby. You take the wheel.

288
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,268
Th-There's no need to cry about it.

289
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,863
Pakkun...

290
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,533
is dead.

291
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,956
I'm all alone now.

292
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,027
You drove 180.000 kilometers, huh?

293
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,365
This ridiculous distance you covered
was all for Mia, wasn't it?

294
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,244
Well, not all of it.

295
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:01,872
But,

296
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,874
I'm too much, right?

297
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,836
You're kind.

298
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,966
<i>Takuzo,</i>

299
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,096
<i>I'm sure this is</i>
<i>what Mia is thinking right now.</i>

300
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:22,226
<i>That your overwhelming kindness</i>
<i>might have been comforting</i>

301
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,812
<i>if it was shared with someone else.</i>

302
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,325
- Oh, good morning.
- Morning.

303
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,246
Can we talk?

304
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,753
Thank you for waiting.

305
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,422
Wow! This looks so delicious!

306
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,674
- Let's eat.
- I'll serve.

307
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,259
Ooh, this is great.

308
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,138
It's good.

309
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,141
- Here.
- Thanks.

310
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:03,892
Hey.

311
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,272
What is this dinner for?

312
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,609
- I-I'll try this.
- Yeah.

313
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,527
I mean...

314
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,448
If you're doing this to cheer me up,

315
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,284
you didn't have to.

316
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,627
Takuzo.

317
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:32,838
Yes?

318
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,132
Would you like to

319
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,136
get married to us?

320
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:40,888
Please.

321
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:44,766
What?

322
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,564
I'll do it.

323
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,443
<i>The distance we couldn't fill</i>
<i>could be bridged by someone else...</i>

324
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,112
I think she really wants to marry you.

325
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,823
<i>Time to promote yourselves!</i>

326
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,824
<i>What?</i>

327
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,118
<i>Do you want to do it after work today?</i>

328
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,912
