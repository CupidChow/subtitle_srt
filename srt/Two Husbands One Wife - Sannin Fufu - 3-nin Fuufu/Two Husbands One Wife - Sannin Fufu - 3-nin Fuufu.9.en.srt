00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,842
BEAVER ARCHITECTS

2
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,468
Let's eat.

3
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,479
Please marry me.

4
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,358
<i>I want to have</i>
<i>a friendship marriage with you.</i>

5
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,777
Let's give it a try.

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,784
Wow, your lunch looks good as always.

7
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,286
Oh, thank you.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,665
But being able to make
such a perfect <i>bento</i> is no good, huh?

9
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,542
It's no good?

10
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,795
Well, I'm okay with it.

11
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,214
But society can be judgmental.

12
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,593
If you're unmarried for a long time,

13
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,596
people might misunderstand,

14
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:00,060
and think something's wrong with you.
I'm not like that though.

15
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,479
I see.

16
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,191
<i>People nag you just for being unmarried.</i>

17
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,443
<i>Imagine what will happen</i>

18
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,613
<i>if your workplace finds out</i>
<i>about the three-person marriage.</i>

19
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,576
What are you gonna tell the workplace?

20
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,536
About what?

21
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,291
If you decide to go through with
the three-person--

22
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,210
- How are you gonna say it?
- Be quiet.

23
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,212
No need to be so loud!

24
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,633
Are you going to throw away
your successful career just like that?

25
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,052
Leaving the company
won't make any difference.

26
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:38,556
People might spread bad rumors and
you'll be kicked out of this industry.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,102
Are you sure you want to
cut ties with your family back home?

28
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:49,109
Regarding that point,
there'll be no problem if you marry me.

29
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,821
You're free to continue
your relationship with Mia and Shinpei.

30
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:03,957
If you don't want to live with me,
we can live separately.

31
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,087
Your lifestyle won't change at all.

32
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,799
We'll only be married on paper.

33
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,426
That sounds like

34
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,304
a fake marriage.

35
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,099
But it's not a crime.

36
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,685
That feels like

37
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,979
I'm deceiving everyone.

38
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:38,324
What's wrong with having a marriage
without romantic feelings?

39
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,121
Huh? Well, you know...

40
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,297
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

41
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,677
That's why you accepted the offer?

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,346
She said it's a one-week trial.

43
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,348
Unbelievable!

44
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,477
I had no reason to decline.

45
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:10,523
No reason? You should've declined
because you have us.

46
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,816
B-But...

47
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,067
Geez.

48
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,863
You're gonna get dumped in a week. Hmph!

49
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,992
Hmph! A woman who says
crazy things like that is no good.

50
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:21,910
Hmph.

51
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,581
Like you should be saying that. Hmph.

52
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,880
<i>And so, on a sunny Sunday afternoon...</i>

53
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,100
Welcome.

54
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,478
Let's do this.

55
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:55,235
<i>One week of a friendship marriage trial</i>
<i>with Ms. Tenma has begun.</i>

56
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,404
Two Husbands One Wife.

57
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:07,872
FRIENDSHIP MARRIAGE TRIAL, SEVEN DAYS LEFT

58
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,045
Nice.

59
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,514
I'm sorry I'm doing laundry
on the day I arrive.

60
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,598
No problem.

61
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,270
I prefer to dry my T-shirts inside out.

62
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,480
Me too.

63
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,901
I don't want the prints to fade.

64
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,362
Yeah, same.

65
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,954
Thanks.

66
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,749
I only get to drink coffee
when I'm with them.

67
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,543
I have coffee.

68
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,963
No. Aside from in the morning,
I prefer tea.

69
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,300
Good. Me too.

70
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,851
I have one favor to ask you.

71
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,270
What is it?

72
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:17,233
Can I talk casually when we're at home?

73
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,573
I want you to see
what it'll be like if we lived together.

74
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,701
Sure.

75
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,580
I don't mind
if you talk casually at the office too.

76
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,583
I'll use formal language at the office.

77
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,834
See. Still formal.

78
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,006
It's pretty difficult.

79
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,467
Then, how about

80
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,470
I call you by your given name?

81
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,930
Let's see.

82
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,016
Sayo.

83
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:52,727
No...

84
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,315
It's embarrassing,
so please stick with our usual style.

85
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,192
Ah, again. Formal language.

86
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,286
I was going to wash it. Sorry.

87
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:14,415
I don't mind. And I don't like
leaving dirty dishes until morning.

88
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,708
Me too.

89
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,669
But they're totally opposite.

90
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,465
They can leave dirty dishes for days.
Unbelievable, right?

91
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,342
Where do I put the dried dishes?

92
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,594
The bottom shelf.

93
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,512
Got it.

94
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,938
It's so relaxing
when there's no one nagging us.

95
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,914
If...

96
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,125
What if...

97
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,297
Forget it.

98
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,304
FRIENDSHIP MARRIAGE TRIAL, SIX DAYS LEFT

99
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,641
<i>Monday morning before going to work.</i>

100
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,943
Is this yours?

101
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,321
Oh, there it is!

102
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,034
Thanks. I've been looking for this.

103
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,293
You're the best, Ms. Tenma.

104
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,796
Those two would've thrown it away.

105
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,592
Like the other day,
I was going to paint my vinyl figure.

106
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,720
So I took it apart and left it--

107
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,637
Hey.

108
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:56,809
How about not talking
about them while you're here?

109
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,061
Huh?

110
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,192
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

111
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,488
I'll be careful.

112
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,780
No, it's fine.

113
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:15,786
Even when you marry me, I want you
to have a good relationship with them.

114
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,333
No, I was in the wrong.

115
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,129
No, it's me. I'll take it back.

116
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,548
Forget I said that.

117
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,889
<i>Friday night.</i>

118
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,560
OUR HOME

119
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:44,607
FRIENDSHIP MARRIAGE TRIAL, TWO DAYS LEFT

120
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,504
What?

121
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,632
Nothing.

122
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:22,144
So, why don't you fall in love?

123
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,691
I do.

124
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,112
Actually, I fall in love quite easily.

125
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,822
Oh, really?

126
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,868
But every time that happens,
the voice inside me whispers,

127
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,705
"Don't do it.

128
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,584
You might like him now,
but you're gonna break up someday."

129
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,591
My parents

130
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,011
were each other's first love.

131
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,682
They went to the same high school

132
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,143
and they were madly in love.

133
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,772
They got married right after college.

134
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:13,195
When I was a kid, I was proud
my parents were in a happy marriage.

135
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,323
<i>But...</i>

136
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,703
<i>I was devastated.</i>

137
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,873
<i>It made me realize</i>

138
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,169
<i>people's feelings can change easily.</i>

139
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,346
See ya.

140
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,348
<i>And the more I loved them,</i>

141
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,351
<i>the more I hated them.</i>

142
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,356
I think I understand.

143
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,363
No matter how much you love them,

144
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,785
breaking up always feels so empty
and disappointing.

145
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,793
<i>Who are you thinking about, Takuzo?</i>

146
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,797
I wonder if they've eaten.

147
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,261
Oh, I'm sorry.

148
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,187
Takuzo.

149
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,650
This doesn't mean anything.

150
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,985
I just felt like it.

151
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,718
Is it against the rules to cuddle?

152
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,639
What?

153
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,164
I'm... sorry.

154
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,292
I can't do this.

155
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,380
Sorry.

156
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,346
Oh, come on.

157
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,141
Don't be so serious.

158
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,486
<i>And so, it's the last day</i>
<i>of the friendship marriage trial.</i>

159
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,570
ONE DAY LEFT

160
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,113
<i>I'm sorry about yesterday.</i>

161
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,324
Don't be.

162
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,243
We all have moments like that.

163
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,412
I don't do that to everyone.

164
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,872
Don't worry about it.

165
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,374
You just had the urge, right?

166
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,254
No.

167
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,972
I thought about it last night.

168
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,609
I think I might be falling for--

169
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,407
Is it a delivery?

170
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,040
I-It's them.

171
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:53,999
Them?

172
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,043
Mia and Shinpei.

173
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,797
Please ask them to leave.

174
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,798
What?

175
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,510
Ms. Tenma?

176
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,471
I'm kidding.

177
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,516
Let them in. I'll go make some tea.

178
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,732
This is for you.

179
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,317
It's <i>castella</i> cake.

180
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,528
Thank you.

181
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,823
I'm not sure if it'll suit
young people's tastes though.

182
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,241
Are you serious?

183
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,492
What?

184
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,079
Judging people based on age like that
is called age harassment.

185
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,415
You're such a dinosaur.

186
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,210
Says the guy who wears toe socks!

187
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,379
- Don't say that here.
- Huh?

188
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,631
Oh, I get it.

189
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,133
Hey, don't!

190
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,011
I knew it. You're wearing your nice socks.

191
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,638
Don't try to act cool
in front of a young girl.

192
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,973
Hey, Mia.

193
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,560
Sorry. Excuse me.

194
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,945
We came to take Takuzo home.

195
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,823
Right?

196
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,159
I-I don't really--

197
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,703
Don't lie. You were crying last night.

198
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,623
What? You cried?

199
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,293
Well, it's not... I...

200
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,589
- "What if he likes her bett--"
- Hey!

201
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,841
- Stop it!
- "What should we do?"

202
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,677
- "What should--"
- Okay, I get it.

203
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:30,888
But, I can't.

204
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,767
I still have one more day left
of the trial.

205
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,605
What do you want to do, Takuzo?

206
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,566
I...

207
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,885
I quit.

208
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,845
Quit what?

209
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,598
The friendship marriage.

210
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,728
On second thought, it's troublesome
to live with someone else.

211
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,231
I realized it through this trial.

212
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,443
I guess it's not for me.

213
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,327
I'm glad we sorted this out peacefully.

214
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,745
Yes.

215
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,040
You two prefer coffee, right?

216
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,877
<i>And so, the friendship marriage trial</i>
<i>came to an end.</i>

217
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,257
I told you that won't work.

218
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,174
Geez.

219
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,634
I wouldn't touch that.

220
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:56,640
Huh? What is this?
The black stuff is on my hand! Ew!

221
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,856
Sorry we're taking so long.

222
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,693
Shinpei messed with the lock
and now we can't get it open.

223
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,695
We decided to break the lock itself.

224
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,238
Yeah?

225
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,707
Hey.

226
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,798
I won't forgive you
if you mess around with Takuzo.

227
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,265
He's my precious friend.

228
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:40,893
Understood.

229
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,647
The past week

230
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,941
didn't feel right.

231
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,235
I felt uneasy.

232
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:56,116
Could it be that you missed us?

233
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,118
Maybe.

234
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,954
Really?

235
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,540
Takuzo!

236
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,042
Takuzo!

237
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,129
Maybe

238
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,258
we should make one too.

239
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,306
You know, something similar
to a marriage certificate.

240
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,481
I...

241
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,026
I don't want to waver anymore.

242
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,741
I don't want to be indecisive and confused

243
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,994
and end up hurting others.

244
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,177
That thing you mentioned before.
An agreed contract?

245
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:02,015
Where you notarize your
marriage agreements and all other details.

246
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,185
I looked into it too.

247
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,398
I think that'll work for the three of us.

248
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,152
It's legally valid as well,
so I think it's perfect.

249
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,446
Yeah.

250
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,532
I totally agree.

251
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,742
- Right?
- Yeah.

252
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,744
I think we can make it work.

253
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,588
Sorry, I have to take this.

254
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,512
INCOMING CALL
BIG BRO

255
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,398
Come in five seconds later.

256
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,483
- Come with me.
- What?

257
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:58,238
Or if the child we're going to have
will understand this type of marriage.

258
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,365
<i>You're dense as always, huh?</i>

259
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,576
<i>I may be inexperienced, but...</i>

260
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,828
