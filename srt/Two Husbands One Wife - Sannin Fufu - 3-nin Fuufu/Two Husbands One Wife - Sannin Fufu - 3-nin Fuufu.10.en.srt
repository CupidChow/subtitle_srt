1
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,464
<i>A lawyer?</i>

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:10,760
Yeah.
He helped Yuki with their agreed contract.

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,680
She's going to
introduce him to me after work.

4
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,765
Has he dealt with three-person marriages?

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,642
I doubt it.

6
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,978
I'll get as much advice as possible.

7
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,522
More importantly,
are you going to be okay?

8
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,732
About?

9
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,108
You won't waver anymore?

10
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:30,405
Making an agreed contract means
we're making a legal commitment.

11
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:33,324
It's the same as
submitting a marriage registration.

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,784
I know that.

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,453
Are you sure?

14
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,622
She's still jealous about Ms. Tenma.

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,540
What?

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,792
It's not jealousy.

17
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,587
I just don't want
my husband to waver so much.

18
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,796
Husband, huh?

19
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:52,093
Make sure to tell your mom.
We have to make an official visit.

20
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,011
Got it.

21
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,056
Tell your brother too, Shinpei.

22
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,974
Oh, yeah.

23
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,895
I guess you have to
try and see your brother first.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,688
About that.

25
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:08,234
He called me the other day
saying he wanted to meet up.

26
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:09,903
- Really?
- What?

27
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:13,156
Talk about great timing.
It must be God's blessing.

28
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,491
I'm not sure.

29
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,868
Maybe he just wants me to quit dancing.

30
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,746
If he really says that, I'll convince him.

31
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,998
I'll tell him he's wrong.

32
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,377
Yeah, right. You can't say anything
if you meet him in person.

33
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,379
I'm not all bark and no bite.

34
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,465
Yeah? But you are.

35
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,636
That's not true. I'm the kind of guy
who speaks up when I need to.

36
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,349
Says the guy who couldn't even refuse
his colleague's friendship marriage trial.

37
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,060
So you really were jealous.

38
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,396
I wasn't jealous. I was just annoyed.

39
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,816
Don't you two have to go?

40
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,733
What?

41
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,360
- Oh, crap.
- Oh, no.

42
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,612
- Sorry about the dishes!
- No worries.

43
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,405
I'm off.

44
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,324
- I'm off.
- Bye. See you.

45
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,166
Two Husbands One Wife.

46
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,672
FENNEC FOX LAW FIRM

47
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,298
<i>Yes, this is a unique case.</i>

48
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,303
But the items that need to be included
are the same as for same-sex marriage.

49
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:23,351
The legal promises
that automatically come into effect

50
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:27,272
with marriage registration
are covered by the agreed contract for us.

51
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,314
Right?

52
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,566
That's right.

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,861
Could you give me an example?

54
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:37,699
Typical examples include the obligations
that spouses are expected to fulfill,

55
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,951
inheritance rights,

56
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:45,290
and the right to give consent
for medical procedures or treatment

57
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,792
when one becomes
unconsciousness due to illness.

58
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,128
I see.

59
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,924
By the way,
are you planning to have children?

60
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,887
I think we are.

61
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,056
That's the tricky part.

62
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,726
Meaning?

63
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,353
Whether the child is biological
or adopted,

64
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,107
it is not legally possible for
three people to become a child's parents.

65
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:16,487
In principle, only the two legal parents
can have parental rights.

66
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,995
Would it be better
to become a single mother

67
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,790
and receive support from both men,

68
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,671
or... to legally marry one of them

69
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,052
so that he can be recognized
as the child's father?

70
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,137
But that would be...

71
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:43,932
However,

72
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,602
considering the child's well-being,

73
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:52,899
I believe it would be better for you
to marry either Takuzo or Shinpei

74
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,488
and have him become the legal father.

75
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,950
That is my personal advice.

76
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,118
What do you think?

77
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,665
Welcome.

78
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,593
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

79
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,391
I think I took this lightly.

80
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,726
I warned you before, didn't I?

81
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,772
But back then, I didn't know
if we'd do the three-person marriage.

82
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,067
If you want kids, you have to
think carefully and thoroughly.

83
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,861
Or else, you'll end up like us.

84
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,779
Huh?

85
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,784
Are you guys in disagreement
about becoming foster parents?

86
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,412
It's not a disagreement...

87
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,832
We decided to get a divorce.

88
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,166
What?

89
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,462
Can you believe it? A starter marriage.

90
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,381
Wait, what? Why?

91
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,926
We couldn't agree on the child issue.

92
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,389
In the end, she started saying
she wanted to give birth to her own child.

93
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,767
I mean, that's not what we agreed on.

94
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:15,356
So you should at least
sort out your thoughts about it.

95
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:21,946
Takuzo is older, so you'd probably
have his child first, right?

96
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,489
What?

97
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,827
If you don't know who the father is,
you'll take a DNA test, right?

98
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,454
What? I...

99
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,957
Think about what's best for the child.

100
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,920
I want to joke around
and tell you to fret over it,

101
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,714
but this is a serious matter.

102
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,842
Because it involves a child.

103
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,642
You want another cake?

104
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,686
No, thanks.

105
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,439
Oh, have you been fishing?

106
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,191
No.

107
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,943
I went the other day.
It was a fishing pond though.

108
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,361
Yeah?

109
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,950
It was fun, but fishing at sea is better.

110
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,203
I bet.

111
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,627
<i>I guess even Shinpei</i>
<i>can feel uncomfortable.</i>

112
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,170
<i>That's a new discovery.</i>

113
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,633
The dancer gig.

114
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,426
<i>Here it is.</i>

115
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,928
You still do it, right?

116
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,017
Yeah. I've got quite a lot of fans too.

117
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,729
We have a show in spring.
Wanna come? You might become my fan.

118
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,483
That would be difficult.

119
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,281
I'm starting a new career.

120
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,201
I'm moving next month.

121
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,120
What? Where to?

122
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,496
Korea.

123
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:54,956
Korea?

124
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,379
I'm not sure if that's near or far.

125
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,634
It's a bigger company
with much better working conditions.

126
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,346
I see. I expect nothing less from you.

127
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,182
Come with me.

128
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:15,810
What?

129
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,313
Learning to dance in Korea
doesn't sound bad, right?

130
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,318
But why? You were against it.

131
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,487
I was never against it.

132
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,451
I wasn't supportive

133
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,747
because I didn't have
enough stability to back up your dream.

134
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:44,839
Or the confidence to say,
"If things don't work out,

135
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,301
you can count on me."

136
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,637
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,561
But... I have enough to support you now.

138
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,064
Let's do this together.

139
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,236
Just like old times.

140
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,412
Aw, come on.

141
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,707
Stop acting cool.

142
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,379
There's no rush.

143
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,798
But think about it.

144
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:30,968
Okay.

145
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,347
Thanks.

146
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,188
Excuse me.

147
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,105
Yes.

148
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,067
Can we have another shortcake?

149
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,235
Yes, sir.

150
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,282
Hey, welcome home.

151
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,784
Yeah, hi.

152
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,036
So, how did it go? The agreed contract.

153
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,830
H-He said he'll put it together for us.

154
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,916
Oh, really? Thanks.

155
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,460
Yeah, I think I'll go take a bath too.

156
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,378
Go ahead.

157
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,215
- I'm home.
- Hi.

158
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,471
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

159
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,640
How did it go?

160
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,562
Oh, he wanted to let me know he's starting
a new job over a cup of coffee.

161
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,232
See. I told you
he wouldn't bug you about your job.

162
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,358
Yeah, you're right.

163
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,236
I'll go take a bath.

164
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,779
Mia's in there now.

165
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,865
Oh. Then, I'll go finish my choreography.

166
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,626
Aren't they acting distant?

167
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,299
I must be overthinking.

168
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,843
<i>Maybe not.</i>

169
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:23,331
<i>He noticed he wasn't overthinking it</i>
<i>a few days later.</i>

170
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,876
MOM

171
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,380
<i>I want to talk to you about something.</i>
<i>When are you free?</i>

172
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,924
<i>Left on read.</i>

173
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,803
You're finally
submitting the agreed contract?

174
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,348
Yeah.

175
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,725
We are. But...

176
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,394
Something wrong?

177
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,774
For the past few days,

178
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,320
it feels like they're avoiding the topic.

179
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,656
Really? Both of them?

180
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:57,990
Yeah.

181
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,285
They don't seem angry or anything.

182
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,416
Oh, I get it.

183
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,882
You're dense as always, huh?

184
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,218
Huh? Dense about what?

185
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,427
You know something?

186
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,845
Yes, everything.

187
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:24,100
If you don't do something about it,
it could ruin your marriage.

188
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,936
Wh-What? Tell me. Please.

189
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:38,280
So, that's why.

190
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,076
<i>I don't know what it is,</i>

191
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,245
<i>but another few days later.</i>

192
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,038
What's wrong?

193
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,251
Mia. Thank goodness.

194
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,093
He said he wouldn't let me in
until you get here.

195
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,469
Why?

196
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,929
I don't know.

197
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,599
Takuzo, Mia's here.

198
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,270
Really?

199
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,604
See.

200
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,106
What are you doing?

201
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,317
I'll unlock the door,
then come in five seconds later.

202
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,404
Fine, just open the door.
My nose will start leaking.

203
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:23,451
Five, four, three, two...

204
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,506
What's all this?

205
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,443
Takuzo.

206
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,455
Gently.

207
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,346
Um...

208
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,014
I...

209
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,518
It will make me happy

210
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,480
if we could stay together

211
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,483
from now on.

212
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,073
I may be inexperienced, but...

213
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,536
Please marry me!

214
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,050
Um...

215
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,468
Here.

216
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,971
I have rings.

217
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,900
Takuzo.

218
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:22,987
Yes.

219
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,283
What's this all of a sudden?

220
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:28,951
Huh?

221
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,037
We've already
talked about getting married.

222
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,417
Huh? But...

223
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,255
But I haven't proposed properly.

224
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,050
I thought that's why you two were upset.

225
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,428
We're not upset.

226
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:48,846
Right?

227
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,764
Y-Yeah.

228
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,682
Really?

229
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,809
But,

230
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,270
this is so sweet.

231
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,564
Thank you, Takuzo.

232
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,817
Thank you.

233
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,695
Sure.

234
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,742
But...

235
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,120
I'm sorry.

236
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,584
I can't feel happy about it.

237
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:21,629
What?

238
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,339
Why?

239
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,178
About our child.

240
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,390
A child?

241
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,478
Are you pregnant?

242
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:39,813
What?

243
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,232
No, that can't be.

244
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,902
- Are you?
- I'm not.

245
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:52,034
I've been thinking about
what we're supposed to do

246
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,786
if I get pregnant.

247
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,706
Like, if I do have a baby with one of you,

248
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:03,879
should I take
a DNA test to check who the father is?

249
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,342
If we did find out who the father is,

250
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:14,139
one of you
might end up feeling jealous or hurt.

251
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,771
Or if the child we're going to have

252
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,275
will understand this type of marriage.

253
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,158
I've been thinking...

254
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,456
what the best option is...

255
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,091
But I can't figure out the answer.

256
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,985
I think it's best for the child...

257
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,906
if their biological father

258
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,411
becomes the legal father.

259
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,747
In that case...

260
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,378
I'll have to get married to one of you.

261
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,010
Is there...

262
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,016
an option to not have a biological child?

263
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,694
I want to have one.

264
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,994
I'm sorry.

265
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,626
That's nothing to be sorry about.

266
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,505
Yeah.

267
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,590
He's right.

268
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,806
I'm the one... who should apologize.

269
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,850
For being so carefree.

270
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,982
There is a way.

271
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,277
How?

272
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,165
It'll work out if you two get married.

273
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,755
What?

274
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,133
What are you saying?

275
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,888
Sh-Shinpei?

276
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,185
I'm out.

277
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,405
I'll leave.

278
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,117
So, Mia

279
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,120
and Takuzo,

280
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,122
you two can become a married couple.

281
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,333
That will solve all problems.

282
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,674
What do you think?

283
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,176
<i>Our two-person marriage.</i>

284
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,927
Shinpei sacrificed himself.

285
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,512
<i>Maybe this is what he really wants.</i>

286
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,472
<i>You gotta go with a bang.</i>

287
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,933
Before I answer,
I want to show you something.

288
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,768
I need to be happy.

289
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,855
