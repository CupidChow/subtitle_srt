1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,218
I'm home.

2
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,345
- Hi.
- I was just about to fry them.

3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,472
Yay! We're having <i>gyoza</i>!

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,850
I took out the laundry from the dryer.

5
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,019
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,311
Let's fold them later.

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,523
<i>After the major fight</i>
<i>they had about the chores,</i>

8
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,735
<i>they decided to help each other out</i>

9
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,362
<i>if the person assigned is busy that day.</i>

10
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,077
- Ready?
- Yup.

11
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,038
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,421
- This hits the spot.
- It sure does.

13
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,797
- Drink up.
- It's great.

14
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,304
So good.

15
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,183
Can I have some?

16
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,601
Sure, got it.

17
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,519
- Done.
- Thanks.

18
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,772
Same dipping sauce.

19
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,109
Oh, vinegar and pepper?

20
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,027
Yeah.

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,696
Yeah, Takuzo's taste rubbed off on me.

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,198
You say it like that's bad.

23
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,241
You wanna try?

24
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,911
I don't really like vinegar.

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,872
I see. That's a shame.

26
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,001
What do you put on fried eggs?

27
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,169
Salt and pepper.

28
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,295
Fried mackerel?

29
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,546
- Soy sauce.
- Soy sauce.

30
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,547
Fried chicken?

31
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,341
I use fish sauce these days.

32
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,802
- What? By itself? Just fish sauce?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,595
It must smell so bad.

34
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,014
It's surprisingly good. You should try it.

35
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,724
No, I don't think so.

36
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,018
You said the same
about vinegar and pepper.

37
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,394
Did I?

38
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,232
Oh, Shinpei.

39
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,193
I was able to get a day off next Saturday.

40
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,654
Huh? You guys have plans?

41
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:56,032
I'm doing a surprise performance
on the street.

42
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,410
And you took a day off for that?

43
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,288
Yeah. I want to
see him perform as much as possible.

44
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,249
He's my fave, you see.

45
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,295
Right. You're lucky
your fave is your boyfriend.

46
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,881
You should come too!

47
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,093
Well, I'll think about it.

48
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:21,057
<i>These three might get married, or not.</i>

49
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:26,437
<i>This is a story about them</i>
<i>giving a three-person marriage a try.</i>

50
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,322
<i>Oh? I thought everything was going well.</i>
<i>Was I wrong?</i>

51
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,290
Two Husbands One Wife.

52
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,884
This looks like a good card!

53
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,428
But the combination is a bit...

54
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,807
It's sort of like, "It's great
you three got together, but now what?"

55
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,267
Really?

56
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,478
I mean, you're trying to
do a three-person marriage.

57
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,023
<i>We saw her in episode one.</i>

58
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,401
<i>She's Yuki, who married another woman.</i>

59
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,655
If there are three of you,
there's bound to be jealousy, right?

60
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,077
I'm not sure. They both seem fine,
as far as I can tell.

61
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,288
Which kind of makes me angry.

62
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,917
I wonder if it's that easy
to process your feelings.

63
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,169
You don't get jealous?

64
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,420
Why would I?

65
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,590
There must be times
you feel jealous of them.

66
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,967
Why? They're both men.

67
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,304
What? I can't believe you said that.

68
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,684
I guess this is something
you should figure out yourself.

69
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,105
What is it? Just tell me.

70
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,150
Good luck fretting over it.

71
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,029
What was she... Geez.

72
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,964
WATCH YOUR STEP

73
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,800
I like Shinpei.

74
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,388
Shinpei likes me too.

75
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,515
<i>I think.</i>

76
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,393
Takuzo...

77
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,478
Well,

78
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:34,148
<i>we have a better relationship</i>
<i>than we did before.</i>

79
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,777
The problem is these two.

80
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,406
What can I do

81
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,700
<i>to help them get along better?</i>

82
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,340
You want coffee?

83
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,759
- Yes.
- Okay.

84
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,262
- Mia.
- Yeah?

85
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,639
I can't do this. Help.

86
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,058
Goodness sake.

87
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,643
Okay.

88
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,770
Come on.

89
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,896
There.

90
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,856
Ready?

91
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,858
<i>Boiling.</i>

92
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,570
<i>Boiling up.</i>

93
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,822
<i>- Boiling up.</i>
- I'm scared.

94
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,907
- Scared of what?
<i>- Boiling up.</i>

95
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,661
- Don't close your eyes.
<i>- Boiling up a lot.</i>

96
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,873
Come on, open your eye.

97
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,624
I don't need coffee.

98
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,752
- What?
- I have to go.

99
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,336
Oh, really?

100
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,172
- Yeah. I'm off.
- Okay.

101
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,925
Oh, I don't need dinner either. Sorry.

102
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,264
Hey.

103
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,893
Do you think he might be angry?

104
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,269
What?

105
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,271
Last night...

106
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,650
Welcome home.

107
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:00,985
Hi.

108
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,801
Welcome home. I mean, I'm home.

109
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,104
Did I do something wrong?

110
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,446
Takuzo.

111
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,116
It's your day off.

112
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,284
I'm going to the store.

113
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,078
I see.

114
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,330
Hey.

115
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,875
Is it possible you're avoiding Shinpei?

116
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,963
What? I'm not.

117
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:07,343
You were getting along after the fight,
so why give him the cold shoulder now?

118
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,557
People often think Shinpei is frivolous,

119
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,435
but he's actually
very sensitive and sincere.

120
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,061
So come with me on Saturday.

121
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,146
- Oh.
- What?

122
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,525
A 500 yen coin.

123
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,235
Really? Five hundred yen?

124
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,654
Where? Where is it?

125
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,908
Hey!

126
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,078
<i>She's Ms. Tenma.</i>

127
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,874
<i>She's Takuzo's colleague</i>
<i>and his hobby buddy.</i>

128
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,835
Why are you making that face?

129
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,336
I'm trying to

130
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,882
get rid of the pork bun dough
stuck inside my mouth.

131
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,633
Do that in the washroom.

132
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,180
I got it off! I did, right?

133
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,223
That's gross!

134
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,642
You know,

135
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,854
you won't be able to
get married acting like that.

136
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,230
- Excuse me?
- Huh?

137
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,068
Right back at you.

138
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:10,698
Do you think <i>you</i> can get married?

139
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,168
Well, it's true that people like us
aren't suited for marriage.

140
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,171
Oh, Takuzo.

141
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,632
Have you heard of "friendship marriage"?

142
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,467
Friendship marriage?

143
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,219
What's that like?

144
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:35,765
Marriage between friends. When two friends
with no romantic feelings get married.

145
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,227
They get along well, so there's no stress
being around each other.

146
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,355
No need to waste your energy
on romance either.

147
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,690
Really? What's the point of that?

148
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,026
You marry someone you don't love?

149
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,028
Friendship is love, too.

150
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,699
But no romance allowed. If you want to
be tossed around by love, do it outside.

151
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,704
Then, why go through
the trouble of marrying?

152
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,790
Why not just live together?

153
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,211
This way,
those who aren't made for marriage

154
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:09,257
can live freely on their own,
whilst dodging the judgmental public eye

155
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,592
asking, "Shouldn't you be married by now?"

156
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,137
It'll also resolve their financial
and health issues after retirement.

157
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,348
How practical.

158
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,562
You wanna give it a shot with me?

159
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,189
What?

160
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,195
It's a joke.

161
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,490
A joke?

162
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,828
Kids these days are scary.

163
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,331
Huh? One of the <i>shachihoko</i>
for the castle tower is missing.

164
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,292
What? Did it fall?

165
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,380
You've dropped so many pieces.

166
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,466
Hey, don't throw them.

167
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,929
Can I ask you something?

168
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,472
What is it?

169
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,935
Aren't you getting back with your ex?

170
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,645
You mean, Yura?

171
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,858
No, not that two-timing woman.

172
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,568
The one before that.

173
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,194
Mia?

174
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,989
You saw her the other day, right?

175
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,617
Right. Mia, huh?

176
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,244
I don't know.

177
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,790
She seems to be
smitten with her current boyfriend.

178
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,086
What's he like?

179
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,673
A good-looking dancer.

180
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,926
Does he earn a lot?

181
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,555
I hate to say this,
but it doesn't seem like it.

182
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,267
I heard he's going to do
a street performance soon.

183
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,897
Good-looking guys get fawned over,
so I guess they can get by like that.

184
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,734
He just seems unreliable, you know?

185
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,987
Like he doesn't know life's hardships.

186
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,906
Oh, found it.

187
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,035
Thank you.

188
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,329
Are these all the parts?

189
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,799
That means you're way better than him.

190
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,594
You have a stable job
and skills to go with it.

191
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,889
Maybe you can win her back.

192
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,685
Huh? What's wrong?

193
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,230
Can you... say that again?

194
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,439
Say what?

195
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,817
Wh-What you just said.

196
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,237
The "you're way better" part.

197
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:42,451
You're way better than him?

198
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,380
There's no need
to think less of myself, right?

199
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,466
Thanks, you gave me confidence.

200
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,346
Good for you.

201
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,603
<i>Thanks to Ms. Tenma,</i>
<i>Takuzo got his confidence back.</i>

202
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,647
Why did you decide to come with me?

203
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,483
My plans got canceled.

204
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,696
Hurry, we won't make it.

205
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,408
- Hey, Mia?
- Yeah?

206
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:28,164
You used to hate places
where young people hang out, didn't you?

207
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:33,711
I guess it's Shinpei's influence.
He got me interested in dance too.

208
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,383
You never
showed interest in building blocks.

209
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:40,843
Huh?

210
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,553
Oh, it's nothing.

211
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,596
What?

212
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:53,272
So many people are here already. He only
announced it on social media just now.

213
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,817
So, all these people here to see Shinpei?

214
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:00,613
Yeah, Shinpei rarely takes part
in surprise shows like this.

215
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,990
The other dancers are pretty popular too.

216
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:04,992
I see.

217
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:06,911
There he is!

218
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,517
Thank you so much!

219
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,277
Sorry, I'll head back first.
I have something to do.

220
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,212
Why are you...

221
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,882
Mia told me.

222
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:47,052
You always come here to drink
when something's bothering you.

223
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,683
Thanks.

224
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:55,895
Hey.

225
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,982
You're the one Mia likes.

226
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,944
I think you should marry her without me.

227
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,367
Do you hate me that much?

228
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,452
It's not that.

229
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,080
I'm saying I feel like the third wheel.

230
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,792
But you two were chummy
during dinner the other day.

231
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:20,711
What?

232
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,089
Fish sauce on fried chicken.

233
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,051
Mia was into it after that.

234
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,636
She was?

235
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,348
She'd never tell me that.

236
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,019
I feel like Mia...

237
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,068
is still a little distant with me.

238
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,739
But she's so open with you.

239
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,910
When I thought
you two make a great couple,

240
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,454
I felt jealous.

241
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,874
If you're saying that...

242
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,753
When we were watching you dance,

243
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,880
her expression

244
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,634
screamed that she's so in love with you.

245
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,138
You're so cool, you see.

246
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,397
So...

247
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,818
I'm sorry,

248
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,028
but

249
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,283
it's hard for me to be around you.

250
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,995
To be honest...

251
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,125
Being with you from now on
and having to be compared

252
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,211
is too painful.

253
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,591
What about you?

254
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:56,056
What did you feel watching me dance?

255
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,477
Forget about Mia and all the other people.

256
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,065
I want to know how you felt.

257
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,154
Frankly, I was surprised.

258
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,577
I was overwhelmed,
and I couldn't take my eyes off of you.

259
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,705
I didn't want it to end.

260
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,083
You were incredible.

261
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,508
Huh? What?

262
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,260
You know,

263
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,597
could it possibly be that

264
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,767
you really like me?

265
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,394
What?

266
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,981
Your eyes look the same as they do
when you eat something delicious.

267
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,317
Don't be stupid.

268
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,278
I see it now. Thank goodness.

269
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,655
I thought you hated me.

270
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,450
No, I don't hate you or anything.

271
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,493
Don't worry.

272
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:01,705
When the three of us get married,
I'm all yours. Okay?

273
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,876
You can brag about me to everyone

274
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,419
as your cool husband.

275
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:08,837
Huh?

276
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,632
My... husband?

277
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,384
Here.

278
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,681
Here's to husband and husband.

279
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,602
Cheers! Yay!

280
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,603
Once more.

281
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,356
Cheers to husband and husband!

282
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,024
- Cheers.
- Yay!

283
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,196
Come on, Takuzo.

284
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,323
I'll pass.

285
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,408
Husband and husband!

286
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:44,248
I hope the husbands
are having a heart-to-heart talk.

287
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,251
Right, Pakkun?

288
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,046
<i>Don't worry, they're getting along well.</i>

289
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,969
<i>Not in the way you're imagining though.</i>

290
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,679
One more.

291
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,473
- Nice.
- Oh, no!

292
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,724
Whoa!

293
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,978
Be careful. You're wasted.

294
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,437
Thanks.

295
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,772
Sure.

296
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,495
Please

297
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,209
don't hate me, okay?

298
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,355
NEXT EPISODE

299
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,565
<i>It's great, isn't it?</i>

300
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,151
<i>Now they're</i>
<i>even going out on dates together.</i>

301
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,235
So warm.

302
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,695
What?

303
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,239
He can't forgive me
for being a loser like our dad.

304
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:03,202
It hurts me to see you cry.

305
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,745
