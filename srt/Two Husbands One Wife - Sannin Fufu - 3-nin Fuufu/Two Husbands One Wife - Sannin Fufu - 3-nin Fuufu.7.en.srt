1
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,465
I'm home.

2
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,259
<i>Oh, no. What are you going to do?</i>

3
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,309
Takuzo!

4
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,895
I can't.

5
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,148
Don't leave your socks lying around!

6
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,781
Um...

7
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,616
Welcome home.

8
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,413
- Mia!
- Wait!

9
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,623
Mia!

10
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,835
Hang on!

11
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,463
<i>Hey, Shinpei!</i>

12
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,632
<i>- Mia!</i>
<i>- That's my shirt!</i>

13
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:36,429
<i>A story of these three</i>
<i>and their marriage is about to begin.</i>

14
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,516
Two Husbands One Wife.

15
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,187
8 MINUTE WALK FROM NISHI-FUNABASHI STATION

16
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,815
Done.

17
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,984
<i>Even after all that,</i>
<i>Mia still goes to work diligently.</i>

18
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,947
It's freezing.

19
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,449
<i>She spends an hour and a half</i>
<i>every morning</i>

20
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,952
<i>riding a packed train</i>
<i>from her parents' house.</i>

21
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,538
Mia.

22
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,706
There's a really cute guy outside.

23
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,668
With a baseball cap and smooth steps.

24
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,806
Shinpei! You're so cool!

25
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,057
Can we take a photo?

26
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,727
Smile. We'll go to your show again.

27
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,521
Yeah. Thanks.

28
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,481
He's so cute. Oh my gosh.

29
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,782
ANAGUMA REAL ESTATE

30
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,540
Excuse me. You can't line up yet.

31
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,126
I'm not here for that.

32
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,491
<i>Welcome home.</i>

33
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,744
<i>This is Mia's mom, Megumi.</i>

34
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,288
Am I a selfish person?

35
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,624
What? Is something bothering you?

36
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,168
Well, I can't tell you what happened.

37
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,254
I might have

38
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,966
a tendency to see relationships
from a self-centered perspective.

39
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,885
You're right about that.

40
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,553
What?

41
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,807
For example, that thing there?

42
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,310
You don't remember, do you?

43
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,938
That was a red teddy bear,
when you got it.

44
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,482
What? No way.

45
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,944
I've been cherishing it
since I got it from Yuri on my birthday.

46
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,949
You didn't like the color,
so you went to the store to exchange it.

47
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,702
I remember Yuri cried her eyes out.

48
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,662
But you said,

49
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,873
"She and I
have completely different taste.

50
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,458
What could I do?"

51
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,459
Really?

52
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:15,755
Oh, and Ken.
Your boyfriend back in ninth grade.

53
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:21,469
He always walked you home
after cram school. Such a sweet boy.

54
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,721
Didn't I get dumped?

55
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,223
Well, of course.

56
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:30,061
You said, "Ken and I are as one.
What's his is mine."

57
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:33,898
And you rode his bike home
from cram school without him.

58
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:38,236
Poor Ken had to walk
10 kilometers to get home.

59
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,114
I sound like a horrible person.

60
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:45,034
Well, you've gotten a lot better
now that you're a grown up.

61
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:50,832
But you have a natural princess-like,
or maybe a queen-like temperament.

62
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,251
No. You're like Gian from <i>Doraemon</i>?

63
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,754
See? That too.

64
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,714
Huh?

65
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,431
Seaweed goes with perilla dressing, no?

66
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,308
I prefer sesame dressing.

67
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,395
I always went along with what you like.

68
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,480
Why didn't you just tell me?

69
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:20,153
Not everyone in this world
can say what they want like you, okay?

70
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,406
Now, I don't know
what brought you back home.

71
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,034
But maybe you should keep in mind

72
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:30,496
what kind of person you are.

73
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,169
Where are you going?

74
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,129
None of your business!

75
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,145
No, that's not the point.

76
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,649
Under the circumstances, it's okay
that they got involved behind my back.

77
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,651
It's not okay, actually.

78
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:07,408
I totally misunderstood
and thought both guys were into me!

79
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,871
For some reason, I thought my presence
would be why they'd get along too.

80
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,666
Like, I thought
the world was revolving around me.

81
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,004
Wow, I'm unbelievably selfish, aren't I?

82
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,304
Y-You guys!

83
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,474
G-Get back to work!

84
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,310
<i>Two Husbands One Wife.</i>

85
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:41,526
<i>They made</i> gyoza <i>seven days in a row</i>
<i>so that they can welcome Mia home anytime.</i>

86
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,738
I wonder

87
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,116
if Mia is eating properly.

88
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,744
I'm sure she is.

89
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:57,416
Even when her favorite idol got married,
she was gobbling up <i>katsudon</i> in tears.

90
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,712
Oh, did you know
she uses vinegar on <i>natto</i> as well?

91
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,089
What? That's gross.

92
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,007
And curry too.

93
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,342
That's disgusting.

94
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,304
She said eating something sour
gives her energy.

95
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,936
She's energetic even if she doesn't eat.

96
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,481
You sound a little cold.

97
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,904
It's not like Mia will come home
just because I eat <i>gyoza</i>.

98
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,657
She'll be happier
if we leave more for her.

99
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,869
She wouldn't say something so mean.

100
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,292
You'd make <i>gyoza</i> for her everyday,
but you won't let me eat what I want?

101
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,752
Actually, you've never made curry for me.

102
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,548
That's what's been bugging you?

103
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,427
What? Not really.

104
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,764
I'll make Japanese curry tomorrow.

105
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,395
Hey.

106
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,981
Can I try?

107
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,192
Give me a bite.

108
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:08,738
Come on.

109
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,792
Yum!

110
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,089
Hey,

111
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,469
I really like you, too. Okay?

112
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,607
Say...

113
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,363
If...

114
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,992
Worst case,

115
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,288
if Mia doesn't come home...

116
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,961
Do you think

117
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,048
you and I will have a chance?

118
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:22,770
Well,

119
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,856
I can't explain it properly,

120
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,570
but I like the way you care about Mia.

121
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,198
What do you mean?

122
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,581
Like, how you go
pick her up in your car late at night.

123
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,168
Or doing this
weird three-person marriage for her.

124
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,424
You're narrow-minded,
but very kind when we least expect it.

125
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,552
That's why I fell for you.

126
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,432
It's the same with Mia.

127
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,393
She complains a lot,

128
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,396
but she's always looking out for you.

129
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,192
I think...

130
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,158
You two have this... bond.

131
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,910
And...

132
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,747
I'm envious.

133
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,918
I want to be a part of it.

134
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,547
So I choose the three of us.

135
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,851
<i>You can do this, Takuzo. Keep it up.</i>

136
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,605
This is the end of the line
for <i>Dragon Chronicle Four</i>.

137
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,322
A scalper?

138
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,453
Excuse me, the line for the game is--

139
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,372
Hey. Geez!

140
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,124
It's because of people like you

141
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,252
that others can't buy their favorite--

142
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,128
Why?

143
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,589
What's mine is mine!

144
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,800
Hey, stop! It's me!

145
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,805
Takuzo?

146
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,598
What are you doing here?

147
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:31,816
I think...

148
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,194
I don't mind

149
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,363
having

150
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,282
a threesome.

151
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,334
I'm sorry...

152
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,296
I took...

153
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,843
your boyfriend.

154
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,595
What you said...

155
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,059
It's not for me.

156
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,564
It's for Shinpei, isn't it?

157
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:13,941
I mean,

158
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,527
when we were going out,

159
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:21,824
you'd never even consider
doing such crazy thing like a threesome.

160
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,034
Right?

161
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,710
It's not for Shinpei.

162
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,757
Then, is it for yourself?

163
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,182
It's because you don't want to
lose Shinpei, right?

164
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,028
That's right.

165
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,199
It's for me.

166
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,247
I've always been selfish.

167
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:20,382
I selfishly forced my feelings on you...

168
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,594
and felt satisfied.

169
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,056
And yet,

170
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,434
when I had to face it,

171
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,188
I acted all mature and ran.

172
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,234
I might even regret...

173
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,990
the three of us living together.

174
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,911
Even so,

175
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,417
I want the three of us to live together.

176
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,224
We have <i>gyoza</i> waiting for you.

177
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,025
This is the end of the line.

178
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,902
Oh, I'm not here for that.

179
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,828
A triangle.

180
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,375
If we look at it from a different angle...

181
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,093
Which side is the top, or the bottom?

182
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,732
<i>Two Husbands One Wife.</i>

183
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,122
I'm home.

184
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,169
Welcome home.

185
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,503
Welcome home!

186
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,057
I'm so full.

187
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,601
You ate both curry and <i>gyoza</i>. So greedy.

188
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,395
You might be right.

189
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:44,109
Three of us living together
is greedy and a luxury.

190
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:48,989
Yeah.

191
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,741
- Right?
- I guess so.

192
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,411
- Okay.
- Okay, go ahead.

193
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,579
I'm ready.

194
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,624
Then...

195
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,710
This.

196
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,716
While we're at it,
can we discuss another topic?

197
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,969
- What is it?
- Sure.

198
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,474
Shinpei.

199
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,142
Takuzo.

200
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,857
Should we have sex together?

201
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,488
What are your thoughts on

202
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,449
having a threesome?

203
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,952
Does that mean, you can't?

204
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,537
Sorry.

205
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,081
To be honest, I don't know.

206
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,506
Whether we do it or not,

207
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,009
it's okay.

208
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,178
I just want

209
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,684
the three of us
to face this issue together.

210
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:05,816
Yeah.

211
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,901
You're right.

212
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,490
Then, let's answer on three.

213
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,909
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

214
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,245
Okay.

215
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,455
Ready?

216
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,918
Do you want to have a threesome?

217
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,628
One, two.

218
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,671
- Yes.
- Yes.

219
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,589
I want to!

220
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,424
<i>The timing was off.</i>

221
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,925
<i>It didn't work.</i>

222
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,802
<i>What? Hang on.</i>

223
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,387
<i>There're two jokers.</i>

224
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,306
<i>Really? How come?</i>

225
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:42,895
<i>As their next step,</i>
<i>they decided to try going to a love hotel.</i>

226
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,982
<i>It's D-day.</i>

227
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,534
<i>Getting nervous.</i>

228
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,704
By the way, should we
stop by at the convenience store?

229
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,456
The hotel has everything.

230
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,459
Oh, but they might not have enough.

231
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,628
- You mean, condoms!
- Too loud.

232
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,880
I brought loads.

233
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,092
Great job. But why is your bag so big?

234
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,927
I thought we'd try things out.

235
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,261
What things?

236
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,223
<i>Nervous and flustered.</i>

237
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,520
<i>Flustered, bewildered, and confused.</i>

238
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,522
This is it.

239
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,864
<i>Completely flustered.</i>

240
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,209
- See ya.
- H-Hey.

241
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,503
- What? No!
- Please!

242
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,922
We're here already! Just give up!

243
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,842
I can't do this! I just can't!

244
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,009
Takuzo?

245
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,929
No! I'm not letting you go!

246
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,722
Do my best at what?

247
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,182
Ow!

248
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,183
Shinpei!

249
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,978
Ow, it hurts!

250
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,024
Ms. Tenma?

251
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,318
What happened? Should I call the police?

252
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,404
No! No police!

253
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,615
Is it a badger game?
There's no shame. Let's call them.

254
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,741
Don't!

255
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,410
Let me explain.

256
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:27,708
You're giving in to evil? I'll turn
this guy over to the police myself!

257
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,300
<i>Of all times, they ended up</i>

258
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,845
<i>running into Takuzo's colleague</i>
<i>in a situation like this.</i>

259
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,221
<i>Hi-yah!</i>

260
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,269
<i>What will happen</i>
<i>to their three-person marriage plan?</i>

261
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,270
<i>Aiyah!</i>

262
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,856
<i>Sounds interesting.</i>

263
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:51,899
Paw.

264
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,317
Mom, I--

265
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,818
Don't! Let me say it.

266
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,071
You'll be letting your parents down too.

267
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,115
<i>I may never meet someone</i>

268
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,658
I feel so strongly about.

269
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,535
I want to change!

270
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,912
