1
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,733
Takuzo, your beer!

2
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,276
Oh, crap!

3
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,153
Are you okay?

4
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:32,574
Wait.

5
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,035
What was that?

6
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,328
What was what?

7
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,377
Oh, the kiss?

8
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,797
No particular reason. I just felt like it.

9
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,633
What?

10
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,385
So...

11
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,346
You do stuff like that for no reason?

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,477
Well, I guess so.
It's a casual way to show affection.

13
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,270
But...

14
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,776
What's going on
with you youngsters these days?

15
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,445
You really surprised me.

16
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,907
But don't do that again.

17
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,241
You idiot.

18
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,202
My bad.

19
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,747
Are your shoes all right?

20
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,965
<i>The next morning.</i>

21
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,637
<i>Oh, my.</i>

22
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,849
<i>Last night,</i>

23
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,894
<i>this happened.</i>

24
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,189
We're home.

25
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,816
Hey, be careful!

26
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,902
Guys! Wh-What happened?

27
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,613
You reek of alcohol!

28
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,032
- Mia!
- Welcome back!

29
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,493
We're going fishing tomorrow.

30
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,619
Let's go.

31
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,745
What?

32
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:05,500
When it comes to family activity,
it's gotta be fishing. Right?

33
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,294
I'm going to bed.
We're going to the beach tomorrow!

34
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,131
What are you talking about? Huh?

35
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,007
- Tuna!
- Huh?

36
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,968
You can't catch Tuna.

37
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:15,927
Good night.

38
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,264
Wait for me, Takuzo! Takuzo!

39
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,227
Huh?

40
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,022
<i>It's great they've gotten closer.</i>
<i>Isn't it, Mia?</i>

41
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,903
<i>Yes, for now, at least.</i>

42
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,866
Two Husbands One Wife.

43
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,705
What fishing?

44
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,250
They decided without me.

45
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:52,964
I already have plans, you know?

46
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,051
<i>Swaying.</i>

47
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,138
<i>Swaying.</i>

48
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,723
<i>Swaying.</i>

49
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,855
<i>Swaying.</i>

50
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,899
<i>Swaying.</i>

51
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,276
Please

52
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,070
<i>don't hate me, okay?</i>

53
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,409
Shush. You'll scare the fish away.

54
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,202
Sorry.

55
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,502
Actually, this wasn't what I had in mind.

56
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,172
But...

57
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,300
We woke up past noon,

58
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,304
we're hungover
and we have no fishing gear.

59
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,515
We can leave if you want.

60
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,270
No.

61
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,735
Why did it have to be fishing?

62
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,945
You forgot?

63
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,905
Huh? Oh.

64
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,448
Well...

65
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,494
I had a lot to drink
so my memory is a bit...

66
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,830
Fine, then.

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,215
My family... didn't get along so well.

68
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,468
My dad was pretty abusive.

69
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:26,266
<i>So, fishing is the</i>
<i>only good memory I have of my family.</i>

70
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,684
Mom, help.

71
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,685
Shinpei, careful.

72
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,775
What a shame.
They just bought that for you.

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,197
Wear this.

74
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,032
Are you sure?

75
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,039
It looks good on you. Keep it.

76
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,750
Not fair.

77
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,169
You look cool, Shinpei.

78
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,550
<i>It was fun back then.</i>

79
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,807
Soon after that,
our mom got sick and died.

80
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,270
In the end, our dad became an alcoholic.

81
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,649
One day, he just left us and disappeared.

82
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,112
Did you have anyone to rely on?

83
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,905
Like a relative.

84
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,782
Some relative took us in.

85
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,787
But it was horrible there.

86
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,582
When my older brother turned 20,

87
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,876
he rented an apartment for the two of us.

88
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:41,674
He got through college on scholarship
while taking care of me.

89
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,802
Now he's doing really well
as a businessman.

90
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,638
That's impressive.

91
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,556
Yeah.

92
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,475
He's incredible.

93
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:28,054
<i>He always said he never wanted to</i>
<i>inherit that scumbag's genes.</i>

94
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,348
<i>Over and over again.</i>

95
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,851
But I did.

96
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,813
I'm stupid, you see.

97
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,613
I think he can't forgive me
for being a loser like our dad.

98
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,245
Shinpei, you're not a scumbag.

99
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:03,923
Thanks.

100
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,647
But to my brother,
dancer isn't a real job.

101
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,150
He thinks I'm playing around.

102
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,987
He said he doesn't want to see me
until I get a proper job.

103
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,126
It'll be okay.

104
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,046
He'll understand some day.

105
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,720
You think so?

106
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,221
Of course.

107
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,015
I'm sure of it.

108
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,986
- You got a hit!
- Oh!

109
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,363
- Wh-What do I do?
- Hold the rod and pull.

110
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,866
- Pull? How?
- Hold it.

111
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,159
- It's big.
- It's huge!

112
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,660
- It's huge!
- It really is.

113
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,832
- Well done, Takuzo!
- Wow, look at that!

114
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,418
- I caught one! In here?
- Yeah.

115
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,464
- I did it!
- Great job, Takuzo!

116
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,549
Yes! Yay!

117
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,511
- Look at the size.
- It's so big!

118
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,889
Fishing sounds fun though.

119
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,432
You really think so?

120
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,394
Why go through all the trouble?
You can buy fish at a supermarket.

121
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,772
You're so mean.

122
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,815
Why are you angry?

123
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,442
I'm not angry!

124
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,569
Thank you.

125
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,072
It's not your ex's hobby, is it?

126
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,366
Takuzo is an indoor man.

127
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,035
Shinpei's never mentioned
fishing before either.

128
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,495
I don't get it.

129
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,457
Well, it's great
your husbands are getting along, right?

130
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,334
Come on, cheers.

131
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,627
Cheers.

132
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:14,679
But it's also baffling
to see them get close so suddenly.

133
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,098
- You jealous?
- It's not that!

134
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:21,018
I just feel a little left out. That's all.

135
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,438
Forget it.

136
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,400
Don't mind me.
What is it that you wanted to talk about?

137
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,985
- Right.
- Yeah.

138
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,946
We decided to become foster parents.

139
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,701
Foster parents?

140
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,497
Same-sex couples can become parents too.

141
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,207
I thought

142
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,587
our family bond will be stronger
if we have a child after all.

143
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,048
We had a
pretty serious discussion about it.

144
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,720
Wow. You guys have
really thought everything through.

145
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,055
Of course.

146
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,474
What about you guys?

147
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,144
You want kids?

148
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,939
I've thought about it.

149
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,900
When you actually have a child,

150
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:14,363
one of your husbands
will probably end up getting hurt.

151
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,449
What?

152
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,252
What?

153
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,546
Give me a bite.

154
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,215
What are you doing?

155
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,017
Thanks.

156
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,227
Eat yours.

157
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:50,024
The wife and one of the husbands
can be their biological parents,

158
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:53,444
but I think
the other husband will feel alienated.

159
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:57,114
They might not be related by blood,
but if they live together it won't--

160
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,824
Sure, in an ideal world.

161
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,994
You won't know until the time comes.

162
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:07,166
That's why it's best for your husbands
to build a strong bond while they can.

163
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,712
But it's great, huh? Now they're
even going out on dates together.

164
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,923
I wouldn't call it a date.

165
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,840
Why not?

166
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,511
If it's a three-person marriage,

167
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:22,848
the husbands
can have a sexual relationship, right?

168
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,481
Hey!

169
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,618
It stinks.

170
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,662
Smells like fish.

171
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,331
Ugh, mine too.

172
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,293
Hey, don't do that!

173
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,380
It stinks! Stop it!

174
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,715
Your hands are freezing.

175
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,884
I'm sensitive to the cold.

176
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,219
You sound old.

177
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,726
So warm.

178
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,022
Nice and warm.

179
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,331
No way. Never.
It's Takuzo we're talking about.

180
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,294
That hard-headed,
stubborn as a mule, Takuzo.

181
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,921
That's never gonna happen.

182
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:47,892
Sorry.

183
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,191
It's getting cold.

184
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,359
Should we head home?

185
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,418
Were you able to
relive your memory a little?

186
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,254
I guess.

187
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,430
You need help?

188
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,099
No.

189
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,025
I told you

190
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,029
not to fool around like that.

191
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,036
You know, you're...

192
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,207
Never mind.

193
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,253
Now I really understand how Mia felt.

194
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,173
What does Mia have to do with this?

195
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,886
I told you two to go live together
if you like her so much.

196
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,597
That's harsh.

197
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:12,977
Ouch.

198
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,812
You cut yourself?

199
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,596
Come on. Give me your hand.

200
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,014
I'll do it myself.

201
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,599
Just let me.

202
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,688
I'm sorry.

203
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,151
If I made you angry,

204
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,278
I apologize.

205
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,537
Do you know what I'm upset about?

206
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,002
Forget it then.

207
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,086
No.

208
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:24,882
Please.

209
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,676
I'm really bad at this.

210
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,722
I don't understand

211
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,476
other people's feelings.

212
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,811
But...

213
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,607
I want to change.

214
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,117
I...

215
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,622
I want to know more about you.

216
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,545
It's not fair.
Mia knows so many different sides of you.

217
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,798
I want to know too.

218
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,636
Different sides of me?

219
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,728
I wonder what you're like

220
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,148
when you're having sex with Mia.

221
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,320
I just wanna try it.

222
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,199
I promise not to hurt you.

223
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:39,957
I...

224
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,004
I can't.

225
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,048
I mean...

226
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,262
I've never even imagined
doing things like that.

227
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,935
Then, try imagining it.

228
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,272
Well...

229
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:05,941
But...

230
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,952
I'm getting hungry.
I'll go cook something right now.

231
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,773
Your hands.

232
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,358
They're cold.

233
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,029
So?

234
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,115
What do you want?

235
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,381
It hurts me

236
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,802
to see you cry.

237
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,186
Don't make me cry then.

238
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,697
Okay.

239
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,582
What's wrong?

240
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,627
Well,

241
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,965
I can't get in bed with dirty socks on.

242
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,736
<i>They are moving on</i>
<i>to the next step without you.</i>

243
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,198
<i>Are you going to be okay, Mia?</i>

244
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,785
Takuzo and Shinpei?

245
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,207
Yeah, right.

246
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,480
<i>I can't do this!</i>

247
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:54,276
<i>I totally misunderstood</i>
<i>and thought both guys were into me!</i>

248
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,279
I always went along with what you like.

249
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,157
<i>If Mia doesn't come home...</i>

250
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,825
<i>It's for Shinpei, isn't it?</i>

251
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,327
I've always been selfish.

252
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,828
