1
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:09,509
That's pretty much how it is.

2
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:14,597
So it's not a badger game.

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,559
Come.

4
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,439
Did that clear things up?

5
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,316
Um...

6
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,277
Ms. Tenma?

7
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,746
A three-person marriage
sounds interesting.

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:39,873
What?

9
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,882
Then, I'll leave you to it.

10
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,974
Oh! U-Um, could you

11
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,810
not mention this at work?

12
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,702
I won't.

13
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,297
She's an interesting person.

14
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:34,677
<i>This is a story about</i>
<i>these three and their marriage.</i>

15
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,349
Two Husbands One Wife.

16
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,103
<i>Spinning round and round.</i>

17
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,026
Good morning.

18
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,403
Morning.

19
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,323
That toast looks so good. How nice.

20
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,783
Can I have some?

21
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,831
Yum.

22
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,543
Where's Mia?

23
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,378
Grocery shopping.

24
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,047
- I see.
- Yup.

25
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,053
Sorry.

26
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,224
You're being distant.

27
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,813
You'll hurt me
if you keep brushing me off, you know?

28
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,694
I'm sorry.
I chickened out at the last minute.

29
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,447
Me too.

30
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,242
I'm sorry I tried to force you.

31
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,578
Don't be.

32
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,789
We made that decision together.

33
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,018
Will you give us another chance?

34
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,361
Someone's here.

35
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,363
I'll get it.

36
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,867
MONITOR
ANSWER/END CALL

37
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,371
Don't walk away.

38
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,051
<i>Takuzo? It's mom.</i>

39
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:39,802
Why?

40
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,846
Huh? Who's this lady?

41
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,348
She's my mom.

42
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,975
- No way.
<i>- Is this Takuzo Mitsuda's house?</i>

43
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,810
Why is she here?

44
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,647
<i>This is Takuzo's mom, Natsuko.</i>

45
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,776
<i>I really need to use the toilet.</i>
<i>You know I hate using one at the station.</i>

46
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,362
Wh-What should we do?

47
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,488
<i>What are you doing?</i>

48
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,533
This is your favorite dish, Takuzo.

49
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,079
- <i>Kakuzushi</i>.
- Wow, you made some.

50
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,330
- Wow!
- Thanks.

51
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,252
It keeps for a while,
so you can eat them tomorrow.

52
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,472
How did you meet my Takuzo?

53
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,517
Um, through a friend.

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,602
It doesn't matter, does it?

55
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,938
What do you do?

56
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,107
Oh, I'm a dancer.

57
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,277
Wow, that's a lovely job.

58
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,571
Where do you live?

59
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,198
Wh-Where?

60
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,450
I, uh...

61
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,205
I live in Azabu. In a high-rise condo.

62
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,917
My, you live in such luxurious place.

63
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,674
DUTY ROSTER

64
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,931
Oh, the laundry is done.
I'll hang them before they get wrinkled.

65
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,141
Right, thanks.

66
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,810
What?

67
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,107
Why is he hanging your laundry?

68
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,365
Don't try to hide it.

69
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,744
I can see right through you.

70
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,997
- Excuse me--
- No, no!

71
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,750
I'll explain it to her.

72
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,336
Mom, I--

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,840
Don't! Let me say it.

74
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,844
You...

75
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,098
You like men, right? You're gay.

76
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,642
Huh? It's not...

77
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,186
Well...

78
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,693
I've had a suspicion for a while
because you're not married at that age.

79
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,611
But--

80
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:06,407
Oh my goodness,
what am I supposed to tell your father?

81
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,202
Come on, you don't have to cry about it.

82
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:14,499
Having a grandchild was
the only thing I was looking forward to.

83
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,793
I hate this!

84
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,171
I have nothing to look forward to anymore.

85
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,800
Don't lie!
You're enjoying your life to the fullest.

86
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,261
See. You came to Tokyo
to see your fave, right?

87
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,513
RORYU IS THE BEST

88
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,807
You have a fave you support?

89
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,600
A male underground idol.

90
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,144
It's so embarrassing,
fangirling at her age.

91
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,896
Leave me alone.

92
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:41,442
Stop getting excited over young men.
I'm sure Dad's not happy about it either.

93
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,156
It's not embarrassing at all.

94
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,826
Age doesn't matter to fan activities.

95
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,788
Well said, young man!

96
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,705
What?

97
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,459
I didn't know you're that kind of person.

98
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,046
He's always been hard-headed.
Just like his father.

99
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,382
- He can be narrow-minded.
- Right?

100
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,635
And he nags like an expert.
Who does he think he is?

101
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:11,973
I'm so jealous
he has a mother with such great taste.

102
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,391
Oh, my.

103
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,269
- I'd love to get to know you more.
- Thanks.

104
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,439
You know, it's not like

105
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:25,570
I don't understand
this romance between two men.

106
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:30,283
In the end,
I'm fine as long as he's happy.

107
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,202
I just want him to be happy.

108
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,423
I'm home!

109
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,802
Sushi was on sale at the supermarket,
so I bought loads!

110
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,725
And you are?

111
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,813
Huh?

112
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,815
<i>This is Mia.</i>

113
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,444
<i>Two Husbands One Wife.</i>

114
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,490
<i>A few hours later.</i>

115
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,911
<i>So and so. This and that.</i>

116
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,207
Um...

117
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:20,791
Mom.

118
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,669
If you go through with such absurd idea,

119
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,672
I will cut all ties with you. Got it?

120
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,884
Mom, please.

121
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,013
Look.

122
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,557
This is the first time

123
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,811
I'm having so much fun
being with other people.

124
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,777
Mia, is it?

125
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,489
Y-Yes.

126
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:53,950
Listen.

127
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,788
You'll be letting your parents down, too.

128
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,134
This keeps for a few days.

129
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,012
Please eat them if you'd like.

130
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,319
Honey...

131
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,322
<i>Making a second appearance, Megumi.</i>

132
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,448
Honey!

133
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,744
A dream, huh?

134
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,707
Good morning.

135
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,420
Hey, don't scare me like that.

136
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,714
Mom.

137
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,718
I have something
I'd like to talk to you about.

138
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,971
<i>An hour later.</i>

139
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,557
This three-person marriage.

140
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,518
Even if Takuzo agrees to it,

141
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,315
what's been worrying me is
not being able to get your blessing.

142
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,486
That's why I wanted to talk to you now.

143
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,282
You don't have to understand it.

144
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,285
But please.

145
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,662
Let me be

146
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,916
your daughter from now on too.

147
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,503
- There.
- Huh?

148
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,421
What?

149
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:39,472
I might get along
with that Shinpei person.

150
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:40,890
What?

151
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,601
Actually...

152
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,148
After your dad got sick,
it got me thinking.

153
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,278
Why is marriage only between two people?

154
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,865
<i>If</i>

155
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,203
<i>I had someone else,</i>
<i>who was in the same shoes as me,</i>

156
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,873
<i>things might have been easier.</i>

157
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,420
Well, in terms of common sense,

158
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:16,675
it's definitely strange
to have a three-person marriage.

159
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,764
But there's nothing I can do, is there?

160
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,892
I've been your mother for 32 years,

161
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:29,063
so I know your personality all too well.
Isn't that right?

162
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,690
Mom.

163
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,442
But...

164
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,949
If you're going to do this,
you better go through with it.

165
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,494
You'll regret it
if you quit half way through.

166
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,874
Yes, ma'am.

167
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,295
Right, okay. A housewife is very busy.

168
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,172
Don't get in my way.

169
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,888
<i>"I'm glad I'm her daughter."</i>

170
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,143
<i>"I want to be a parent like her one day."</i>

171
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,228
<i>Thought Mia.</i>

172
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,319
Three?

173
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,239
A three-person marriage?

174
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,494
TOKYO PUBLIC BATH

175
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,664
- Yes, I saw it!
- I thought they're talking about me.

176
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:33,627
That's the one I gave him during the show...

177
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,715
They're here!

178
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,800
- Seishiro!
- Thank you!

179
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,343
Thanks everyone!

180
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,221
Mom!

181
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,312
I thought I could see you if I came here.

182
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,815
Listen.

183
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,319
About the other day.

184
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,699
I'm...

185
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,204
I'm not good at being around people.

186
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,501
I may never meet someone

187
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,212
I feel so strongly about.

188
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,801
The thing is,

189
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,848
being with them... somehow helps me

190
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,979
to see things in a different light
than by being on my own.

191
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,317
Mom, I...

192
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,239
I want to change!

193
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,213
Then pull yourself together
and face the fight!

194
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,144
You got this, Takuzo!

195
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,563
- Takuzo!
- Mom.

196
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,523
Go. Go on!

197
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,149
Thanks.

198
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,489
You can do this, Takuzo!

199
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,907
Takuzo!

200
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,659
<i>Two Husbands One Wife.</i>

201
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,414
<i>Once again, it's D-day.</i>

202
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,616
So, what do we do first?

203
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,828
Um, let's take a look at what we brought.

204
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,705
R-Right. Okay!

205
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,333
Geez, why did you bring so much stuff?

206
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,710
I thought it'd be more fun.

207
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,921
- Let's use scented candles.
- Here.

208
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,007
Oh, I forgot to bring a lighter. Sorry.

209
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,885
It's okay.
Why don't you take a shower first?

210
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:28,928
Roger!

211
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,471
Go with the plan, okay?

212
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,139
Slicked back hair, right?

213
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,266
Make sure not to dry your hair too much.

214
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,184
Got it!

215
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,561
Wh-What about me?

216
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,773
You jump in the shower
when Shinpei is done.

217
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,524
Okay!

218
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,735
Takuzo.

219
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,080
Takuzo.

220
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,754
I really appreciate this. Thank you.

221
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,760
Me too.

222
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,473
Thank you.

223
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,419
Wait.

224
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,423
Hang on.

225
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,262
We should start
when all three of us are ready.

226
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,264
- You're right.
- Yeah.

227
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,099
Should we have sex together?

228
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,100
- Yes.
- Yes.

229
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,101
I want to!

230
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,274
<i>No one knows</i>
<i>what will happen in the future.</i>

231
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,154
<i>There's no guarantee</i>
<i>that this is the right path.</i>

232
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:18,704
<i>Still, this is a big step for these three.</i>

233
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,092
<i>Living your life</i>
<i>means to be greedy, doesn't it?</i>

234
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,886
<i>Chomp, chomp.</i>

235
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,914
You scared me.

236
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,294
Thanks.

237
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,423
Why didn't you ask me to join you?

238
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,511
Is it because of
what happened the other day?

239
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,264
I'm sorry you had to see that.

240
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:25,979
This?

241
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,689
Paw.

242
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:33,028
OUR HOME

243
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,533
This hand.

244
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,963
Please marry me.

245
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,342
What?

246
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,719
Turn around.

247
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,224
What you want to do

248
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,687
is to live your life
with someone else, correct?

249
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,731
Then two people works fine too.

250
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,832
I want to have
a friendship marriage with you.

251
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,752
Friendship marriage?

252
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,716
Let's give it a try.

253
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:43,140
<i>Friendship marriage is when two friends</i>
<i>with no romantic feelings get married.</i>

254
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,435
<i>An unexpected opponent candidate appeared.</i>

255
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,812
<i>What will happen to</i>
<i>the three-person marriage?</i>

256
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,689
Let's do this.

257
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,734
<i>A woman who says</i>
<i>crazy things like that is no good.</i>

258
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,154
<i>What's wrong with having a marriage</i>
<i>without romantic feelings?</i>

259
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,198
You're the best, Ms. Tenma.

260
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:03,410
Is it against the rules to cuddle
if we miss another person's touch?

261
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,786
