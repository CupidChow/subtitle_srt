1
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:23,314
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>Takuzo was regretting his decision.</i>

2
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:27,318
Would you like to get married to us?

3
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,030
You mean you'll try it out for a year?

4
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,699
- Thank you, Takuzo!
- No, no.

5
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,120
A three-person marriage?

6
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:42,667
Takuzo, we received a call about
the new construction project in Ueno.

7
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,585
And?

8
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:46,504
They want a bedroom
for three people after all.

9
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,173
- Three people?
- Yes.

10
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,675
Parents and their child.

11
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,719
To fit a children's bed too.

12
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,638
Oh, got it.

13
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,640
- Thanks.
- Sure.

14
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,476
<i>Poor Takuzo.</i>

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,729
<i>He's become sensitive</i>
<i>to hearing "three people."</i>

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,066
Do you want a <i>manju</i> bun?

17
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,192
Last one.

18
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,613
Don't give out smashed <i>manju</i> buns.

19
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,531
You went somewhere?

20
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,867
A solo trip to a hot spring.

21
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,413
Sounds great. I wish I could
throw away my troubles and go somewhere.

22
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:28,713
Hello, this is Beaver Architects.

23
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,258
Yes, he's here.

24
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,180
Excuse me, may I have your name?

25
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,016
Mr. Shinpei Satomura.

26
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,021
Don't call me at work!

27
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,650
<i>Is there anything you want to do?</i>

28
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,777
What? Me?

29
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,903
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Takuzo.

30
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,488
Your client is here.

31
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,115
<i>Takuzo. Takuzo!</i>

32
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,575
- <i>Come on. Anything will do.</i>
- Welcome.

33
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,744
- Use the meeting room.
- <i>Give me one idea.</i>

34
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,287
<i>Takuzo!</i>

35
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,956
I'm busy right now.

36
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,208
- Hurry!
- <i>Hurry.</i>

37
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,835
Th-Then, um...

38
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,461
Go to a hot spring.

39
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,214
<i>Okay, hot springs. Got it. Bye.</i>

40
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,509
Wait. I said hot springs,
but I mean a solo trip. Okay?

41
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,889
What was that?

42
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,518
Excuse me.

43
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,521
ALL ABOUT SEX

44
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:34,195
"Your thirties are the time
for a new challenge in bed."

45
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,366
Right.

46
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,161
No, it's not right.

47
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,537
Well...

48
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,080
But...

49
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,422
"It brought back my love for my husband."

50
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,966
Love...

51
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,887
You'll never be able to get married
any other way!

52
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,263
- What?
- Mia!

53
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,015
Did I?

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,863
Did I...

55
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,157
love him?

56
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,829
Right?

57
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,081
I'm home.

58
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,333
Oh, hi.

59
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,001
Hey, Mia.

60
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,797
You're heavy. Hey! What?

61
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,425
Wash your hands first when you come home.

62
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,885
- Get up.
- What?

63
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,762
Ready? Turn.

64
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,182
Mia.

65
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,559
Let's go to a hot spring.

66
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,770
- A hot spring?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,230
The three of us.

68
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,358
- What?
- I'll go wash my hands.

69
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,985
Wait. What?

70
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,528
Huh?

71
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,841
Two husbands, one wife

72
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,074
- They're so fluffy.
- So fluffy.

73
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,038
<i>Fluffy.</i>

74
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,127
<i>So fluffy.</i>

75
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,214
<i>Fluffy, so fluffy.</i>

76
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,842
Hey, let's go look at alpacas next.

77
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:06,597
But I'm tired.
I want to go to the hot springs.

78
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,182
But it's alpacas.

79
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,019
What's the point in
watching those hairy camels.

80
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,770
Hairy camels?

81
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,731
Then, let's have a vote.

82
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,108
Who wants to see alpacas? Me.

83
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,027
Yes?

84
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,825
Okay, fine.

85
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,160
We can go?

86
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,704
You guys voted, right?

87
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:33,041
Hey, this might be
the upside of a group of three.

88
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,340
I remember we ended up fighting a lot
because you always had to get your way.

89
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:46,596
Excuse me? You're the one who always
left it up to me and whined when I decide.

90
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,848
That's really annoying, you know.

91
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,683
You have weird taste.

92
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,603
Who goes to
the Parasitological Museum on a date?

93
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,396
To see a tapeworm, of all things.

94
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,398
But it's not any other tapeworm.

95
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,486
It's the longest tapeworm
that even Bill Gates tweeted about.

96
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,362
What's a tapeworm?

97
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,739
You don't know?

98
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,158
It's a white and long parasite,
like a noodle.

99
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,202
Sometimes it's in people's intestines.

100
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,370
- Gross.
- What?

101
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,872
I think I want to see it.

102
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:13,998
Right?

103
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,793
Really? You're one of those people too?

104
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:20,213
<i>Despite that,</i>
<i>you seem to be having fun, Takuzo.</i>

105
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,800
<i>It's been a while</i>
<i>since you went on a trip with others.</i>

106
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,844
Look, they're eating.

107
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,180
There's another one.

108
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,683
Hey, crouch down a bit.

109
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,352
That's good.

110
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,770
It's perfect.

111
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,355
Look at the camera.

112
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,150
They look a bit scared.

113
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,070
Thank you.

114
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,699
Let's have a taste.

115
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,595
Takuzo?

116
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,893
Takuzo, you're so boring.

117
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,522
What a coincidence.

118
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,941
Maybe you're here with your girlfriend?

119
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,528
Well, sort of.

120
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,988
Really?

121
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,409
Oh, he's--

122
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,161
It's fine. I can tell.

123
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,289
I'm happy for you.

124
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,749
Why?

125
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,001
You found someone new.

126
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,088
I'm glad to see you're happy.

127
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,009
Takuzo!

128
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,343
Look at this.

129
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,637
Isn't this cool? It's a sword.

130
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,141
Your friends?

131
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:58,936
Bye.

132
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,027
<i>I know you were just</i>
<i>trying to save face, Takuzo.</i>

133
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,821
Hot springs, hot springs.

134
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,615
It's here.

135
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,578
Oh, wow.

136
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,598
SARASVATI'S BATH

137
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,358
My underwear is

138
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,610
beige.

139
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,282
No, no. Not gonna happen.
It's too soon for that.

140
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,799
No, stop checking.

141
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,925
MEN'S BATH

142
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:11,842
There.

143
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,179
Hello.

144
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:16,889
Hi.

145
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,311
This feels so good.

146
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,423
Mia seemed like
she was having a great time today.

147
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,926
She's always like that.

148
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,766
She seems more relaxed
when she's with you.

149
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,269
Does she?

150
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,228
Yeah.

151
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,023
I guess your vibes are compatible.

152
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,399
Vibes?

153
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,194
Mia and I belong to a different clique
to begin with.

154
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,696
Clique?

155
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,617
I've never dated anyone like her before.

156
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,829
Someone who's like... proper.

157
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,418
None of my friends go to work
on a rush-hour train every morning.

158
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,212
It's like we live in a different world.

159
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,131
Is that so?

160
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,134
So...

161
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,762
It's embarrassing to say this,

162
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,181
but,

163
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,810
the fact that she chose me
has really boosted my confidence.

164
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:50,650
Like, even someone free-spirited like me
can be accepted by society.

165
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,653
And yet,

166
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,658
you don't want to
have a normal marriage with her?

167
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,204
No.

168
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,625
I can only carry so much.

169
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,926
Either way,

170
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,054
in the end, I got dumped.

171
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,431
You're the one she chose.

172
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,939
So, be more confident.

173
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,074
What?

174
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,080
What is it?

175
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,041
Takuzo,

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,293
you really are kind.

177
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,564
What's going on with those three, huh?

178
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,483
She brought two guys with her. How wild.

179
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,078
Something wrong?

180
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,504
Why are you moving it?

181
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,965
Well, this doesn't feel right.

182
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,140
What are you doing?

183
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,683
Come on.

184
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,393
I'm fine over here.

185
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,478
There.

186
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,354
Closer.

187
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,441
Hey!

188
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,776
You two sleep over there.

189
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,862
I'm fine on my own!

190
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,621
This feels like heaven.

191
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,516
Takuzo,

192
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,144
you don't have to answer
if you don't want to. But...

193
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,479
Okay.

194
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,816
That woman we met at the souvenir shop.

195
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,610
Is she your ex?

196
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,488
Yeah.

197
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,491
I dated her after Mia.

198
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,202
We broke up about three months ago.

199
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:54,291
Why didn't you marry her?
She's so pretty. You wasted your chance.

200
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,503
I thought I would.

201
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,588
But,

202
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,967
as it turned out,
she didn't like me that much.

203
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,635
She was cheating on me.

204
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,558
<i>I felt so angry and...</i>

205
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,518
Hey!

206
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,687
<i>I said,</i>

207
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,231
You know,

208
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,819
I don't give a damn what you do.

209
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,197
What?

210
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,660
<i>Then she started having a go at me.</i>

211
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,708
Takuzo, you're so boring.

212
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,837
There's no one in the world
who can live with you!

213
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,340
Let's go.

214
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,218
- Who's that?
- No one you should worry about.

215
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,805
She said there's no one in the world
who can live with me.

216
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,265
That's horrible!

217
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,143
Who does she think she is?

218
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,354
You said I could never get married, too.

219
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,106
That's totally different.

220
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,232
How so?

221
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:05,321
Why is she acting like a victim
when she's the one who cheated?

222
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,157
You know, people like her

223
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:13,621
shamelessly say stuff like,
"I want you to be happy too."

224
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,624
Oh, that!
That's exactly what she said earlier!

225
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,293
It's been bugging me!

226
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,962
Oh, I have one too! When I was in college,

227
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,007
my boyfriend was cheating on me
for a whole year!

228
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,216
A year?

229
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,844
Guess what he said when we broke up?

230
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:34,600
I can't date a dense chick who
didn't notice I was cheating for a year.

231
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,684
He said that!

232
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,102
He's quite a guy.

233
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,771
That's insane.

234
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,481
Unbelievable, right?

235
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,734
On top of that, he said,
"I've been holding this in,

236
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:48,530
but you have ugly footsteps
so walking with you was torture."

237
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,740
Ugly footsteps?

238
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,993
He was trying to put the blame on you.

239
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,453
Exactly!

240
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,372
What are ugly footsteps?

241
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,123
My turn!

242
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,961
I once got dumped at
the rest stop on our way back from a trip.

243
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,255
It was because she didn't like
the way I eat <i>udon</i> noodles.

244
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,256
That's mean.

245
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,967
On your way back?

246
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,054
What's more, we got stuck in traffic
so it was like being in hell.

247
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,724
But I've got loads of stories like that.

248
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,935
When I was in middle school,

249
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,688
I made rice balls
and gave them to the girl I liked.

250
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,023
So she won't be hungry
after her club activity.

251
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,734
Then she said
I was being creepy and dumped me.

252
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,903
- That really is creepy.
- What?

253
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,239
A middle school boy making rice balls?

254
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,282
- Right?
- Yeah.

255
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,575
Oh, come on!

256
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,202
Sympathize with me!

257
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,495
We can't.

258
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,164
Right, we can't.

259
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,750
- No way.
- Nope.

260
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,053
You know, I hope that someday

261
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,433
we can laugh about today, just like this.

262
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,394
We can.

263
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,814
One day. I'm sure of it.

264
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,525
Yeah.

265
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,655
Oh, right.

266
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,033
- Here.
- Huh?

267
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,535
I brought scarves for you two.

268
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,329
It'll keep your neck warm.

269
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:20,831
Use it.

270
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,292
- That's creepy.
- What?

271
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,836
Why would you bring them all the way here?

272
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,464
- But--
- Sorry, but no thank you.

273
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,549
You guys are cold!

274
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,482
<i>These three ended up talking until dawn</i>

275
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,651
<i>and woke up without getting much sleep.</i>

276
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,532
Mia, let's battle.

277
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,201
Slash!

278
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,121
Give me a second?

279
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,581
You forgot something?

280
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,129
Excuse me.

281
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,300
Is there something you want to say to me?

282
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,846
- No.
- No.

283
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,146
Okay. Shall we go?

284
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,148
- Are we ready?
- Yes.

285
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,150
Let's go!

286
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,569
Go!

287
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,866
- We're going straight home, right?
- Um, yeah...

288
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,494
Wait, let's stop by somewhe--

289
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,335
<i>A few days later.</i>

290
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,338
- It's heavy.
- There.

291
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,507
H-Hang on. Hey!

292
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,176
We have loads of stuff. Keep it up.

293
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,137
What is this? What's going on?

294
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,972
Oh, my slippers.

295
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,890
- What?
- Huh?

296
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,225
Huh?

297
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:07,563
I told you we want to move in with you
because our contract renewal is coming up.

298
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,108
No, you didn't.

299
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,860
- You did not.
- I did.

300
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,945
You said it sounds fun.

301
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,616
I sent you a message.

302
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,118
But...

303
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,495
We haven't even exchanged our IDs.

304
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,623
- For real?
- Yeah.

305
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,793
Oh, no!

306
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,337
I sent it to my friend, Takumi.

307
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,255
What?

308
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,510
Oh, we have to move the car!

309
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,721
I'll carry it in, okay?

310
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,806
No, wait. Hey!

311
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,398
When do we do the dishes?

312
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,734
<i>We have no place to go back to.</i>

313
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,069
<i>Have you ever had a threesome?</i>

314
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,238
There's no way I can.

315
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,657
<i>I'm assigning you chores right now.</i>

316
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,367
You have to stick with it, okay?

317
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,493
<i>Do it every day!</i>

318
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,870
