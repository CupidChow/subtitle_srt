1
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,120
Qiushan.

2
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,720
Qiushan.

3
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:19,840
Qiushan.

4
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,039
Qiushan.

5
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,360
Qiushan.

6
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,400
Qiushan.

7
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,600
Qiushan.

8
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,680
Qiushan.

9
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,600
Are you okay?

10
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,120
I think my bone is broken.

11
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,240
Let's go.

12
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,020
We need to get to the hospital.

13
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,880
Come on.

14
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,840
Let's go.

15
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,880
Move.

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,080
Hurry.

17
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,120
I'll carry you

18
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,640
Let's go.

19
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,400
That's Mu Qiushan.

20
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,160
Yes.

21
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,360
How did he get injured?

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,280
I don't know.

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
Probably made an operational error.

24
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
But it's perfect timing.

25
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,360
If he dies,

26
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,320
our problem will be solved.

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,760
You sent someone to do it.

28
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,880
Why did you take matters into your own hands?

29
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,840
Without the patent,

30
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,300
what am I supposed to tell the shareholders?

31
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,440
Jiang Chunyu.

32
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,960
How is Qiushan?

33
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,240
Is his life in danger?

34
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,520
Qiushan ended up like this

35
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,320
because of you and Gu Xiaomeng.

36
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,130
How dare you come here with your crocodile tears.

37
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,120
Get out.

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,040
Why should I leave?

39
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,840
You're the homewrecker who destroyed our relationship.

40
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,920
But now,

41
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,880
Qiushan has finally seen

42
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,320
who you really are.

43
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,680
He's ready to reconcile with me.

44
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,800
If you two want to argue, do it outside.

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,920
This is the emergency room.

46
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,120
Don't interfere with our patient care.

47
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,680
If you've got the guts, come with me.

48
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,120
Let's talk in private.

49
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,560
Stop looking.

50
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,440
It's just you and me here now.

51
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,520
Jiang Chunyu.

52
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,360
Do you know what Mu Qiushan

53
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,320
was doing

54
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,480
before the car accident?

55
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,320
He was in bed

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,440
with me.

57
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,040
Let me go!

58
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
Let me go!

59
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,320
Gu Nian.

60
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,360
You can fight me however you want.

61
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,090
But if you dare mess with Mu Qiushan again,

62
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,010
I'll make sure you die without a burial place.

63
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,320
Jiang Chunyu.

64
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,840
Weren't you being so arrogant?

65
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,240
Go ahead and act tough now.

66
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,640
I dare you.

67
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,760
What took you so long?

68
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,720
Sorry, Nian.

69
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,780
There was traffic.

70
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,700
I thought Jiang Chunyu was pretty tough,

71
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,680
but she still ended up defeated by our Nian.

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Anyone who fights against me

73
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,040
has only one path - death.

74
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,320
Nian.

75
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,970
She won't die, will she?

76
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,520
Don't worry.

77
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,840
It's not time yet.

78
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,159
The medicine seller said

79
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,720
this drug

80
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,880
just works slowly.

81
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,640
Its only advantage

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,440
is that all modern equipment

83
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,320
can't detect it.

84
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,840
She can only slowly

85
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,520
wait for death.

86
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,120
These days,

87
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,250
where can you even find such drugs?

88
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,240
Nian,

89
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,280
you weren't scammed, were you?

90
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,159
How about

91
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,560
you try it?

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,320
I'm sorry, Nian.

93
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,320
Otherwise

94
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
I'll

95
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,760
slash Jiang Chunyu's face

96
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,160
to avenge you.

97
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,740
Be careful with it.

98
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,240
Don't break it.

99
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
Don't move.

100
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,160
Weren't you poisoned?

101
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,130
Please read more books when you have time.

102
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't you know there are many ways

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,520
to dilute poison?

104
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,840
Plus with this,

105
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,200
the toxins in my body

106
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,000
were quickly cleared out.

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,400
Is Mu Qiushan's family here?

108
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,480
Doctor.

109
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,800
How is he?

110
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,640
Is it serious?

111
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,040
The fracture isn't too bad,

112
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,440
but he injured his spinal cord.

113
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,600
The worst outcome

114
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,040
is permanent paralysis.

115
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,420
How could this happen?

116
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,680
Doctor.

117
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,960
Please, I beg you to save him.

118
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,040
We'll do our best.

119
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,920
But you must pay attention to

120
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,280
the patient's mental state.

121
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,040
Most people find this difficult to accept.

122
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,120
As family members,

123
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,560
you must maintain a positive attitude

124
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,640
and provide encouragement.

125
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,440
Okay.

126
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,160
Sis.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,520
Since things have come to this point,

128
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,680
let's just cancel

129
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,000
this marriage.

130
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,760
As for the patent issue,

131
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,280
I'll find another solution for you.

132
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,520
I want to continue.

133
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,560
Are you crazy, sis?

134
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,720
He's already become a cripple.

135
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,400
You...

136
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,360
Do you love him that much?

137
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,080
This has nothing to do with love.

138
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,800
The Gu Group is my last card.

139
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,720
If I lose it,

140
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,560
I'll truly have nothing left.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,440
I'm so tired.

142
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,160
I'm so exhausted.

143
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,320
Sis.

144
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,000
You still have me.

145
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,440
We've known each other for 20 years.

146
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,450
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.

147
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
I'll give you anything you desire.

148
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,600
I'll give it to you.

149
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,160
Gu Xiaomeng.

150
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,040
What I want,

151
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,000
you can never give me.

152
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
I told you long ago,

153
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,480
don't have any hopes for her.

154
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,600
It's not too late to back out now.

155
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,880
Haven't I told you before

156
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,900
don't let me hear this kind of talk again.

157
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,960
Yes.

158
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,920
In your heart,

159
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,700
I'll never be worthy of comparison with Gu Nian.

160
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,720
But do you know what?

161
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,960
In this world,

162
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,840
only I,

163
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,960
only I, Fang Yue, truly care about you.

164
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,120
I don't want to see you

165
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,450
walking step by step toward destruction.

166
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,360
I will handle everything.

167
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,380
I don't need your help.

168
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Chunyu.

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,080
Do you have something on your mind?

170
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,040
Auntie,

171
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,200
how did you know?

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,440
Shuyun once told me

173
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,800
that you

174
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
seem sweet and cheerful,

175
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,120
but you actually keep a lot to yourself.

176
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,960
When something serious happens,

177
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,520
you tend to bottle it up.

178
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,040
All these years...

179
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,600
I've long considered you

180
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,000
as my own daughter.

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,730
If something's troubling you,

182
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,560
would you tell me about it?

183
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,080
Auntie...

184
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,360
Does everyone who gets involved with me

185
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,740
end up becoming unfortunate?

186
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,140
What nonsense are you talking about?

187
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,440
Don't let yourself be brainwashed

188
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
by such ridiculous ideas.

189
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,400
Everyone's fate

190
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,440
is their own responsibility.

191
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,880
As long as you don't harm others,

192
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,680
you can have a clear conscience.

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
As long as I have a clear conscience.

194
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,780
By the way, Auntie.

195
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,500
Mu Qiushan and I are together now.

196
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,210
Next time I'll bring him to meet you

197
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,040
as my future partner.

198
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,400
Good.

199
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,770
Make sure you bring him.

200
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,720
Thank you, Auntie.

201
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,280
Look at you,

202
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,840
being so formal with me.

203
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,640
You're awake.

204
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,720
Chunyu.

205
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,800
My legs.

206
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,040
It's okay.

207
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,810
I know many specialists in this field.

208
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,920
If this hospital can't help you,

209
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,960
we'll try other hospitals.

210
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,930
You'll definitely get better.

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,800
Qiushan.

212
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,720
Even if your legs never heal,

213
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,120
I still want to marry you.

214
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,800
Let's get married.

215
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,920
I'm useless now.

216
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,200
Love doesn't matter anymore.

217
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
You should find someone more suitable.

218
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,160
Qiushan.

219
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,880
Jiang Chunyu.

220
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,520
I don't understand

221
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,040
what you're really thinking.

222
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,680
This relationship exhausts me.

223
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,840
Since my body is ruined now,

224
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,800
let's end this completely.

225
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,080
Are you deaf?

226
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,360
Can't you hear someone asking you to leave?

227
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,720
If you shamelessly refuse to leave,

228
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,440
I'll call security.

229
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,640
Mu Qiushan.

230
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,360
Don't regret this.

231
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,760
Mu Qiushan has changed too quickly.

232
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,440
Something feels

233
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,600
off about him.

234
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,400
It seems

235
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,240
the toxins have been almost completely eliminated.

236
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,500
It won't interfere with my date tonight.

237
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
Did you and Mu Qiushan

238
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,970
really break up?

239
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,520
Don't worry about that.

240
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,400
How are the arrangements for what comes next?

241
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,520
It's time to close the net.

242
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Then Gu Xiaomeng,

243
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,770
he can't escape either, right?

244
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,370
Do you want to watch him die,

245
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,680
or see him go to prison?

246
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,480
Take your pick.
