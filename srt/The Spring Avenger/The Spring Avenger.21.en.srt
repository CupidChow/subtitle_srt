1
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,160
I am the real

2
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,440
heir to the Gu Group.

3
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,360
Jiang Chunyu.

4
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,600
What are you doing

5
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,200
with Gu family business?

6
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,240
I'm the heir to the Gu Group.

7
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,100
Of course I had to come.

8
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,160
Nonsense.

9
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,240
Who do you think you are,

10
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,160
daring to get your hands on our Gu Group?

11
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,440
Mr. Zhang,

12
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,160
do you know what you're doing?

13
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,020
You are my grandfather's lawyer.

14
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,560
Are you betraying us now?

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,100
Miss Gu, please calm down.

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,320
Please allow Miss Jiang

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,450
to finish speaking.

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,880
This is the DNA test result

19
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,340
between Mr. Gu and myself.

20
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,700
You can all take a look.

21
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,410
This appears to be genuine.

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,759
If Miss Jiang

23
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,480
is Mr. Gu's biological granddaughter,

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,280
then Gu Nian

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,660
is indeed unsuitable.

26
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,200
Indeed unsuitable.

27
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,880
Miss Jiang,

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,000
Mr. Gu met with me before he passed away

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
and gave me a DNA sample.

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,329
I'm the granddaughter Grandpa raised for twenty years.

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,360
It's fake.

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,480
It's all fake.

33
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,120
Security,

34
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,480
get her out of here.

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,040
Miss Gu,

36
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,480
The DNA test was conducted

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,520
under proper supervision.

38
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,960
You can verify it at the hospital.

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,020
I don't believe it.

40
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,280
You're clearly favoring Jiang Chunyu.

41
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,280
Why are you doing this?

42
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,810
Wasn't my grandfather good enough to you?

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,040
Gu Nian,

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,480
Miss Gu, please control yourself.

45
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,280
Mr. Gu showed me great kindness.

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,880
I must fulfill his last wish

47
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,720
to give the company

48
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,250
to his real granddaughter.

49
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,400
You bitch,

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,920
how dare you bribe Lawyer Zhang

51
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,240
to forge the DNA test

52
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,320
and try to steal my company.

53
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,800
Dream on!

54
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,240
Miss Gu, why are you so upset?

55
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,380
Is it because you feel guilty?

56
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,090
What do I have to feel guilty about?

57
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,560
All these years,

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,040
I've always been Grandfather's granddaughter.

59
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,079
All the shareholders present here

60
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,680
have witnessed this fact.

61
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,160
Don't think you can use such a cheap trick

62
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
to drive me away.

63
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,280
Now that I, the real granddaughter, am here,

64
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,560
you, the impostor,

65
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,320
naturally need to back off.

66
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,160
Of course you're scared.

67
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,160
Ladies,

68
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,520
This Miss Gu

69
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,680
and Mr. Gu

70
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,240
indeed have a 20-year parent-child relationship,

71
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,920
while Miss Jiang's blood relation to Mr. Gu

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
is also genuine.

73
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,520
I suggest this:

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,810
according to Mr. Gu's last wishes,

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,529
whichever of you obtains the Mu family patent

76
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,240
will be the company's heir.

77
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,170
On what grounds?

78
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,400
I am the rightful heir.

79
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,540
Why should I compete with this bitch?

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Miss Gu,

81
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,610
this is the most feasible solution right now.

82
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,080
I agree.

83
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,040
But to be fair,

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
everyone should be at the company

85
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,720
to get things done properly.

86
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,250
I want to work in the office,

87
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,520
and I need to have access

88
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,480
to the company's financial affairs.

89
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,280
No problem.

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,080
You think joining the company

91
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,600
will help you deal with me?

92
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,320
What a delusion.

93
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,880
Why don't these accounts match?

94
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,170
The funds that Gu Xiaomeng managed...

95
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,040
He must have misappropriated these funds.

96
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,700
The money he embezzled

97
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,680
must be connected to Gu Nian.

98
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,060
You think you can take me down with just this?

99
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,920
Jiang Chunyu.

100
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,360
Do you think I'm

101
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,840
that stupid?

102
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,560
I don't know about others.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,680
But Gu Xiaomeng left traces

104
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,560
which wasn't very smart.

105
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Yes.

106
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,760
If he were smart,

107
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,820
how could he take the blame for me?

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,840
It's precisely because

109
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,800
he's the one who did everything publicly,

110
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,040
that I can deny all involvement.

111
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,920
You're truly incorrigible.

112
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,760
Do you think Gu Xiaomeng still feels

113
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,520
the same way about you as before?

114
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,320
After all the cruel things

115
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,880
you did to his child,

116
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,920
do you expect him not to have any resentment?

117
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,200
What do you know?

118
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,400
The things between Xiaomeng and me

119
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,720
are something you'll never understand.

120
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,180
I really don't understand

121
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,000
why Gu Xiaomeng follows you.

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,120
It's such a waste.

123
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,400
But Gu Nian,

124
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,610
let me give you some advice.

125
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,320
You reap what you sow.

126
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,100
Everyone has already abandoned you.

127
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,600
Sooner or later, you'll pay the price

128
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,730
for your arrogance.

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,600
Abandoned?

130
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,520
I think you're the one who's been abandoned.

131
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,120
You caused your own mother's death

132
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,480
and brought doom to your father.

133
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,130
As soon as you showed up,

134
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,880
that old man Gu died too.

135
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,880
You're a walking disaster.

136
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,920
You've been abandoned from the very beginning.

137
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,320
You ruined my face.

138
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,260
I'll make you taste what it's like to have your face destroyed too.

139
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,480
Go ahead.

140
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
There are cameras everywhere here.

141
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,280
If you die,

142
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,440
won't the company be mine?

143
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,300
Do you want this side of your face ruined too?

144
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,560
Jiang Chunyu.

145
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,159
You'll die by my hands sooner or later.

146
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,360
I need to find out quickly

147
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,640
what Gu Nian injected me with

148
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,970
and what it actually is.

149
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,160
I also need to get the Mu family's patent as soon as possible.

150
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,960
However,

151
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,440
I could discuss this with Qiushan.

152
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,840
Sis,

153
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,090
what's going on?

154
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,960
Jiang Chunyu and his team are auditing our accounts.

155
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,220
We have many discrepancies in our books.

156
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,919
Okay, sis.

157
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,360
Don't worry.

158
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,039
I'll raise the money.

159
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,560
Hello?

160
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,720
Mr. Mu,

161
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,640
the sports car owner has agreed to meet.

162
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,880
Please send me the time and place.

163
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,520
Okay.

164
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,560
Hello.

165
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,000
So you're the one who kept asking to meet me,

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,720
right?

167
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,080
Yes.

168
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,480
I'm very interested in your sports car,

169
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,680
but it has too many modifications.

170
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,340
I'd like to know more details.

171
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,640
All the information is here.

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,440
Aerodynamic system optimization,

173
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,560
engine upgrades,

174
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,760
suspension system adjustments,

175
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,080
these are all easy to understand.

176
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,440
If it's easy to understand, what else is there to discuss?

177
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,960
But I don't quite understand the chassis modification.

178
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,280
The modified vehicle

179
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,620
has specific road surface requirements

180
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,100
and poor road conditions can damage the car.

181
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,240
Why modify the chassis?

182
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,080
I just wanted to, so I did.

183
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,880
What brand did you use

184
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,960
for the modification?

185
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,600
Well...

186
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,080
Why are you asking so many questions?

187
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,680
Are you going to buy it or not?

188
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,480
Thanks.

189
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,300
I'll think about it some more.

190
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,360
Xiaomeng.

191
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,620
How's it going?

192
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,880
The buyer is really picky.

193
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,920
Asking a lot of detailed questions.

194
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,250
Seems like they're serious about buying.

195
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,080
Gu Xiaomeng.

196
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,840
Why is he meeting with Gu Xiaomeng?

197
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,640
Judging by their conversation.

198
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,640
This so-called sports car owner

199
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,010
seems more like Gu Xiaomeng's underling.

200
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,650
What's the connection between this sports car and Gu Xiaomeng?

201
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,120
Hello?

202
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,400
Check something for me.

203
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,660
What sports cars are registered under Gu Xiaomeng's name?

204
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,840
Back to earth.

205
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,680
President Mu is certainly a busy person.

206
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,200
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

207
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,000
What is it?

208
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,900
Do you need something from me?

209
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,800
Gu Nian and I...

210
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,720
Whoever gets the Mu Corporation patent first

211
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,360
will inherit the company.

212
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,000
No wonder

213
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,960
you've been waiting for me here.

214
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,800
So you're trying to get

215
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,400
our Mu Corporation patent.

216
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,000
You really are a dangerous woman.

217
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
So, President Mu,

218
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,400
are you willing to give the patent

219
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,120
to this dangerous woman?

220
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,490
You'll have to agree to one condition.

221
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,920
Go ahead.

222
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,360
Do you want my body or my life?

223
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,680
Marry me.

224
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,320
In the future, the Mu Corporation

225
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,580
will be managed by you.

226
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,480
Why?

227
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,240
If it weren't for what happened with my brother and sister-in-law,

228
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,840
I would never have entered the business world.

229
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,930
Because I hate all the scheming and plotting.

230
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,560
I like painting

231
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,760
and art.

232
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,640
If I let you manage the corporation,

233
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
I can continue to pursue my artistic interests.

234
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,680
So you'll enjoy your peaceful life,

235
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,360
while I carry all the burden.

236
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,520
I'm getting the short end of the stick.

237
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,480
Such a bad deal.

238
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,400
Well, I

239
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,170
will make it up to you properly.

240
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,970
How will you compensate me?

241
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,600
That poison Gu Nian mentioned,

242
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,040
can you really handle it?

243
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,520
Don't worry.

244
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,160
I have a doctorate in medicine.

245
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,120
Mu Qiushan,

246
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,650
what exactly is he trying to do?

247
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,720
President Mu,

248
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,720
there are no such vehicles registered under Gu Xiaomeng's name.

249
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,970
He might have registered the car under someone else's name.

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,040
In that case,

251
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,880
we don't have any evidence.

252
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,520
It seems

253
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,680
we need to arrange a meeting to test him.

254
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,480
Why is it you?

255
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,320
What's wrong?

256
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,640
Not happy to see me?

257
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,480
Sis,

258
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,120
the sports car buyer is actually Mu Qiushan.

259
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Mu Qiushan?

260
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes.

261
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,000
Why would he

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,520
buy a used sports car

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,720
and check all its information

264
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,440
and now ask to meet me?

265
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,240
I suspect

266
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,340
he's connected to that accident from back then.

267
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,360
In that case,

268
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
I'll go sound him out first.

269
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,440
I need to

270
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,320
have a good talk with him anyway.

271
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
About the wedding

272
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,440
and the patent issues.

273
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,200
Qiushan,

274
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,460
I have such deep feelings for you.

275
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,620
Why did you break off our engagement?

276
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,680
Is it because my face

277
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,040
has been disfigured?

278
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,200
Gunian,

279
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,240
stop pretending in front of me.

280
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,130
At least you're straightforward.

281
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,320
Fine.

282
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,130
I'll get straight to the point.

283
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,960
You must marry me

284
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,600
and give me the patent.

285
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,500
I've already told you,

286
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,010
that's impossible.

287
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,800
Mu Qiushan.

288
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,680
You have no choice.

289
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,320
I've injected

290
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
Jiang Chunyu

291
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
with a special slow-acting poison.

292
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
No one except me

293
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,560
knows the formula.

294
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,240
Do you want to watch her

295
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,920
grow weaker and weaker?

296
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,200
Until she bleeds from all orifices

297
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,000
and dies?

298
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,440
Then can I make a condition too?

299
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,480
Tell me everything

300
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,480
about Gu Xiaomeng's sports car.

301
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,640
Fine.

302
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,080
Drink this glass of wine

303
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,800
and I'll tell you.

304
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,620
This sports car of Xiaomeng's

305
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,920
was a gift from me ten years ago.

306
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,120
It was the first sports car I ever gave him.

307
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,160
Xiaomeng loved it very much.

308
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,040
He drove it everywhere.

309
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,800
Xiaomeng also had

310
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,320
the car modified.

311
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,960
He made

312
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,840
the sports car

313
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,240
extremely cool.

314
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,240
Xiaomeng,

315
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,880
hurry up,

316
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,940
take the video.

317
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,880
Do we really have to do this, sis?

318
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,920
Come on, hurry up.

319
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,640
Just shoot when I tell you to.

320
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,970
Stop talking nonsense.

321
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,720
Sis, I can't do it.

322
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,680
Gu Xiaomeng,

323
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,800
hurry up.

324
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,960
I don't want to film, sis.

325
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,599
Sis, are you okay?

326
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,640
Quick, go after them!

327
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,040
Qiushan.

328
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,920
Sister,

329
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,120
stop chasing.

330
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,540
Stop chasing, sister.

331
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,200
Qiushan.
