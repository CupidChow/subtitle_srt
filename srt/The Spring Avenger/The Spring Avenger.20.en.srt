1
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,960
How did she get in here?

2
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,560
How dare she hit people here?

3
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,200
Who is this?

4
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,560
Yeah.

5
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,480
You ungrateful wretch!

6
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,800
I carried you for 10 months.

7
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,520
I'm your birth mother who suffered to bring you into this world.

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,400
Even if I deserve no credit, I at least deserve recognition for my hardship.

9
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,480
Now that you've made it big,

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,440
you not only refuse to acknowledge me,

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,440
but you even had people beat me up like this.

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,280
Aren't you afraid of divine retribution?

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,200
I'll kill you!

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,440
This woman is crazy.

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,920
I don't know her at all.

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,860
- Get out.
- Get out.

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,600
Get out.

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,520
Get her out of here quickly!

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,050
Lunatic!

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,200
Let me go!

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,530
I really don't know her.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,360
Then how do you explain this?

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,039
She's not the Gu family's daughter.

24
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,760
How can she be this kind of person?

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,800
She's obviously a prostitute.

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,840
It's all fake.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,800
So hypocritical.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,530
It's fake from start to finish.

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,160
Yeah.

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,120
That's terrifying.

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,960
They're just deceiving us.

32
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,220
How could they do this?

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,320
It's all fake.

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,360
Exactly.

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,200
Quick, take a picture.

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,000
I've liked her for so many years,

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,729
and she turns out to be fake.

38
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,560
What the hell?

39
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,000
Phony.

40
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,289
Congratulations, Miss Gu.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,840
You're about to make

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,770
headlines across all major media.

43
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,520
I've already thought of the headline for you.

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,640
Famous Star Gu on Her Award Day:

45
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Brutally Blacklisted from Entertainment Industry.

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,800
Jiang Chunyu.

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,800
I should have killed you long ago.

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,120
You think this is enough?

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,920
No,

50
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,400
far from it.

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,060
All the pain and despair you've made me suffer for 10 years,

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,400
I'll make you taste every bit of it.

53
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,360
I didn't.

54
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,160
The big star Gu just said

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,640
she wants to kill me.

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,440
It's really scary.

57
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
I didn't say that.

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,160
That's too much.

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,400
Think you're special because you're rich?

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,280
Exactly.

61
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,400
I didn't.

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,680
The award was bought anyway.

63
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,880
When your scandal breaks, you just throw money at people?

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,650
Just quit the industry.

65
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,000
Don't move.

66
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,920
Sis.

67
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:58,840
Sis.

68
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,000
I didn't.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,560
Let's go.

70
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:01,960
Sis.

71
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,620
Blacklist.

72
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,000
I've worked hard for 20 years

73
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,200
and finally made it to the top.

74
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,660
Am I going to be knocked back down to nothing?

75
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
I won't accept it even if it kills me.

76
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Jiang Chunyu.

77
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
You think you've won?

78
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,610
So what if my reputation is ruined?

79
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,160
It's just

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,280
people laughing at me.

81
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,680
I don't care.

82
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,140
I really don't give a damn.

83
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,880
As long as I'm still the Gu family's daughter,

84
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,480
as long as I have money,

85
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
I can make a comeback.

86
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
Don't worry.

87
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,800
I'm not so easily defeated.

88
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,480
Where is she?

89
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,210
Locked in the basement.

90
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,240
Niuniu.

91
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,560
What are you doing?

92
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,400
Why did you lock Mom in here?

93
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,399
Please let me out.

94
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,290
I'm begging you.

95
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,400
Shut your mouth.

96
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,560
Shut up. Shut up.

97
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,820
When you helped Jiang Chunyu against me,

98
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,000
you should have known

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,800
this day would come.

100
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,040
Gu Nian.

101
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,680
I'm still your biological mother.

102
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,320
I was wrong in the past.

103
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,920
Please forgive me.

105
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,800
Forgive me.

106
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,080
From the moment you abandoned me

107
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,280
at the orphanage door,

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,400
you don't deserve to be my mother.

109
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,760
Xiao Meng.

110
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
When dawn breaks,

111
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,680
take her to the mental hospital.

112
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,520
No!

113
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,240
I won't go!

114
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,680
I won't go!

115
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,240
Never to be released.

116
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,120
Understood.

117
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,760
Gu Nian.

118
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,760
Mr. Mu.

119
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,840
Since you miss Miss Jiang so much,

120
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,500
why don't you go up and see her?

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's not time yet.

122
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,760
Go back and rest early.

123
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,020
No staying up late.

124
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,560
Let's go.

125
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,400
Head back.

126
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,120
Yes.

127
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,890
I thought it was just an ordinary anesthetic.

128
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,080
But now,

129
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,680
it's not that simple.

130
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,520
So you mean

131
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,800
to move up the wedding to the day after tomorrow?

132
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,600
That's right.

133
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,480
Since we've already decided to get married,

134
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,440
let's just get it done quickly.

135
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,520
But the day after tomorrow seems too rushed,

136
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,650
there won't be enough time to prepare.

137
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,610
You don't need to worry about that.

138
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,440
I'll take care of everything.

139
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
You just need to

140
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,360
show up on time.

141
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,760
Marriage is a big deal after all.

142
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,370
Let's wait a bit longer.

143
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,720
I can wait,

144
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
but I'm afraid

145
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
someone else can't wait any longer.

146
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
What do you mean?

147
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,260
I've injected Jiang Chunyu with a slow-acting poison.

148
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,320
If you want to save her,

149
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,600
stop wasting time.

150
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,340
It seems I really am poisoned.

151
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,880
But acupuncture

152
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,340
can only temporarily relieve the symptoms.

153
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,800
To completely detoxify,

154
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,420
I must first know the main components of the poison.

155
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,000
Mu Qiushan has agreed

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,600
to marry Gu Nian the day after tomorrow.

157
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,130
What are you planning to do?

158
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,760
It seems

159
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,490
Mu Qiushan already knows about it,

160
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,900
otherwise he wouldn't give in so easily.

161
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,720
Qiushan,

162
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,760
how far are you willing

163
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,600
to sacrifice yourself for me?

164
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,960
What...

165
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,600
what are you doing?

166
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,960
Gu Nian has no regard for the mother-daughter bond

167
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,620
and insists on sending you to a mental hospital.

168
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,320
Don't you want to

169
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,080
teach her a lesson?

170
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,000
Nian.

171
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,600
You look so beautiful today.

172
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,660
You'll definitely captivate Mr. Mu.

173
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,240
Of course.

174
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,080
Hello?

175
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,280
Miss,

176
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,540
the woman locked in the basement is gone.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,960
Where's Xiaomeng?

178
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,760
Tell him to find her immediately.

179
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,320
The young master drank a lot last night.

180
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,850
We don't know where he went.

181
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,040
Nian,

182
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,400
the wedding time is approaching.

183
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,040
You should get your makeup done now.

184
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,970
I'll go find him.

185
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,080
Go ahead.

186
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,040
She's getting married today.

187
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,200
You should give up on her now.

188
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,680
Gu Xiaomeng.

189
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,640
Can you tell me

190
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,000
what exactly you like about her?

191
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,920
She is my sister.

192
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,400
My family.

193
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,280
She is

194
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,080
my

195
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,120
mother.

196
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,040
She is the warmest

197
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,760
presence

198
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,560
in my life.

199
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,480
Warmth.

200
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,440
This word

201
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,680
has nothing to do with Gu Nian.

202
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
She's clearly

203
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,760
a cold-blooded snake.

204
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
When I was little,

205
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,120
no one wanted to play with me.

206
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,960
They all said I was born evil.

207
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,000
Only my sister.

208
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,080
No fighting.

209
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,880
Do you hear me?

210
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,140
Who told you to hit people?

211
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,240
You little brat.

212
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,240
Let me tell you,

213
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,480
if you cause trouble again,

214
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,280
I'll throw you out on the street.

215
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,120
Xiao Meng,

216
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,440
you're so amazing.

217
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,240
You actually beat the director.

218
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,160
Will you protect me from now on?

219
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,600
What about me?

220
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,280
What about our child?

221
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,720
Sis.

222
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,400
If this is what you want,

223
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,200
I hope you get your wish.

224
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,240
Miss Gu Nian,

225
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,480
do you take

226
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,640
Mr. Mu Qiushan as your husband?

227
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,400
For richer or poorer,

228
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,560
in sickness and in health,

229
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,820
to love and to cherish,

230
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,720
till death do you part?

231
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,160
I do.

232
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,200
Good.

233
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,480
May you have a happy marriage.

234
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,560
Mr. Mu Qiushan.

235
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,720
Didn't she just have a major scandal

236
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,000
a few days ago? Why would Mr. Mu want to marry such a woman?

237
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,640
It's just a business marriage.

238
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,680
Only profits matter.

239
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,720
Nothing else is important.

240
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,600
Until the end of life.

241
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,080
I...

242
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,980
He doesn't want to.

243
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Who is this?

244
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,760
Jiang Chunyu.

245
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
What do you want?

246
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
I've already hired an expert hacker

247
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,090
to restore the surveillance video from that day.

248
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,520
This video

249
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,040
can fully prove

250
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
that when I arrived at the hospital,

251
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,800
the old man was already dead.

252
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,600
Don't forget what I told you.

253
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,600
If you dare to leave,

254
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,880
you'll definitely regret it.

255
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,680
Qiushan,

256
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,770
as long as we work together,

257
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,450
there's no difficulty we can't overcome.

258
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,120
Trust me.

259
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,680
Okay?

260
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,480
I'm sorry, everyone,

261
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,960
but today's wedding has been canceled.

262
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,240
Let's go.

263
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,880
Mu Qiushan.

264
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,840
You agreed to this wedding.

265
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
If you dare leave,

266
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,920
I'll kill you.

267
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Good girl.

268
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,160
Since you won't let me live in peace,

269
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,920
let's die together.

270
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,400
Sis!

271
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,540
Sis, watch out!

272
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,800
Die!

273
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,120
I'll burn you to death.

274
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,250
I'll burn you alive.

275
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,400
Let me go!

276
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,250
Let's go.

277
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,120
My face.

278
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,800
My face.

279
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,480
Sis.

280
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,280
Sister.

281
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,680
Sister, calm down.

282
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,920
Calm down.

283
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,890
Sis, my face.

284
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,580
Sister.

285
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,400
Take it easy.

286
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:32,720
Sis.

287
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,520
You'll always be the most beautiful in my heart.

288
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,120
Besides, technology is so advanced now.

289
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,520
Skin grafts are completely undetectable.

290
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,400
Trust me.

291
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,440
It'll be fine.

292
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,800
Xiaomeng.

293
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,120
Can my face be restored?

294
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,840
No problem.

295
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,960
Of course it can.

296
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,440
Really?

297
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,040
Really.

298
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,080
We'll use my skin.

299
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,000
Besides what's on my back,

300
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,440
I have other places we can use.

301
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,240
It's okay.

302
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,360
Don't worry.

303
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,600
It's alright.

304
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,840
Everything will be fine.

305
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,770
Don't be afraid.

306
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,280
It's going to be okay.

307
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,800
I want to slash that bitch Jiang Chunyu's face.

308
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,480
I want her to taste

309
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
what it feels like to be disfigured.

310
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,120
Okay.

311
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,240
I'll help you, sis.

312
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,800
I'll help you.

313
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,480
It's going to be alright.

314
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,160
Everything will be fine.

315
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,880
Since Mr. Gu passed away,

316
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,920
our group has been leaderless,

317
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,240
and our business situation

318
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,000
has become extremely concerning.

319
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,040
So I've gathered everyone here today

320
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,640
for a shareholders' meeting

321
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,920
to discuss

322
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,000
who will be

323
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,180
our next chairman.

324
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,920
But Miss Gu has just been hospitalized after an injury,

325
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
so she probably won't be able to attend.

326
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,360
Who says I can't come?

327
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,160
Thank you all for waiting.

328
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,960
I am

329
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,360
Gu Nian,

330
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,760
As the heir to the Gu Group,

331
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,800
taking on the family business

332
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,660
is naturally my responsibility.

333
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,839
Wait.

334
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,480
I am the true heir

335
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,839
to the Gu Group.
