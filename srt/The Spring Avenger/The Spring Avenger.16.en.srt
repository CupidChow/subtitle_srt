1
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,680
You finally came.

2
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,400
I know your child is seriously ill and needs treatment.

3
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,600
If you're willing to cooperate with me,

4
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,480
I'm willing to cover the medical expenses.

5
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,200
What do you want me to do for you?

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,039
I'm here to apply for the cleaning job.

7
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:09,800
Come with me.

8
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,440
Okay.

9
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,760
I've drawn them all away.

10
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,039
But we need to hurry,

11
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,010
or they might show up at any moment.

12
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,640
What should we do? It won't open.

13
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,240
Liu, you were looking for me?

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,039
No, I wasn't.

15
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,759
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on him?

16
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,160
But that cleaner clearly said...

17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,960
Oh no.

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,490
Do you have any wire?

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,940
Preferably a long one.

20
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,740
Will this work?

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,400
Chunyu.

22
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,920
You even know how to pick locks.

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,850
That's amazing.

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,000
Your child's condition has stabilized quite a bit.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,760
After we complete the mission...

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,040
You can take her away now.

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,720
Go.

28
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,760
Don't run!

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,840
Stop!

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,400
Stop running!

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,320
Freeze!

32
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,160
Don't run!

33
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Stop right there!

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,120
Run!

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,960
How is that possible?

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,040
Unbelievable.

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,490
Detective Wang.

38
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,480
I need you to

39
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,160
look up Jiang Chunyu's parents' information

40
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,960
for me.

41
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,640
Mr. Mu.

42
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,280
Did you find anything?

43
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
Miss Jiang was taken

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
to the Gu family villa yesterday afternoon

45
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,020
and hasn't come out since.

46
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,040
She's probably being held captive.

47
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,960
Gather everyone immediately.

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,920
Come with me to rescue her.

49
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,720
Wait, Mr. Mu.

50
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,160
Miss Jiang

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,360
has already escaped.

52
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,680
When did this happen?

53
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,760
Are you sure?

54
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,480
Yes,

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,800
I've had someone watching the place.

56
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,260
He saw it with his own eyes.

57
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,180
He took a video.

58
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,200
Jiang Chunyu.

59
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,120
You won't even give me

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,450
a chance to be your hero.

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,320
Grandpa.

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,300
I heard Jiang Chunyu ran away.

63
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,250
Don't you know how to knock?

64
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,210
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

65
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,240
I was in a hurry.

66
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,320
Sir.

67
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,160
Jiang Chunyu.

68
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,040
Wait a moment.

69
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,140
Go back to your room first.

70
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,959
Yes, Grandpa.

71
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,440
Continue.

72
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Jiang Chunyu's biological father

73
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,680
has no registered information.

74
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120
Her mother's name was Jiang Shuyun,

75
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,840
who died in an accidental fall 10 years ago.

76
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,520
However,

77
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,200
she had changed her name before.

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,330
Her original name was Jiang Mengting.

79
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,520
So that means

80
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,690
Jiang Chunyu is my own granddaughter.

81
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Although the name and person match,

82
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
we still can't be certain

83
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,940
that Jiang Chunyu is Gu Ming's child.

84
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,440
This matter

85
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,810
must be investigated carefully and thoroughly.

86
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,240
If the old man discovers

87
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,620
that Jiang Chunyu is his granddaughter,

88
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,120
everything I have

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,820
will be taken away from me.

90
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,040
No.

91
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
I won't accept it,

92
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,040
and I absolutely won't allow it.

93
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,200
Only if you die

94
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,280
can this secret be kept forever.

95
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,320
Only then can I forever

96
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,450
remain the young lady of the Gu family.

97
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,080
What happened?

98
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,080
Grandfather,

99
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,960
what's wrong?

100
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,159
Please don't scare me,

101
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,480
Grandfather!

102
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,240
Miss,

103
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
what happened to the master?

104
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,040
I don't know what happened, but Grandfather

105
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,560
fell down the stairs.

106
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,920
Call an ambulance, quickly!

107
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,720
Hello, emergency services?

108
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,690
I've already paid the hospital bills.

109
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,800
This doctor is an authority on heart disease.

110
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,000
Perhaps he can help with her condition.

111
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,610
You should give it a try.

112
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,040
Chunyu,

113
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,520
I know I have no right

114
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,920
to ask for your forgiveness.

115
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,720
All these years,

116
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,320
I've been filled with regret.

117
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,840
I hate my own cowardice,

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,960
aiding the wicked,

119
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,600
doing so many things that hurt you.

120
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,680
I deserve to die.

121
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,920
If regret were useful,

122
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,159
then in this world

123
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,220
there wouldn't be so many tragedies.

124
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,040
It seems I can't go back to the apartment for now.

125
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,520
The Gu family will surely send people to intercept me.

126
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,000
Now the only safe place

127
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,760
is just one location.

128
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,280
Hurry!

129
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,120
Doctor,

130
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,640
please save my grandfather!

131
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,400
He fell down the stairs.

132
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,240
Miss Gu,

133
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,920
please calm down.

134
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,800
Let go first.

135
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,760
You're wasting precious treatment time.

136
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,920
No, doctor.

137
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,920
I need to stay with my grandfather.

138
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,080
If anything happens to my grandfather,

139
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,720
I don't want to live either.

140
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,159
Alright, please calm down,

141
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:36,920
Miss Gu.

142
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,540
What are you doing?

143
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,360
Let go!

144
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,490
Get out of my way!

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,800
Xiaomeng,

146
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,920
what should we do?

147
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,040
Grandfather,

148
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,380
you can't leave us, Grandfather!

149
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,320
Grandfather,

150
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,360
how did you end up like this?

151
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,159
Grandfather!

152
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,240
Save him quickly! Wake up, Grandfather!

153
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,320
Grandfather!

154
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,960
You can't leave us,

155
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,600
Grandfather!

156
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,690
I've been waiting all night

157
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
and you finally came.

158
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,640
How did you know I would come?

159
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,120
You're so smart.

160
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,600
Of course you know

161
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
what's best for yourself right now.

162
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,840
The only one who can fight against the Gu family now

163
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,720
is me.

164
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,720
So will you help me?

165
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,919
Of course.

166
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,480
If you hadn't escaped on your own today,

167
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,700
I would have already led people to fight the Gu family to the death.

168
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,160
Qiushan.

169
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,640
Why are you so good to me?

170
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,200
Aren't you afraid I'm just using you,

171
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,120
deceiving you?

172
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,580
It doesn't matter.

173
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,780
As long as I'm still useful to you,

174
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,290
I can stay by your side forever.

175
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,720
You fool.

176
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,400
Then you

177
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,720
should make it up to me properly.

178
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,410
All of you may leave now.

179
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,040
I'll stay with Grandfather.

180
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,760
Yes.

181
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,000
You should go back too.

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,080
You shouldn't stay up late.

183
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,280
I can keep watch here.

184
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,480
Tell me.

185
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,000
Can the old man be saved?

186
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,260
It would be better if he died tonight.

187
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,120
Doctor.

188
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,480
How is my grandfather?

189
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,760
He's out of danger now.

190
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,320
However,

191
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
he has a broken leg

192
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,480
and suffered a mild stroke.

193
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,880
It might take a long time for him to recover.

194
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,440
That's great news.

195
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,220
Thank you, doctor.

196
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,120
So,

197
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,280
you want me to be your model.

198
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,000
Mu Qiushan.

199
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,120
Why don't you ask me

200
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,580
what really happened in the past?

201
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,280
If you want to tell me,

202
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,900
I'm willing to listen.

203
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,680
It's a long story.

204
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,000
But before that,

205
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,120
I want to show you something.

206
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,320
What?

207
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,640
Your eye...

208
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,080
How is this possible?

209
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,640
This eye of mine

210
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,200
was blind for exactly 10 years.

211
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,420
During these 10 years,

212
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,800
to survive

213
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,760
and to treat my eye,

214
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,720
I collected garbage,

215
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,720
worked as a salesperson,

216
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,770
and even worked as a hospital aide.

217
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,560
I was exhausted every day.

218
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,040
But whenever I closed my eyes,

219
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,640
I...

220
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,080
I would...

221
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,800
I would see my mother

222
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,440
dying right in front of me.

223
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,850
I couldn't sleep all night.

224
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,560
I live only for revenge.

225
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,520
If I can't avenge them,

226
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
I have no reason to live.

227
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,970
Someone like me,

228
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,060
do you still want to love me

229
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,120
and spend your life with me?

230
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,720
Why didn't you go to the police?

231
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,380
Because there's no evidence.

232
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,840
And they were minors at the time.

233
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,080
Even if they were convicted,

234
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,690
nothing much would happen to the Gu siblings.

235
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,960
I need to take revenge in my own way.

236
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,680
Alright.

237
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
I promise to help fulfill your wish,

238
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,560
no matter what it costs.

239
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,880
You're awake.

240
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,300
Did you sleep well?

241
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,120
I slept well.

242
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,530
Haven't slept this well in a long time.

243
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,040
Then

244
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,240
move in with me.

245
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,860
I guarantee you'll sleep this well every night.

246
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,800
Okay.

247
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,520
Got it.

248
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,360
You agreed.

249
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,500
I'm not the one losing out anyway.

250
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,880
Let me be clear.

251
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,780
I won't be paying any rent.

252
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,440
Consider it

253
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,370
payment for being your life model.

254
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,320
Uncle

255
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,360
Ms. Jiang

256
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,180
What are you two doing?

257
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,120
Come here, Weiwei.

258
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,640
Where's Uncle?

259
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,040
He's with Ms. Jiang

260
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,850
having a heart-to-heart talk.

261
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,160
Don't corrupt the child.

262
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,320
Heart-to-heart talk?

263
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,200
That sounds fun.

264
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,240
Can I join you?

265
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,320
Uncle and Ms. Jiang are sharing their true feelings.

266
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,120
Do you know what that means?

267
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,480
I know!

268
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,560
You two are dating, right?

269
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
Mu Weiwei!

270
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,800
Ms. Jiang,

271
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,640
are you going to be my aunt?

272
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,000
Ms. Jiang hasn't agreed yet.

273
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,520
Weiwei,

274
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,840
could you

275
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,080
help your uncle out?

276
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,480
This way

277
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,480
Ms. Jiang can always be with you.

278
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,920
Plus,

279
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,040
we can save on tutor fees.

280
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
You're the CEO of the Mu Group

281
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,420
and you're being so cheap?

282
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,800
You were just talking about true feelings

283
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,400
and now you're trying to take advantage of me.

284
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,730
You're something else.

285
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,680
Ms. Jiang,

286
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,800
Uncle is stingy,

287
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,200
I can give you all my pocket money.

288
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,760
Please don't be mad at him.

289
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,360
Alright.

290
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,800
To reward Weiwei today,

291
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,410
how about I cook something delicious for you?

292
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,440
What about me?

293
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,080
Come on.

294
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,920
What about you?

295
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,320
You can stay by yourself.

296
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,680
You want to save on tutor fees

297
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,960
and now you want to save on a cook too?

298
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,760
Let's go.
