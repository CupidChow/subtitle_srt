1
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,080
Are you really not planning

2
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,480
to move in with me?

3
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,660
When you cancel your engagement.

4
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,180
That's when I'll move in with you.

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,240
Looks like I need to find

6
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,880
a time to talk with Mr. Gu soon.

7
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:11,760
Mr. Mu,

8
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
we have news.

9
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,160
I found that sports car

10
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,690
from back then at a repair shop in the suburbs.

11
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,400
Gu Nian.

12
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,840
Stop looking.

13
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,920
It's just me.

14
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,280
You slept with Mu Qiushan last night.

15
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,520
You really have no shame.

16
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,960
I've always said

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,560
you're just a pretentious bitch.

18
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,640
Why are you here?

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
Jiang Chunyu.

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,610
We've known each other for over ten years.

21
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,680
We were high school classmates.

22
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,200
I'm kindly warning you.

23
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,210
Leave Shangcheng while you still can.

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,919
Otherwise,

25
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,820
you won't be able to leave even if you want to.

26
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,520
My grandfather's methods

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,880
are beyond your imagination.

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,440
You should worry about yourself first.

29
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,720
Your greatest value to the Gu family

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,000
is just for marriage alliance.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,460
If you can't fulfill that,

32
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,280
you'll be thrown out

33
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,720
of the Gu family like trash.

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,480
Trash?

35
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,400
You're the trash!

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,079
You don't even deserve

37
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,120
to stand next to me, you slut!

38
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,960
Gu Nian.

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm warning you.

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't test my patience.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,850
Or one day when I'm tired of playing along,

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,240
we'll both go down together.

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,600
Stop trying to scare me.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,800
If you wanted to kill me,

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,360
you would have done it already.

46
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,520
No need for all this drama.

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,400
Because the blood of someone like you is too dirty.

48
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,570
It's not worth getting on my hands.

49
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,200
After all, my life

50
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,680
was given to me by my beloved mother.

51
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Unlike you,

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,120
who abandoned your own birth mother.

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,040
Shut up!

54
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,360
I said shut up!

55
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,560
Let go.

56
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,440
Or I'll slash that face of yours.

57
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,280
Let go!

58
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,880
Jiang Chunyu.

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,960
You won't be so arrogant for long.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,480
Just wait for your death.

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,120
These two are at loggerheads.

62
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,850
It's still unclear who will win in the end.

63
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,960
I'd better hold my position

64
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,290
and stay out of trouble.

65
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,240
From what she's saying,

66
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,920
it doesn't sound like she's exaggerating.

67
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,740
Could it be that the old man

68
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,400
has already taken action?

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,040
Anyway,

70
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,740
I should discuss this with Mu Qiushan first.

71
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,000
Mr. Mu,

72
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
this is the place.

73
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Let's split up and search.

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,800
Okay.

75
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,340
Please be careful, Mr. Mu.

76
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,490
Don't worry.

77
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,280
I know what I'm doing.

78
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,760
Yes.

79
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,960
Strange.

80
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,220
Why isn't he answering his phone?

81
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,410
I never expected

82
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,440
that old Mr. Gu

83
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,170
would take this marriage alliance so seriously.

84
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,720
I've been outmaneuvered.

85
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,770
But now that we're here,

86
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,520
we can only take it one step at a time.

87
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,520
Why did you ambush me?

88
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Who sent you?

89
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,480
I saw you sneaking in here

90
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,400
and thought you were a thief stealing car parts.

91
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,159
I wanted to teach you a lesson.

92
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,159
Are you the owner of this garage?

93
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,000
Then whose sports car is this?

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,640
What sports car?

95
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,520
I don't know.

96
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,440
Please! Please! Please!

97
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,970
Spare me!

98
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,920
How about

99
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,440
I ask the manager for you?

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,200
It seems to be just a misunderstanding.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,800
I'm a collector of vintage cars.

102
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,720
Although this sports car has been modified,

103
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,600
it still has good collection value.

104
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,280
If the owner is willing to part with it,

105
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,880
I'm willing to pay a premium.

106
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,320
This car

107
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,480
has been parked here for a long time.

108
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,040
Nobody has touched it either.

109
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,760
I thought

110
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,920
it had been scrapped long ago.

111
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,440
I didn't expect

112
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,560
it to be so valuable.

113
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
Old cars like this

114
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,640
are treasures to those who appreciate them.

115
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,720
Otherwise, they're just scrap metal.

116
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,520
Tell you what.

117
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,200
I can pay a deposit first

118
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,400
to show my sincerity.

119
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,960
It's best to contact the owner quickly

120
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,040
to meet with me in person.

121
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,440
The price is negotiable.

122
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,120
Chunyu.

123
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,360
Did something happen?

124
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,280
Don't worry.

125
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,810
Nothing happened to me.

126
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,600
There are just too many scammers nowadays.

127
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,860
Better to be cautious.

128
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,320
That's good.

129
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,520
By the way,

130
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
is that Mr. Mu your boyfriend?

131
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,520
He seems nice.

132
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,000
You know,

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,760
you're not getting any younger.

134
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,160
You should settle down and start a family soon.

135
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,120
Shuyun would

136
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,520
rest in peace

137
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,920
knowing you're settled.

138
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,480
Okay.

139
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,400
Don't worry, auntie.

140
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,080
Auntie,

141
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,560
it's getting late now.

142
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,760
You should head back.

143
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,760
Alright.

144
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Take care.

145
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,280
Bye-bye.

146
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,500
My phone number is on this.

147
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,559
My surname is Lin.

148
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,159
Okay.

149
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,000
Mr. Lin,

150
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,799
our boss will contact you.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,400
Mr. Mu,

152
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,260
how's it going?

153
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,520
Something seems wrong with Chunyu.

154
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,400
I'll go back and check.

155
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,320
Keep an eye on things here.

156
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes.

157
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,480
Where's that damn woman

158
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,680
gone off to now?

159
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,160
Hey.

160
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,000
Hey, Meng.

161
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,880
Someone's offering good money for that car.

162
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,410
Should we just get rid of it?

163
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,960
Who is it?

164
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,200
Surname Lin.

165
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,720
Don't know much about them.

166
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,280
But

167
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,680
they seem pretty loaded.

168
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,060
Let's find out more about them first.

169
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,680
Got it.

170
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Okay, hanging up.

171
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,000
Meng.

172
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,000
Why are you here?

173
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,320
Then I'll...

174
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,360
Don't bother.

175
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,360
I'm not in the mood.

176
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,960
I'm hungry. Go make some food.

177
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,760
Okay.

178
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,000
What's this?

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,680
It's for you.

180
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,540
Consider it payment for the meal.

181
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,280
Meng.

182
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,610
How did you know I wanted

183
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,200
this limited edition bag?

184
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,930
I've had my eye on it for so long.

185
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,600
Thank you.

186
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,380
So you actually have double eyelids.

187
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,680
It's just a bag.

188
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,480
My sister has a whole room full of them

189
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,140
and she's never this excited.

190
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,960
Gu Nian is a big star.

191
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,060
How could I compare myself to her?

192
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,760
Besides.

193
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,400
If she hadn't been adopted by rich people,

194
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,800
she'd be just like me.

195
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,040
What are you mumbling about?

196
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,280
Nothing.

197
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,520
Meng.

198
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,400
Just wait.

199
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,760
I'll definitely cook a great meal today

200
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,960
to treat your stomach.

201
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,560
Alright, alright. Go ahead.

202
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
The old man is causing trouble.

203
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,620
Come back quickly!

204
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,840
I'm not staying for dinner. I have to go.

205
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,880
Meng!

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
Get some water to splash her awake.

207
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,320
Yes.

208
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,880
I've already warned you

209
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,770
not to refuse the easy way and choose the hard way.

210
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,560
Anyone who dares to interfere with the Gu family's affairs

211
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,160
must be punished.

212
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,920
Stop!

213
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,920
If you want to live,

214
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,160
leave Mu Qiushan immediately,

215
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,520
get as far away as possible,

216
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,680
and never come back.

217
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm not the one who should leave.

218
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,260
I'm not the one who should die either.

219
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,120
It's Gu Nian and Gu Xiaomeng.

220
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,720
You insolent girl!

221
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,120
You're asking for death.

222
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,320
Dad.

223
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,440
Unless you beat me to death,

224
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,100
otherwise,

225
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,210
I will definitely marry Mengting.

226
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,880
Sir,

227
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,680
what's wrong?

228
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,160
Let me tell you the truth.

229
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,200
The marriage between Mu Qiushan and Gu Nian

230
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,080
concerns the future of both companies.

231
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,200
No one can stop it.

232
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,240
You should know your place.

233
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,000
No need to hit her anymore.

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,440
Just keep an eye on her.

235
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,400
Yes.

236
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,680
I was too careless.

237
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,520
I underestimated the Gu family's tactics.

238
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,490
I must find a way to escape quickly.

239
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,120
Don't waste your energy.

240
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,560
You won't be able to escape.
