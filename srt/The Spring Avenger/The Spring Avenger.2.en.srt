1
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,880
Didn't anyone tell you

2
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,080
that first place

3
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,720
can only be mine?

4
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,040
Who gave you permission

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
to score two points higher than me?

6
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,640
I won't dare to do it again.

7
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,400
Fangyue.

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,600
Look at her.

9
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,560
Her hair is a mess.

10
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,440
Her face is dirty too.

11
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,480
Help clean her up.

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,260
What are you doing?

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,760
Let go!

14
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:29,880
Come.

15
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:30,770
Are you okay?

16
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,400
Get up.

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,860
Let's go together.

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,920
Grandpa.

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,600
The company will go public in six months.

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Before that,

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,759
the marriage alliance between the Gu and Mu families is imperative.

22
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,490
You need to pay more attention.

23
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,000
I know, Grandpa.

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,280
Jiang Chunyu

25
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,560
Please spare me.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,720
It was Gu Nian and Gu Xiaomeng who forced me back then.

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,000
If I didn't do what they said,

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
they would have beaten me to death.

29
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,320
I begged you all like this back then too.

30
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,880
But not one of you,

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,640
not once,

32
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,840
showed me any mercy.

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,720
Chunyu

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,000
I know I was wrong.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,280
I truly regret what I did.

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,360
As long as you don't kill me,

37
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,280
I'll do anything you want.

38
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,000
Really?

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,500
What if I ask you to betray Gu Nian?

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,520
I heard you have a child,

41
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,840
just 5 years old.

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
Why isn't that bitch Jiang Chunyu dead yet?

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,920
Why is she still alive?

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,920
She even dares to seduce Mu Qiushan.

45
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
She's not worthy.

46
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,880
Sis.

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,420
Don't be like this.

48
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,080
It's not good if people downstairs hear you.

49
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,480
Take your anger out on me.

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,200
It's okay.

51
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,610
I'm here for you.

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,220
It doesn't matter who comes back.

53
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
You're right.

54
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,200
She's just a grasshopper under our feet.

55
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,079
She's just hopped around a bit more.

56
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,370
We'll just step on her a few more times.

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,840
If you want me to let you go

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,480
show me some sincerity.

59
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,760
I have a video of her.

60
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,480
Gu Nian asked me to record it for her back then.

61
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,760
Maybe it can help you.

62
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,560
Xiaomeng.

63
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,080
Will you always stay by my side?

64
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,520
Protect me?

65
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,760
Help me,

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,920
won't you?

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,960
I swear.

68
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,959
But what if

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,880
I marry Mu Qiushan?

70
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Get some rest.

71
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,980
We have a press conference tomorrow.

72
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,640
Gu Nian!

73
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,240
Gu Nian.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,260
Let's go inside first.

75
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,360
I'm terribly sorry

76
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,770
for frightening everyone.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,730
This industry is complicated.

78
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,760
There's a lot of jealousy and sabotage.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,080
But for all of you,

80
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,880
I will keep going.

81
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,880
Stay strong!

82
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,000
We'll always support you!

83
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,800
Gu Nian!

84
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,760
Gu Nian.

85
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,560
No wonder you're doing so well in showbiz.

86
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,020
You're really successful

87
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,800
because your acting is impressive.

88
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,760
Gu Nian!

89
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,360
Please give Miss Gu Nian some time to recover.

90
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,120
Qiushan,

91
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,360
could you come with me to change my clothes?

92
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,880
Alright, let's first look at the information about this show.

93
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,540
Please look at the big screen.

94
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,610
Why is she hitting someone?

95
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,880
Is that really Gu Nian?

96
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,640
Oh my god!

97
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,780
How can she be this kind of person?

98
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,320
When did this happen?

99
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
How could the Gu Nian I admire be such a person?

100
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,000
No, Qiushan.

101
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,040
This isn't me.

102
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,159
This isn't me.

103
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,880
No.

104
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,159
It's not me.

105
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,000
I mean,

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,060
how could she do something like this?

107
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,360
So all of this was just a persona.

108
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,240
It's not me.

109
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,080
Qiushan,

110
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,440
this isn't me.

111
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,880
This really isn't me.

112
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,320
Get out of here.

113
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,200
Get out. Get out. Get out.

114
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,480
It's not me.

115
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,000
Quit.

116
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,960
Leave the industry.

117
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,560
Just quit.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,440
Quit.

119
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,420
Just leave.

120
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,100
Get out.

121
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:20,940
Go away.

122
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,240
Mom.

123
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
I've missed you so much.

124
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,000
Mom.

125
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,880
Mom.

126
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,560
Gu Nian.

127
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,160
All the pain I've endured

128
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,240
I'll make you pay for it all.

129
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,320
Prepare to lose everything

130
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,360
and fall into hell.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Breaking News

132
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,080
Gu Nian, known as the golden girl of the entertainment industry,

133
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,560
was at her new drama press conference

134
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,080
when allegations surfaced that she bullied a female classmate in high school.

135
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,640
The methods were reportedly extremely cruel.

136
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,800
This incident has caused great outrage across society.

137
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,200
People are demanding a public apology from Gu Nian,

138
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,440
otherwise they will boycott all her works

139
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,770
along with the Gu Corporation behind her.

140
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,360
You bastard!

141
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,120
You've caused such a big mess.

142
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,919
If I had known,

143
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,000
I should never have taken you

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,360
from the orphanage.

145
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,919
Don't you dare hit her!

146
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,680
What?

147
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,680
You mad dog, you want to fight me?

148
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,240
Don't forget who raised you.

149
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,240
Grandpa.

150
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,280
This matter

151
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,440
is my fault.

152
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,920
But don't worry,

153
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,730
I can handle the PR quickly.

154
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,000
We'll release a statement saying

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,160
the video was

156
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,210
fabricated to frame me.

157
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,330
Grandpa, please calm down.

158
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,240
Gu Nian.

159
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,600
I brought you both back to the Gu family.

160
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,560
It's just to prove

161
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,020
that my educational philosophy is correct.

162
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,680
You must be the best.

163
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,260
Do you understand?

164
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,960
I understand.

165
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,780
Go explain to Qiushan now.

166
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,860
Yes, Grandfather.

167
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,800
Why are you following me?

168
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,200
Qiushan.

169
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,320
Gunian.

170
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,240
It's so late.

171
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,170
Why are you here?

172
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,960
In the video from today's press conference,

173
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,120
it really wasn't me.

174
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,880
I swear to you.

175
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,080
It's just a small matter.

176
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,200
Nothing serious.

177
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,490
As long as we can solve the problem.

178
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,640
You should

179
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,800
take a shower and change your clothes before going back.

180
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,560
Okay.

181
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,200
Qiushan.

182
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,440
We're not officially engaged yet.

183
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,520
Is this

184
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,120
appropriate?

185
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,810
Indeed, it's not appropriate.

186
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,120
Jiang Chunyu.

187
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,200
Miss Gu,

188
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,700
is this all you've got?

189
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,640
It's really not impressive.

190
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,320
Go to hell!

191
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,640
Gu Nian,

192
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,460
did something happen?

193
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,680
If you dare say one more word,

194
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,900
I'll give all your dirt to Mu Qiushan.

195
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,490
Let's see if he still dares to marry someone like you.

196
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,200
Nothing.

197
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,840
Your tutor was just

198
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,200
bringing me a towel.

199
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,440
How did it go?

200
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
Did he believe it?

201
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,320
I think so.

202
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,080
What did you find out?

203
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,320
I've asked around everywhere.

204
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,050
Only Xie Xiaoqi has this video.

205
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,440
But Xie Xiaoqi and her daughter

206
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,680
have been missing for days.

207
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,740
We can't find them.

208
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,960
It must be Jiang Chunyu's doing again.

209
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,240
That bitch.

210
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,800
Must die.

211
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,650
Anyone my sister doesn't like.

212
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,040
Of course must die.

213
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,720
Mr. Jiang, you play so beautifully.

214
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,920
If you practice diligently,

215
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
you'll play better than me someday.

216
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,960
I don't want to practice.

217
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,320
It's too tiring.

218
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,580
How about this.

219
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,800
If you can learn the second section today,

220
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,080
I'll take you out to play.

221
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,210
How does that sound?

222
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,120
Let's go.

223
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,300
Watch your fingering.

224
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,600
Mr. Mu.

225
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,530
Where is Weiwei?

226
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,560
Isn't she supposed to have violin lessons today?

227
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,480
Miss Jiang took her out.

228
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,420
They went to buy some sheet music.

229
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,960
He really came.

230
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,080
Teacher, what's wrong?

231
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,640
I'm fine.

232
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,000
Weiwei.

233
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,140
The scenery is beautiful.

234
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,920
Let's take a photo together.

235
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,600
Alright.

236
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,370
Let's go.

237
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,840
Bastard!

238
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
Uncle, stop fighting!

239
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,520
Weiwei!

240
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,600
Gu Xiaomeng!

241
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,920
What are you trying to do to Weiwei?

242
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,720
Xiaomeng,

243
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,840
Mu Qiushan is going to be your brother-in-law.

244
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,970
You can't touch him.

245
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,760
Don't be so upset,

246
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,400
Mr. Mu.

247
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,080
I just noticed that this new tutor

248
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,280
is quite attractive.

249
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
I just wanted to have some fun with her.

250
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,080
Get out!

251
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,410
Stay away from them from now on,

252
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,240
or I won't be so polite next time.

253
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,240
Uncle.

254
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,320
Weiwei.

255
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,440
It's okay.

256
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,320
It's alright.

257
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,600
Everything's fine now.
