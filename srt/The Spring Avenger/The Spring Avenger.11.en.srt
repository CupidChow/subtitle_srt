1
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,040
I didn't want to raise him at first.

2
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,840
It was you

3
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,320
who insisted on adopting this little brat.

4
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,250
The fortune teller said

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,960
if we adopted a girl,

6
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,600
it would bring my real granddaughter

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
back to us.

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,610
What you keep in mind

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,330
will eventually come true.

10
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,120
From now on,

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,600
your name will be Gu Nian.

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,720
Okay.

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,720
I, Gu Nian,

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,680
will take good care of you.

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
Good child.

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,080
Let's go.

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,880
Sister! Sister!

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,320
Are you leaving, sister?

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,880
I have my own family now.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,560
This is the candy you gave me.

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,960
I couldn't bear to eat it.

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,880
Grandpa,

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,360
can you take my brother and me with you?

24
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,440
I promise I'll take good care of him

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,880
and won't cause you any trouble.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,360
Hit him! Keep hitting!

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,530
It's not my sister's fault.

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,410
I'm the one who doesn't like Jiang Chunyu.

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,360
Want to teach her a lesson.

30
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,120
Meng,

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
shut up!

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,200
You,

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,840
apologize to Grandfather now.

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,479
Say you'll never do it again.

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,320
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,680
Grandfather.

37
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,120
You raised Meng yourself after all.

38
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,880
You've already hit him.

39
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,160
And punished him too.

40
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,360
Are you really going to let an outsider

41
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,920
ruin years of grandfather-grandson relationship?

42
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,720
Grandfather.

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,360
Grandfather, please.

44
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,240
Grandfather.

45
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,280
Mr. Gu.

46
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,860
Please don't be angry.

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,400
Perhaps young Mr. Gu

48
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,000
has some misunderstanding about me,

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,520
that's why he acted impulsively.

50
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,400
Chunyu is really reasonable.

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,560
About this matter,

52
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,160
I'll definitely give you an explanation.

53
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,320
How much compensation do you want?

54
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,250
Name your price.

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,200
No need.

56
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,079
I'm not badly hurt anyway.

57
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,000
But Young Master Gu,

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,930
his bone seems to be broken.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,260
He needs to go to the hospital right away.

60
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,000
Xiaomeng!

61
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,400
Chunyu!

62
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Not my own flesh and blood after all.

63
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,720
No matter how I try to teach him, he's hopeless.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,640
If only

65
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,760
I could find

66
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,600
my real granddaughter.

67
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,160
Mr. Gu.

68
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,760
I know

69
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,890
a very good private detective agency.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
If you're interested,

71
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,960
I can recommend them to you,

72
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,320
see if they can help.

73
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,120
Over the years,

74
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,680
I've tried many methods.

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,320
They're all scammers.

76
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,560
Completely useless.

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Alright then.

78
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,600
But I can leave you a phone number.

79
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,920
If you need it,

80
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,280
you can contact them anytime.

81
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,079
Fine.

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
You finally came out.

83
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,140
Did you get the short end of the stick?

84
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,200
Someone did suffer.

85
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,160
But it wasn't me.

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,600
That's good.

87
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,690
Let's go.

88
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,180
I'll take you home.

89
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,080
Wait.

90
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,440
I have a question.

91
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,600
What?

92
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,160
Do you still want to continue

93
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,320
with the marriage alliance with the Gu family

94
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,640
and marry Gu Nian?

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,240
Qiushan,

96
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,880
my brother's greatest wish

97
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,720
is to make Mu Corporation the leading enterprise in Shangcheng.

98
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,580
Can you please step up and help me?

99
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,360
It seems Mr. Mu still doesn't understand.

100
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,159
I'm sorry,

101
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,680
I have to go now.

102
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,360
Xiaomeng.

103
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,920
How did you get so badly injured?

104
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,520
The old man was too harsh on you.

105
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,320
Enough.

106
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,320
Stop nagging.

107
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,280
I'm not dead.

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,400
I made chicken soup

109
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,220
simmered for three hours.

110
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,760
Here, try it

111
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,890
and see if it's good.

112
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,440
It's alright.

113
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,560
If it's good, drink more.

114
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
I can do it myself.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,840
Actually,

116
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm a good cook.

117
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,300
If I get married in the future,

118
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,920
I'll definitely make soup for my husband every day

119
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,320
and take good care of him.

120
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,640
You're not...

121
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,020
Xiaomeng, are you hungry?

122
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I bought you a sandwich downstairs.

123
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,159
You're here too?

124
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,520
Bringing food for Xiaomeng?

125
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,240
I made chicken soup for Xiaomeng.

126
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,640
He said it was delicious.

127
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,920
Really?

128
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,400
Well, this sandwich of mine

129
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,760
isn't drinkable at all.

130
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,560
I still prefer sandwiches.

131
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,360
Here, take it.

132
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,200
Look at you,

133
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,440
eating like a child

134
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,400
with food all over your face.

135
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,720
If there's nothing else,

136
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,800
I'll be going now.

137
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,760
What a tasteless fool.

138
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,520
He deserves to be that woman's lapdog for life.

139
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,880
I've spoken with the doctor.

140
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,040
Apart from a minor rib fracture,

141
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,320
everything else is just superficial.

142
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,120
It seems

143
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,360
we don't need to worry too much.

144
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,400
The old man called Jiang Chunyu

145
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,210
trying to downplay the situation.

146
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,130
I don't care what he thinks.

147
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,860
If it weren't for that,

148
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,450
I would have killed her.

149
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,720
Xiaomeng.

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600
I know you're not satisfied,

151
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,850
but now is not the time for confrontation.

152
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,760
I promise you,

153
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,880
once the Gu family's assets

154
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,200
are all in my hands,

155
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,200
you can do whatever you want.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,530
Just listen to your sister.

157
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,360
Mu Qiushan

158
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,240
I've told you already

159
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,320
not to apply to art school.

160
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Why don't you listen?

161
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,920
Brother.

162
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,360
This is my life.

163
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,560
What gives you the right to decide for me?

164
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,640
Because I'm your brother.

165
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,960
Because I raised you

166
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,890
from the age of three all by myself.

167
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,360
Mr. Mu.

168
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,300
How's it going?

169
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,400
Any leads?

170
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,280
Sorry, Mr. Mu,

171
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,000
the car has vanished without a trace.

172
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,530
We can't find anything.

173
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,400
Why are you back?

174
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,900
Where's Xiaomeng?

175
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,280
Grandpa.

176
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,120
Xiaomeng is fine now.

177
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,000
The doctor said

178
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,800
he can be discharged soon.

179
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,840
Oh, Grandpa.

180
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,960
I have good news for you.

181
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,120
An internationally renowned director

182
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,040
is coming to Shangcheng to shoot a film.

183
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,000
He specifically asked for me to be the leading actress.

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,120
And he promised us

185
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,620
that we can place Gu family product placements in the film.

186
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,560
Good.

187
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,240
Well done.

188
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,080
But all this is secondary.

189
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,360
The most important thing

190
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,360
is your marriage with the Mu family.

191
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,520
Yes, Grandpa.

192
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
I understand.

193
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,010
Regarding Qiushan,

194
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
I'll do my best.

195
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,760
Grandpa,

196
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,180
you should rest early.

197
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,560
I'm going to read the script now.

198
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,320
Alright,

199
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,160
go ahead.

200
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,120
Detective Wang?

201
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,640
The great star Gu is going to shoot another film.

202
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,520
You're quite the busy person.

203
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,360
But don't worry.

204
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,680
I'll make sure you're even busier.

205
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,640
Hey.

206
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,680
Weiwei.

207
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,960
I can't come to class today.

208
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,280
Ms. Jiang.

209
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
My uncle...

210
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,640
He's missing.

211
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,640
What happened?

212
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,840
Don't cry.

213
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,160
Tell me slowly.

214
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,040
He was drinking all night.

215
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,320
This morning he was gone.

216
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,400
No one knows where he went.

217
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,320
Don't panic.

218
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,440
Weiwei, think carefully.

219
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
Did your uncle

220
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,460
say anything unusual yesterday?

221
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,360
I think he mentioned

222
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,890
today is the death anniversary of my parents.

223
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,820
I just want to be a painter.

224
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Why do you insist I take over the family business?

225
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,840
Isn't having you at home enough?

226
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,770
How can that be the same?

227
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,360
Now

228
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,690
times have changed.

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,360
Relying on just one person working alone

230
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,480
isn't enough anymore.

231
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,280
The two of us brothers

232
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,520
must work together.

233
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,920
Painting and such

234
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,570
isn't a proper occupation.

235
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,600
Why isn't it proper?

236
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,920
Why is it that whatever you say is always considered proper

237
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,320
and nothing else counts?

238
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,760
Stop the car.

239
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,720
Brother.

240
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,080
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm useless.

242
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,280
I couldn't find who killed you.

243
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,400
But don't worry.

244
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,400
I will fulfill your wish.

245
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,410
I'll make the Mu company bigger and stronger.

246
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,560
[Husband]

247
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,180
The dead cannot come back to life.

248
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,560
The best way to honor them

249
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,560
is to live well yourself.

250
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,120
This truth

251
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,160
I understood ten years ago.

252
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,040
Go ahead and cry if you're hurting.

253
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,400
I won't laugh at you.

254
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,840
I never thought

255
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,570
that the seemingly invincible Mu Qiushan

256
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,320
could be so vulnerable and helpless.

257
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,600
Your fever has gone down.

258
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,100
Did you stay here all night taking care of me?

259
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,000
Weiwei was terrified.

260
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,440
She refused to sleep.

261
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,680
I promised Weiwei I would take good care of you.

262
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,400
Since you're fine now,

263
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,880
I'll be going.

264
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,840
Chunyu.

265
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Mr. Mu,

266
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,520
I have some personal matters to attend to,

267
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,180
so I need to take some time off.

268
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,360
If you're worried about Weiwei falling behind in her studies,

269
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,420
you can hire another teacher for her.

270
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,960
Don't worry about what happened last night.

271
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,880
Just treat it

272
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,330
as if it were all a dream.

273
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,360
The proud Mr. Mu,

274
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,520
after being slept with

275
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,840
and then immediately abandoned,

276
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,280
must be furious.

277
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
But this way,

278
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,960
he won't be able to let me go.

279
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,520
Jiang Chunyu

280
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,319
since you've provoked me

281
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,960
don't think about escaping.

282
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,880
Hello?

283
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Alright, I got it.

284
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,319
Good.

285
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,480
Sis.

286
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,520
Jiang Chunyu has already moved away from her previous place.

287
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,320
It seems that although we didn't kill her last time,

288
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,640
she's still scared.

289
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,570
What about her job at the Mu family?

290
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
She quit that too.

291
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,420
They said she took a leave.

292
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,920
I just feel

293
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,040
things aren't that simple.

294
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,440
But it's fine.

295
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,160
This persistent pest

296
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,240
has finally disappeared for now.

297
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,720
Now I can focus on making my movie with peace of mind.
