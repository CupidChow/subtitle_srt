1
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,800
Meng.

2
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,840
Meng.

3
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,880
Hang in there.

4
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,920
We'll go to the hospital right away.

5
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,800
Right now.

6
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,120
I got the patent.

7
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,680
Let's go to the villa for my sister first.

8
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,600
At a time like this,

9
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
why do you still care about her business?

10
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,730
If you won't take me,

11
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,039
I'll go by myself.

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,039
Fine.

13
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
Whatever you say.

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,720
After we give her the stuff,

15
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,720
we'll go straight to the hospital for a checkup, okay?

16
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,259
Where's the stuff?

17
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,280
Finally got the upper hand.

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,080
Jiang Chunyu,

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,280
let's see how you can fight me now.

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,200
Xiaomeng!

21
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,000
Xiaomeng, what's wrong?

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,960
Xiaomeng,

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,080
what's wrong?

24
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,960
What's wrong with Xiaomeng?

25
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,440
He just had a car accident.

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,760
Xiaomeng must have internal injuries.

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,759
What are you waiting for?

28
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,199
Get him to the hospital now!

29
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,840
Sis.

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,200
What you wanted,

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,600
I've given you.

32
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,280
No!

33
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,160
Xiaomeng!

34
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
Xiaomeng!

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,920
Xiaomeng!

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
Didn't you promise me

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,120
that you wouldn't leave me?

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,320
Didn't you promise your sister

39
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,079
that you'd protect me forever?

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,500
I can only accompany you this far.

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
Fangyue.

42
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,560
Fangyue.

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,640
I'm here.

44
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,280
Xiaomeng.

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,280
Xiaomeng.

46
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,880
Gu Nian.

47
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,970
It's all your fault.

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,040
It's all your fault, you bitch.

49
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,480
You not only killed my child.

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,280
You also got Xiaomeng killed.

51
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,160
Why wasn't it you who died?

52
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,140
You're the one who should die.

53
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,200
Why don't you just die?

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
Go to hell.

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,640
Gu Xiaomeng.

56
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,120
Didn't I tell you long ago

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,720
to leave this bitch sooner?

58
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,240
But you wouldn't listen to me.

59
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,720
You deserve it.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,240
You deserve it.

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,480
Xiaomeng

62
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,840
Xiaomeng

63
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,560
Xiaomeng

64
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,520
Xiaomeng

65
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,120
Xiaomeng

66
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,440
Now I'm the only one left.

67
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,280
Miss.

68
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,080
The company called to say

69
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,000
today is the shareholders' meeting.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,760
They're asking if

71
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,820
you plan to attend.

72
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,960
Tell them

73
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,120
I'll be there on time.

74
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,680
Since we've come this far,

75
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,720
no matter what,

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,200
I will never admit defeat.

77
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,880
Are you sure you don't need me to accompany you?

78
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,080
Gu Xiaomeng is dead.

79
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,720
I'm afraid Gu Nian might become desperate.

80
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,720
Really, there's no need.

81
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,760
Today is the final showdown between Gu Nian and me.

82
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,600
I want to face it alone.

83
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,320
It's time.

84
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,770
Shouldn't we start now?

85
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,440
10 minutes after the meeting starts,

86
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,880
if someone hasn't shown up,

87
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,760
they'll be considered to have forfeited their inheritance rights.

88
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,000
Miss Gu is probably busy with funeral arrangements

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,920
and won't be coming.

90
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,280
Who says I'm not coming?

91
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,320
This contains the Mu family's patented core technology.

92
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,840
From today on,

93
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,600
it belongs to our Gu Corporation.

94
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,000
Miss Gu,

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,640
do you have the authorized transfer documents?

96
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,760
If not,

97
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,340
this doesn't seem proper.

98
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,520
Indeed,

99
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,159
this really isn't following protocol.

100
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes, exactly.

101
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,320
This truly isn't proper procedure.

102
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,680
That's right,

103
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,340
authorized transfer documents are mandatory.

104
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,520
When you worked with my grandfather

105
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,040
back then,

106
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,360
were you this timid as well?

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,600
The agreed condition was to obtain the patent.

108
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,880
As for how we get there,

109
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,240
it doesn't matter.

110
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,800
Jiang Chunyu.

111
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,120
What are you laughing at?

112
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,200
Miss Gu truly lives up to her acting background.

113
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,640
Taking a stolen fake patent

114
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
and daring to submit it to the board.

115
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,440
And still acting so righteous

116
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,560
that one can't help but admire your nerve.

117
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,880
What makes you say my patent is fake?

118
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,640
Because

119
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,540
the real one is with me.

120
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,200
But unlike you...

121
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,679
I have Mu Qiushan's

122
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,120
personally signed authorization transfer document.

123
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,450
It's completely legal.

124
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,320
Miss Gu,

125
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,330
you're not taking us shareholders seriously at all.

126
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,720
So you and that bitch Fang Yue

127
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,020
are working together.

128
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,000
Miss Gu,

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,760
something terrible has happened!

130
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,120
There are many police officers downstairs.

131
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,280
They said there are several cases

132
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,760
that need your cooperation at the police station.

133
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,560
[Police]

134
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Why panic?

135
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,280
It's just an investigation.

136
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,680
I'll be back soon.

137
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,000
Wait.

138
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,400
To prevent Miss Gu from suddenly disappearing,

139
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,060
I'll have someone follow you,

140
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,420
and protect your safety at the same time.

141
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,160
Wait a second.

142
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,100
I need to use the restroom.

143
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,120
Well...

144
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,480
What?

145
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,840
You're really treating me like a criminal.

146
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,440
Who knows who'll be running this company in the future.

147
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,800
It's not decided yet.

148
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,600
Why are you here?

149
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,050
Where's Gu Nian?

150
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,850
She went to the restroom and hasn't come back yet.

151
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
It's so cold today.

152
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,280
I think it's going to snow heavily.

153
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,040
When that happens,

154
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,240
I want to build a snowman with Mr. Jiang.

155
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,680
How's it going?

156
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,680
Any news?

157
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,440
The nanny said it happened too suddenly.

158
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,200
She couldn't see who attacked them.

159
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,260
Seems the kidnappers came prepared.

160
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,480
I suspect this

161
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,560
has something to do with Gu Nian.

162
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,690
It was her after all.

163
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,480
I'll go stall her.

164
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,610
You call the police.

165
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,440
No way.

166
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,520
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

167
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,120
Weiwei could be in danger at any moment.

168
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,450
We can't take that risk.

169
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,920
Besides, Gu Nian and I

170
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,450
need to settle things once and for all.

171
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,720
Stop it!

172
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Don't hit my mom!

173
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,360
Mom!

174
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,680
Weiwei!

175
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,600
Weiwei!

176
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,560
Jiang Chunyu.

177
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,200
You finally came.

178
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,280
Let Weiwei go.

179
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,240
If you have a problem, come at me.

180
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,080
Fine.

181
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,400
Jump from here.

182
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,290
I'll release her immediately.

183
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,460
Do you still think I'm stupid?

184
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,050
Do you think I'd still believe you?

185
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,320
If you don't jump,

186
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,160
I'll kill her right away.

187
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,320
Fine.

188
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,480
I promise you.

189
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,010
Don't be afraid.

190
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,640
Jump now!

191
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,960
You always talk such a good game.

192
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,920
Why are you such a coward

193
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,620
when death is staring you in the face?

194
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,200
Even if I die today,

195
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,080
you won't escape.

196
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,010
The police are on their way.

197
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,200
Jiang Chunyu.

198
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,480
I came here today

199
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,760
with no intention of leaving alive.

200
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,840
But you

201
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,920
must die before me.

202
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,440
Why are you so lucky?

203
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,200
Born with a silver spoon.

204
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,880
Having a loving family.

205
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,040
And Mu Qiushan who loves you so much.

206
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,000
But I

207
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,680
have been living in the mud since childhood.

208
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,920
No matter how hard I try,

209
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,440
there's always an invisible hand

210
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,440
pulling me back down.

211
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,080
Why is life so unfair?

212
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Don't blame everything

213
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,240
on fate.

214
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,600
Everything that happened

215
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,760
is the consequence of your own actions.

216
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,800
My mother,

217
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,560
Old Mr. Gu,

218
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,960
they all died by your hand.

219
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,200
It's too late for words now.

220
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,000
If ten years ago,

221
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,680
when you first met me,

222
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,540
you hadn't harbored such evil thoughts,

223
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,820
perhaps things would have turned out differently.

224
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,080
I have nowhere to go now.

225
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,840
Jiang Chunyu.

226
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,520
Let's die together.

227
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,720
Vivi, stay back!

228
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,680
Are you crazy?

229
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,600
Chunyu.

230
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,080
Chunyu.

231
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,120
Qiushan.

232
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,250
I've finally avenged my mother

233
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,520
and my grandfather.

234
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,200
It's all over now.

235
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,360
We can go back to our normal lives.

236
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,880
Thank you.

237
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,520
Mr. Jiang.

238
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,960
Thank you and Mr. Mu

239
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,840
for everything you've done for the children.

240
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,960
You're truly a loving couple.

241
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,260
It's what we should do.

242
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,120
Chunshan Children's Home

243
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,080
is officially established.

244
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,760
That's wonderful!

245
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
So great!

246
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,920
Let's go in and take a look.

247
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,980
Please, after you.

248
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:21,920
Come.

249
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,720
Mu Qiushan.

250
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,400
You're painting so enthusiastically by yourself.

251
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,120
It seems that I, as your model,

252
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,610
am falling out of favor.

253
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,760
Chunyu.

254
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,240
Your every expression

255
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,320
is etched in my memory.

256
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,160
I could paint you for a lifetime.
