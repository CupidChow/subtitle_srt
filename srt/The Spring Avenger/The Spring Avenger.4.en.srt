1
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,720
Mr. Mu doesn't want to hear nonsense.

2
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,200
Then what does he want to hear?

3
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,160
Sweet talk?

4
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,220
What are you two doing?

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,519
Miss Gu.

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,160
Mr. Mu and I

7
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,220
were just talking.

8
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,320
Please don't

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,200
misunderstand.

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Why so nervous?

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,280
Did I say anything about you two?

12
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,240
Qiushan.

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,400
I trust your judgment.

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,850
He definitely won't get involved with

15
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,600
such a messy woman.

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,289
It's not worth getting entangled.

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,400
Mr. Jiang.

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,450
You can go ahead with your work.

19
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,960
What brings you here?

20
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,200
Isn't Weiwei's birthday coming up?

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,800
I specially picked out a gift

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,140
and wanted to give it to her early.

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
Weiwei is upstairs.

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,860
You can go up first.

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,600
Hello?

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,360
Mr. Mu.

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,400
I've checked all the car dealerships in Shangcheng.

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,520
No leads related to that accident from years ago.

29
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,040
Expand the search area.

30
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,000
No matter what it costs,

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,400
we must find the person responsible.

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,130
Understood.

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,079
Weiwei.

34
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,680
I bought you a birthday present.

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,820
Take a look. Do you like it?

36
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,120
How is it?

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,600
Isn't it beautiful?

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,320
- I hate it!
- I hate it!

39
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,850
All dolls can go to hell!

40
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,240
What are you doing?

41
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,040
Weiwei!

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,400
Weiwei!

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,120
Stop this nonsense.

44
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,320
Apologize to Mrs. Gu.

45
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,720
No!

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,200
I hate her!

47
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,560
I hate you too!

48
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,360
If my parents were still alive,

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,040
they would never treat me like this!

50
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,320
Weiwei!

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
What are you laughing at?

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,400
Weiwei.

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,000
Weiwei.

54
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,680
Stop fooling around.

55
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,480
Open the door.

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
No, no.

57
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,320
Uncle always says no.

58
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,160
Go away.

59
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,200
I don't want you.

60
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,520
I want Ms. Jiang.

61
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:33,880
All right.

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,320
I'll go get her.

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,200
Vivi was traumatized as a child.

64
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,079
She gets triggered whenever she sees dolls.

65
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,000
Gu Nian.

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,040
Before you try to butter someone up,

67
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,120
couldn't you check what they're sensitive about?

68
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,440
Now you've ended up shooting yourself in the foot.

69
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Isn't that funny?

70
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,800
Nonsense.

71
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,820
There's no such weird condition.

72
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,400
You must be scheming behind my back again,

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,930
trying to ruin my relationship with Qiushan.

74
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,760
How dare you fight back.

75
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,480
What are you trying to do?

76
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,240
Gu Nian.

77
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,200
You think I'm still

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,460
the same Jiang Chunyu from ten years ago?

79
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,240
For all the evil you've done to me over these years,

80
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,000
I will make you pay for each and every one of them.

81
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,260
You wouldn't dare.

82
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,880
There are cameras everywhere.

83
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,880
And Qiushan will be back any minute.

84
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,440
If you lay a finger on me,

85
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,200
I will

86
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,040
make you pay

87
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,720
a thousand times over.

88
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,480
Fine.

89
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,240
I have nothing to lose.

90
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
I have nothing.

91
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,840
Do whatever you want.

92
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,080
But you, Gu Nian, are different.

93
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,280
You're a wealthy heiress.

94
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,720
And a big celebrity.

95
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,360
With a handsome and rich fiancé.

96
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,200
What would happen if you

97
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,520
lost all of that?

98
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,320
Jiang Chunyu.

99
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,200
You think this is enough

100
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,840
to threaten me?

101
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,560
Unless you kill me right here and now.

102
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,000
Otherwise,

103
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,920
I could crush you back then.

104
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,760
And I can do it now too.

105
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,880
Is that so?

106
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,760
Well, in that case...

107
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,560
Miss Gu,

108
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,800
would you like some fruit?

109
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,730
It's very sweet.

110
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,160
Thank you.

111
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,280
Qiushan,

112
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
I have something to take care of.

113
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,159
I'll head back first.

114
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,200
Tell Weiwei

115
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,440
on her actual birthday,

116
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,450
I'll give her another gift.

117
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,200
Alright, go ahead.

118
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,280
Mr. Mu.

119
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,520
Where's Weiwei?

120
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,840
She locked herself in the storage room

121
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,760
and refuses to come out.

122
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,720
Don't worry.

123
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,930
I'll go check on her.

124
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,480
Sis.

125
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,810
Why are you back so early today?

126
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,040
You're hurt.

127
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,120
Who did this?

128
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,800
Jiang Chunyu?

129
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,160
I'll chop her hands off!

130
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,640
Wait.

131
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,880
Let's go back and talk about it later.

132
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,320
I'm arranging a live interview tomorrow.

133
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,370
Don't let her find a chance to sabotage it.

134
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,120
No more crying, okay?

135
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,840
Uncle only cares about his company and stocks.

136
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,570
He doesn't care about me at all.

137
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Your uncle actually loves you very much.

138
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,840
You'll understand when you grow up.

139
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,920
Having family by your side

140
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,400
is such a precious and fortunate thing.

141
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,880
Mr. Mu.

142
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,730
Where's Weiwei?

143
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,800
She's asleep.

144
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,720
Ms. Jiang.

145
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,760
You're being quite bold, aren't you?

146
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,760
What?

147
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,000
Mr. Mu wants to fire me.

148
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,560
People who don't follow the rules

149
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,720
I cannot tolerate.

150
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,600
Mr. Mu, you're so cold-hearted.

151
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,480
I worked until midnight,

152
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,540
only had half a glass of your wine,

153
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,100
and didn't even get overtime pay.

154
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,200
Jiang Chunyu.

155
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,159
What exactly do you want from me?

156
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,000
Didn't I tell you before?

157
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,840
I want...

158
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,240
You.

159
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,610
But unfortunately,

160
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,040
Mr. Mu is already taken.

161
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,940
I won't be the other woman.

162
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,600
Welcome to today's live interview.

163
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,640
Today we have invited the actress Ms. Gu Nian,

164
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,520
who has recently been caught in a bullying controversy.

165
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm sure she has a lot to say

166
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,200
to the fans who have been supporting her all along.

167
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,400
I don't know who I've offended.

168
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,780
Someone has fabricated videos to defame me.

169
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,440
Please believe me.

170
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,240
I would never do those terrible things.

171
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,600
Indeed.

172
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,160
Those who spread rumors are truly despicable.

173
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,000
So to help everyone better understand

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,400
the truth of this matter,

175
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,200
we have invited

176
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,920
Gu Nian's high school classmates and homeroom teacher.

177
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,200
Let's hear

178
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,360
what they have to say about Gu Nian.

179
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,600
Gu Nian was always very kind to her classmates.

180
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
especially those

181
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
from disadvantaged families.

182
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,450
Everyone really liked her.

183
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,600
Mr. Wei.

184
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,240
I heard that student Gu Nian

185
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,400
has excellent academic performance at school,

186
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,200
is that right?

187
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,320
This child Gu Nian

188
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,720
is very humble.

189
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,010
Although her family is very well-off,

190
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,120
she's still hardworking and studious.

191
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,650
She has consistently maintained the top position in her grade.

192
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,680
Teacher.

193
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,960
I'm clearly the one who ranked first.

194
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,220
Why is it Gu Nian's name

195
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,360
on the honor roll?

196
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,360
Jiang Chunyu.

197
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,180
Don't make trouble for no reason.

198
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,280
You should know your place

199
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,340
and what kind of family you come from.

200
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,240
Your mother just sells pancakes for a living.

201
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,360
Being in the top ten of your grade

202
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,280
is already a stroke of luck for you.

203
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,480
Don't be ungrateful.

204
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,860
What's wrong with selling pancakes?

205
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,040
Does a pancake seller's daughter

206
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,720
not deserve to ask for fairness?

207
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,960
You're a teacher

208
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,160
yet you help students cheat.

209
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,090
I'm going to report you to the school leadership.

210
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,880
Do you know what kind of school this is?

211
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,210
Old Mr. Gu is a board member of this school.

212
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,240
The annual donation he gives to the school

213
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
is more than your mother could earn selling pancakes for ten lifetimes.

214
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,280
Even the principal doesn't dare to offend him.

215
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,720
Who do you think you are?

216
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,880
Then I'll report to higher authorities.

217
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't believe

218
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,600
I can't get a fair chance.

219
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,640
How dare you!

220
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,570
Reporting to higher authorities?

221
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,400
You ungrateful little brat!

222
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,840
Run ten laps around the playground.

223
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,970
Make it thirty laps!

224
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,360
You're not going home until you finish.

225
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,520
Go! What are you standing there for?
