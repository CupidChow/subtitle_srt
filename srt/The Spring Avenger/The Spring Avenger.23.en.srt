1
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,920
Why didn't you use the door?

2
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,760
Climbing through windows is dangerous.

3
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,560
If we're putting on an act, we should go all the way.

4
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,560
So we don't waste

5
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,080
Mr. Mu's good intentions.

6
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,519
But tell me,

7
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,650
did they believe it?

8
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,039
You said

9
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,960
it was an award-winning performance.

10
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,490
They must have believed it.

11
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:17,840
Tell me.

12
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,770
What exactly happened?

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,610
It was all arranged by Gu Xiaomeng.

14
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,600
He must have found out

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,280
that I'm investigating the truth about that accident.

16
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,880
Guilty conscience, I guess.

17
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,000
I figured as much.

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,560
That's why I'm pretending to be paralyzed,

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,220
to make them lower their guard

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,440
while I search for evidence.

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,400
But it's been so many years.

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,680
It might be difficult to find anything.

23
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,080
The Gu siblings have always been arrogant.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,000
They wouldn't have covered their tracks completely.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,060
There must be some clues left behind.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,160
I believe

27
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,920
the spirits of my brother and sister-in-law

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,250
will surely protect me.

29
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,240
So you've learned to use your charm now.

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,320
Yes.

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,120
After all my sacrifices,

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,400
how do you plan to make it up to me?

33
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,960
Sis.

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,500
Are you really bringing Mu Qiushan over?

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,840
What's wrong?

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,840
Are you upset?

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,040
No,

38
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,440
I just think there's more to him.

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,360
His leg injury might be fake.

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,300
It's precisely because he's not that simple

41
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,560
that we need to keep him where we can watch him.

42
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,200
That's a good idea.

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,560
Find a way to get

44
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,290
the patent as soon as possible.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,440
After you arrive at the Gu family,

46
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,570
you must be careful.

47
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,320
Gu Nian isn't stupid,

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,880
she won't be easy to deal with.

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,720
Don't worry.

50
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,920
If you don't enter the tiger's den,

51
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,000
how can you catch the cubs?

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,280
At least you're still working behind the scenes.

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,360
We'll coordinate from inside and outside,

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
and stay in touch.

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
I'm leaving then.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
Be careful.

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,410
This is really nice.

58
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,410
Thank you for your trouble.

59
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,170
No need to be polite.

60
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
We'll be family soon.

61
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,079
Xiaomeng,

62
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,400
hurry up and pour tea for your brother-in-law.

63
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,720
Qiushan,

64
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,680
are you okay?

65
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,000
Are you hurt?

66
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,320
It's fine.

67
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,520
Luckily they're just useless legs.

68
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,320
Xiaomeng,

69
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,920
what's wrong with you?

70
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,320
You can't even pour water properly.

71
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,240
Apologize to your brother-in-law right now.

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,040
Ever since Mu Qiushan came to the Gu family,

73
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,079
my sister has been giving me the cold shoulder

74
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
and treating me with contempt.

75
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,760
You can't stand the sight of me, right?

76
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,560
I'm leaving.

77
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,920
You.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
Qiushan.

79
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,580
Don't be angry with Xiaomeng.

80
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,560
He just has a strange temper.

81
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,200
I'll go talk to him.

82
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,520
Okay.

83
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,020
It seems Mu Qiushan's legs

84
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,610
are truly crippled.

85
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,040
His legs are ruined.

86
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,680
My heart isn't dead yet.

87
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,840
How dare you lie to me.

88
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,600
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

89
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,280
What are you planning to do, sis?

90
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,480
Isn't Mu Qiushan investigating the sports car incident?

91
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,800
He'll never find any evidence.

92
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,920
At this moment

93
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,240
we can take the opportunity.

94
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,440
Oh no.

95
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,840
Oh no, sis.

96
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,240
Mu Qiushan seems to have discovered

97
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,440
that the car was mine.

98
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,120
This is all your fault.

99
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,240
Go after him now!

100
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,580
When you catch him,

101
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,159
break his legs.

102
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,520
We've already bought the wheelchair,

103
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,000
might as well put it to use.

104
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
Get in the car.

105
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,080
Hurry!

106
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,120
Stop!

107
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Stop right there!

108
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,120
Nian.

109
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,760
Xiaomeng is so capable,

110
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
he'll definitely catch Mu Qiushan.

111
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,920
Don't be angry.

112
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,800
Even if we don't catch him,

113
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,120
I have other ways.

114
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,480
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,680
He got away.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,960
It's okay.

117
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,880
Fang Yue has

118
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,320
already found where the patent documents are hidden.

119
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,520
While Mu Qiushan

120
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,840
and Jiang Chunyu are still figuring things out,

121
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,960
let's go get those documents back first.

122
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,880
Get them back.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Of course.

124
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,240
Why do you think the old man

125
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,400
is so obsessed with this marriage alliance?

126
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,920
It's not just because the Mu family has patents,

127
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
but also because

128
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,680
they have a mature R&D team.

129
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,440
And a tech production line.

130
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,640
But

131
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,120
having patents alone

132
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
is useless.

133
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,800
Of course it's useful.

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,930
Once we have the patent documents,

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,720
we can set up our own R&D and production team,

136
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,880
and it'll work just the same.

137
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,280
What do you think those old guys on the board

138
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,200
really want?

139
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,120
Isn't this exactly what they're after?

140
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,920
Meng,

141
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,800
thank you for your hard work today.

142
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,880
As for this matter,

143
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,540
I'll handle it myself.

144
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:42,760
Meng.

145
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,890
Where are you going?

146
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,890
Of course he's stealing the patent documents for me.

147
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,040
Otherwise, for something so dangerous,

148
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,960
would he let me go?

149
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,020
Even if Mu Qiushan isn't home,

150
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,620
there should still be a housekeeper.

151
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,040
Why is it so quiet?

152
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,160
A trap.

153
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,460
I only have one chance.

154
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,220
Whether it's a trap or not,

155
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,200
I must get that patent.

156
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
Your trick of drawing the snake out of its hole

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,120
really works well.

158
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,520
Luring Gu Nian to steal patents from the Mu family.

159
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,330
She won't fall for it, will she?

160
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,860
Even a cornered dog will leap over a wall.

161
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,280
She's left with nothing now.

162
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,400
If there's even a 1% chance,

163
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,880
she'll take it.

164
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,760
Cut the crap.

165
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,530
If you've got the guts, take me to the police station.

166
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,560
Taking you to the police station

167
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,420
would be letting you off too easy.

168
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
Ten years ago,

169
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
when you were driving that modified sports car,

170
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,080
did you hit someone?

171
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Don't worry.

172
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,120
Jiang Chunyu won't get away.

173
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,560
Brother.

174
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,560
Brother.

175
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,200
Brother.

176
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,680
Brother.

177
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,520
Yes, I have.

178
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,880
I've bumped into many people.

179
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,440
Which one are you talking about?

180
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,880
Let me see if I remember.

181
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,440
You beast!

182
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,320
Qiushan!

183
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,760
Hit me!

184
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,730
Beat me to death!

185
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,400
Will that bring your brother and sister-in-law back to life?
