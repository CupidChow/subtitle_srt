1
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,727
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

2
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,318
Did you really

3
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,487
ring my Love Alarm?

4
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,125
When I got your call,
I thought something happened.

5
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,544
Were you worried?

6
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,338
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,307
Hye-yeong.

8
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,393
This is nice.

9
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,979
Nicer than I expected.

10
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,232
You know about who likes who,

11
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,277
and things like that.

12
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,488
So…

13
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,408
tell me.

14
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:41,870
Who…

15
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,622
do I like right now?

16
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:32,754
THE RINGING WORLD BY ??
THE GRAVE OF THE RINGING WORLD

17
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,027
Is there a reason it's 23?

18
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,573
You knew I wouldn't die there.

19
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,120
I didn't run away because I was scared.
It is exactly like you predicted.

20
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,332
It seems life
hasn't been easy for you lately.

21
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,960
Do you want my help?

22
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,714
THE GRAVE OF THE RINGING WORLD

23
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,215
YOU KNEW I WOULDN'T DIE THERE

24
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,092
I DIDN'T RUN AWAY BECAUSE I WAS SCARED

25
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,928
Why do you

26
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,639
never answer me?

27
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,227
IT SEEMS LIKE
LIFE HASN'T BEEN EASY FOR YOU LATELY

28
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,186
DO YOU WANT MY HELP?

29
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,563
WHY DO YOU NEVER ANSWER ME?

30
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,032
It's her, Jojo.

31
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,581
Did you make it to school?

32
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,751
I dozed off and almost missed my stop.

33
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,961
I'll pick you up after work.

34
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,339
Call me if anything comes up.

35
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,262
Let's not run away.

36
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,185
Isn't that Kim Jojo?

37
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,567
Is that Kim Jojo? Hwang Sun-oh's mistress?

38
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,914
Don't worry. Most of the videos are down.

39
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:55,915
Okay.

40
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,084
Did things not go well yesterday?

41
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,503
It went fine.

42
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,589
Really? Then do you not have to find
Chon Duk-gu anymore?

43
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,091
Yes.

44
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,011
Something's off.

45
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,013
What is?

46
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,226
Shouldn't you be excited
if you completed your mission?

47
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,524
It must not have hit me yet.

48
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,661
JEJU ISLAND SAEOREUM MARATHON

49
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,544
UNINSTALL SHIELD
RUN IN THE JEJU MARATHON

50
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,468
There was an unusual activity
in Kim Jojo's Love Alarm.

51
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,137
At 5:40 a.m. today,

52
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,265
an unauthorized code was installed
on Kim Jojo's Love Alarm,

53
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,767
and rang Lee Hye-yeong's Love Alarm.

54
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,280
"The woman is the radio host K,
who endorses H in the election.

55
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,993
B obtained a copy of their Love Alarm logs
indicating the times and places

56
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,912
they rang each other's Love Alarm."

57
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,706
They got the logs?

58
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,085
Maybe they really do collect them.

59
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,003
Watch it.

60
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,172
You saw the press release.

61
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,133
It's company policy
to expunge them automatically.

62
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:34,180
True. People would freak out
about their privacy being breached.

63
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,598
They wouldn't store it.

64
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,183
How would we know?

65
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,560
We just have to assume they don't.

66
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,021
CANDIDATE H AND RADIO HOST K
ARE HAVING AN AFFAIR

67
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,673
I felt like you should know.

68
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,384
It may be all over the news soon.

69
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:16,222
CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF THE MARRIAGE
BETWEEN ACTOR J AND CANDIDATE H IS ROCKY

70
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,326
Hey, Sun-oh.

71
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,997
About the TV show today…

72
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,457
I know you don't like it,
but "a happy family"

73
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,334
is good for winning votes.

74
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,378
But…

75
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,673
I wonder if we can cover this up.
We have to.

76
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,306
You'll go, right?

77
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,479
I should go.

78
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,319
They took down the videos
because I said I'd go.

79
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,446
That's right.

80
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,595
That's her, right?

81
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,679
It is.

82
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,014
She's so pretty.

83
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,058
-Right?
-Right?

84
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,438
She just looked at me, right?

85
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,648
No, she looked at me.

86
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,402
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

87
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,372
Gul-mi,

88
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,626
is it your eyes, nose, or lips?

89
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,755
What is causing you this nuisance?

90
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,308
Hey, cutiepies.

91
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,602
These are on me.

92
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,687
You need your energy. Am I right?

93
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,772
Hang in there.

94
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,941
-She was talking to me.
-No.

95
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,610
-It was me.
-No. It wasn't you, it was me.

96
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,367
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

97
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,581
Okay, then. Let's calculate.

98
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,085
If you take away 10 from 300, you get 290.

99
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:56,382
I have 290 left. I got 10 in 2 days,

100
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,883
so that's 290…

101
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,304
Wait. What?

102
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,849
I'll be done in ten days.

103
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,393
58 DAYS = RIGHT

104
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,649
Where are you, my lovely hearts?

105
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,278
She's so pretty. Look at her dance.

106
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,956
I'm stuck at work,
so I can't pick you up at school.

107
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,459
I'll go to the convenience store
even if it's late.

108
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,878
I miss you.

109
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,724
NEIGHBORHOOD BIKE RENTAL

110
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,773
Does Sun-oh know
that she's going away for work?

111
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,901
What does it matter? It's over now.

112
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,361
Did they really break up?

113
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,532
I mean…

114
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,995
Yuk-jo, you didn't really break up,
did you?

115
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,498
Of course, she should.

116
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,708
What would people say
if she takes back a boyfriend

117
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,043
who rings someone else's Love Alarm?

118
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,586
She should kick him to the curb.

119
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,213
Still.

120
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,883
It seemed like Sun-oh really liked you.

121
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,303
How much time do we have before we leave?

122
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,653
SHOW THEM YOUR LOVING MARRIAGE
RING EACH OTHER'S LOVE ALARM

123
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,536
Talk about shameless.

124
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,579
We all heard the gossip.

125
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,082
A loving couple's special?

126
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,919
I know, right? We may believe them
if they rang each other's Love Alarm,

127
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,170
but I know they can't.

128
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,258
Did you see earlier?
She lied that she didn't bring her phone.

129
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,468
There's been a lot of rumors.

130
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,428
Last election, they said

131
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,473
he had Jeong Mi-mi service
the party leader for his candidacy.

132
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,683
-Really?
-Yes.

133
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,437
But then again, from what I saw today,
I wouldn't put it past her.

134
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,677
There's no need.

135
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,888
They're not exactly making things up.

136
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,558
People are so simple.

137
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,396
I envy them.

138
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:58,981
What do you envy?

139
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,358
Being able to talk bullshit like that?

140
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,738
They want us to ring
each other's Love Alarm

141
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,574
to prove that we're in a loving marriage.

142
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,660
I'm the one who can't ring his.

143
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,706
Your dad still rings my Love Alarm.

144
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,376
But he's the one cheating.

145
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,672
Love Alarm.

146
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,925
What's the big deal?

147
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,095
How do I look?

148
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,601
So? Do you really plan to go on the show
in the midst of all this?

149
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,937
If I do nothing,

150
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,940
what else is left for me to do
except fall apart?

151
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,890
Gosh.

152
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,397
Hey…

153
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,736
LEE YUK-JO

154
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,238
What is it?

155
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,574
Well, the thing is…

156
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,617
Yuk-jo kept…

157
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,788
Hey, Sun-oh!

158
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,707
Hey, Sun-oh!

159
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,000
Hey!

160
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,334
Hey, Sun-oh!

161
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,141
Did we figure out how
Hwang Jae-cheol's log was leaked?

162
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,977
We're tracking it based on
the signs of an external breach.

163
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,028
Hold it.

164
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,122
Rewind five minutes.

165
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,300
Yes, we're on standby.

166
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,844
Yes. We're going to take care of it
as soon as…

167
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,804
Pardon?

168
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,639
I see.

169
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,351
Okay, I understand.

170
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,229
What did they say?

171
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,731
They'll send us
the quarterly sales report tomorrow.

172
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,193
Darn it. They're so slow.

173
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,278
Okay, let's go home for today.

174
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,582
I have something to give you,

175
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,752
but I guess I can't
since you're working late.

176
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,339
Mr. Lee Hye-yeong.

177
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,015
LEE HYE-YEONG

178
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,464
Duk-gu.

179
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,050
What are you up to?

180
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,149
I don't have to work overtime anymore.
Coming now.

181
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,127
CONNECTING CALL
YUK-JO

182
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,430
SUN-OH

183
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,908
I saw that video.

184
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,288
But…

185
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,207
I still don't hate him.

186
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,587
He said the same thing to me too.

187
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,301
That he hated you so much…

188
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,344
That he should,

189
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,222
but he didn't hate you at all.

190
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,940
Sun-oh will never get over you
his entire life.

191
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,735
That's not true. Sun-oh--

192
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,695
Because I'll never get over him.

193
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,947
So I know what it's like.

194
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,792
What more could I possibly do
to make him get over you?

195
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,629
His feelings for you…

196
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,965
How could I beat that?

197
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,184
But…

198
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,854
I came because I wanted to know
how you felt.

199
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,650
Even if that meant
I had to give up on Sun-oh.

200
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,239
Still, I wanted to be sure before I did.

201
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,836
Why are you here?

202
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,404
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

203
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,345
How did you do that?

204
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:33,763
I told you.

205
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,725
This is my own volition.

206
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,687
You rang Hye-yeong's Love Alarm

207
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,607
of your own free will?

208
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,367
In other words,

209
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,707
this is the choice that you mentioned.

210
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,514
Drive me home.

211
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,638
I went to ask Jojo
if she rings your Love Alarm

212
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,182
as well.

213
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,353
Later.

214
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,607
Let's talk about it later.

215
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,862
If you rang each other's Love Alarm,

216
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,491
I would be the third wheel.

217
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,661
But…

218
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,788
She doesn't.

219
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,500
Jojo rings Hye-yeong's Love Alarm.

220
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,920
They like each other.

221
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,269
I won't be here for a while.

222
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,189
When I come back,

223
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,525
if you still say it can't be me,

224
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,696
I'll stop liking you.

225
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,836
I know I'm being an immature loser,

226
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,340
but to be honest,

227
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,593
I was happy

228
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,471
that you rang my Love Alarm.

229
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,977
Because it was mine that you rang.

230
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,199
Nothing's changed since yesterday,
but everything feels different.

231
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,202
I feel like I can be smug.

232
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,456
I feel like you gave me permission
to be stupid in front of you.

233
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,879
Should I wait for you to finish?

234
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,589
You said you were busy at work.

235
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,008
Go and rest up,
so I can see you again tomorrow.

236
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,181
That's right. I have something for you.

237
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,524
Nothing happened, right?

238
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,403
Did something happen?

239
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,865
Hey. She begged and looked like she'd cry.

240
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,284
She said she had to talk to her
for one last time.

241
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,412
How could I not tell her?
She's going away for a full month.

242
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,210
It's all your fault.

243
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,380
Because you rang Jojo's Love Alarm,
Yuk-jo…

244
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,550
They canceled her contract,

245
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,678
so she's going there to fix it.

246
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,463
What?

247
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,173
A gold digger?

248
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,132
A gold digger?

249
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:47,262
Hey. All I got from you
was one stupid heart.

250
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,639
Is that true or not? Answer me.

251
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,266
How am I a gold digger?

252
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,269
You seduced me and stuff
to get a heart from me.

253
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,312
You smiled at me and came on to me.

254
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,190
I came on to you?
Someone might actually believe you.

255
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,608
What did you do?

256
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,653
Did you or did you not
shake your butt in front of me?

257
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:07,198
That woman begged me for a heart.

258
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,241
-Like hell.
-Hey.

259
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,704
Just settle among yourselves and go.

260
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:17,542
Hey, screw that. I don't want your heart.
Take it. You can take it.

261
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,793
I don't want it.

262
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,712
Come on.

263
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,512
LOVE ALARM HOT PEOPLE

264
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,229
LOVE ALARM HOT PEOPLE
PARK GUL-MI

265
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,611
I made the Hot People list.

266
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,281
Love Alarm's Hot People.

267
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,577
This time…

268
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:57,081
It must really be true this time.

269
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,835
Oh my gosh! Listen up, people!

270
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,297
I made it to Love Alarm's Hot People list!

271
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,842
Do you have any idea
how hard I worked for this?

272
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:08,801
I finally…

273
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,055
I finally made it
to Love Alarm's Hot People list!

274
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,292
You rang Hye-yeong's Love Alarm
of your own free will?

275
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,170
This is the choice that you mentioned.

276
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,434
Please get in.

277
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,270
It's important, and it'll take a while.

278
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,234
Let's just talk here.

279
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,577
You got something else from Duk-gu

280
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,747
in addition to the shield.

281
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,801
Is it a spear?

282
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,971
It is the spear.

283
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,640
So that's why it rang.

284
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,977
So that's what the spear does.

285
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,105
Where's Duk-gu?

286
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,943
You're the one who said Duk-gu died--

287
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,945
You got the spear, but you don't know?

288
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:35,865
Where

289
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,658
is Duk-gu?

290
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,328
Are you saying he's alive?

291
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,209
Who are you?

292
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,504
Why did you say he was dead,

293
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,714
and why are you pretending
to be the developer?

294
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,840
Who are you--

295
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,175
I have a question too.

296
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,178
You have both the spear and the shield,

297
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,347
but you don't know where Duk-gu is.

298
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,185
You used the shield to prevent
Sun-oh's Love Alarm from ringing,

299
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,479
and used the spear
to ring Hye-yeong's Love Alarm.

300
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,023
You lie for your convenience.

301
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,946
Did you know that Sun-oh
came to see me about the shield?

302
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,368
But you used the spear on Lee Hye-yeong?

303
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,746
Then…

304
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,376
is it his turn to come see me?

305
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,966
Jojo.

306
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,221
Why don't we try being honest now?

307
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,690
Hey, Jojo.

308
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,734
Want to see something?

309
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,611
Ta-da!

310
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,155
You've never seen this before, right?

311
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,656
Love Alarm's Hot People.

312
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,076
I'm finally in the Badge Club.

313
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,203
I can meet him. Who?

314
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,246
Brian Chon.

315
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,456
I need to get just 200 more.

316
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,375
What's this?

317
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,419
What was that look?

318
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,006
Are you jealous
that things are going well for me?

319
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:19,719
You won't understand because Hye-yeong
and Sun-oh ring yours for free.

320
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,180
Do you know what I went through
to get this to ring?

321
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:27,435
But then again,
you did try in your own way too.

322
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,897
You had to work and go on dates.

323
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,315
Isn't that right?

324
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,443
But why was Hye-yeong so out of it?

325
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,737
He walked right past me.

326
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,114
You saw Hye-yeong?

327
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,742
Why else would I say that?

328
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,161
But he left a while ago.

329
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,747
What are you talking about?
I just saw him on my way in.

330
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,935
You used the shield to prevent
Sun-oh's Love Alarm from ringing,

331
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,853
and used the spear
to ring Hye-yeong's Love Alarm.

332
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,690
You lie for your convenience.

333
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,319
Did you know that Sun-oh
came to see me about the shield?

334
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,488
Then…

335
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,449
is it his turn to come see me?

336
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,479
What's a shield?

337
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,442
And what's a spear?

338
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,945
A spear?

339
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,074
I heard that Jojo used a spear

340
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,827
to ring my Love Alarm.

341
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,416
You knew,

342
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,753
didn't you?

343
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,931
You did.

344
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,022
What thought ran through your mind

345
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,568
when you saw me overjoyed
that Jojo rang my Love Alarm?

346
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,949
I must have looked pathetic to you
when I said I was waiting.

347
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,079
Don't say that.

348
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,168
There's a reason you don't know about.

349
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,090
Why…

350
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,802
do you know that…

351
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,765
when I don't?

352
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,692
I don't know either.

353
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,655
I don't know.

354
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,536
But…

355
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,423
I do know that it was Jojo's own volition.

356
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,761
Exactly.

357
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,807
Why don't I

358
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:36,934
know that?

359
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,376
Hye-yeong.

360
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,671
Is something wrong?

361
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,269
Did you get home okay?

362
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:32,198
NEW MESSAGE FROM: JOJO

363
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,447
Were you filming until now?

364
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,368
Right?

365
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:19,453
It took a while.

366
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,292
So? Did you protect the image

367
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,587
of our happy family?

368
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,298
I'm not sure.

369
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,052
But if we keep pretending,

370
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,806
we may end up becoming one.

371
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,561
For now,

372
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,982
I'm playing the role of a mom
trying to understand her son.

373
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,069
If I keep this up,

374
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,283
I may be able to understand you one day.

375
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,704
If it's too hard for you,

376
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,331
just pretend to accept it.

377
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,334
Eventually,

378
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:12,006
it may really end up that way.

379
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,276
-What's taking them so long?
-Right?

380
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,320
-They're here.
-Good, they're here.

381
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,821
-Why are you so late?
-Let's go.

382
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,948
-I got my hair done.
-It looks great.

383
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,366
-Is this better?
-Goodness.

384
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,743
I got up early to get ready.

385
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,952
You look the same.

386
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,245
And this…

387
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:49,752
Mom!

388
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,215
I'm going to the store now.

389
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,636
Aren't you happy that I'm working?

390
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,845
Goodness.

391
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,140
Like you've been doing it for so long?

392
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,666
What is this?

393
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,001
She said she hated hiking.

394
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,838
She should've gotten
a pretty color at least.

395
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:56,402
DID YOU GET HOME OKAY?

396
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,828
SOMEONE WITHIN A 10M RADIUS LOVES YOU

397
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,242
I thought about it over and over.

398
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,000
I overheard you

399
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:37,794
talking last night.

400
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,343
Hye-yeong.

401
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,012
I can explain everything.

402
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,521
If you want me to wait,

403
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,189
I'll wait.

404
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,859
If you stand me up, I'll get stood up.

405
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,489
If you dump me, I'll get dumped.

406
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,535
I said it will be fine

407
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,539
whatever you do as long as you're sincere.

408
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,378
All of it was meaningful for me.

409
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,299
Since I was doing it with you.

410
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,012
Things that I can't do on my own…

411
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,347
To me, they were…

412
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,230
I was willing to wait

413
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,650
while listening to you by your side.

414
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,902
Building it up slowly

415
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,114
was

416
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,908
what I wanted to do.

417
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,164
As long as you were being sincere, I…

418
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,353
What

419
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,439
do I do now?

420
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,414
