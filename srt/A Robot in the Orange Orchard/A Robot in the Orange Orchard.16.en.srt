00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:38,239
(Episode 16, The Destined Answer)

2
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,209
The man at the manor is your boss.

3
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,379
- Right? - Yes.

4
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,980
His name is Lu Sen.

5
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:51,750
Yes.

6
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,420
He's also my junior.

7
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:56,549
He's the CEO of IMU Tech Group.

8
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:57,989
He's amazing.

9
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,629
Then...

10
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,760
Bring him to me someday.

11
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,299
Tang Tang.

12
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:08,530
Why did you ask him to come?

13
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,539
Look.

14
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,669
Your tarot card reading for today says...

15
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,870
there will be a huge setback in your career.

16
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,180
The kind that can affect your life.

17
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,009
I want to meet your boss to read his tarot cards...

18
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,879
to see if he'll have any conflict with you.

19
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,479
Besides,

20
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,819
isn't this all for the sake of your career?

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,830
Okay.

22
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,030
Well...

23
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,300
But he doesn't usually go out.

24
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,840
That's easy.

25
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,800
I have an idea.

26
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,680
Do you know what real lifelong partners are?

27
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,280
They have great chemistry with each other.

28
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,879
But then, there are always surprises.

29
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,150
I hope you'll get to experience...

30
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,259
the moment that your heart beats...

31
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,189
only for that one person.

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,740
What are you thinking about?

33
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,129
Hello?

34
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,159
Hello, Lu Sen.

35
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,699
What's wrong with you lately?

36
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,270
I'm fine.

37
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:55,210
Have you not been sleeping well?

38
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,180
Are you unable to fall asleep and wide awake at night?

39
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,610
Do you get delusional and hysterical?

40
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,909
I'm all right.

41
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,550
Sometimes, do you have an arrhythmia,

42
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,849
emotional instability, and difficulty in making choices?

43
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,990
You can't control your thoughts and actions.

44
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,250
You don't know what to do. All of those above symptoms?

45
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,520
I think so.

46
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,399
How did you know?

47
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,329
I have a friend who's an expert in tarot cards.

48
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,600
I went to her for a reading today.

49
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,600
She told me...

50
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,639
that my boss might run into a major life issue...

51
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:30,009
But she can tell you...

52
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,839
the destined answer.

53
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,930
Welcome.

54
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:53,100
Tang Tang.

55
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:54,829
Da Yun, hi.

56
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,230
Let me introduce you.

57
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:59,170
This is my junior, Lu Sen.

58
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:00,939
Hello.

59
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,279
May I ask what you wish to know?

60
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,449
Everything that I didn't know.

61
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,379
Okay.

62
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,250
By the way, Da Yun,

63
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,449
I'm really craving...

64
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,319
that really tasty ice cream at the plaza.

65
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,490
Can you buy one for me?

66
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:21,459
Sure.

67
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,930
Thank you.

68
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:24,029
Do you want one?

69
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,730
I'll get going.

70
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,769
Okay, come with me.

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,480
Please clear your mind.

72
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,980
Think about what you want to ask.

73
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,819
Pick three cards from here.

74
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,290
How did it go?

75
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,199
That person has been watching you.

76
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,269
And in your heart,

77
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:38,769
you actually have some answers.

78
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,009
But you still don't get it.

79
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,879
What do you mean?

80
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,310
Who is that person?

81
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,610
That person?

82
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,879
It's that person who makes you flustered...

83
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,879
and swoons all over her.

84
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,319
It's the person you see in your mind right now.

85
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,490
Are you saying that person is interested in me?

86
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,129
How is that possible?

87
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,600
She's definitely interested in you.

88
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,370
How can you be so sure?

89
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,439
According to this card,

90
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,879
she has been watching you.

91
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,110
Where your eyes can reach...

92
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,050
is where the heart is.

93
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,220
If you're in love with someone,

94
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,519
the look in your eyes can't lie.

95
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,689
Try to remember...

96
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,490
the look in her eyes.

97
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:48,470
But she's a robot.

98
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,339
She locks eyes with me.

99
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:52,839
Isn't it because I'm her master?

100
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,550
The look in your eyes can't lie.

101
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,550
But I can't be sure...

102
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,689
what she's thinking.

103
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,689
What about her feelings?

104
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,959
How can you check that?

105
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,800
If you can't determine with the look in her eyes,

106
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,129
your gut feelings will have to be the most honest answer.

107
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:17,970
Don't you agree?

108
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,740
What about your feelings?

109
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,040
Do you like her?

110
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,149
I...

111
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,620
I don't know.

112
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,820
You don't even know how you feel.

113
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,190
But you want to know how the other person feels.

114
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,960
I think the answer is out.

115
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,580
Tang Tang.

116
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,690
Thank you.

117
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,419
You're welcome.

118
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:16,159
How did it go? Do our energies clash?

119
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:18,399
No, not at all.

120
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,029
As the cards show,

121
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:21,429
your boss will surely...

122
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,769
make more money from now on.

123
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,639
You can't go wrong by working for him.

124
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,970
Great.

125
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:34,980
About the bad luck I had before,

126
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:35,980
how can I resolve that?

127
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,750
Anyway, don't go out so much.

128
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,019
Sunbathe more often.

129
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,389
Surround yourself with red things.

130
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:46,519
Good luck will surely come your way.

131
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,360
Da Yun.

132
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:51,460
Tang Tang.

133
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:54,100
Thank you.

134
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,139
You're back.

135
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,710
You guys come one after another.

136
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,809
Lu Sen just left.

137
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,110
Have a seat.

138
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,279
Listen, you should just confess your love to him.

139
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,720
It's not as if...

140
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,320
a robot has fallen in love with a human being.

141
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:25,919
It's a human that's in love with another human.

142
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:29,029
Besides, will Lu Sen kill you...

143
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,429
just because you're not a robot?

144
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,500
He hates deception.

145
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:37,330
He'll be terribly hurt if he finds out...

146
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
that I've been pretending to be a robot.

147
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,110
And I feel sorry for Alpha Team.

148
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,539
Shan Shan.

149
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,240
You're prioritizing everyone else.

150
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,610
Can't you put yourself first for once?

151
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:52,820
I...

152
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,120
I'm doing this for myself too.

153
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,860
All right, fine.

154
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:02,860
Look at you, all chivalrous.

155
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,000
Let me tell you a secret.

156
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:08,600
I'm very certain...

157
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,440
that Lu Sen really likes you.

158
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,210
Da Tang Zi.

159
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,669
You have no idea...

160
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,809
how badly lies...

161
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,679
can hurt him.

162
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,419
He'll be fine once I leave.

163
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,149
And I can move on with my life.

164
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,049
Are you sure it's Friday,

165
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,490
the robot that is making him get better,

166
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,990
instead of Yan Shan Shan, that's made of flesh and blood?

167
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,460
I know.

168
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,929
There's bound to be a game of pursuit...

169
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,460
when it comes to love.

170
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:42,200
But before you run,

171
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,470
you need to discuss it with the guy chasing after you.

172
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,440
What if...

173
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,769
he loses sight of you?

174
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:31,879
Friday.

175
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,149
You'll be the only one...

176
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,259
to accompany Lu Sen now.

177
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,659
Yes.

178
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,700
I will always be with the owner.

179
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,730
Lu Sen has some special habits.

180
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,940
I have to tell you about them.

181
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:54,269
We don't have much time.

182
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,009
Watch and learn.

183
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:59,039
Let me start with the first one.

184
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:03,110
Your master prefers Friend Mode...

185
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:05,049
to Operation Mode.

186
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,250
So when he puts you in Friend Mode,

187
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,120
you mustn't sound too formal.

188
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,320
You...

189
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:11,720
You need to learn to talk like me.

190
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:12,559
Do you understand?

191
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,730
All data on Yang Shan Shan has been backed up.

192
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,730
I'll retrieve it when necessary.

193
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:20,429
You can't speak in this tone.

194
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,429
It's too formal.

195
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,830
Lu Sen doesn't like this.

196
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:30,110
Forget it.

197
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,139
It might take you some time...

198
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,509
to learn to behave like me.

199
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,980
Let's talk about his second habit.

200
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,279
Your master,

201
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,279
he might like to play...

202
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,019
the game of the kitty and its master with you.

203
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,490
Remember not to react too quickly.

204
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,889
You just have to fool him a little.

205
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,330
He'll be very happy.

206
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,029
Master doesn't like to be deceived.

207
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,230
Friday would never lie to Master.

208
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,009
I know.

209
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,070
You didn't lie to him.

210
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,580
The one who's been lying to him...

211
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,809
is me.

212
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:11,419
Anyway, my point is,

213
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,179
you don't have to be so perfect.

214
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,049
That's all.

215
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,389
Let me tell you about his third habit.

216
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,860
This is very important.

217
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,289
Your master,

218
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,789
when he takes his pills, he might choke on them.

219
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:25,960
So you'll have to do this...

220
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:26,929
Do you understand?

221
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:32,639
No, that's not it.

222
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:34,440
Like this.

223
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,169
Pat his back hard like this.

224
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:42,009
I can't identify the movement.

225
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,110
Please try again.

226
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,019
Why can't it be identified?

227
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,190
You...

228
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,389
What you need to learn now is really important.

229
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,820
And it's very likely to happen.

230
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:53,759
Do you know that?

231
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,330
If you don't learn it, he might...

232
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,559
You must learn to do it right.

233
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:02,370
Do it.

234
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:10,639
Do it like I just taught you.

235
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,480
Just do it!

236
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,279
Haven't you been imitating me?

237
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,450
Aren't you supposed to be smart?

238
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,379
Aren't you an AI robot...

239
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,519
that's 100 times smarter than Yang Shan Shan?

240
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:29,090
Unable to identify your language and movements.

241
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,929
Do you need me to do something?

242
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,129
Please try again.

243
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:52,419
Friday.

244
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,490
How can I make you...

245
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:01,730
become more like me?

246
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,089
How can I make...

247
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,769
Lu Sen like you even more?

248
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,769
Forget it.

249
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,809
How about this?

250
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:21,109
I'll explain and you can have all this inputted slowly.

251
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,250
Take your time to learn it.

252
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,920
Okay?

253
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,759
Take your time recording...

254
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,000
what I am about to tell you now.

255
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,230
Your master,

256
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,170
he's a...

257
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,940
He's a very innocent and kind person.

258
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:48,609
Didn't you say...

259
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,809
you can recognize me as long as I'm human?

260
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:50,839
Why can't you recognize me?

261
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,779
It's Master.

262
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,710
It's Master.

263
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,049
It's Master.

264
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,250
It's Master.

265
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:58,480
It's Master.

266
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,849
It's Master. It's still Master.

267
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,289
He doesn't always mean what he says.

268
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,259
When that happens,

269
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,960
don't ever leave him.

270
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,700
It's because he's sad.

271
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,400
He's in great sorrow.

272
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:14,900
Just go back to the lab.

273
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,569
I still have some battery left.

274
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:20,970
You should go.

275
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:23,710
And don't come again tomorrow.

276
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,009
He really needs you by his side.

277
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,650
Friday.

278
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:31,680
Please...

279
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,650
You...

280
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,049
You must be...

281
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,660
really good to him.

282
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:42,730
Treat him really well.

283
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,269
So you have a present for Friday.

284
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,410
I'd like you to make me...

285
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,710
a pair of robot mock-ups.

286
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:34,480
They should look like Friday and me.

287
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,279
It can't be as simple as making mock-ups.

288
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,680
Otherwise, you wouldn't have asked me.

289
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:43,390
I want to use them...

290
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,589
to remember that day.

291
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,490
That day?

292
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,059
Let me guess.

293
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,400
Was it the day at the amusement park?

294
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,230
How do you know?

295
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,269
I think something must have happened that day.

296
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:00,339
Okay.

297
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,769
I can contact someone...

298
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,140
to have them customized in the UK.

299
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,380
If you're not in a hurry,

300
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:07,210
I can even get you...

301
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,410
a mini Friday with basic functions.

302
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,279
But I have to ask Fu Yang...

303
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:14,220
for Friday's data.

304
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,349
Thank you, Li Er.

305
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,619
I can't entrust Friday's data to anyone else.

306
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,359
So you're the only one I can count on.

307
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,430
Aren't you curious about why I'm doing this?

308
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,940
You're thinking of a way to preserve the memories you shared with her...

309
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,039
as a special gift that you'll always treasure.

310
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,980
If that's not love, what is it?

311
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,680
But this memory,

312
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,720
it only matters to me now.

313
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:53,960
That's just statistics...

314
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,960
to Friday.

315
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,430
Maybe it isn't?

316
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,430
Maybe after looking for answers,

317
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,769
you'll find something new.

318
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,609
That's great, sir.

319
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,039
Congratulations.

320
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,269
Congratulations, Professor Fu.

321
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,440
Congratulations!

322
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,779
What are you so happy about?

323
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,410
Da Yun, what are you wearing?

324
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:18,119
Come here. Listen.

325
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,480
Look.

326
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,220
There were a lot of people...

327
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,250
defaming Dr. Fu previously.

328
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,549
Today, someone finally...

329
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:26,289
proved him right on the most prestigious tech website.

330
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,930
"The truth behind the information leakage of Fu Yang,"

331
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,630
"a gifted scientist in the intelligent world."

332
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,130
One time, during a public lecture,

333
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,000
there was a notification on Dr. Fu's laptop...

334
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,539
that said private messages were sent.

335
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,440
No matter how stupid Dr. Fu is, he can't possibly expose himself.

336
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,940
But the graduate school refused to believe him...

337
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:45,380
and they even fired him.

338
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,539
But you're all scientists.

339
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:49,109
You should find some data to prove it.

340
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,019
They fired me because they believed in the data.

341
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,579
Entering the Information Age,

342
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,220
people prefer to believe in navigation...

343
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:56,690
than the locals...

344
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,950
who have lived here all their lives.

345
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,759
Who cleared it up for you this time?

346
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,700
I don't think anyone here has that sort of authority.

347
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:06,960
It must be Lu Sen.

348
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,759
But I didn't expect him...

349
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,500
to be able to impress the British press as well.

350
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,430
That's amazing.

351
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:13,440
Look at this article.

352
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,940
"Bite the bullet," sure is an accurate description.

353
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,109
This guy. I know this reporter.

354
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,440
He's very authoritative.

355
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:21,809
He's won a Pulitzer.

356
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,880
Then his words carry some weight.

357
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,049
Lu Sen really trusts you guys.

358
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,420
Of course.

359
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,059
Scroll up.

360
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,559
How about...

361
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,390
we thank him together?

362
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,400
How about this?

363
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,369
I don't think Lu Sen has ever felt...

364
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,140
that he has so many friends.

365
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,769
Before I leave,

366
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:50,269
why don't we throw him a party?

367
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,279
I agree.

368
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:15,700
I'll make a toast.

369
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,940
MIT has already cleared Dr. Fu's name.

370
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,440
Who got him through all the obstacles?

371
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,039
- Alpha Team! - Alpha Team!

372
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,180
- Keep it down. - Wait.

373
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,410
Who made all this possible?

374
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,079
- Lu Sen! - Lu Sen!

375
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:32,119
Lu Sen, thank you.

376
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,849
Yes, we have to thank him together.

377
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,789
Come on. Cheers!

378
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,589
Cheers!

379
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,160
This wine tastes good.

380
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,200
As long as you have a sentimental heart,

381
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:52,470
be it coffee or wine,

382
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:54,869
you'll be able to taste some unique flavors.

383
00:23:58,809 --> 00:23:59,740
Da Yun.

384
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,009
Why don't you drink more?

385
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:02,849
Aren't you usually a heavy drinker?

386
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
Don't be ridiculous.

387
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:08,650
I usually drink to ease the mood.

388
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,589
Da Yun.

389
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:14,759
I think with your outfit today,

390
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,559
you can have a few more drinks.

391
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:18,960
Okay.

392
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:26,740
You know what?

393
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,539
Alcohol,

394
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,240
it sure is good stuff.

395
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,480
If deep down one of you has something to say...

396
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:35,809
that you haven't been able to express,

397
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,410
take a sip...

398
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,049
and you can muster the courage...

399
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,319
to say it out loud.

400
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:42,420
That makes sense.

401
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,329
Come on. Let's all raise our glasses.

402
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:54,359
Let's enjoy this beautiful night!

403
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,130
Cheers!

404
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,400
- Cheers. - Cheers.

405
00:24:57,569 --> 00:24:58,440
Come on.

406
00:24:58,869 --> 00:24:59,839
- Cheers, Lu Sen. - Cheers.

407
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,410
Cheers, Lu Sen.

408
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:15,450
I'm suddenly craving popsicles.

409
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,849
Fu Yang. Why don't you come with me?

410
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,259
No.

411
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,859
Eating a popsicle stimulates your stomach lining.

412
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,359
It constricts the blood vessels in your stomach lining.

413
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,430
The gastric secretion decreases...

414
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,230
and it will make you lose your appetite,

415
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,769
causing indigestion.

416
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,200
You can't eat it.

417
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,940
I just want to eat it.

418
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,710
I'll let you guys talk.

419
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,650
Fu Yang, buy a popsicle with me.

420
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:51,250
I saw the weather report today.

421
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,690
The moon is particularly bright tonight.

422
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,490
How about the four of us...

423
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,289
go up to the rooftop and look at the moon?

424
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,859
Okay.

425
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,799
Where's the moon tonight?

426
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,130
When is the moon ever gone?

427
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,339
Let's go.

428
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,690
The moon is beautiful tonight.

429
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:25,519
Yes.

430
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,759
The moon is bright.

431
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,430
But...

432
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,289
Mr. Wang.

433
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,400
Ever since we came up here,

434
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:35,400
you've been avoiding my eyes.

435
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,670
I didn't.

436
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:41,369
Don't deny it.

437
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,039
Do you hate me?

438
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,710
Of course not.

439
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,380
I'm afraid that when I look at you,

440
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,849
the look in my eyes will tell...

441
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:56,950
that I like you.

442
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:10,329
Am I the one who doesn't know love?

443
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,599
How quickly did that speed up?

444
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,009
It's good to be in love.

445
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,769
I want to date someone too.

446
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,119
You were the only one who didn't notice.

447
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,819
I'm giving them some privacy.

448
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,019
You don't really think that I want ice cream, do you?

449
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,059
Is that so?

450
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,930
This is...

451
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,470
I inquired Friday remotely.

452
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,599
Friday analyzed...

453
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,269
that it's true...

454
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,680
that you wanted ice cream.

455
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:56,680
But don't eat too much.

456
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,109
You have a weak stomach.

457
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,549
If I can't have too much of it,

458
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:04,950
does this mean you'll eat half for me?

459
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:09,990
One bite each.

460
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:29,980
Did you get any?

461
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:34,819
No.

462
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:12,289
Master.

463
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:14,119
You should go home and rest.

464
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,859
I'll need to recharge as well.

465
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,990
I'll take you...

466
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:18,930
I'm not going home.

467
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:22,170
I can't live without you, Friday.

468
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,240
Do you remember that you once asked me,

469
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,309
what kind of person...

470
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,049
is your master?

471
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:41,380
Lu Sen.

472
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,119
He's your master.

473
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:47,920
But now,

474
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,200
he's sad and angry...

475
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,799
because you don't recall this memory.

476
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,740
He's behaving strangely.

477
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:02,140
It's because...

478
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,109
he has fallen in love with a robot called Friday.

479
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,650
I like you too.

480
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:21,589
I mean...

481
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,259
Master, I also like you...

482
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:26,430
as I would like a friend.

483
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,069
What if...

484
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,009
my affection for you...

485
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:42,009
is more than just friendship?

486
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,609
What will you do?

487
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:47,480
I'm sorry.

488
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,150
This is beyond my scope of learning.

489
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:55,059
But why do I feel like you love me too?

490
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:57,490
Was it all just my imagination?

491
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:03,599
All of my actions and speech...

492
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,539
are responses to digital input by humans.

493
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:10,339
If I make you think that I'm in love,

494
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,279
it's all just the result of an input.

495
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,049
Right.

496
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:28,119
You're not the one...

497
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:30,930
who made me...

498
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:32,960
feel this way.

499
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,569
It's me.

500
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,170
I'm sorry.

501
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,039
I'm sorry for troubling you.

502
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,009
I'll keep studying.

503
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,119
It's okay.

504
00:31:57,589 --> 00:31:58,660
It's not the same.

505
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,700
