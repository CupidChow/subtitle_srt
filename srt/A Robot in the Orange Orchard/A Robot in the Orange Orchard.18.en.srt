(Episode 18: I Miss You So Much)

2
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,239
Friday.

3
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,340
We're going to change your face.

4
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:44,109
To what?

5
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
To a guy's.

6
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,780
Then I want the most handsome face in the world.

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,219
All mistakes...

8
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,719
started with this face.

9
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,290
Let's turn everything back to the way it was.

10
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,359
Are you ready?

11
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:06,099
Yes.

12
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,009
Fu Yang, wait.

13
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,120
I want her back.

14
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:27,819
Who?

15
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,289
Don't touch it, Lu Sen.

16
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,000
She is my Friday.

17
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,300
I shouldn't have reset her.

18
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,699
I shouldn't have sent her away.

19
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,030
I regret it now.

20
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,539
I want her back.

21
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,669
It's impossible.

22
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,210
No, it is.

23
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,810
From the top.

24
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,509
Start deep learning from the top.

25
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,849
Lu Sen.

26
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,879
Be realistic.

27
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,620
It's impossible.

28
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:01,919
Let me try.

29
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:03,620
I can do it.

30
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,740
I'll get her back.

31
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,650
Hi, Friday.

32
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,120
Greetings, Master.

33
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:35,319
How can I help you?

34
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:45,960
Remember?

35
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,039
Friday.

36
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,139
Friend Mode.

37
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,379
Nice to meet you,

38
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,610
my dear friend.

39
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,250
You weren't like this before.

40
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:09,520
You used to say...

41
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh, my gosh!

42
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,259
When we first met,

43
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,860
the first thing you said was, "Oh, my gosh!"

44
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,360
Oh, my gosh.

45
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:26,240
Good. Very good.

46
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,939
As long as we work with each other,

47
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,410
we'll reunite soon.

48
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,879
Do you understand?

49
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,620
Give it to me.

50
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,660
Me too.

51
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,560
Give me one.

52
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:48,189
- Give me one. - Me too.

53
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:49,129
Give me one.

54
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:50,829
- Thank you. - Thank you.

55
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,300
- Bye. - Bye.

56
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:01,970
Come in, Friday.

57
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,910
Do you remember this place?

58
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:07,649
Over here.

59
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,680
Do you remember this fragrance?

60
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,819
The best robot in the world.

61
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,689
You can't even tell the difference between fragrance and detergent.

62
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,529
You used it as a detergent.

63
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,439
Use fragrance as detergent?

64
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
It's silly.

65
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:55,589
Thank you for the gift.

66
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,360
This is from me.

67
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:12,310
Go in.

68
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,050
Do you remember?

69
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,790
This is your room.

70
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,560
Did you prepare all this for me?

71
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,129
You deserve it.

72
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,089
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,899
My room?

74
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,300
Yes. And that shirt you're wearing.

75
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,139
You wore it when you first came.

76
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:39,639
You loved it so much.

77
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,170
Yes, Master.

78
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,040
I've set this place as my room.

79
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,079
Where's my charging station?

80
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:00,560
Thank you.

81
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
Miss.

82
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,170
Is the orange juice not good?

83
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,970
Why are your eyes red?

84
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:14,110
Not at all.

85
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,079
It's just that my eyes hurt.

86
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:21,649
You're having a hard time?

87
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:24,279
Then I'll help you with eye exercises.

88
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,250
Close your eyes.

89
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,149
Your eyes need to rest too.

90
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,250
We have to be good to our eyes.

91
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,319
They let us see...

92
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:33,959
the things we want to see...

93
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,160
and the person we want to see the most.

94
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,529
Welcome back, Friday.

95
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,269
Friday.

96
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,810
Friday, you were amazing.

97
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,970
From now on,

98
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,639
you're promoted to Sweetheart.

99
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,040
You did well, my Friday.

100
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,050
Let's input it again.

101
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,279
I'll protect you from now on.

102
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,050
Put your hand in here.

103
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,949
You're going to run out of battery from the cold.

104
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,290
Who would dare deceive our Mr. Lu?

105
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,600
Don't leave me.

106
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,430
I don't want to leave you either.

107
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,240
I will cherish you.

108
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:20,240
I want you by my side forever,

109
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,209
until the last moment of my life.

110
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,079
From now on,

111
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,579
you're my most precious treasure.

112
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:29,379
A deal is a deal. Don't break your promise.

113
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,080
A deal is a deal. No going back.

114
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,659
Okay, I got it.

115
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:42,360
Go on.

116
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,649
I can't rush it.

117
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,519
I'm sure I'll be able to find her back.

118
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,519
It's like restoring a phone to the factory settings by accident.

119
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,120
As time passes, it'll go back to the old phone.

120
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,389
That's right.

121
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,460
All I have to do is repeat what I did before.

122
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:14,960
My Friday...

123
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,230
will come back.

124
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:32,879
Friday.

125
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,350
Friday...

126
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,019
Unable to identify Master's facial expression.

127
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,149
Please try again.

128
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,389
What do you need me to do?

129
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,200
You can go now.

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,809
And...

131
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:03,610
put the necklace away.

132
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,980
Yes, Master.

133
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:40,570
When did she get back?

134
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,850
Ms. Xing is already back.

135
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,450
What are you doing out here?

136
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,490
It's tough here pretending to be a gardener.

137
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,320
How can you achieve big things with that brain of yours?

138
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,899
What are you saying?

139
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,629
Ms. Xing is at the amusement park.

140
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
What?

141
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,470
Could robots have twins?

142
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,610
Hey, Lu Sen.

143
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,980
You got Friday to take the necklace off?

144
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,049
Seeing the necklace...

145
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,190
reminds me of the day of the reset.

146
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,190
You've tried.

147
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,000
I think...

148
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,399
you should move on.

149
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:44,240
Why don't I send away the necklace now?

150
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:45,440
No need.

151
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,340
Leave it with her.

152
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,240
I still need a little more time.

153
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,419
Then I'll keep the necklace.

154
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,149
Why is this orange so sour?

155
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,120
Who bought it?

156
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,090
Everything tastes sour when you're in a bad mood.

157
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,259
What brings you here, Angel?

158
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,730
You're so worried.

159
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:48,000
It's because of Lu Sen and Shan Shan, right?

160
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,240
He wants to bring back the old Friday.

161
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,669
It's no use.

162
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,070
Yang Shan Shan is a real person after all.

163
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,309
No matter how much a robot learns,

164
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,840
it can't be the same as the real thing.

165
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,649
Where's Dr. Fu?

166
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,820
He's probably at the beach again.

167
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,850
Whenever he has something on his mind,

168
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,019
he'll leave the lab.

169
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:23,070
You regret it?

170
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,000
No.

171
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,139
I just don't know.

172
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,879
What can we do to make Lu Sen accept the new Friday?

173
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,210
What about Shan Shan?

174
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,480
Is she okay?

175
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,750
I think so.

176
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,320
She has her own dreams and aspirations.

177
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,750
She won't be defeated so easily.

178
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,120
Is it the Young Idea Competition?

179
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,529
That's one of the reasons.

180
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:54,500
When we asked her,

181
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,669
she only agreed just to get back in the competition.

182
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,539
Now the lights are fixed.

183
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,210
She won't give up...

184
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
on her hard work.

185
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,509
It's just that...

186
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,509
I don't know what to do to help her.

187
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,120
It's good she's in the competition again.

188
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:15,620
Do you know who the director of IMU Tech is now?

189
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,320
Don't tell me.

190
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,529
You?

191
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,190
What?

192
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,100
I don't look like a director?

193
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,700
Are you like those ignorant men...

194
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,769
who only thinks I'm a decoration at IMU Tech?

195
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,940
Calling you a decoration means you're pretty.

196
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,570
These ignorant men...

197
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,110
have good taste.

198
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,919
You said...

199
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,279
we should talk.

200
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,690
I'll be honest with you.

201
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,159
Yang Shan Shan and I had our reasons for lying.

202
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,559
May I know the reason?

203
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:00,600
I'm sorry, Li Er.

204
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,529
It involves the privacy of others.

205
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,399
However, it's not money.

206
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,240
It's not about money?

207
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,309
Then it has to be a relationship.

208
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,309
Between you and Shan Shan,

209
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:17,480
Lu Sen is the only one involved.

210
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,019
Sometimes, when I'm with you,

211
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,559
I feel like I'm see-through.

212
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,490
And soft.

213
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,830
When you're sad,

214
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,470
does it help to see the ocean?

215
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,470
Yes.

216
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,909
The sea is like time.

217
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:46,240
It'll wash away everything.

218
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,679
But you don't know how to choose...

219
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:51,919
things in front of you.

220
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,490
What about the person in front of you?

221
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,460
There's no need to choose.

222
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,740
Dude.

223
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:16,339
About Lu Sen having two identical robots,

224
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,640
should I tell Li Zhan?

225
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:22,880
I think we shouldn't tell him yet.

226
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,049
It's a little complicated.

227
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,819
I think the one I was with...

228
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,420
was obviously a person.

229
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,619
The one we've been following...

230
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,759
is her, right?

231
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,589
But we've tested it before.

232
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,529
That's a robot.

233
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,099
Forget it.

234
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:43,470
Let's not say anything.

235
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,200
Even if Li Zhan understands,

236
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,339
I don't know if we can explain it.

237
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,869
It's not about understanding.

238
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,210
The whole thing isn't right.

239
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:52,339
It's weird.

240
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:53,980
Strange.

241
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:55,009
Well...

242
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,910
- Very mysterious. - Two.

243
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,349
I heard you have intentions...

244
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,559
for Li Er and Lu Sen to get married.

245
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,190
That's the plan.

246
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,029
Lu Sen is the major shareholder of the company.

247
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:13,799
Is that why you want Li Er to marry him?

248
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:17,700
That's up to the young people.

249
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,970
What if Li Zhan becomes the major shareholder?

250
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,450
As you know, IMU Tech...

251
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,680
is founded by me and Lu Sen's dad.

252
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,279
For the company to grow to what it is today,

253
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,519
my weight as the original shareholder of the company...

254
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,089
does not lose out to Lu Sen.

255
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,720
All these years,

256
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:43,690
Lu Sen helped make a lot of money for the company.

257
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,730
But he's not fit to be the chairman.

258
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,700
Why isn't he fit to be the chairman?

259
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,000
What's the reason?

260
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,670
He only comes to the office a few times a year.

261
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,769
He hardly comes.

262
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,839
He would be a chairman who doesn't care about the company.

263
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,049
Will such a company grow well?

264
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,880
The company has grown to what it is today...

265
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,150
because the company has a good foundation.

266
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,849
Other departments prepared everything for him.

267
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,890
He just reaped the benefits.

268
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,819
I think if someone else more serious...

269
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,529
becomes the chairman,

270
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,690
I'm sure he can give the company...

271
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:20,029
a broader space for development.

272
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,299
You have to believe me.

273
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,470
I don't know about that.

274
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:28,269
Unless you find evidence to prove...

275
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,509
that Lu Sen isn't suitable to be the chairman.

276
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:35,680
You see, my shares...

277
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,049
can totally support Lu Sen.

278
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,049
Speaking of which,

279
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,519
this has already been agreed...

280
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,519
when Lu Cheng passed away.

281
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,490
If there's nothing else,

282
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,960
I'll get going.

283
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:55,829
Da Liang.

284
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,400
I'm giving you a chance.

285
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:01,269
You are a businessman.

286
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
I hope you can understand.

287
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,980
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for you.

288
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,650
Cherish it.

289
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,089
His weakness...

290
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:18,289
isn't hard to find.

291
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,660
As an adult,

292
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:25,230
we should act like an adult.

293
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,170
All I care about is IMU Tech's future.

294
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:30,369
And...

295
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,670
who can create greater value for the company.

296
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,009
See you.

297
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,460
Let's talk tomorrow.

298
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,059
See you at the competition.

299
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,730
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

300
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,599
No.

301
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:05,769
You should talk more with Lu Sen.

302
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:06,740
Interact more.

303
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,569
Dad.

304
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,440
I wasn't talking to Lu Sen.

305
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,480
I heard everything.

306
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,509
You were talking to him about gifts.

307
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,450
Dad.

308
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,549
Lu Sen already has someone he likes.

309
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:23,049
I'm helping him buy a gift for that person.

310
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:25,160
Stop trying to matchmake us.

311
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:26,460
Of course not.

312
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:29,990
Lu Sen loves you very much.

313
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,829
Did he...

314
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,029
meet someone else?

315
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,039
Dad.

316
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,039
It's all a misunderstanding.

317
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,240
We're not a good match.

318
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,880
And I like someone else.

319
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,779
Who is it?

320
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,680
Could it be Li Zhan?

321
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:51,750
No.

322
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,150
It's Fu Yang.

323
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,119
Fu Yang.

324
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,750
Whose kid is that?

325
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,259
He's no one's kid.

326
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:00,960
He is just Fu Yang.

327
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:02,930
A really good scientist.

328
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,099
Li Er.

329
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:11,740
Marriage isn't dating.

330
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:14,200
If you're just dating,

331
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:16,410
I will leave you alone.

332
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,480
But I'll tell you one thing.

333
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
Not marriage.

334
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,509
To get married,

335
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:25,049
you have to find someone who's on your level.

336
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,220
You're the Kang family's only daughter.

337
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,390
So you know I am the Kang family's daughter.

338
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,920
I'm not a tool for your marriage alliance.

339
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,259
We just want you to find a good man.

340
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,589
We want you to have happiness for the rest of your life.

341
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:40,299
Your mom and I are already old.

342
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,470
Can you stop making us worry?

343
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,500
- You... - No.

344
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,940
I'll decide what to do with my life.

345
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:49,809
No...

346
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,279
This kid.

347
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,450
What?

348
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,950
You want to work part-time as a delivery person?

349
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,660
Do you think you're made of iron?

350
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,859
Do you know how tiring that job is?

351
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,430
I'm not tired.

352
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
As long as I'm busy,

353
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,369
I won't have time to think about those things.

354
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,740
Lovelorn syndrome it is.

355
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,440
I've decided.

356
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,640
I'm going to keep busy.

357
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:26,779
I'm going to live my life to the fullest.

358
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,109
I'll work hard.

359
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:29,650
I'll memorize the words tonight.

360
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:34,680
Do you have a cold? Here, have some water.

361
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,119
I don't want to catch a cold.

362
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,049
My body might want to though.

363
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,930
Hello. Who is it?

364
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,170
Hello. Is this Yang Shan Shan?

365
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,170
I'm from IMU Tech's Young Idea Competition Committee.

366
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,769
I would like to inform you...

367
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,470
that our finals this year will be relaunched...

368
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:56,839
in the form of a creative market.

369
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,809
As a finalist,

370
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,779
would you be interested to continue?

371
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,450
I...

372
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,950
Can I get back to you on that?

373
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,690
What's the matter? Who is it?

374
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,589
You don't look well.

375
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,130
The finals...

376
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,230
for the competition will start again.

377
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:24,069
Really?

378
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,670
Isn't that great?

379
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,869
Hurry up and join it.

380
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:30,970
I want to but...

381
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,109
It's a competition from IMU Tech.

382
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:37,950
That's right.

383
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,990
But he's a CEO.

384
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:44,720
I don't think he'll show up at the competition.

385
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,359
Okay, stop hesitating.

386
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,930
This is your chance.

387
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:53,430
Don't forget why you started, Shan Shan.

388
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,900
Your dream is to launch the products you designed.

389
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:59,039
This is your opportunity.

390
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,769
You must seize it.

391
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,539
Besides, we can...

392
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,710
disguise ourselves.

393
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,000
What are you doing now?

394
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,230
Pai Song didn't join.

395
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,480
We're always looking for a certain someone.

396
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,410
As long as we're together,

397
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,049
we're a complete existence.

398
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,480
I hope you shine brightly.

399
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,490
Even if we're weak,

400
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,750
we will be able to find our own planet...

401
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:27,190
and illuminate each other.

402
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:11,329
Welcome to IMU Tech's Young Idea Competition.

403
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,170
This time, in the form of a market,

404
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,539
technology and human touch are integrated into one.

405
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,579
You will vote...

406
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,980
with the balloon in your hand.

407
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,480
You can only use it once.

408
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,609
Put the balloon...

409
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,349
at the booth...

410
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,220
of your favorite work.

411
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,049
Dear guests, hello.

412
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,059
I'm the initiator of this competition, Kang Li Er.

413
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,690
We're lucky to have expert judges in the industry here...

414
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,190
at the creative market.

415
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,559
They will vote with the IMU Tech users...

416
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,500
as public judges.

417
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,029
The one who receives the most votes...

418
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:44,430
will be our winner today.

419
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,799
The winner will be sponsored by IMU Tech...

420
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:48,569
Mr. Li, are we still waiting for Mr. Lu?

421
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,809
- IMU Tech... - Let's just start.

422
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
He probably won't come.

423
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,349
Next, let's welcome...

424
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,349
the COO of IMU Tech, Li Zhan.

425
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,650
to say a few words.

426
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,720
Mr. Lu.

427
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,250
Hello.

428
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,700
Hello, everyone.

429
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:15,099
I'm Li Zhan, the COO of IMU Tech.

430
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:15,900
Mr. Lu.

431
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,970
I now announce...

432
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:21,970
that the Youth Idea Competition officially begins!

433
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,809
- Great. - Great.

434
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,680
Will Shan Shan be so nervous until she can't speak clearly?

435
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,319
Will Shan Shan's booth be well-received?

436
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:37,150
Don't jinx it.

437
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:52,769
Looks like Shan Shan's fortune for today...

438
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:54,799
is a bit confusing.

439
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,240
Does it use electricity or magnet?

440
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:02,109
That's how you pick it up.

441
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,809
That's amazing.

442
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:10,089
Velveteen rabbit?

443
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,460
What's this?

444
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:16,990
A complimentary gift?

445
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:19,160
- A gift. - It looks like a night light.

446
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:20,730
It's not a night light.

447
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,930
It's Aiya Lamp.

448
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:24,230
When one person holds this lamp,

449
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,900
the other person's lamp will light up.

450
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,369
It shows how much you miss them.

451
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,940
Aren't there video calls nowadays?

452
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:32,480
What's this for?

453
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,910
That's fun. Let's go see.

454
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,849
- That's cool. - Come on.

455
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,109
- Those glasses. - Those glasses are cool.

456
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,049
- These glasses are nice. - Hello.

457
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,650
Take a look at these glasses.

458
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,690
These glasses use eye focus...

459
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,900
Come.

460
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,319
Are you giving up already?

461
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,390
Aren't you the smartest robot in the whole world?

462
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,930
Wasn't it you who told me...

463
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:28,160
to work hard and happily...

464
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,029
no matter what I do or where I am?

465
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:55,059
You each have someone you love, don't you?

466
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,190
Someone you want to protect and comfort?

467
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,029
With my lamp,

468
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:03,000
no matter where you are in the world,

469
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,400
you can let the other person feel your yearning for them.

470
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,369
And the lamps are one of a kind.

471
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,009
Every pair is unique.

472
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,509
Now it's just a prototype.

473
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,109
If you like the concept,

474
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,410
I'm going to make them into dolls,

475
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,480
pillows,

476
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:21,049
and all sorts of objects.

477
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,819
You can express the love that you can't say...

478
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,319
to your family, friends and lover.

479
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,859
Would any of you like to try it?

480
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,430
I want to try.

481
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,029
You're a couple, right?

482
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,430
- Yes. - Then take this.

483
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,329
Thank you.

484
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,400
- Boy, you take this. - Thank you.

485
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,670
Girl, you touch the lamp.

486
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,809
The boy's lamp will light up.

487
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:44,670
Then you can see each other's thoughts.

488
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:14,240
On Shan Shan,

489
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,009
there's something even more powerful than luck.

490
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,339
(Youth Idea Competition)

491
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,180
What's the difference between this competition...

492
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,279
and the previous one?

493
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,349
Rumor has it that you and Lu Sen are very close.

494
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,750
Could you tell us more?

495
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,819
- Yes. - Please say something.

496
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:36,430
They mistook you for Lu Sen.

497
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,690
Let's clear it up.

498
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,230
Please tell us.

499
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,069
If you're done taking the photos, please delete them.

500
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,640
Or I'll ban you from entering...

501
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,279
future IMU Tech's events.

502
00:32:57,579 --> 00:32:59,720
Please go around and take other photos.

503
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,779
The designers and products...

504
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:03,519
are what you should focus on.

505
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,589
Let's go.

506
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:13,160
What do you think?

507
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,799
Did you see any products you like?

508
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,230
As a professional judge,

509
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,000
you have to be fair and square.

510
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,140
I have a question for Director Kang.

511
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,009
Is there a product you like?

512
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,480
I think Yang Shan Shan's Aiya Lamp is not bad.

513
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:30,680
Tasteful.

514
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,079
Even though it's just an ordinary lamp,

515
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,390
Aiya Lamp is beyond quantum transmission technology.

516
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,690
It uses the quantum entanglement technology.

517
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,990
But the lamp doesn't suit me.

518
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:42,329
Why?

519
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:44,289
I've already learned from someone.

520
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:46,299
When I'm thinking of them,

521
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,400
I should go to them right away.

522
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:56,740
You haven't voted yet?

523
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,369
No.

524
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,309
- I'm having second thoughts. - Me too.

525
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:03,950
There are many good products.

526
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,220
Your product is getting a lot of attention.

527
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,019
Thank you.

528
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,150
But this circular design...

529
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,119
doesn't quite suit IMU Tech at the moment.

530
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,260
I know.

531
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,059
IMU Tech's designs are rather high-tech.

532
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,530
But I think that would look too cold...

533
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,659
for many families.

534
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,599
Just like my sister.

535
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,829
She prefers a rounded tablet case.

536
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,230
She thinks it feels warm.

537
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,869
Mine's the same.

538
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,670
The design idea of yours...

539
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,369
is a bit cheap...

540
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,039
for a big global company...

541
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,780
like IMU Tech.

542
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,880
I've been wondering...

543
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,619
what's the bottleneck of IMU Tech's development.

544
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,820
I think I realized it today.

545
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,460
I have no idea what you're talking about.

546
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:48,119
You can't even figure that out?

547
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:50,789
All this time,

548
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,900
IMU Tech has been the benchmark of the industry.

549
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,159
But when I see IMU Tech designs these days,

550
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,730
they feel a bit cold.

551
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,130
Even more by the touch.

552
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:01,000
Yes. It's a trend.

553
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,840
But this lamp...

554
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,610
gives me a different feeling.

555
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,280
She pays attention to the group we've been ignoring.

556
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,210
Users who need emotional companionship.

557
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,250
Okay.

558
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,119
Since you're satisfied,

559
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,929
then I'll do my best...

560
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,429
as an employee.

561
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,010
Long time no see.

562
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,579
Lu Sen.

563
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,360
But there's another problem.

564
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,360
If their ending isn't perfect,

565
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,159
then wouldn't this lamp...

566
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,300
give them a false sense of deception?

567
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:05,130
To leave someone standing for a long time,

568
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:06,739
unable to move on?

569
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,539
The lamp...

570
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,880
never gives anyone the answer.

571
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,449
It's like flipping a coin.

572
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:20,320
The moment you touch the lamp,

573
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,050
you've already made a choice.

574
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:26,559
My dad once told me...

575
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,320
that people are like rivers.

576
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,059
They keep flowing...

577
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,429
and meeting new people.

578
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,360
They will eventually flow out to sea.

579
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,429
If...

580
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:40,440
If you think...

581
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,940
the past is too painful,

582
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,110
you should go make some new friends.

583
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:54,920
What's wrong?

584
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:57,119
It's okay.

585
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,719
I just have a cold.

586
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,289
Take off the hood and get some fresh air then.

587
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:03,059
Don't.

588
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:05,360
I might infect you.

589
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,329
Okay.

590
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:11,630
You're similar to a friend of mine.

591
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:13,940
Is that so?

592
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,010
Oh, right.

593
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,440
When the lamp lights up,

594
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,309
can it really...

595
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,409
wake up the longing for the other person?

596
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,949
I'm sure.

597
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,719
Let me try.

598
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:17,599
It really works.

599
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:04,309
Lu Sen.

600
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,289
Goodbye.
