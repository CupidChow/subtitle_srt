On this basis, we developed

173
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,520
the 1st and 2nd generation of Friday.

174
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,910
While it can learn through association,

175
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,400
we still faced a challenge
that baffled the world.

176
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Robots

177
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,200
cannot read human emotions.

178
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,550
Until this year,

179
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,000
the first deep learning robot

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,400
that could read human emotions was born.

181
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,400

182

184
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,590
For the 3rd generation of Friday,

185
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,760
we used a ground-breaking, healthy, safe, secure,

186
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
and environmentally friendly

187
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,840
emotion analyzing neural network system.

188
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,320
Team Alpha

189
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,030
holds the sole patent of this technology.

190
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,550
Are your lights here

191
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,590
voice-controlled?

192
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,400
An 80% deposit

193
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,910
will be paid within 24 hours of contract signing.

194
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,200
The fine for the delay is 300%.

195
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,960
Can you guys afford electricity even?

196
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,760
I heard you're a conman in the scientific field.

197
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,080
I also heard

198
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,520
you're a hooligan in the I.T. industry.

199
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,230
Friday's neural network

200
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,790
is formed through an interlocking
system of neurons.

201
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,030
Even for a prototype,

202
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,280
it's pretty expensive to run

203
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,320
calculations that intensive.

204
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
He lied.

205
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,200
Friday, mute.

206
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,030
Friday,

207
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,960
you could tell he's lying?

208
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,080
If you still want me to sign the contract,

209
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,320
let Friday answer my questions.

210
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,710
Friday,

211
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,520
disable mute.

212
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,550
Sure.

213
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,590
0.04 seconds after speaking,

214
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,670
(Dr. Fu subconsciously touched his nose.)

215
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,320
As Dr. Fu is not having a fever,

216
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,350
nor displaying flu symptoms,

217
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,590
according to the Pinocchio effect
in psychology,

218
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,910
he lied.

219
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,615
Can you lie then?

220
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:35,465
The greatest difference
between robots and humans

221
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:36,375
is that humans lie,

222
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,615
but robots can't.

223
00:16:37,615 --> 00:16:39,305
I will always be loyal to my master.

224
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:43,665
How many types of human emotions can she read?

225
00:16:45,695 --> 00:16:47,055
Friday's empathy

226
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:48,935
has far surpassed

227
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:50,615
all AI products currently in the market.

228
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:52,695
So long as we give her enough time

229
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:53,935
to go through deep learning,

230
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:56,465
she will know you better than yourself.

231
00:16:57,905 --> 00:16:58,735
No problem.

232
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:00,255
The deposit

233
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:02,055
will be wired after the trial period.

234
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,465
But with an additional condition.

235
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:05,105
The project must be kept an absolute secret.

236
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:06,694
Also, you guys have to move

237
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:08,304
into a lab I provide.

238

I'll start the trial use of Friday tomorrow.

239
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:12,214
If she fails,

240
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,335
we'll void the contract.

00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:36,545
The item is damaged.

344
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:37,905
I cannot pay you the rest.

345
00:23:38,095 --> 00:23:38,825
Damage?

346
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:40,615
It's dented here.

347
00:23:40,615 --> 00:23:41,455
Can't you see?

348
00:23:41,735 --> 00:23:42,665
Let me see.

349
00:23:42,665 --> 00:23:42,975
I...

350
00:23:43,065 --> 00:23:43,905
No!

351
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:46,095
What if you damage it further?

352
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:47,975
No, hey.

353
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,455
How is it fine when it's with me

354
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:51,065
but damaged once you take it?

355
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:52,615
Are you trying to run?

356
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:53,905
Pay up already!

357
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:56,455
This model is only sold today.

358
00:23:56,455 --> 00:23:58,135
I can't get it anymore once I miss it.

359
00:23:58,135 --> 00:23:58,905
You damaged it

360
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,305
and still dare demand payment?

361
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:01,025
You!

362
00:24:04,305 --> 00:24:05,305
What?

363
00:24:05,455 --> 00:24:06,945
Do you want me to apologize

364
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:07,975
and compensate you instead

365
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:09,305
for mental damages?

366
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:10,855
That's a nice car.

367
00:24:10,855 --> 00:24:12,375
Don't tell me you're a valet?

368
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,255
Come out now!

369
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:14,585
Get off!

370
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:15,455
Open up!

371
00:24:15,825 --> 00:24:17,335
You damaged my item.

372
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,375
You'll pay for this!

373
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,215
Stop pretending.

374
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:18,335
You're not leaving!

375
00:25:18,545 --> 00:25:19,585
Trying to run?

376
00:25:19,945 --> 00:25:21,065
-Pay up!
-Let go!

377
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:30,215
Let go!

378
00:25:39,425 --> 00:25:40,425
You pushed me?

379
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,855
Scum! Get back here!

380
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:46,735
Rest assured.

381
00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:48,135
Still alive and kicking.

382
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:50,455
What exactly happened?

383
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:52,975
You know this is a fatal illness.

384
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:54,425
You must be careful.

385
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:56,375
Don't let anyone touch you again.

386
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:57,905
It was just an accident.

387
00:26:58,905 --> 00:27:00,335
Gained any insights

388
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:02,335
from the seminar?

389
00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:08,855
Thought so.

390
00:27:10,785 --> 00:27:12,025
Would anyone in the world

391
00:27:12,855 --> 00:27:14,335
believe that someone

392
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:17,025
could actually be allergic to humans?

393
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:18,855
Well, it's not a wasted trip.

394
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:23,375
There seems to be a new program
developed in Sweden.

395
00:27:23,785 --> 00:27:25,705
It can upgrade your medical smartwatch.

396
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:28,065
On top of recording your pulse, temperature,

397
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:29,545
and allergic index,

398
00:27:29,545 --> 00:27:31,305
there is a time estimate of symptoms relief.

399
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:32,135
Once it acts up,

400
00:27:32,705 --> 00:27:34,335
I will receive an alarm in real time.

401
00:27:35,335 --> 00:27:36,735
The rest remains the same.

402
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:39,255
As the index increases,

403
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:40,975
your allergic reactions
and breathing difficulties

404
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:42,135
will become even more severe.

405
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:43,425
It'll usually be green.

406
00:27:43,665 --> 00:27:45,025
When it's above 100, it's yellow.

407
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,855
When it turns orange at above 1,000,

408
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:48,305
you'll have allergic reactions on
your entire body.

409
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,545
Above 2,000 and it'll turn red.

410
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:52,735
Without timely intervention,

411
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:54,135
in a few minutes...

412
00:27:54,135 --> 00:27:55,095
It'll be over.

413
00:27:57,215 --> 00:27:58,665
But it hasn't gone past 2,000

414
00:27:58,825 --> 00:28:00,255
over the past 15 years.

415
00:28:02,785 --> 00:28:03,495
Lu Sen.

416
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:06,095
You should take your condition seriously.

417
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:07,665
Wear the watch at all times.

418
00:28:10,665 --> 00:28:11,585
Don't worry.

419
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:13,665
This cuff looks pretty decent.

420
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:14,905
I won't take it off.

421
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:17,495
Lu Sen,

422
00:28:18,255 --> 00:28:20,135
I know it's been tough on you.

423
00:28:20,785 --> 00:28:21,975
But recovery is not something

424
00:28:22,495 --> 00:28:23,615
that can be rushed.

425
00:28:25,215 --> 00:28:26,735
Haphephobia

426
00:28:27,425 --> 00:28:28,375
is almost beyond

427
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,065
the understanding of today's medicine.

428
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:32,665
It's really rare to find

429
00:28:32,665 --> 00:28:34,135
a second case like yours in the world.

430
00:28:57,095 --> 00:28:58,065
Hey,

431
00:28:58,215 --> 00:28:59,785
I thought you're a surrogate shopper?

432
00:29:00,095 --> 00:29:01,735
Why did you come back injured all over?

433
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:03,335
Drop it already.

434
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:05,735
I met a man who dine and dash.

435
00:29:06,215 --> 00:29:06,665
Ouch, ouch!

436
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,335
He kept insisting

437
00:29:09,335 --> 00:29:11,255
I damaged the packaging.

438
00:29:11,665 --> 00:29:13,375
Who am I?

439
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,025
I get 5-star stellar reviews every time!

440
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:16,735
I'm experienced and seen-it-all.

441
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:17,975
I've even bought someone a fridge on their behalf!

442
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:20,025
And he says I damaged that little toy of his?

443
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:21,305
Liar.

444
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,255
He's totally a repeat offender!

445
00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:24,735
He goes on and on.

446
00:29:24,735 --> 00:29:26,255
With your temper,

447
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,305
you must've tackled him right there.

448
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:30,945
I caught him!

449
00:29:31,065 --> 00:29:33,585
But then I got careless, and he ran off.

450
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:34,425
Can't be.

451
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:35,785
Is there anyone

452
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:37,455
that even you, Ms. Yang, can't handle

453
00:29:37,455 --> 00:29:38,455
and discipline?

454
00:29:38,665 --> 00:29:41,305
I thought only your uncle could make you obey!

455
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:43,665
I'm a delicate lady, alright?

456
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,025
Okay.

457
00:29:46,305 --> 00:29:47,615
Then, pray tell.

458
00:29:47,735 --> 00:29:49,185
The delicate Miss Yang,

459
00:29:49,305 --> 00:29:50,425
when will you end

460
00:29:50,425 --> 00:29:52,905
your adventure of running away from home

461
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:55,375
and hurry back to your warm little home?

462
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:56,975
I'm not going back!

463
00:29:57,785 --> 00:29:59,095
We'll just fight again.

464
00:29:59,305 --> 00:30:00,425
To my uncle,

465
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,585
a part-time job isn't a real job,

466
00:30:02,785 --> 00:30:05,095
and making Love Lamps is just me fooling around.

467
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,095
Is this the table lamp

468
00:30:08,095 --> 00:30:10,185
you're sending
to the Youth Creativity Competition?

469
00:30:11,255 --> 00:30:12,495
Mind your words.

470
00:30:12,495 --> 00:30:13,705
Is this just a table lamp?

471
00:30:13,705 --> 00:30:15,425
It's a Love Lamp.

472
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:17,545
What's the difference?

473
00:30:18,585 --> 00:30:20,425
Love Lamps come in pairs.

474
00:30:20,425 --> 00:30:21,905
Through a certain technology,

475
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,305
when one touches a lamp,

476
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:24,665
the other would light up as well.

477
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:26,065
In that case,

478
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,705
no matter where you are in the world,

479
00:30:28,705 --> 00:30:30,585
if you miss them

480
00:30:30,585 --> 00:30:31,705
and touch the lamp,

481
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:33,825
they will feel that you're missing them.

482
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:35,215
This is the Love Lamp.

483
00:30:35,665 --> 00:30:36,305
Oh, come on.

484
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:37,495
That's so troublesome.

485
00:30:37,855 --> 00:30:39,975
If I miss someone,

486
00:30:40,095 --> 00:30:41,855
can't I just give them a call?

487
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:43,785
Do you think everyone's like you?

488
00:30:44,095 --> 00:30:45,215
Me? What about me?

489
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:50,455
Sometimes, longing cannot be expressed.

490
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:54,455
You wouldn't understand even if I explained.

491
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:55,705
Anyhow,

492
00:30:55,975 --> 00:30:56,785
if I got

493
00:30:56,785 --> 00:30:58,975
first place in the Youth Creativity Competition,

494
00:30:58,975 --> 00:31:00,545
I can become a designer!

495
00:31:00,545 --> 00:31:02,025
I can invent things all day then.

496
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:03,905
Oh, please.

497
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:04,785
If you win the competition,

498
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:06,905
please pay for your meals.

499
00:31:10,025 --> 00:31:11,065
Hello, is this Yang Shanshan?

500
00:31:11,735 --> 00:31:12,855
Yes, that's me.

501
00:31:13,615 --> 00:31:14,455
I'm really sorry.

502
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,455
This year's IMU Youth Creativity Competition

503
00:31:16,455 --> 00:31:17,375
has been canceled.

504
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:18,335
I'm really sorry.

505
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:21,215
The... the competition's canceled?

506
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:22,065
Yes.

507
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,174
[Happy Birthday]

508
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:31,305
Max,

509
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:32,255
happy birthday.

510
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:34,025
In my heart,

511
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,665
you're elegant and accepting

512
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:37,135
and full of charisma.

513
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:40,705
You're an indispensable member of this family.

514
00:31:57,825 --> 00:31:58,855
