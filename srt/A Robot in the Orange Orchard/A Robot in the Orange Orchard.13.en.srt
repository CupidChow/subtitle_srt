1
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,670
(Episode 13)

2
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,519
Let's clean up, guys.

3
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,290
Fu Yang.

4
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:58,890
Can we not go?

5
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,890
Lu Sen is not a pervert.

6
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,989
He's kind to the robots.

7
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,060
We all saw it.

8
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:05,730
There must be a misunderstanding.

9
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:06,829
Yes, Professor.

10
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,370
Can we not go?

11
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,199
I'll help you do the chores.

12
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,909
I think...

13
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,379
maybe we can try again.

14
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,599
Who said anything about leaving?

15
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,229
I said, "clean up."

16
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,340
Aren't you supposed to put the wires back in place?

17
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,710
We're not leaving! Why didn't you say so earlier?

18
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,960
But within five days,

19
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,460
we need to get Friday fixed.

20
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:07,560
No problem.

21
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,430
- Get to work. - Get to work.

22
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,189
Come on.

23
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,960
What's wrong with me?

24
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,990
Everything is going so well.

25
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:16,129
So why do I feel so empty?

26
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,629
I must have been quite anxious lately.

27
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,829
I'm even having trouble falling asleep.

28
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,600
Yes, that's right.

29
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's just sleep.

30
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,439
One sheep, two sheep...

31
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,879
sheep number three.

32
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,850
Four deer...

33
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,449
Where did this deer come from?

34
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,490
I counted sheep. How did a deer get in there?

35
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:42,050
Go away! Go away!

36
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:48,889
Five sheep, six deer.

37
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,829
Sheep. I want sheep.

38
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,899
Mr. Li.

39
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,129
How did it go?

40
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:30,399
We were supposed to go see the robot.

41
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:32,170
Fu Yang suddenly called.

42
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,199
He changed his mind.

43
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,069
He's not selling it.

44
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,310
- He's not selling? - No.

45
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:39,579
Why not?

46
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,680
He didn't say.

47
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,180
I even told him that...

48
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,819
as long as I can see the robot,

49
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,550
I'll raise the price if I like it.

50
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,649
But Fu Yang is very determined this time.

51
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,189
Yet he acted like he needed so much money.

52
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,629
In other words,

53
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:55,629
he tells the investors...

54
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,360
he's successfully developed an emotional companion robot.

55
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,529
But in reality,

56
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,699
no one has ever seen the actual thing.

57
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:02,699
That's true.

58
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,939
From what I know about this type of robot,

59
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,769
it's a preconceived idea in the tech world.

60
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,069
How long will it take to objectify the idea?

61
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,680
No one can say for sure.

62
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,079
Is Fu Yang's project real or fake?

63
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,949
No one knows.

64
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,180
And I've asked around.

65
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,350
All the investors he's contacted...

66
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:23,389
have only seen a video clip that he showed,

67
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,889
nothing more.

68
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:36,569
We'll stay.

69
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,870
But let's make a pact.

70
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:44,040
Number one. Let's rewrite the contract.

71
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,449
That includes the details of Friday's launch event.

72
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,209
And we'll add a month's probation period.

73
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,319
This time, it's our turn to inspect you.

74
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,720
Number two. During the month of probation,

75
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,220
I will have to oversee you,

76
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,360
every time you take Friday out.

77
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,790
Third.

78
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,029
If you go against these two rules,

79
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,230
we can terminate the contract whenever we want,

80
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,430
without paying...

81
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,829
any form of breach of contract.

82
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,029
Deal?

83
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,639
No problem.

84
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,370
After signing the contract,

85
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,370
I'll pay you the rest of the installments.

86
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,810
Even after the probation period is over,

87
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,439
I will still need to monitor your behavior.

88
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,449
Okay.

89
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,279
Oh, right.

90
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,350
I have a gift for you.

91
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:48,569
Did you design...

92
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,910
this logo for the Alpha Team?

93
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,250
We are going to work together, after all.

94
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,050
You have to be up to snuff.

95
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,420
If that's the case,

96
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,420
we also have a gift for you.

97
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,720
Mr. Lu, since you're so bad at...

98
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,889
remembering other people's names,

99
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,290
we will make an exception today...

100
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:10,230
and let you become a member...

101
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,829
of the infamous Alpha Lab.

102
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,970
I'll tell him the rules.

103
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,399
In the scientific world,

104
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,439
seniority depends on who joins the lab first.

105
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:23,009
So from now on, you will call us...

106
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,410
Mr. Richard,

107
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:25,709
Mr. Fu,

108
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:26,779
Mr. Wang,

109
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:28,680
and Ms. Pai.

110
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,620
- I think... - I'm not the youngest anymore.

111
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,149
- Hi, Lu Sen. - Hi, Lu Sen.

112
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,519
Hi, Lu Sen.

113
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,090
Dr. Fu.

114
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:41,759
Control your team members.

115
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:43,360
After signing the contract,

116
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,100
you are a partner of the company.

117
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,500
You should call him Mr. Lu.

118
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,000
Si Jia Li.

119
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,200
You're talking to your boss's senior.

120
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,600
You need to be more humble.

121
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:53,399
It's okay.

122
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,970
I'm fine with this.

123
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,179
Never mind.

124
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,649
Mister?

125
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,080
Miss?

126
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
I'm speechless.

127
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,120
Who said you could take him in?

128
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,190
Did I agree?

129
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,460
You didn't say no either.

130
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:16,860
I took your silence as a yes.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,659
Boss.

132
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,700
Look.

133
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,230
After the probation period ends,

134
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,399
Lu Sen will be our boss, right?

135
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,700
I beat him to it...

136
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,440
and made him our junior.

137
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,840
By doing so, I've closed the distance between us.

138
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,940
Two birds, one stone.

139
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:33,779
Kill two birds with one stone.

140
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,580
Stunning.

141
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:35,679
- Stunner. - Stunned.

142
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,549
Stop!

143
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,320
We have a big day ahead of us.

144
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,059
Friday's exchange with Shan Shan is right around the corner.

145
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,460
Good luck.

146
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,629
I think he's happy.

147
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,960
Stream?

148
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,200
S... street!

149
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,970
Good morning, Master.

150
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,309
Friday.

151
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:06,080
Friend Mode.

152
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:09,450
Morning, Mr. Lu...

153
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,090
What's with Friend Mode today?

154
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,460
Did Fu Yang forget to charge your battery?

155
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,659
That's right.

156
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,159
He forgot to charge me yesterday.

157
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,929
Then we can't let you run out of battery too fast today.

158
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:29,799
Let's go.

159
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,169
I have a gift for you.

160
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:42,509
Look.

161
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:50,090
Let's go in.

162
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:04,200
Did you prepare all this for me?

163
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,840
You deserve it.

164
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:07,299
You don't have enough clothes.

165
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,269
So I got you some more.

166
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,470
You can choose what you like.

167
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,279
And my room is behind this wall.

168
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,309
Out of all my sweethearts,

169
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,350
you're the closest to me.

170
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,950
Thanks, Mr. Lu!

171
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,750
Caring really does recharge the battery.

172
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,789
Fu Yang is leaving.

173
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,159
I guess that's why his focus is not on you.

174
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,059
Then I'll need to charge your battery.

175
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,190
Pick one you like and put it on.

176
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,399
Aren't you going to go out?

177
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,830
Why should I?

178
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,070
What if your arm gets ripped off?

179
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:40,070
I'll have to put it back for you.

180
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,409
Mr. Lu.

181
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,110
You bought me for 100 million.

182
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,210
I wouldn't break so easily.

183
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,779
Don't worry.

184
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:58,559
(Sweetheart's Room)

185
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,159
Being Friday is not so bad after all.

186
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,740
What am I talking about?

187
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,009
I mean, maybe he and I...

188
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,809
spend too much time together.

189
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:20,580
Yang Shan Shan.

190
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,879
You can't forget why you're here.

191
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:35,559
Which one?

192
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:04,679
Are you okay?

193
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,480
I'm fine.

194
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Don't we have a lot of work to do?

195
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,360
- Tell me what I should do. - It's okay.

196
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,289
Aren't you almost out of battery?

197
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,230
Leave the housework to Dusty.

198
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,330
Then I'll build the card castle.

199
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,230
I said it's fine.

200
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,399
I am trying to get rid of the card castle.

201
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,500
It's blocking the sunlight.

202
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,370
I'll make breakfast, then.

203
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,370
It's already noon.

204
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:26,840
Then...

205
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:30,210
I'll vacuum.

206
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,720
Beautiful lady scientist.

207
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,080
Here's your delivery.

208
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,649
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

209
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,519
You're welcome.

210
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,029
Mr. Fu. The parts for Friday are here.

211
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,929
Good.

212
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,200
We'll start the test now.

213
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,080
The drive system.

214
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,379
Normal.

215
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,019
Mechanical structure.

216
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,950
Normal.

217
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,320
Nerve reflexes.

218
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,179
Normal.

219
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,889
All that's left is to complete the interactive test.

220
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,659
Afterwards, we can bring Shan Shan back.

221
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,289
We need her to test Friday's transmitting system.

222
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,330
Okay.

223
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,429
Our Friday is up and running again.

224
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,399
In order to ensure a safe handover,

225
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,269
let's run the tests again.

226
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,950
Calm down.

227
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:46,850
It was an accident.

228
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,549
Doing the chores I used to do...

229
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,019
can make me remember...

230
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,090
the time when I was abused.

231
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,899
I told you. You should rest.

232
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,129
Have a seat.

233
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:18,950
Are you happy, Friday?

234
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,649
I prepared this especially for you.

235
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,250
From now on, when you're home,

236
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,289
you can use this.

237
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,360
It will only work for you.

238
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,720
So you won't waste any battery.

239
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,259
No, thanks. I can still...

240
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,029
Sit down.

241
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,500
Yesterday.

242
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,929
When I thought you'd really leave me,

243
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,230
I realized a lot of things.

244
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,539
I now know what you mean to me.

245
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:42,539
I'd never been so scared to lose something.

246
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,879
That's why I will cherish you.

247
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,580
Because you're my treasure.

248
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,649
There's more.

249
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,549
I'm going to hold...

250
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,620
the Young Idea Competition.

251
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,720
Tell Pai she can participate again.

252
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,259
Why now, all of a sudden?

253
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,990
Because this time,

254
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,529
I achieved something with sincerity.

255
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,400
I'm happy.

256
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,529
So now, I want to make everybody happy too

257
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,130
Friday.

258
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,140
Enter.

259
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,569
Always be true to me.

260
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:17,910
Mr. Lu, then...

261
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:22,980
Can I be honest with you?

262
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,450
My name's not Friday.

263
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,349
I'm Yang Shan Shan.

264
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,289
What?

265
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,130
I...

266
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,369
Can I be honest with you?

267
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,769
Then...

268
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,509
I...

269
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,240
I want to turn on the TV.

270
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,380
IMU, turn on the TV.

271
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:20,039
Friday.

272
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,000
Enter.

273
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:22,440
Always be true to me.

274
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,000
Why are you still up?

275
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,740
I'm just trying...

276
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:55,009
to fix Aiya Lamp as soon as possible.

277
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,309
I'll fix Aiya Lamp for you...

279
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,079
as soon as we're done with Friday.

280
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,559
Did you sort everything out with Lu Sen?

281
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,190
It went well.

282
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:16,190
That's good.

283
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,000
Will Friday really be ready in five days?

284
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,500
Is it taking too long?

285
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,769
Have I tired you out these days?

286
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:28,069
We can go faster.

287
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,170
No. That's not what I meant.

288
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,069
I mean...

289
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,009
Working late all the time isn't good for your health.

290
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,880
You should slow down.

291
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,309
It's okay on my end.

292
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,880
Don't worry. It won't take long.

293
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,279
The parts have arrived.

294
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:40,349
So it won't take long now.

295
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,289
That's good.

296
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,490
I...

297
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,990
Go...

298
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,400
Go to bed early.

299
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,799
- Good night. - Good night.

300
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,569
Hi, Friday.

301
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,470
Good morning, master.

302
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:38,980
What can I do for you?

303
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,240
I'm going to work.

304
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:41,380
I have to go out today.

305
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:42,609
Okay.

306
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:03,400
Why did you pick me up here today?

307
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,500
I want to save your battery as much as possible.

308
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:06,940
Don't jump around and waste it.

309
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,839
Got it?

310
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:09,769
Okay, got it.

311
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,710
Why are you suddenly so obedient today?

312
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,079
Master.

313
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,250
Every day from now on,

314
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,880
I will always be this obedient.

315
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,490
I think you're afraid that I'll scold you.

316
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:27,319
Your brain isn't full of data.

317
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,130
I think it's full of wicked ideas.

318
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,190
What are you talking about?

319
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,900
At least, it's full of clever ideas.

320
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,069
This is better.

321
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,799
You can talk back to me all you want.

322
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,309
These are my gifts for you.

323
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,349
Electric, internal combustion,

324
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,519
and steam.

325
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,759
They don't make these kinds of parts anymore.

326
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,329
This one looks like a perfect match for Xiao C.

327
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,890
I've been looking everywhere for it.

328
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,759
We can finally upgrade Xiao C.

329
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,500
This is from my collection.

330
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,900
It's all yours now.

331
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,470
You're being too generous.

332
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,240
Do you like spare parts too?

333
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,369
I thought that except us and Dr. Fu,

334
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:18,410
no one has any interests in them.

335
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,309
It's just a hobby.

336
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,109
But don't hold back.

337
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,150
Knowing that the parts I like are usable,

338
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,279
I'm even happier than you.

339
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:30,089
You're an angel.

340
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,119
Angel, have some water.

341
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:35,960
These are too precious.

342
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,900
You must've kept them for a long time.

343
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,329
We can't take it.

344
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,329
Professor Fu!

345
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,880
I'm here to take what I left behind that night.

346
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:55,450
Hold on.

347
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,519
That night?

348
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,890
I parked my car in the back.

349
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,759
I'll take you there.

350
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:14,930
Scientists.

351
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,069
See you later.

352
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:28,779
Didn't you hear a kind of...

353
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:32,420
adult shyness in Boss's words?

354
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,049
No.

355
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,069
Are you staying?

356
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,380
Thank you.

357
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:08,250
Why won't you look at me?

358
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:10,289
I am looking.

359
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:13,460
Then why are your ears so red?

360
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:15,660
Are they?

361
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,859
Did I make your heart flutter?

362
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,400
Dr. Fu.

363
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:25,140
Can I ask you two questions?

364
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,640
You've never had a girlfriend, right?

365
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,250
Can I be your girlfriend then?

366
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,250
I'll take it as a yes.

367
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,190
I'll leave the parts to you.

368
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:47,789
I'll visit them often.

369
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:49,859
This is the token of our love.

370
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:03,940
Okay.

371
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,319
Why are we here?

372
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,160
Dr. Ou's clinic is up there.

373
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,930
He asked me to come in for a follow-up.

374
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,059
I have never come here at this hour.

375
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,329
It's usually pretty crowded now.

376
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:28,329
Then what time do you usually come to the hospital?

377
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:30,170
Midnight.

378
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,539
You come here in the middle of the night?

379
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,210
Friday.

380
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,539
There are so many people up there.

381
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:39,109
I'll should call you Xiao Xing later.

382
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:41,509
Sure.

383
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:43,910
I'll call you Mr. Lu then.

384
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,420
We're already friends.

385
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,619
Then, Lu Sen?

386
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:50,619
No.

387
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,390
That's disrespectful.

388
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,789
How about Sen Sen?

389
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,930
It's too cringey for you.

390
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,559
I'll just call you Lu Sen then.

391
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:01,299
Whatever.

392
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,210
You're here.

393
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,680
How's it going?

394
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:13,880
How was the drive up?

395
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,609
It was fine.

396
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,980
I didn't expect there would be so many people

397
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,720
in the daytime.

398
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,180
You just recovered from the physical contact disorder.

399
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:23,049
Coming to the hospital during the day...

400
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,650
is the perfect way for you to adapt.

401
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,460
I still like the hospital at night better.

402
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,960
Hello, Friday.

403
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,900
Hello, Dr. Ou.

404
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,230
Have a seat.

405
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,940
Need a chair for Friday too?

406
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,670
Her batteries aren't very durable.

407
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,609
Okay.

408
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,609
I'll cut to the chase.

409
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:51,210
I've been looking at your data.

410
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,150
Your wavelength on the way here...

411
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,519
is all within the normal range.

412
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,450
Today, we're doing a skin check-up.

413
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,720
If the results are good,

414
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,529
from now on, you can try to go around without gloves.

415
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,160
Get used to normal human contact.

416
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But just in case,

417
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,769
you still have to take your medication.

418
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,569
Okay.

419
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:15,339
Take off your clothes. I'll set you up.

420
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,670
You're taking your clothes off here?

421
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:20,779
I'm Dr. Ou's VIP client.

422
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,009
That's why he personally examines me.

423
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,279
That's not the real reason.

424
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,619
He's too demanding.

425
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,650
I'm the only one who can treat him.

426
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,150
I mean.

427
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,259
Don't I need to leave for this?

428
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,259
Do you need to?

429
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,029
I am still in the testing phase.

430
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,930
My eyes have image storage.

431
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:45,170
To better protect my master's privacy,

432
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,670
I should leave the room.

433
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,009
You can go.

434
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,240
- I'll call you when I'm ready. - Okay.

435
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,009
It's just a checkup today.

436
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,819
I'll have the nurse take you to the room.

437
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,650
- You take her. - Okay.

438
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,519
Hello.

439
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,259
En Bao is allergic?

440
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,059
- So you have an appointment. - Yes.

441
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,890
Okay. We'll have the nurse take you there.

442
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,630
All right.

443
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,589
This way, please.

444
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,160
- Hello. - Hello.

445
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:16,130
One moment, please.

446
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,039
It's peanut allergy again.

447
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,170
Look at your rash.

448
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,609
You're like a kitten now.

449
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:30,279
Who knew there were peanuts in the cupcakes?

450
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,450
Too bad there's still a big piece left.

451
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:35,049
I saved the cake for Shan Shan.

452
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,319
I didn't save it for you.

453
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:39,059
When is she coming back?

454
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:40,359
When she's not at home,

455
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:43,589
Dad pays more attention to me and scolds me instead.

456
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,930
I don't know when she'll be back.

457
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,500
Why don't we give her a call tonight?

458
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,769
Sure!

459
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,200
I'll call her tonight.

460
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:57,869
Please come in.

461
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,269
To the lab? At night?

462
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,400
Really?

463
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,069
Look, this is their lab.

464
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,609
The lab is huge!

465
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:53,759
Hello.

466
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,869
- Feel free to look around. - Okay.

467
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:05,710
Let's go.

468
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,450
Shan Shan.

469
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,049
It's...

470
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,359
This is the robot that looks exactly like Shan Shan?

471
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,519
It's exactly the same!

472
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:23,960
Look!

473
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,130
Her skin...

474
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,700
is even better than you.

475
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,630
And her hair.

476
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:29,769
It's pretty.

477
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,099
Why don't you get the same haircut?

478
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,200
Who's your friend?

479
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,000
You are. You are.

480
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,079
Doctor.

481
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,210
Later, can you help me take a photo

482
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:47,019
with Shan Shan and the robot?

483
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,349
That way, I can tell my friends.

484
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,119
I have two identical best friends.

485
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,519
No.

486
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,960
You can't take photos here.

487
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,000
Hi.

488
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,299
- Hi. - You can take pictures here.

489
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,339
We'll send Friday to be tested the day after tomorrow.

490
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,769
After that, you can take all the photos you want.

491
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,690
Is Friday leaving in two days?

492
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:24,420
Yes.

493
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,259
Friday is finally ready.

494
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:37,970
Shan Shan.

495
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,200
Looks like your maid life...

496
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:43,470
with room and board is finally ending.

497
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,809
You're going to go back

498
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,380
to being a freelancer again.

499
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:48,980
Yes.

500
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,710
My freelance career...

501
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:52,480
is multifarious.

502
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:53,480
It's great.

503
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:54,720
Right...

504
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:58,549
Tang Tang.

505
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,059
Can I have your contact information?

506
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,359
I'm afraid that you'll get lost when you come back to take pictures.

507
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:08,000
Sure.

508
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:09,900
But if you want to contact me,

509
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,400
come have a drink at my cafe instead.

510
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,140
After all, to pursue a career woman,

511
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,839
you should contribute to my sales number first, right?

512
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,210
Shan Shan.

513
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,410
I want to see where your dorm is.

514
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:25,250
The dorm is that way.

515
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,670
Once Friday is gone,

516
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,440
you'll have to leave, don't you?

517
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,410
Yeah.

518
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,809
I saw my aunt and En Bao...

519
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,819
at the hospital today.

520
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:02,089
They seem to really miss me.

521
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,559
Are you sure...

522
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,890
you can leave without feeling anything?

523
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,329
This is basically just a job.

524
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:14,900
Like a part-time job.

525
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,369
I'll leave when it's done.

526
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,670
What's so sentimental about it?

527
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:22,609
But I think...

528
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:24,269
you already have feelings for him.

529
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:25,380
That's impossible.

530
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,609
And he likes you, too.

531
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,839
That's impossible.

532
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,779
He's always wanted to marry...

533
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:31,250
his childhood friend.

534
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,319
He only thinks of me as a robot.

535
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,519
Is he only treating you...

536
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,319
like how he would a robot?

537
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,390
Yes.

538
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,329
Well, not exactly.

539
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:04,609
Sometimes,

540
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,250
he protects me at the cost of his own body.

541
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,630
I told you. You should rest.

542
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,840
That's strange.

543
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,980
Every time I close my eyes,

544
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,320
I can't stop thinking about Friday.

545
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,619
No matter how much one likes one's phone,

546
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,389
it's impossible for one to break the bones...

547
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,760
just to save the phone.

548
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,590
If he did that much for you,

549
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,860
that means he really likes you.

550
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:52,300
You can't hide your feelings when you like someone.

551
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,130
Not necessarily.

552
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:56,500
Maybe he'll do the same...

553
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,699
for Friday.

554
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:01,340
I have to go out later.

555
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:02,570
Bring an umbrella for me.

556
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,769
It's all ready for you.

557
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:08,849
Be careful!

558
00:35:33,969 --> 00:35:34,769
Seems like...

559
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,469
I really need to have a charger at home.

560
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,409
I keep missing her.

561
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,849
My heart feels empty.

562
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:44,480
Shan Shan.

563
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Lu Sen might not realize it.

564
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,250
But why don't you get it?

565
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,849
What's the biggest difference between you and Friday?

566
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:55,530
Let me warn you out of kindness.

567
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,329
In this world,

568
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,599
it's really hard to find someone who feels the same way you do.

569
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:02,699
Once this part-time job is over,

570
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,099
go stand in front of him and tell him.

571
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,400
You're Yang Shan Shan.

572
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:07,739
You're not a robot.

573
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,670
You're human.

574
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,710
As long as you really like him,

575
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,539
everything that happened in the past...

576
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,980
is not a big deal.
