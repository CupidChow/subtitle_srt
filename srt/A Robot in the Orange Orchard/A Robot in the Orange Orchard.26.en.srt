00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,540
(Episode 26, I'll Embrace The World Just For You)

2
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,209
You didn't expect me to come home early, did you?

3
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,150
I knew something was wrong.

4
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,620
I knew it.

5
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:58,459
It's all my fault.

6
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,489
It has nothing to do with Shan Shan.

7
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,689
It has nothing to do with Shan Shan?

8
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,459
But...

9
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,760
It's not one-sided at all.

10
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,969
Shan Shan likes me too.

11
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,270
Does Shan Shan like you?

12
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:14,810
She has never admitted to it.

13
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:17,979
No, she didn't.

14
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,409
But...

15
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:22,379
Please don't give her a hard time.

16
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,879
I'm not trying to give her a hard time.

17
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,319
I'm giving you a hard time.

18
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,750
I want to get to the bottom of this.

19
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,659
I'm not afraid of you giving me a hard time.

20
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,759
I've looked it up.

21
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,460
If I want to be acknowledged by my sweetheart's family,

22
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:37,400
my biggest hurdle will be my father-in-law.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,699
You're like a father to Shan Shan.

24
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:41,699
The harsher you are to me,

25
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,430
the more it shows how much you love Shan Shan.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm happy for her.

27
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,469
You had to look up...

28
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,439
such a trivial matter online?

29
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,280
I grew up alone...

30
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,750
so no one taught me any of this.

31
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,590
Just like now,

32
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,289
moving out of the villa...

33
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:12,659
and spending time with people as if they were my family...

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,830
is all new to me.

35
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,740
It's all thanks to Shan Shan.

36
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:24,680
I know I might not have done well enough...

37
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,650
and if I truly upset you,

38
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,750
I'll move out tomorrow morning.

39
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:32,479
Thank you for the past few days.

40
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:41,629
Well...

41
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,729
You're a guest in my home.

42
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,759
Don't worry.

43
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,699
We've agreed to take you in...

44
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,969
so we won't go back on our word.

45
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,069
Thank you, Uncle.

46
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,840
I'm not your uncle.

47
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,610
I'll make sure you and Shan Shan acknowledge me.

48
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,389
Both of you are unemployed.

49
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:08,719
Are you still in the mood for romance?

50
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,590
Listen up.

51
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,789
I'll be watching you.

52
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,160
I promise that...

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,959
I'll tackle the issues in the company as soon as possible.

54
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,500
I'll also protect Shan Shan's dream.

55
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,410
I'm going to bed.

56
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:33,949
Right.

57
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,610
If there's anything you don't know, don't look it up online.

58
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,079
Just ask me.

59
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,350
I'm a human encyclopedia.

60
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,350
I'm very knowledgeable.

61
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,259
You should go to bed too.

62
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,509
Good morning, Uncle.

63
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,689
Did you make this?

64
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,490
Shan Shan told me...

65
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,060
her aunt makes delicious omelets.

66
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,860
That's why I made it according to her recipe.

67
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:19,860
Please try it.

68
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,060
Don't worry about it.

69
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,300
Well, Shan Shan, she...

70
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,930
Shan Shan went to the station early this morning...

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,829
to pick up Aunt.

72
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,899
Please try it.

73
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:42,709
Does it taste okay?

74
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,480
It's okay.

75
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,379
It's okay.

76
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,620
Well...

77
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,250
There aren't many ingredients left in the fridge.

78
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,290
If you have some time,

79
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,589
could you take me to the supermarket?

80
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,290
Okay.

81
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,730
I'll get back to work.

82
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,500
Enjoy your meal.

83
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,100
At the same price, this has better quality.

84
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:36,430
Why?

85
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,269
We can tell the quality of meat...

86
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,610
by its color and fat distribution.

87
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,569
Look at this meat.

88
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,740
It's pink.

89
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,980
The fat is evenly distributed.

90
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,180
Its color hasn't turned gray or yellow...

91
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,110
due to oxidization.

92
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,449
So this meat is better.

93
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,449
It has been hard on you.

94
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,449
What's going on?

95
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,990
Lu Sen clearly turned down the Edge-N project.

96
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:07,060
There's evidence that indicates...

97
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,389
Mr. Lu authorized it on the intranet.

98
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,430
In my opinion,

99
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,829
before we reach a conclusion for the internal investigation,

100
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,600
I hope no one jumps to conclusions.

101
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,670
Isn't it obvious?

102
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,410
Lu Sen wants to drag down the whole company.

103
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,310
You can't say that.

104
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,410
IMU was founded...

105
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:29,810
by Mr. Lu's father single-handedly.

106
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,320
You said he dragged the whole company down.

107
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,679
What's in it for him?

108
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,320
Don't forget...

109
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:39,759
that IMU doesn't just belong to the Lu family.

110
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,759
What's the point in saying this now?

111
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,870
I'm here on behalf of my father...

112
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:49,200
to resolve the issues...

113
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,169
and get the company back on its feet.

114
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,600
I think right now,

115
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:57,409
it's best for you to make a statement...

116
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,610
as the CEO of IMU Tech Group...

117
00:08:58,809 --> 00:08:59,980
to appease our users first.

118
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,080
Mr. Lu still has...

119
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,549
a Smartbot project...

120
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,690
that will make IMU TECH Group...

121
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,950
a top IT company worldwide.

122
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,059
If you burn the bridges now,

123
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,620
you will be losing...

124
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,330
more than just Mr. Lu.

125
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,269
Is Lu Sen the only one capable...

126
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,940
of developing the Smartbot project?

127
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,570
In your opinion,

128
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,879
what other project is there that's worth recommending?

129
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,549
It's kind of a coincidence.

130
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,580
A while ago,

131
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,250
I happened to come across...

132
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,320
a team of top-tier Smartbot developers.

133
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,990
Nothing was set in stone.

134
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,389
I didn't want to announce it so soon.

135
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,129
But what if this collaboration is just in time to resolve...

136
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,899
our company's current crisis?

137
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,870
I don't mind flaunting myself as a veteran staff...

138
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,539
to seal this deal as soon as possible.

139
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,340
A top-tier overseas team?

140
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,039
Since Mr. Li is also able to get hold of a competent team,

141
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,039
you shouldn't be so modest.

142
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:10,450
It's a little early to be saying that, isn't it?

143
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,450
What does Mr. Li's robot look like?

144
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,149
None of us have seen it.

145
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,460
I wonder if this means...

146
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,590
whoever is capable of developing a top-tier Smartbot...

147
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:24,629
is qualified to take the CEO position?

148
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,960
That's right.

149
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,230
If that's what you all think,

150
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,370
I'd like to speak my mind.

151
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,009
Lu Sen isn't here right now.

152
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,139
Someone has to step in.

153
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,110
As for the information leakage,

154
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,440
it has to do with Edge-N Project.

155
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,879
How about bringing Li Zhan back...

156
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,419
to act as deputy CEO for the time being...

157
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,620
to redeem himself?

158
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,620
You can decide what to do with him...

159
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,190
if he doesn't cope well.

160
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,759
Regarding the position of CEO,

161
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,429
we'll discuss it...

162
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,259
after the premium Smartbot project is finalized,

163
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,759
as all of you suggested.

164
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:02,000
The most important issue at hand...

165
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,740
is to tackle the current problems.

166
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,700
What do you think?

167
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:07,669
That's true.

168
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,169
That's right.

169
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,340
Sure, let's do that.

170
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,019
Uncle.

171
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,090
Are you home?

172
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,419
Why did you make Lu Sen do chores...

173
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,389
without asking for my permission?

174
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,429
Exactly. Why did you take him to the supermarket?

175
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,159
I asked him to take me there.

176
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,769
Didn't you say I should get a life?

177
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,200
I've learned a lot today.

178
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,169
Then, you...

179
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,080
Okay, I'll carry them for a while.

180
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,019
Thank you, Uncle.

181
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:56,750
You don't have to be so polite.

182
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,960
Have you changed your attitude?

183
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,429
Does this mean they can date?

184
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Sen.

185
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,399
I think Dad likes you.

186
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,200
En Bao, what do you know?

187
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,399
One ice cream.

188
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,000
Let me have one...

189
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,409
and I'll tell you.

190
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,769
I saw that Sen bought some.

191
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,710
He bought me my favorite strawberry flavor.

192
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,909
It's too cold for ice cream.

193
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,649
You can't have it.

194
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,750
You're so mean.

195
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,049
Just you wait!

196
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,850
You...

197
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,159
That's so En Bao.

198
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:35,830
Let's go.

199
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:39,629
Shan Shan.

200
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,970
I'll make lunch.

201
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,230
You?

202
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,600
En Bao will keep pestering me after she tries your cooking.

203
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:46,870
When you have to leave,

204
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:48,539
I'll never hear the end of it.

205
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,279
Then I'll take you all with me.

206
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,340
Don't flatter yourself.

207
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,710
Don't dream of taking us along.

208
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,309
Right.

209
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:57,919
If you're going to cook, why don't you make more?

210
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,350
Mrs. Wang upstairs and Mr. Li downstairs...

211
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:02,120
used to make me dumplings when I was little.

212
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,419
I want to share some food with them.

213
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,519
Who else?

214
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,000
Ms. Liu.

215
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,529
Don't bother packing up.

216
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:15,600
Why don't you go get Mr. Si?

217
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,600
Yes, Mr. Li.

218
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,070
Come in.

219
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,049
Did you ask to see me?

220
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,879
You haven't decided to quit yet, right?

221
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:33,879
Not yet.

222
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,450
You can tell Lu Sen today...

223
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,690
that the Alpha Team has to vacate their lab as soon as possible.

224
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,429
The Smartbot Friday Project...

225
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,200
might be Lu Sen's personal research,

226
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,960
but the lab still belongs to IMU.

227
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,870
IMU will send someone soon to take over the orange orchard.

228
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:55,340
Okay.

229
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,450
Lu Sen.

230
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,620
My little granddaughter.

231
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,990
Do you still want more?

232
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,120
My youngest granddaughter...

233
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,659
became so picky...

234
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,129
after she had the fish balls you grilled.

235
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,559
I've taught everyone the recipe.

236
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:21,899
You can try it later.

237
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:23,070
Lu Sen is so handsome.

238
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,240
Do you have a girlfriend?

239
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:27,539
Your niece doesn't stand a chance.

240
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,179
He's living with Shan Shan now.

241
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:33,509
Shan Shan, you're so lucky.

242
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,909
You have a boyfriend who looks handsome and cooks well.

243
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,220
It looks like the wedding bells are ringing soon.

244
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,480
Not at all.

245
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,720
No.

246
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,419
Mr. Lu!

247
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,330
Just do as Li Zhan says.

248
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,529
And remind Fu Yang and the others...

249
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,700
to remove the data as soon as they can.

250
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,600
Keep an eye on Li Zhan for me in the company.

251
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,039
If anything happens,

252
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,210
let me know right away.

253
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,509
Got it.

254
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,409
One more thing.

255
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,279
There are 12 days and 17 hours left...

256
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,279
before our contract expires.

257
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,919
That's plenty of time.

258
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:17,149
Hello, Mr. Si.

259
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,519
Yes.

260
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,889
We'll be back soon to pick up Friday.

261
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,799
We'll need two more hours...

262
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,230
to get things done.

263
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,970
Please stall two hours for us.

264
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,500
Okay.

265
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:34,470
Let's speed up.

266
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,570
Okay.

267
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:36,370
What do you think?

268
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,440
Just wait a little longer.

269
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,379
Fu Yang!

270
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:40,580
Fu Yang!

271
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,320
Fu Yang!

272
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:45,149
Mr. Xie.

273
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,120
What's wrong?

274
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,720
Friday...

275
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:49,320
Friday is gone!

276
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,059
What?

277
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,090
Are you here too?

278
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,929
Let's go.

279
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:00,100
Mr. Xie.

280
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,000
Young Master, you're back.

281
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:04,899
It's all my fault.

282
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,570
I didn't safeguard the house.

283
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,070
Are you okay?

284
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:10,669
Fortunately, we were able to secure...

285
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,179
the core information and documents ahead of time.

286
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:13,679
Otherwise, the consequences would be dire.

287
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:15,909
From Mr. Xie's description,

288
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:18,320
those guys move fast.

289
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,320
They don't seem like ordinary thieves.

290
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:22,320
They are most likely to be...

291
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:24,389
an experienced Smartbot team.

292
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,529
Could it be Li Jing Cheng?

293
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,529
At the board meeting,

294
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,029
he said that he had already contacted...

295
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,600
a top-tier Smartbot team from overseas.

296
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:36,399
Is this how he contacted them?

297
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:38,139
We'll just have to see...

298
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,940
if we can find any clues...

299
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,440
from the security footage.

300
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:47,539
Yes, Professor Fu.

301
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,850
I'll project it to the screens.

302
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,019
Stop.

303
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,599
Who is this?

304
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,599
That is Tom.

305
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,799
Who's Tom?

306
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,009
Tom used to be a member of Dr. Fu's lab.

307
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:19,039
He was fired for misconduct.

308
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,609
That's not all.

309
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,180
He's a criminal.

310
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,349
He was the one who framed Dr. Fu.

311
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,750
That's why the professor was blamed for leaking the information.

312
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,089
Not only that, he's a mercenary.

313
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,819
He has no respect for science.

314
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,319
He's the black sheep of the academic world.

315
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,940
Will this bring unforeseen economic benefits...

316
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,299
to the company...

317
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:49,269
just like Lu Sen had claimed?

318
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,839
That's true.

319
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:51,809
Mr. Li.

320
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,250
Friday is a perfect robot.

321
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:58,750
But they only used her as a silly emotional companion.

322
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,349
What's the matter with them?

323
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,420
It's a beautiful robot.

324
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,119
I want to see it with my own eyes.

325
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,490
Okay.

326
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
Hi, Friday.

327
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,700
She even smiles?

328
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,410
Friday.

329
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,579
Hello, Director Li Jing Cheng.

330
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,079
Do you know who I am?

331
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,450
Board Member and shareholder of IMU Tech Group,

332
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,789
co-founder along with Master's father, Lu Cheng,

333
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,319
and Mr. Kang Da Liang.

334
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:46,200
Answer me.

335
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,000
Is your master Lu Sen?

336
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:49,299
Yes.

337
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,730
So Friday,

338
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,869
reset all the previous settings.

339
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:56,410
Make me your new master.

340
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,210
I can't change the settings.

341
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,440
Why?

342
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,680
Well, Mr. Li, calm down.

343
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,910
Friday, sleep mode.

344
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,450
Mr. Li.

345
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,019
Those guys are so sneaky.

346
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,059
They have removed Friday's core data in advance.

347
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,329
So now her core settings are locked.

348
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,660
It can't be changed.

349
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,170
I've tried to hack the key to her system,

350
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,000
but I haven't succeeded.

351
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,470
But it's okay, Mr. Li.

352
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,339
When Fu Yang was in the lab,

353
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,569
he was very timid.

354
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,809
He wouldn't dare to do anything to a robot's core system.

355
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,079
Give me some time.

356
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:33,880
If I force my way in,

357
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,210
I'm sure he'll give me the key.

358
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,079
Make it fast.

359
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,319
Don't worry.

360
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,549
I don't want the shareholders to look down on me.

361
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,460
He's working with Li Jing Cheng,

362
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:49,730
but he can't openly announce...

363
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,500
that Friday is their new project.

364
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,029
Are they just going to make a copy of her?

365
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:56,299
Even if they make a copy,

366
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,069
Tom doesn't have what it takes to do that in a short time.

367
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,910
First of all, we have to link up with Friday.

368
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,240
Second, we'll have to figure out...

369
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:07,910
where they are hiding Friday.

370
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:10,809
Li Jing Cheng is just using Friday...

371
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,680
to take over the company as the CEO.

372
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,019
He'll seek further assistance once he finds out...

373
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,890
that Tom can't handle Friday.

374
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,720
Covertly, we can contact all top AI research teams...

375
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:21,460
nationwide and worldwide.

376
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,789
I'm sure we'll find some clues.

377
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:25,730
I'll have Mr. Si look into evidence...

378
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,430
of Li Jing Cheng's embezzlement in public.

379
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:31,170
Knowing him, he'll panic for sure.

380
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Okay, so our main goal is to locate Friday.

381
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:37,410
I'll also share her information in my part-timers' chatroom.

382
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,410
They don't have any access to executives,

383
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,349
but there are many of us.

384
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,710
We can do this if we all work together.

385
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:45,420
One more question.

386
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:48,420
We don't know what Li Jing Cheng and his son...

387
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,319
are up to at IMU.

388
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,960
Ms. Kang, you can't go in.

389
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,430
Ms. Kang, you can't go in.

390
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,559
- Step aside. - Ms. Kang...

391
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,099
Mr. Li.

392
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:06,670
Must you and your father go in for the kill?

393
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:09,539
It's okay, Ms. Liu.

394
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:10,670
Get back to work.

395
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,809
Ms. Kang.

396
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,410
What brings you here...

397
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:16,680
in such a hurry?

398
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,819
Why did you kick out Alpha Team?

399
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,079
It's strictly business.

400
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,220
Strictly business?

401
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,750
I think you're abusing your power to take revenge.

402
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,259
Li Zhan.

403
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,420
Lu Sen lost everything because of you.

404
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,529
As for the Edge-N Project,

405
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,160
you know very well who he took the blame for.

406
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,730
Friday has been taken away.

407
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,759
You don't care anymore, do you?

408
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,500
What about Friday?

409
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:36,700
You don't know?

410
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
Or are you just pretending?

411
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,240
Li Zhan.

412
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:42,170
I really don't know you anymore.

413
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,880
You said you didn't want to end up like your dad.

414
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,809
But you're becoming more and more like him now.

415
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,210
Ms. Kang.

416
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:52,319
If you're not here to discuss work...

417
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,089
Didn't you always want to know why Lu Sen snubbed you?

418
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,390
Ask your dad.

419
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,559
What did he do?

420
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,759
He said he adopted Lu Sen out of kindness.

421
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,930
He just wanted the Lu family's assets for himself.

422
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,829
Back then, he should also be held accountable...

423
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,740
for the accident that killed Lu Sen's parents.

424
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,009
Do you know what you're saying?

425
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,670
You better give your dad a piece of advice.

426
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,240
People always leave evidence behind for the things they have done.

427
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,910
It's just a matter of time before they get busted.

428
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,019
(Missing Person)

429
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,019
Come on.

430
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,390
Look at how small my shop is.

431
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,960
Why are you doing this to me?

432
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:09,730
I can't put these up anywhere else.

433
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:10,930
It has to be your store.

434
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,130
You're the best.

435
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,230
All right, I got it.

436
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,730
Anyway,

437
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,940
you only take advantage of a good friend like me.

438
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,470
I'll hand out a few more inside.

439
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,839
- Go ahead. - Okay.

440
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,460
Mr. Lu.

441
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,099
You can even recognize me like this?

442
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,869
Yes, it's obvious.

443
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,440
Can I get you anything?

444
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:57,569
It's okay.

445
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,440
You're dressed like this because...

446
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,440
It doesn't matter. How did it go?

447
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:02,380
What did you discover?

448
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,680
According to your prompts,

449
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:06,150
I cracked some encrypted files from Research and Development.

450
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,890
Mr. Li's trusted aides mostly manage these documents.

451
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,720
Based on the content of the documents,

452
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,319
he's running a secret lab...

453
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,990
with the company's funds.

454
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:17,160
Some of the research is similar to Alpha Team's projects.

455
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:18,329
Do you have any evidence?

456
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,160
We need to check the company's accounts in the past few years.

457
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,099
It's troublesome without you.

458
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,529
I'll help you.

459
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,140
How are you doing at work?

460
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,740
Mr. Li has started to bribe me.

461
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,509
He must be offering you a lot of money.

462
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:34,240
My contract as your employee hasn't expired yet.

463
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,309
Before it expires,

464
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:37,279
I won't accept anyone's invitation.

465
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,420
I'll have to kick Li Jing Cheng out...

466
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,519
before your contract expires.

467
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:44,690
Thank you, sir.

468
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,890
I'd like to continue working with you.

469
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:05,410
Leave him be.

470
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:08,980
Tom is despicable.

471
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,250
He knows our fears...

472
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,650
so he keeps driving daggers into our hearts.

473
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,190
Whenever we manage to connect to Friday,

474
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,160
he activates the program.

475
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,059
We're always one step away.

476
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,029
What happens if this program is activated?

477
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,130
Friday will self-destruct.

478
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,839
They don't even care how they will damage Friday.

479
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,309
So what do we do next?

480
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,150
It doesn't look like a firewall or manual intervention.

481
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,250
It's as if Friday has rejected it.

482
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,359
They want to re-format Friday.

483
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:56,190
We can't get through to her.

484
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,500
As for Friday's defense system, they also can't crack it.

485
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,230
I think he's desperate.

486
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,170
It's like formatting a computer.

487
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,930
They cleaned out all of the documents on the hard drive.

488
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:06,369
That's trying to take out enemies through self-destruction.

489
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,970
But Friday's documents...

490
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
will also be deleted.

491
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,950
It's not that easy to format Friday.

492
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,960
We can't rule out that Tom will try anything.

493
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,589
He has resorted to such means...

494
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,329
We can also think of other ways.

495
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,369
Keep an eye on...

496
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,200
what Lu Sen is going to do next.

497
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,369
If anything happens,

498
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,109
you have to tell me immediately.

499
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,410
That punk,

500
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,650
he was born arrogant.

501
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,710
We can't allow him to get back on his feet.

502
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:52,880
If so, what awaits us...

503
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:54,680
will be an act of revenge like no other.

504
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,619
Yes, Mr. Li.

505
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:57,920
By the way,

506
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,420
Mr. Li Zhan called you more than 10 times today...

507
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,289
to ask you about Friday.

508
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,759
What did you say to him?

509
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,259
I told him that you went out early this morning...

510
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:07,230
to meet a client at an ecological farm in the suburbs.

511
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,900
You don't know about Friday.

512
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:12,500
Bear this in mind.

513
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,740
Li Zhan mustn't know about anything that we've done.

514
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,779
Yes, Mr. Li.

515
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:50,769
Shan Shan, what are you doing?

516
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,839
I'm sorry.

517
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:55,950
Shan Shan.

518
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,549
Will you stop making things worse?

519
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,750
You should know how troubled we are about Friday's issue.

520
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,950
Fu Yang! How could you say that?

521
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,220
No.

522
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,789
All right. I just came to bring you breakfast.

523
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,730
I was too careless just now. I'm sorry.

524
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:09,829
I'm sorry.

525
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:11,960
I'm sorry.

526
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:12,799
It's okay.

527
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:14,400
Finish your breakfast.

528
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:15,799
We'll get going.

529
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,170
Let's go.

530
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,200
Let's go.

531
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,569
Have some breakfast.

532
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,230
I...

533
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,529
I actually wanted to help them.

534
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,759
And it didn't work out.

535
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:50,029
Friday.

536
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:51,940
Friend Mode.

537
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,039
Are you malfunctioning now?

538
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,680
So you're only on Operation Mode?

539
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,690
When has Yang Shan Shan...

540
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,690
become someone who only apologizes?

541
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:14,059
You apologized when you cooked.

542
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,890
You apologized when you brought them food.

543
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,559
Who says you can't do anything right?

544
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,900
You can still help me look for Friday.

545
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,069
When I feel disheartened,

546
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:29,240
you can cheer me up.

547
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,809
You've said it yourself.

548
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,509
Showing concern can cheer me up.

549
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,200
Hello?

550
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,730
This is Kang Li Er speaking.

551
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:59,569
Please contact a few overseas research teams for me.

552
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,539
- Please come again. - Okay.

553
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,509
Right.

554
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:07,980
Have you seen...

555
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,910
a Smartbot that looks like this?

556
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,750
Friday has been stolen from Alpha Team.

557
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:12,880
Here is her file.

558
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,819
Don't hesitate to call us if you notice anything.

559
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,589
I've never heard of it.

560
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,930
She looks just like my friend.

561
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,529
Yes, but she has short hair.

562
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,559
And her fringe comes up here. She has straight bangs.

563
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,599
Have you seen it?

564
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:31,069
No, I haven't.

565
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:34,599
Send me the new data.

566
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:43,579
Mr. Si.

567
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,279
Same place tomorrow afternoon.

568
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,349
Let's meet.

569
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:54,819
Go ahead and eat.

570
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:55,990
Don't be so down.

571
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:58,190
If you don't eat, you won't have the energy to look for Friday.

572
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,640
Welcome.

573
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:09,170
Excuse me, you two.

574
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,470
Have you seen...

575
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:12,210
the missing girl on the poster?

576
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,180
I haven't.

577
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,349
No.

578
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:16,450
Me neither.

579
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,279
Thank you.

580
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,250
It's okay.

581
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,349
Two lattes, please.

582
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,150
Please have a seat.

583
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,410
I'm sorry.

584
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,220
Aren't you the CEO who leaked information?

585
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:52,980
What are you doing here?

586
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:54,019
That's right.

587
00:31:57,589 --> 00:31:59,660
Does he want to kill himself here to put on an act?

588
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,990
Stop right there!

589
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:04,059
Are you insulting him when you're using his product?

590
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,230
Is this even okay?

591
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,130
Do your small brains make you look taller?

592
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Let's go.

593
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,599
What are you doing? Get going.

594
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:16,910
Let's go.

595
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,440
There you go.

596
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,849
I prefer the straightforward Yang Shan Shan.

597
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:27,349
It's not good for me to be so impulsive.

598
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,089
It's good.

599
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,890
What happened? Why did you stop in your tracks?

600
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,930
That was the first time...

601
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,130
that I dared to cross the road after the accident.

602
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:52,740
My parents...

603
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:54,509
were killed on the road by the coast.

604
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,049
Shan Shan.

605
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,680
Since that day,

606
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,880
you've been the first person who ever hugged me.

607
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,390
Thank you, Shan Shan.

608
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,660
You brought me back into this world.

609
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,700
Cheer up.
