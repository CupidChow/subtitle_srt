Is that for you to ask me?

None of your business.

152

It's okay, Friday.

168

Before Lu Sen finds out.

170
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,990
Who are you afraid to be found out by?

171
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,110
Dr. Fu.

172
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Who are you?

173
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,960
Don't come over.

174
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
You...

175
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,700
This is a laboratory.

176
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,320
Outsiders cannot come in as they please.

177
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Please leave.

178
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Please leave.

179
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:24,349
[Infinity]

180
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,810
I was really the one who spoilt it.

181
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,984
(Who are you?)

182
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,110
(Are you Lu Sen's friend?)

183
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,960
How do you know my name?

184
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,840
Do we know each other?

185
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,760
You've asked me so many questions.

186
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,440
Which should I answer first?

187
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,375
Dr. Fu, how about this?

188
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,115
You answer my question first.

189
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:26,149
What's your relationship
with the robot inside?

190
00:16:29,665 --> 00:16:30,805
Are you nervous?

191
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:32,805
Am I that scary?

192
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:34,161
I'm not nervous.

193
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:39,175
That means you have a secret
that others can't know about.

194
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:41,815
Is it a secret that Lu Sen can't know about?

195
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:45,655
There's no secret.

196
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:51,905
If I didn't see wrongly, Dr. Fu
has an amazing masterpiece.

197
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:53,815
It's okay if you don't want to show it to me now,

198
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:55,495
there'll be chances in the future.

199
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:57,175
I don't let other people come in here.

200
00:16:57,175 --> 00:16:59,305
Next time, you better... I'll come often.

201
00:16:59,305 --> 00:17:03,229
Dr. Fu, I will also find a way
to know your secret with Lu Sen.

202
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:18,135
No,

203
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:20,825
I have to find a way to make it up to him.

204
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:23,657
Otherwise, I'll feel really bad.

205
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:34,019
Friday?

206
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:47,305
Shouldn't you be at home?

207
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:48,565
Why are you out here?

208
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:51,705
Master asked me to scan the image of the yard.

209
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:55,159
Then shall I take you around?

210
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:57,825
Mr. Xie, I have an
automatic navigation function

211
00:17:57,825 --> 00:17:59,425
and can do the scan on my own.

212
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:00,705
Is that so?

213
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,861
Then, when you go around
by yourself, don't get lost.

214
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:05,945
Yes, Mr. Xie.

215
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:07,865
Alright, go then.

216
00:18:11,455 --> 00:18:15,019
How fascinating...
Almost like a real person.

217
00:18:17,585 --> 00:18:18,629
What a genius.

218
00:18:35,305 --> 00:18:37,305
Your recovery time has shortened.

219
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:38,397
How long was it?

220
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,305
About an hour.

221
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:46,077
Anyway, it's faster than the previous time.

222
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,375
This is within the error range,

223
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,065
or rather, your attack this time
was not very serious.

224
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,375
What do you mean?

225
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,735
Didn't you receive the signal from my watch?

226
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,785
You were almost unable to
receive a call from me ever.

227
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:00,465
You didn't die, right?

228
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:02,065
Dr. Ou.

229
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:03,349
Are you serious?

230
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:04,545
Okay.

231
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:05,905
Wait, I'll come.

232
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:07,455
Once I finish my work,
I'll come see you in a few days.

233
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:08,705
I have a lot of patients recently.

234
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:09,857
I'll hang up now.

235
00:19:28,305 --> 00:19:31,905
Looking at it like this...
it is pretty relaxing.

236
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:39,215
Friday!

237
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:43,455
Friday!

238
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,163
Where did she go?

239
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,375
I haven't done physical work in a long time.

240
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,635
My arms and legs...

241
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,491
Excuse me.

242
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:04,135
Shanshan, your way works.

243
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:08,467
This is called a two-pronged
approach that is extremely strong.

244
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:11,065
What mechanical principle is that?

245
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:12,545
Why didn't I think of it?

246
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,615
Does it need to be combined
with three dimensions?

247
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:15,735
What mechanical principle?

248
00:20:15,735 --> 00:20:17,665
This is the principle of a part-timer.

249
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:19,905
This is the result of
my experience working

250
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:21,765
for many people over the years.

251
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:22,786
I'll try it too.

252
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:23,665
Here, you chase me.

253
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:24,186
I'll chase you.

254
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:25,305
Let's compete. Ready, go!

255
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:25,906
Excuse me!

256
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:27,346
Both of you, be careful!

257
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:29,069
Friday mode!

258
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:30,705
Start!

259
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,615
(What is this?)

260
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,247
(Smiling so happily...)

261
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:51,705
(Usually when you're with me, )

262
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:53,865
(I don't see you smiling like this.)

263
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:10,825
Friday!

264
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:20,205
What are you doing?

265
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:23,096
It's so cold.

266
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:24,615
Why did they ask you to work outside?

267
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:26,855
Don't they know that you
will run out of battery quickly?

268
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:28,775
What if there's any malfunction?

269
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,375
Master, today's temperature is
between eight and two degrees,

270
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,615
it's not considered cold.

271
00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:37,447
Also, they were teaching me

272
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:39,225
the newest human skills.

273
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:41,545
Even I have never asked you to do such taxing work.

274
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:43,066
Also, I'm your master.

275
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:44,735
Why were you so far from me just now?

276
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:47,215
Coming all the way to the yard from the villa.

277
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:49,025
(Is this guy jealous over us laughing)

278
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:50,495
(and being rowdy because he doesn't)

279
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:51,635
(have any friends?)

280
00:21:57,255 --> 00:21:58,887
Did they call you over?

281
00:22:04,785 --> 00:22:06,105
Put your hands inside.

282
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:12,535
You'll be cold and run out of battery.

283
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:29,187
Robots don't need this.

284
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:37,905
Where are you going?

285
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:40,905
Hurry and go back to charge yourself and get warm.

286
00:22:46,905 --> 00:22:47,905
You can walk me up till here.

287
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:49,225
I can go in by myself.

288
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,195
I want to personally see you get charged.

289
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:18,585
Mr. Lu.

290
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:21,045
Why are you hiding there?

291
00:23:22,455 --> 00:23:23,305
This is my laboratory.

292
00:23:23,305 --> 00:23:25,945
Is there something wrong with me being here?

293
00:23:27,785 --> 00:23:29,705
Even so, you can't order Friday to work.

294
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:31,786
Today, the butler used
my scientists as servants,

295
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:33,766
and I didn't say anything, right?

296
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:37,065
Then, you shouldn't let her do the cleaning, right?

297
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:38,805
We clean such a huge place...

298
00:23:39,495 --> 00:23:40,256
every day.

299
00:23:40,256 --> 00:23:42,495
Don't you think we're a little shorthanded?

300
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:43,375
No, I don't.

301
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,735
I don't like people showing up in front of me.

302
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:46,905
And we can?

303
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:47,905
No.

304
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:51,195
It's because of Friday that I allow it.

305
00:23:51,945 --> 00:23:54,517
You've already said this... Looks like

306
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:56,375
it might be better if we move out.

307
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:56,906
Okay.

308
00:23:56,906 --> 00:23:58,249
With Friday.

309
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,855
Then, no.

310
00:24:03,335 --> 00:24:05,675
Can I take Friday inside to charge now?

311
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:09,665
Not you.

312
00:24:11,545 --> 00:24:12,425
Why not?

313
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:14,255
Because it's very messy inside.

314
00:24:14,255 --> 00:24:18,239
I don't know if anything will
explode if you touch something.

315
00:24:20,665 --> 00:24:21,665
Wait.

316
00:24:23,335 --> 00:24:26,135
Since your people have even
asked Friday to do cleaning,

317
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:28,545
they must have a lot of confidence
in her battery life.

318
00:24:28,545 --> 00:24:29,685
From tomorrow,

319
00:24:30,305 --> 00:24:33,065
I want Friday for six hours every day.

320
00:24:33,065 --> 00:24:34,065
Okay, Mr. Lu.

321
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:52,615
So all of a sudden, I have
to work three more hours?

322
00:24:52,615 --> 00:24:54,665
He now completely believes you are a robot,

323
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:56,615
so these three hours shouldn't be a problem.

324
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:59,435
How do you know that he completely believes it?

325
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,135
Have you watched a movie called Ex Machina?

326
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:02,135
No.

327
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,456
When humans spend a long time
together with robots, they will suspect

328
00:25:06,456 --> 00:25:08,305
if they have become a robot as well.

329
00:25:08,305 --> 00:25:09,925
So do you suspect yourself?

330
00:25:12,585 --> 00:25:13,585
No.

331
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:17,545
See?

332
00:25:17,545 --> 00:25:19,585
You don't suspect yourself either.

333
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:39,211
Dad, Mom.

334
00:25:39,545 --> 00:25:40,637
I'm back.

335
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:41,975
Li'er?

336
00:25:43,065 --> 00:25:44,135
Look at her.

337
00:25:44,135 --> 00:25:45,585
She didn't even tell us she was coming back early.

338
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,855
Exactly!

339
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:47,855
Li'er.

340
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,065
Dad.

341
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:49,546
Oh, right.

342
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:51,166
Did Lu Sen go to fetch you?

343
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:53,065
She just came back.

344
00:25:53,065 --> 00:25:54,585
Can't you ask her something else?

345
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:55,585
Thank you, Mom.

346
00:25:56,185 --> 00:25:57,425
Are you tired?

347
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:59,095
You haven't eaten, right?

348
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:00,151
I've eaten.

349
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:02,585
Dad, I went to see Lu Sen as well.

350
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:04,095
Good.

351
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,025
Come and have some fruits.

352
00:26:06,025 --> 00:26:06,495
Okay.

353
00:26:06,495 --> 00:26:11,135
Li'er, make sure you spend
more time with Lu Sen.

354
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:13,095
After all, your wedding is approaching.

355
00:26:13,095 --> 00:26:14,585
- Come on.
- Have some fruits.

356
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:17,785
Dad, you're talking about all
these groundless things again.

357
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:21,185
I urgently called you to
come back from the UK

358
00:26:21,185 --> 00:26:24,965
for your wedding with Lu Sen.

359
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,785
You don't know,

360
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:30,011
but there's an undercurrent
among the Board of Directors.

361
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:34,545
At this important time, if you
announce that you're marrying Lu Sen,

362
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:38,577
you can immediately have
a foothold in the company.

363
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:39,665
Dad.

364
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:40,705
Which one is more important?

365
00:26:40,705 --> 00:26:42,095
My happiness or my shares in the company?

366
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:44,735
Of course, your happiness is more important.

367
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:49,539
I want to give you an easy life.

368
00:26:50,135 --> 00:26:52,305
You and Lu Sen grew up together.

369
00:26:52,305 --> 00:26:59,217
Other than Lu Sen, who else would
be more suitable to make you happy?

370
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,185
Dad, Mom, I'm a little sleepy.

371
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:03,469
I'll go and rest.

372
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,245
What are the market prospects
for humanoid robots?

373
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:06,765
Mostly for emotional companionship.

374
00:28:09,065 --> 00:28:11,455
What kind of companion are we talking about?

375
00:28:11,455 --> 00:28:14,495
Life companion? An emotional companion?

376
00:28:14,495 --> 00:28:17,039
Or something more... physical?

377
00:28:17,135 --> 00:28:19,975
I've heard that Guiwa is
the best for that sort of thing

378
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:21,425
and the best paid.

379
00:28:21,425 --> 00:28:26,741
Could it be that the great Dr. Fu
is looking into the adult market?

380
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:29,665
Will you do anything for money?

381
00:28:29,665 --> 00:28:31,669
The future of humanoid robots

382
00:28:32,255 --> 00:28:34,585
will definitely be used more
for emotional companionship

383
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:37,455
With the advancement of
science, everyone's emotions

384
00:28:37,455 --> 00:28:41,451
will be even more complicated,
delicate, and sensitive.

385
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:44,455
However, in contrast, the physical
distance between individuals

386
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:45,825
will grow wider.

387
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:48,065
Humanoid robots can
have different responses

388
00:28:48,065 --> 00:28:49,585
and feedback to different human emotions.

389
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:52,255
This is very important to the lives
of people in the future,

390
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:53,945
but if you're going to label the humanoid robots

391
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:58,013
as just sexual companions, I
think you are an insult to our project

392
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,415
and interpreting it superficially.

393
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:04,735
The research for practical and humanoid robots

394
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:07,315
are in two completely different directions.

395
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,185
Luckily, in recent years,

396
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:10,975
the research into the neural network
of humanoid robots

397
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:13,315
has seen important breakthroughs and...

398
00:29:19,255 --> 00:29:21,025
They have seen important
breakthroughs and development.

399
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,637
Of course, this is only a possibility
that we are showing everyone.

400
00:29:39,335 --> 00:29:40,439
Dr. Fu.

401
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,595
This person is definitely not normal.

402
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:56,925
I think the extent of his allergies

403
00:29:57,615 --> 00:29:59,163
might kill him anytime.

404
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:01,255
It's really serious.

405
00:30:01,255 --> 00:30:03,375
I don't know what he's allergic to either.

406
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,835
He doesn't have any dietary restrictions.

407
00:30:07,665 --> 00:30:08,865
And you...

408
00:30:09,945 --> 00:30:11,181
Are you a doctor?

409
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:13,825
Do you have a license to practice medicine?

410
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:15,905
You just took a needle
and gave him a leg injection.

411
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:17,425
What if anything happened?

412
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:20,161
Hey, can't you see how serious it is?

413
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:23,705
If I didn't go and save him, he...
He wouldn't even be around anymore,

414
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:25,585
let alone being your golden ticket.

415
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:27,205
Even so, you can't be rash.

416
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:30,835
I think his emotions are quite unstable

417
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:33,185
and he seems to rely on you as well.

418
00:30:34,185 --> 00:30:35,785
He's a normal person.

419
00:30:35,785 --> 00:30:37,129
He's just...

420
00:30:38,825 --> 00:30:41,765
a little more unsociable
than other normal people.

421
00:30:41,855 --> 00:30:44,591
Actually, he's pretty innocent.

422
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,263
Why do I think you're explaining for him?

423
00:30:51,305 --> 00:30:53,135
What do you mean explaining for him?

424
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:54,785
Hurry and fix your robot.

425
00:30:54,785 --> 00:30:58,545
It's already so hard for me to lie
and pretend I'm a robot every day.

426
00:30:58,545 --> 00:31:01,135
I'm lying to... to such a... poor thing.

427
00:31:01,135 --> 00:31:02,335
Okay, okay.

428
00:31:02,335 --> 00:31:04,065
The parts will be here soon.

429
00:31:04,065 --> 00:31:06,255
The whole earth is experiencing
climate variability,

430
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:07,705
so the delivery is slower.

431
00:31:07,705 --> 00:31:09,925
It'll be quick once it reaches China.

432
00:31:21,025 --> 00:31:22,025
Friday,

433
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:23,665
let me ask you.

434
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:27,493
What allergic reaction will cause
swelling of the whole body?

435
00:31:27,735 --> 00:31:30,375
Among the many allergies,
they will all cause swelling.

436
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:32,025
I will need a more specific description

437
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:34,585
in order to search for the answer for you.

438
00:31:34,585 --> 00:31:38,495
More specific... I don't
know how to explain it.

439
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:44,159
It's different from Enbao's
allergic reaction to peanuts.

440
00:31:44,975 --> 00:31:46,585
There will be rapid swelling.

441
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:47,665
Do you understand?

442
00:31:49,095 --> 00:31:51,255
I don't understand your description.

443
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:00,973
That arrogant Fu Yang.

444
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:03,305
Once the testing is over,

445
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:05,705
you won't be able to wander around
in my house anymore.

446
00:32:05,705 --> 00:32:07,745
You dare to order my robot around?

(Friend?)

454
00:32:35,785 --> 00:32:38,605
