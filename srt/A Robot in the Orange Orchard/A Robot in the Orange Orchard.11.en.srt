1
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,549
(Episode 11, You are My Friend)

2
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,480
You look worried.

3
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,489
Is there anything...

4
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:54,950
I can do for you?

5
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,189
Friday.

6
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,560
If your master acts inappropriately toward you,

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,099
how would you react?

8
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,669
No matter what the master does,

9
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,270
I will serve him with all my heart.

10
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,240
Sir.

11
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:22,180
There are answers you can't find from Friday.

12
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:26,650
You are a decisive person,

13
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,889
but you're so nervous now.

14
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,620
I'm quite surprised.

15
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,330
We had many struggles before...

16
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,500
and things are going steady now.

17
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,800
I can't help but wonder...

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,030
if I should compromise.

19
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,939
In our team,

20
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,069
the one who's the easiest to compromise with reality...

21
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,270
is probably Wang Da Yun.

22
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,909
Sir.

23
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:53,680
Your perception is the only thing that can make you falter.

24
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:55,509
As you know,

25
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:58,479
we made Friday a woman...

26
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,349
to appeal to her better nature,

27
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,789
strong tolerance, and perseverance.

28
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:05,060
What we have made...

29
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,860
is a dream robot.

30
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,699
We tried to anthropomorphize her...

31
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:15,129
so we must give her dignity and a bottom line.

32
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:17,840
Friday is evolving all the time.

33
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,669
If she appears in front of the world...

34
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,009
with a shallow...

35
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,569
and simple image,

36
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,479
then the world will doubt her for sure.

37
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,810
Shallow and simple.

38
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:30,250
Lu Sen knows AI.

39
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,849
His IQ is 159.

40
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,750
But even he...

41
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,360
Maybe that's just human nature.

42
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,699
I don't know if what we're doing...

43
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,430
is helping Friday...

44
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,669
or is holding her back.

45
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,370
I'm afraid no one knows the answer to that question.

46
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,879
But sir,

47
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,409
no matter what decision you make,

48
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,009
we believe in you.

49
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,319
It's late.

50
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:06,680
Get some rest.

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,020
I'm going to bed.

52
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,870
Do you know what time it is?

53
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,810
Why isn't Friday here yet?

54
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,310
Did you forget to charge her?

55
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,250
Friday will never go to work again.

56
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,279
There will be no more tests.

57
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,220
What do you mean?

58
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,720
Do you not want to take the development fee...

59
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,259
or do you want to raise the price?

60
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,259
I'll find a new investor...

61
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,990
and we will leave as soon as we can.

62
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,560
You want to leave?

63
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,430
Says who?

64
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:53,769
Says I.

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,240
You signed a contract and received a deposit.

66
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,740
Do you mean the 300 million for breach of contract?

67
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,240
Don't worry.

68
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,009
I'll find investors,

69
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,279
pay you back and cut ties with you the soonest as I can.

70
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,209
If you offend IMU,

71
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,310
who would dare to invest in you?

72
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,819
I have no choice but to be honest.

73
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,050
Lu Sen.

74
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:17,660
I thought you knew what we've been doing.

75
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,829
I thought you knew Friday was special...

76
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:21,759
and would respect her.

77
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,930
I thought we could create...

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,759
a new era of intelligent robots.

79
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,040
But to my surprise,

80
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,639
you are nothing but a pervert...

81
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,680
who loves lowbrow entertainment.

82
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:40,240
What?

83
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:42,209
I am a pervert?

84
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,050
Fu Yang, what's wrong with you?

85
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,819
What happened yesterday in the amusement park?

86
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,319
Do I need to repeat it myself?

87
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,290
Wait.

88
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,319
That was a misunderstanding.

89
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,490
The urge was too strong.

90
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,660
I couldn't help it.

91
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,759
You could just say you had a boner.

92
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,029
I'm really disappointed in you.

93
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,699
I'm officially canceling the contract.

94
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,670
Alpha Team will leave as soon as possible.

95
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:04,839
Hey.

96
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,769
What's wrong, Da Yun?

97
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,040
My stomach hurts.

98
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,709
As I heard the contract is being terminated,

99
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:12,879
I feel like...

100
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:18,680
Sir.

101
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,220
Don't worry.

102
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,689
I'll find an investor soon.

103
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,529
Inform Yang Shan Shan...

104
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,930
her part-time job is over.

105
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,199
I'm going to give her some money.

106
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:33,560
Also,

107
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,029
that armor she's wearing,

108
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,800
don't forget to take it off.

109
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,269
Got it.

110
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:50,819
Find out which company...

111
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,279
is buying the Alpha Team's robots.

112
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,019
What?

113
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,350
Are they selling it to someone else?

114
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,920
And when you do, find a way to stop it.

115
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,490
Find out what the scientists want.

116
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,389
You must not let Friday leave me.

117
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:03,290
Understood, Mr. Lu.

118
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:07,000
And find out more about Fu Yang's past in England.

119
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:18,980
I miss this place since I haven't been here for a day.

120
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,879
Shan Shan, remember this.

121
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,279
You're a little car.

122
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,250
You're a car, you know?

123
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,220
Don't overthink it.

124
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,329
Friday?

125
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,459
Why are you out here?

126
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,629
It's way past work hours.

127
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:40,529
Hello, Mr. Xie.

128
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,100
Hey.

129
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,199
Hello.

130
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,430
I just saw Mr. Xie...

131
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,139
took Shan Shan to Lu Sen.

132
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,040
Shan Shan doesn't have her glasses or earphones on.

133
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,480
Will we get caught?

134
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,709
I don't know.

135
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:27,410
I can't reach Shan Shan at all.

136
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,050
Shouldn't we inform Dr. Fu about this?

137
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:30,209
Forget it.

138
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,649
He has his own affairs to deal with.

139
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,620
I believe Shan Shan will take care of it.

140
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,720
Goodbye, Mr. Xie.

141
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,100
What should I do?

142
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,129
I don't have my earphones or glasses.

143
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,740
Okay, Dr. Ou.

144
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,639
See you later.

145
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,649
What is Friday up to now?

146
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,570
Friday.

147
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,009
Well done.

148
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,279
Whenever I call you,

149
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:32,809
no matter who stops you,

150
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,009
you can appear before me anywhere and anytime.

151
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,549
I'm still going to criticize you though.

152
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,090
Criticize me?

153
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,389
Because you're a robot.

154
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,159
You're a robot and have no heart.

155
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:48,730
That's the reason to criticize you.

156
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,100
Starting today,

157
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,899
you must learn from me.

158
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,029
I want to be in...

159
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,570
your heart-shaped hardware.

160
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,379
But...

161
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:10,509
that's going to take a lot of power.

162
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,649
Then...

163
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,620
for how long can you stay with me from now on?

164
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,590
If you activate Power Saving Mode,

165
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:20,990
I can stay with you for eight hours.

166
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,659
Friday.

167
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,759
Activate Power Saving Mode.

168
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,500
Activating Power Saving Mode.

169
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,600
Just a reminder.

170
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,529
I can't do my job on Power Saving Mode.

171
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, I'll do it.

172
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:34,210
Then you deactivate it.

173
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:36,970
Let's see later.

174
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,509
Come with me.

175
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,649
Have a seat.

176
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,879
Don't stand around and drain the power.

177
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,419
What's wrong?

178
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,490
Friday.

179
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,320
Someone asked me...

180
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,490
what our relationship was.

181
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,129
Guess what I said.

182
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,230
What did you say?

183
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,000
I said...

184
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:03,399
you're an ingrate.

185
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,299
If someone calls you,

186
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,039
you obediently follow that person around.

187
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,769
But even if you are like this,

188
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,679
you are the first friend I made all these years.

189
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,049
Do you understand?

190
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,049
I understand.

191
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,289
Friday.

192
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,059
I'll protect you.

193
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:41,539
What about the robot?

194
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,870
We still have a little problem with the robot,

195
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,440
but the core works fine.

196
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:49,779
We're missing some parts...

197
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,220
and it causes uncoordinated movements.

198
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:52,950
But it won't take long before we fix it.

199
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:54,750
I see.

200
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,360
Your reputation in the industry has been...

201
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,120
You know.

202
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,330
We meet this time because your mentor,

203
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,730
Professor Hu, set it up.

204
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,730
But only with this video...

205
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,429
and not meeting the robot in person,

206
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,039
it's hard for me to make any decisions.

207
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,769
That's a very reasonable concern.

208
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,110
How about this?

209
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,009
Once the robot is fixed,

210
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,080
I'll show it to you right away.

211
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,110
Okay.

212
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,519
Also, the price is a bit too high.

213
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,250
No matter how good this robot is,

214
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,519
I'm afraid the company won't pay that much.

215
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:33,090
You know what? Let's bargain.

216
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:34,590
Make it 150 million dollars, okay?

217
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,100
That price did work before,

218
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:41,370
but now we have to pay a penalty...

219
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:43,100
of 300 million dollars for breach of contract.

220
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,399
Our research team can do it for free.

221
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,809
Then there's nothing I can do.

222
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,409
With this price,

223
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,779
I think it's not likely we will work together.

224
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:56,049
It's not just our company.

225
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,480
I don't think other companies...

226
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:00,080
will pay such an amount of money.

227
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:02,950
Who was your buyer?

228
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,389
It's okay.

229
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,360
You don't have to tell me.

230
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:10,789
It's Lu Sen of IMU, right?

231
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,330
He's a financial thief infamous in the industry.

232
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,570
He always marks...

233
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,039
huge compensation on the contracts.

234
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,669
Once you sign the contract,

235
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,570
you have sold yourself to him.

236
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,639
It's hard to get out of it.

237
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,210
No one would take over at such a high cost.

238
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:36,820
Mr. Peng.

239
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,519
I'm sure you know very well...

240
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,090
that our robot Friday...

241
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,389
will bring you a profit of over...

242
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,600
300 million dollars severalfold.

243
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,529
Please keep this meeting...

244
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,740
a secret.

245
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,250
What's this?

246
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,120
It's a bonus...

247
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,649
for all four of you.

248
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,549
On top of that,

249
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,919
Mr. Lu will add 20 million to the development fee.

250
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,690
This is the contract.

251
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,289
The money will be paid in advance...

252
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,059
and deposited immediately...

253
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,200
if you agree to sign it.

254
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,730
We can do it right now.

255
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,730
Mr. Si, we need to confirm this with Dr. Fu.

256
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,470
Hold on.

257
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:28,639
We don't need them.

258
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,639
Take them back.

259
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,460
Are you doubling it?

260
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,370
Go back and tell Lu Sen...

261
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,629
that we won't agree to it no matter how much he pays us.

262
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:58,870
Dr. Fu won't change his mind too.

263
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,610
The Alpha Team sticks together.

264
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,009
And tell Lu Sen to return Friday to us.

265
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,909
Do you hear me?

266
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:08,179
Don't just stand there.

267
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:08,909
Get to work.

268
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,629
Mr. Li.

269
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,570
Mr. Li.

270
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,169
I asked around.

271
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,169
Lu Sen is indeed involved...

272
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,769
in a humanoid robot project.

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,139
I saw the videos.

274
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,440
It's amazing.

275
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,710
But he said it's still being adjusted.

276
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,049
Whether that's true or not,

277
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,450
we'll look into it.

278
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,480
This nephew of mine...

279
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,820
is always causing trouble.

280
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,220
He's just like his dad.

281
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,519
However, we still have to help him investigate.

282
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,230
We can't let those people fool him.

283
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,629
If IMU gets dragged into it,

284
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,399
it is not worth it.

285
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,169
But all the investigations...

286
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,269
must be done in private.

287
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,139
Yes, Mr. Li.

288
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,450
Let me introduce you to someone.

289
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:15,909
Dr. Ou.

290
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,250
He has been taking care of me for over 10 years.

291
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,159
Dr. Ou.

292
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,559
Hi, Friday.

293
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,259
Hello, Dr. Ou.

294
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:34,299
Lu Sen said...

295
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,000
you're already a good friend to him.

296
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,230
I wonder...

297
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:39,000
how amazing a robot you are...

298
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,169
to be able to cure his illness.

299
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,110
He hasn't been able to befriend me...

300
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,269
all these years.

301
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,700
Don't stare at her.

302
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,130
She will get shy.

303
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,539
Excuse me.

304
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:15,269
Friday is too human-like.

305
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,369
Even I have a hard time adjusting.

306
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,779
You two sitting together look like a couple...

307
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,279
that comes to me for couple therapy.

308
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,119
Dr. Ou, you're talking too much today.

309
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,890
Is she really a robot?

310
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:36,829
Of course.

311
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,759
Don't be fooled by how she looks now.

312
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:40,829
It's actually full of data...

313
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,569
and wires.

314
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,829
And not only does she curse,

315
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:46,269
but she also does many things that only humans can do.

316
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,140
But that's also her strength.

317
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,539
Only by making robots more human...

318
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:50,940
will make them better company for us.

319
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,480
You must really like her.

320
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,710
You praise her every day.

321
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,220
But before I see Friday,

322
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,720
I didn't expect...

323
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,460
a robot to be so human-like.

324
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,900
Friday.

325
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,359
Please send me a copy of the information...

326
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,170
on your relationship with Lu Sen from now on.

327
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,769
You know his condition.

328
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:21,640
You're the key to today's miracle.

329
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,769
That's why I want to do some research.

330
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,079
Okay.

331
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,750
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

332
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,680
Alpha Team won't accept the deal, no matter what.

333
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,049
And they tell you to return Friday.

334
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:37,920
What?

335
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,089
Aren't they afraid that I'll sue them?

336
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,160
What's wrong?

337
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,700
The Alpha Team wants to terminate my contract.

338
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,230
They want to take Friday away.

339
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,200
Don't worry.

340
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:50,930
I won't let them take you.

341
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,569
Friday believes that...

342
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,009
there must be a misunderstanding.

343
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,180
Whether it's a misunderstanding or intentional,

344
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,039
I won't let you leave me.

345
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,309
I guess you're busy.

346
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:05,549
I'll let you spend time with your robot.

347
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:06,680
Bye.

348
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,500
I think, for whatever reason,

349
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,660
we should know the truth first.

350
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,569
Then figure things out.

351
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,900
There's no need.

352
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,240
I have the most professional lawyers in the country.

353
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,009
I'll think of something.

354
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:30,039
No one knows the Alpha Team better than I do.

355
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,480
How?

356
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,650
It's sincerity.

357
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:37,279
There's no need.

358
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:38,880
It looks like...

359
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,450
my master wants to lose his sweetheart.

360
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,329
Let's give them one more chance.

361
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,200
Don't underestimate these tablewares.

362
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:01,470
They're not very trendy,

363
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,240
but my mom used to serve the guests with them.

364
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,410
Is that sincere enough?

365
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:07,440
You got it right away.

366
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,210
Friday.

367
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:11,980
Because of you,

368
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:14,019
I've done a lot of things I've never done before.

369
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:19,660
Now,

370
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,190
how many dishes do I have to cook for five?

371
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,230
That will be eight dishes and two desserts.

372
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,569
Well, what flavor do they like?

373
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,400
Fu Yang is from Jiangzhe.

374
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,339
He likes it light.

375
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,079
Pai loves dessert.

376
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:40,309
Da Yun is from Sichuan. He likes spicy food.

377
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:41,980
Li Cha De is a 1.5-generation immigrant.

378
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:43,880
Making him Chinese food is the way to go.

379
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,150
It's so troublesome.

380
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,549
- Are you... - I can do it.

381
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,430
I suggest you all keep it down.

382
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,099
If you run, you'll get hungrier.

383
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:05,500
Wait.

384
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,009
It's mine.

385
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:09,440
You're done.

386
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:10,940
You're lying.

387
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:13,579
This is the instant noodle I saved up yesterday.

388
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,579
We're in a public area.

389
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,650
First to find it can own it.

390
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,480
Besides, I'm older.

391
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:21,750
Shouldn't he go easy on me?

392
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,049
No, it's mine.

393
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,289
This jerk.

394
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,299
Go.

395
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,039
We could've just ordered them to come over.

396
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,339
It's not an order.

397
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,470
Ask them politely.

398
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:44,779
They work for me.

399
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,410
Of course I should order them.

400
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:47,180
Besides...

401
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,809
If I order them to come here,

402
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,910
wouldn't that be a surprise to find out...

403
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,319
that there's a feast?

404
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,319
They are people, not robots.

405
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,289
Let's say it's a professional relationship.

406
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,420
You have to consider their feelings too.

407
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,019
Nobody likes to be bossed around.

408
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:01,890
Go now.

409
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:03,759
Is that necessary?

410
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,910
Thank you for returning Friday.

411
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:33,319
You didn't eat dinner, did you?

412
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,190
I have some...

413
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,789
It's fine. We're not hungry.

414
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,170
I made Sichuan boiled fish,

415
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,569
sweet and sour pork,

416
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,240
saliva chicken, and spicy crab.

417
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,809
I can make anything you want.

418
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,819
Steak, lobster, anything.

419
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:02,950
Are you sure it's not multiple flavors of instant noodles?

420
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,250
Instant noodles?

421
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,559
If you want some, I'll make them for you.

422
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:09,990
Well,

423
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,029
is there enough food for all of us?

424
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:36,789
My guests.

425
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:39,319
I made all these dishes for you.

426
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,759
It has been too long since I saw such a sumptuous dinner.

427
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,529
Let me introduce you.

428
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,829
Sichuan boiled fish,

429
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,970
my hometown food.

430
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,170
Researcher One.

431
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,700
(Researcher Number One)

432
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,009
I heard you're from Sichuan and you love spicy food.

433
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,109
So this Sichuan boiled fish is made just for you.

434
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,650
Researcher One?

435
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:04,680
Researcher Two.

436
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,319
(Researcher Number Two)

437
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,019
I heard you're from abroad...

438
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:10,720
and you love Chinese food.

439
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,089
So this dessert is made for you.

440
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:26,839
Researcher Three.

441
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,339
(Researcher Number Three)

442
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,009
I heard you're fond of desserts...

443
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,480
so I made my signature dish, orange cake.

444
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:36,309
Try it.

445
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,650
One, two, three?

446
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,190
Interesting.

447
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,529
Don't you know our names?

448
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,069
Eat up.

449
00:24:58,339 --> 00:24:59,170
Why aren't you eating?

450
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:02,009
I lost my appetite.

451
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:04,309
I think instant noodles are good.

452
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,309
- Since we're not eating, let's go. - Come on.

453
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,410
I made these for...

454
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,480
Wait for me.

455
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,950
I need to talk to him.

456
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,549
This way, Mr. Lu.

457
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,759
Come here.

458
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,829
Let's go.

459
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:36,609
Wang Da Yun.

460
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,809
Take the one on the edge so he can't tell.

461
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,539
Don't eat it.

462
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:41,779
This is good. Try it.

463
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:43,579
I'm not hungry.

464
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:45,519
It's so good.

465
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,250
What's wrong?

466
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,920
Why did you say all those?

467
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,890
It's no use even if you're a good cook.

468
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,259
You're driving them away.

469
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,160
I'm always like this.

470
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,529
From now on, remember their names.

471
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,029
Da Yun, Li Cha De, Pai Song.

472
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:02,970
You have to get close to people...

473
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,769
before they help you.

474
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:07,200
I don't have much experience pleasing others.

475
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,410
It must have been hard for you.

476
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,809
I'll teach you. Watch and learn.

477
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:15,380
You have to smile.

478
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,349
When someone asks you a question,

479
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,920
you have to answer truthfully.

480
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,730
Ask questions gently...

481
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,829
instead of giving them orders.

482
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:35,230
Ask questions?

483
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:36,900
Let me show you.

484
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,339
Have you guys eaten?

485
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:41,970
Does my cooking taste good?

486
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,539
Try it.

487
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:48,509
I can do it,

488
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:49,880
am I right?

489
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,660
That's it.

490
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:03,589
Let's go.

491
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,170
Do they taste good?

492
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,380
Eat all you want, okay?

493
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,180
Go ahead and eat.

494
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,619
Relax and eat up.

495
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,890
Dr. Da Yun.

496
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,089
You...

497
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,029
Do you like...

498
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,269
the food today?

499
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:51,910
It's good.

500
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,150
Dr. Li Cha De.

501
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,990
Why did you say...

502
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:05,089
you're a 1.5-generation immigrant?

503
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,059
You remembered our names.

504
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,099
I just recalled them.

505
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,700
In order to make money,

506
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,269
my parents opened a laundromat abroad.

507
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:19,740
It was when I was about 1.5 years old.

508
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,069
So I'm a passionate Chinese...

509
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,079
who's a 1.5-generation immigrant.

510
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:29,349
Let me know if there's anything else you want.

511
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,180
I can make them for you.

512
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,049
Eat up.

513
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,930
But I still want to ask,

514
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:44,589
laundromat business...

515
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,730
doesn't seem to earn much money, right?

516
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:49,500
This guy is a natural.

517
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:50,829
He's good at ruining the mood.

518
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,460
Thank you for the meal, Dr. Fu.

519
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,859
If you're interested in my project,

520
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,559
call me anytime.

521
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,099
Thank you.

522
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,400
Here.

523
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:26,200
Let's go.

524
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:44,190
They ate everything.

525
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,390
I can do as I please, right?

526
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,490
Yes, right now.

527
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,029
I'm glad you enjoyed the meal.

528
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,900
Right.

529
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:56,130
Where else can you go...

530
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:57,599
to eat such good food?

531
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:02,440
I promise.

532
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:03,910
Let's say you're willing to stay.

533
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:04,670
- I will... - Wait.

534
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:08,609
You shouldn't have made so much food.

535
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,049
There's an old saying,

536
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,619
"Every grain of rice takes hard work."

537
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,380
You made so much food...

538
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,950
so we made sure we finish it for you.

539
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,450
But now that I'm done eating,

540
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,890
my stomach is a bit...

541
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,859
- Let's go. - Come on.

542
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,589
Wait.

543
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,859
Are you guys...

544
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,359
leaving just like that?

545
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,670
You can't leave.

546
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,170
Don't eat for free.

547
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,269
He cooked for you with all his heart...

548
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:35,410
and you're leaving just like that?

549
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,039
He's not good with words,

550
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,079
but he's doing the best he can.

551
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:52,190
Dr. Da Yun is good at washing dishes.

552
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:56,460
Researcher Two is good at it too.

553
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,539
Dr. Fu.

554
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:12,680
Dr. Fu.

555
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,410
We meet again.

556
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,420
It's you.

557
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,619
What are you doing here?

558
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:28,759
I'm guessing you lack water in Wu Xing.

559
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,730
Wu Xing.

560
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,369
There's not a single one that works.

561
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:40,569
My car is parked outback.

562
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,569
Let me give you a ride.

563
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:44,440
It's okay.

564
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,940
I'm fine.

565
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:48,009
I just feel like...

566
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,750
throwing up.

567
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,150
Just come with me...

568
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,490
or my car will get towed.

569
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,380
Pai.

570
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:20,880
I'm sorry.

571
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,779
It's okay.

572
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,609
We weren't doing it right either.

573
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:28,250
But what you did just now was not very robotic.

574
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:32,490
Can't you...

575
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,859
just stay?

576
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,490
Since Lu Sen's parents passed away,

577
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,900
he has been living here all alone.

578
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,500
He's not a bad person.

579
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,599
He just doesn't have much human contact.

580
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,230
He's as innocent as you are.

581
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:46,140
I'm sure you can be good friends...

582
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,069
if you stay long enough.

583
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:49,240
Shan Shan.

584
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:52,309
Maybe Lu Sen is who you say he is,

585
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,309
but it's too late now.

586
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,109
Mr. Fu went to meet a new investor today.

587
00:32:58,349 --> 00:32:59,019
Fu Yang.

588
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,319
Gosh.

589
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,690
We listen to him.

590
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,400
How about this?

591
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,170
When you leave, please tell him,

592
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,230
"Thank you, we enjoyed the meal."

593
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,440
Something like that?

594
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,769
I want him to feel happy...

595
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:22,670
for having worked hard.

596
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,440
No.

597
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,809
It won't change anything anyway.

598
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,910
If we never see each other again,

599
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,980
it's better to act evil in the end.

600
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,890
But we'll thank him in our hearts.

601
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:09,150
What should I do...

602
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,659
to make them stay?

603
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,559
Thank you.

604
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,199
You have done a great job.

605
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:26,840
Let's think of some other ways.

606
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:27,800
It will be okay.
