1
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,569
(Episode 30, Hello, My Orange Lover)

2
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,060
Shan Shan.

3
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,569
I will do it myself.

4
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:58,479
Where are Shan Shan and Lu Sen?

5
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,389
Don't worry.

6
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:01,250
They're fine.

7
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,229
What's wrong?

8
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:14,400
Let me see.

9
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:18,400
You need to get that hand treated.

10
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,000
Nurse.

11
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,180
You're a scientist.

12
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,009
It's just a minor injury.

13
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,009
Look at yourself.

14
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,650
Are you worried about me when you're hurt all over?

15
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:30,719
No.

16
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:32,250
It needs to be taken care of.

17
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,219
Doctor.

18
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,520
Take care of yourself.

19
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,990
That will be caring for me.

20
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:40,990
Do you understand?

21
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:43,389
Got it.

22
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,770
Have some porridge. Get some rest.

23
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,680
It's good.

24
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,460
I was rude to you.

25
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,060
I said a lot of harsh things.

26
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,689
I'm sorry.

27
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,759
It's okay, it was for Lu Sen's good.

28
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,199
And we were on different sides.

29
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,370
I don't blame you.

30
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,040
I just didn't expect...

31
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,670
he would go public...

32
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,509
with his illness for me.

33
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:33,610
For him,

34
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,250
it's not necessarily a bad thing.

35
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,519
He has had this secret...

36
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,920
bottled up for too long.

37
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,319
He's too lonely.

38
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,060
But words can hurt people.

39
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,529
He might be backstabbed.

40
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:50,129
He has just opened up to this world. I'm worried that...

41
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,029
Since when...

42
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,269
did this boy care about other people's opinions?

43
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,139
Shan Shan.

44
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,810
You let him out of his shell,

45
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,209
and you make him believe...

46
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,050
there is sincerity behind the lies.

47
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,680
You managed to do...

48
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:14,089
what I couldn't all these years.

49
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,759
As his uncle,

50
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,860
I'm really ashamed.

51
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,329
Uncle?

52
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,129
Do I not look like it?

53
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,439
I just didn't expect it.

54
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,269
But Lu Sen...

55
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,339
had physical contact with many people...

56
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,839
in front of Li Jing Cheng today...

57
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,680
and so much has happened.

58
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:42,810
But he didn't relapse.

59
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,279
Has he really recovered?

60
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:47,920
We'll have to wait and see.

61
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,089
But his condition...

62
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,060
should have changed in nature...

63
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,759
through this relapse and recovery.

64
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,160
Compared with last time,

65
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,360
he is the source of his power this time.

66
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,970
He took all the risk to step out...

67
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,939
to protect you...

68
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:06,740
and he's willing to admit...

69
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:08,240
that he cares about you.

70
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,779
It means he has really grown up...

71
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,810
and he is willing to embrace this complicated world.

72
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,550
He isn't afraid even if there may be lies.

73
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,120
Rather than focusing on the evil...

74
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
and caring about the damage,

75
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
he finally understands...

76
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,660
that surrounding him...

77
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:30,060
are much kindness and love.

78
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:39,800
Shan Shan.

79
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,040
Shan...

80
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,310
Shan Shan.

81
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,779
Shan Shan.

82
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,350
His allergies are psychological.

83
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,519
It stems from distrust of others.

84
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,360
But he has someone in his heart now,

85
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,889
whom he feels like...

86
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,899
he can give his heart to.

87
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,300
A friend for life.

88
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,750
Lu Sen.

89
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,389
Lu Sen.

90
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:34,089
I'll get going.

91
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,560
Lu Sen! What is this?

92
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,470
Why are you out in the cold?

93
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,870
What if you catch a cold?

94
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,939
You're hurt too.

95
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,040
I'm fine.

96
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,610
Does it still hurt?

97
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:56,879
It hurts here.

98
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,420
Why does it hurt here?

99
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,649
Because you're hurt.

100
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,350
It breaks my heart.

101
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,430
I want something sweet.

102
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,470
This isn't sweet enough.

103
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,690
If I don't come,

104
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,559
are you not going to tell me?

105
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,299
I'm fine.

106
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,899
If anything happens to you,

107
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,139
I'll punish you.

108
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,899
If anything really happened to me,

109
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,639
you wouldn't...

110
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,139
have the chance to punish me.

111
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:56,669
Uncle.

112
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,639
It's all my fault.

113
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,080
We agreed not to get Shan Shan involved,

114
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,710
but she ended up getting hurt.

115
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,549
That's right.

116
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,320
And you.

117
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,019
If you're a man,

118
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,860
you should keep your promise.

119
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,460
You even asked Da Tang Zi to lie to me,

120
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,990
saying Shan Shan was living with them.

121
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:16,090
Let me tell you.

122
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,330
Don't let this happen again.

123
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,600
Do I get a second chance?

124
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,029
Uncle.

125
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:23,830
Thank you.

126
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:27,470
Don't thank me.

127
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,840
Thank everyone else.

128
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,740
Well.

129
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,240
The neighbors heard...

130
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,110
that you have to compensate...

131
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,779
for leaking information.

132
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,549
They're worried that you don't have enough money...

133
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,480
so they all chipped in.

134
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,590
This is too much.

135
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:42,549
I can't accept it.

136
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:43,919
We wanted to help.

137
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:44,789
Take it.

138
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:50,029
Just take it.

139
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,000
Take it.

140
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,399
Then...

141
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,730
I'll take that as you guys' investment.

142
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,669
Do whatever you want.

143
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,299
Thank you.

144
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,470
Thank you.

145
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,419
Are...

146
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,289
Are you okay?

147
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,519
I'm glad you're fine.

148
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:19,720
That's good.

149
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:27,970
Where did your aunt park her car?

150
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:34,539
How does it feel to lie?

151
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,639
Not bad.

152
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,440
That's why sometimes people lie.

153
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,610
It's to protect the people they love.

154
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,620
Come to think of it,

155
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,490
I feel like the truth doesn't matter anymore.

156
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,590
The truth is sometimes...

157
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,289
not that important.

158
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,019
Right?

159
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,029
The person in your arms right now,

160
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:58,500
that's all that matters.

161
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:00,629
I love it when you do that.

162
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:15,350
Li Jing Cheng, Director of IMU Group,

163
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,950
is suspected in violation of citizens' personal information...

164
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:20,320
and illegal restrictions on civilian's freedom of person.

165
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,289
IMU Group has filed a formal charge.

166
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,690
Mr. Li, can you explain if IMU's scandal is true?

167
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,690
Mr. Li, how will you explain...

168
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:28,590
for the charge of illegal restriction...

169
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:29,389
on civilian's freedom of person?

170
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,259
Excuse me.

171
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,230
- Get in the car. - Mr. Li, can you explain it to us?

172
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,200
- What will happen to IMU? - Please go.

173
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,169
What's going to happen?

174
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,710
Lu Sen, ex-president of IMU Tech, is assigned last minute...

175
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:43,769
and is back in power.

176
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,710
He decided to hold a press conference.

177
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:50,279
Hello, everyone. I'm Lu Sen.

178
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,080
Thank you all for coming today.

179
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,590
I'm pleased to meet you again as the president...

180
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,059
of IMU Tech.

181
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,029
The recent upheaval at IMU Tech...

182
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,659
has been thoroughly reported by all of you...

183
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,129
so we will not discuss it today.

184
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,600
I called this press conference...

185
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,769
to regain...

186
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,169
users' confidence in the future of IMU Tech.

187
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:13,039
IMU Tech...

188
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:15,470
will be focusing on rare diseases from now on...

189
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,379
and use technology to help patients...

190
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,440
of rare diseases.

191
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:20,879
I believe...

192
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:23,350
technology is always for warming our hearts...

193
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,879
and it is a miracle given to us...

194
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,519
by Friday.

195
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,789
After we pay back the money,

196
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:38,159
are we so broke that we can't even afford ...

197
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,399
a grilled sausage now?

198
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,399
Here's some bread.

199
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,970
This is as good as it gets.

200
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,639
Take it.

201
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,879
Take it.

202
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,659
Friday...

203
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,929
was an emotion-interactive robot.

204
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:15,029
She could read my emotions...

205
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,629
and follow my instructions.

206
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,470
And what she could achieve...

207
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,940
- was so much more than that. - Hey.

208
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:21,909
Friday.

209
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,909
- We're on the news. - She had strong empathy.

210
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,909
She could even generate something similar to emotions.

211
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,480
During our time with Friday,

212
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,950
her growth...

213
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,620
had exceeded our expectations.

214
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,519
- This is the day we met Friday. - Our research team...

215
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,690
no longer saw her as a product,

216
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,090
but a friend.

217
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:42,860
Brother.

218
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,759
We lost everything.

219
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,940
What should we do from now on?

220
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:55,840
Brother.

221
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,809
At least we have dreams.

222
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,409
Right?

223
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:07,350
For the next five years, IMU Tech will continue...

224
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:08,389
to support...

225
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,690
- Dr. Fu Yang's Alpha Team. - Brother.

226
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,659
We will develop humanoid emotional companion AI robots.

227
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:15,190
Now,

228
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,029
we have a new plan...

229
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,929
to announce to you.

230
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,929
Team Alpha is about to start manufacturing...

231
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,340
a new generation of emotional companion AI robots...

232
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,139
that marks a milestone...

233
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,240
in the history of humanoid robots,

234
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,009
Orange.

235
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,470
Come on.

236
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,279
Melon seeds and fruit.

237
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:32,580
Thank you.

238
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,379
You're welcome.

239
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,980
To provide simple happy life,

240
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,309
IMU will continue to develop the smart home line,

241
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,620
setting up a new sub brand...

242
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,090
targeted at young people...

243
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:42,320
and themed by warmth and coziness.

244
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,289
It is inspired by the winner...

245
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,889
of IMU's Design Contest this year,

246
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,529
Yang Shan Shan.

247
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:55,500
You should learn from Sen and Shan Shan, okay?

248
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,230
Do you hear me?

249
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,580
That's a deal.

250
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,480
I will have Friday's chip.

251
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,879
Let me take one more look.

252
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,919
You can come whenever you want.

253
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,149
My...

254
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,659
Friday.

255
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,899
This isn't just your Friday.

256
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,730
I'm still her owner.

257
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:32,840
Okay.

258
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:44,419
(The heart of the sincere and beautiful Friday)

259
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,389
I got it.

260
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,990
Careful with the step.

261
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:52,860
Slow down.

262
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,899
What do you think?

263
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,759
Everything is ready.

264
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:03,899
Come here, everyone.

265
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,470
What?

266
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,710
Let me borrow your hand.

267
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:29,159
Let me introduce to you,

268
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,629
our new generation...

269
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,960
of emotional companion AI robot,

270
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,769
Orange.

271
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,240
Dr. Fu,

272
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:39,970
do you mean...

273
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,940
you're fulfilling the dreams of the young girls?

274
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:44,980
Did Lu Sen design this?

275
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,779
No, it's a mistake.

276
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,879
It's a mistake.

277

Orange.

278
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,799
Why isn't anyone waiting for me?

279
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:07,720
Let's go.

280
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,509
- Friday. - Friday.

281
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:45,200
Dad.

282
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:08,289
Dad.

283
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,400
Do you still remember I'm your dad?

284
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,740
You are really something, my son,

285
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,809
to have sent me to jail.

286
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,849
I...

287
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,920
I'm here to tell you that...

288
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:42,890
Lu Sen reinstated me.

289
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:46,390
I was going to quit and leave,

290
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:47,930
but then I figured it out.

291
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,130
Working for IMU...

292
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,200
can let me pay back...

293
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,900
what we've owed the Lu family.

294
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,000
What did you say?

295
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,170
Are you kidding me?

296
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,579
It's the Lu family,

297
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,940
Lu Cheng and Lu Sen,

298
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:07,579
that has wronged us.

299
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,579
On the night of Mr. Lu's accident,

300
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,720
he was trying to help you...

301
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,319
hide the huge mistakes you made in the company.

302
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,359
He even argued with Mrs. Lu for that.

303
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,759
He advised you to resign and check your accounts...

304
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,130
to protect you.

305
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,730
Mr. Lu is even willing...

306
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:26,930
to use his own money...

307
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,769
to make up for the funds you embezzled...

308
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,839
so that you won't be held legally responsible.

309
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:34,069
Before Mr. Lu passed away,

310
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,170
he had always thought of you as his best friend,

311
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,579
his dearest brother.

312
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,279
You know what, Dad?

313
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:47,750
It's not the Lu family who wronged us.

314
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,019
It's us who wronged the Lu family.

315
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,930
I am still not sure...

316
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:57,329
what Lu Cheng had done for me.

317
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,329
No way.

318
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:04,839
No way.

319
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:10,039
No way.

320
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,890
Resign on your own.

321
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,190
- Here. - Lu Sen, come here. Have a drink.

322
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:32,799
Here.

323
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,900
Have a drink. Are you tired?

324
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:36,230
Yes.

325
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:38,440
Jing Cheng.

326
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,069
What have I done all these years?

327
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,220
What have I done all these years?

328
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:13,400
This is the mistake I made.

329
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:16,500
I shall bear it myself.

330
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,670
This is the punishment I deserve.

331
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,579
It's inevitable.

332
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:34,049
All right, that's enough.

Where are you taking me?

00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,329
It's just a little further.

00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:56,029
(Hard Hat Water Bag)

342
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,369
(Hotdog Ear Mask)

343
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,390
How...

344
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,789
How long did it take you?

345
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,589
It took me a long time.

346
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,099
I was going to use it to confess to you,

347
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,960
but before these were ready...

348
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,299
so many things happened.

349
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,200
At last,

350
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,069
I can confess to you...

351
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,339
before you confess to me.

352
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:48,519
Shan Shan.

353
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,319
Give me a hug.

354
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:55,529
I remember everything now.

355
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,630
When my parents got into an accident,

356
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,559
the little girl...

357
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:05,000
who held me and covered my eyes with her hands...

358
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,400
was you, right?

359
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,519
I saw your childhood photo.

360
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,960
It reminded me...

361
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,930
of the little girl who saved me.

362
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,640
So that little boy was you.

363
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:44,980
Before I got sick,

364
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,609
you are the last person to hold me.

365
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,109
After I got sick,

366
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,880
the first person who held me...

367
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:54,480
was you as well.

368
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,170
I have something for you too.

369
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,019
Weren't you the one who wanted to surprise me?

370
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,549
Why do you look so nervous?

371
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,450
You'll see.

372
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,369
This is a gift from me...

373
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,509
and the Alpha Team.

374
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:10,690
They still look...

375
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,559
the same.

376
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,029
So they can be with you forever.

377
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:32,519
Hello, Uncle, Aunt.

378
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,019
I'm Yang Shan Shan.

379
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:36,150
From now on,

380
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,259
I'll take good care of Lu Sen.

381
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:51,000
Don't worry.

382
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,309
Shan Shan.

383
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:37,210
I love you.

384
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,880
I fell in love with you first.

385
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:43,490
Are you fighting me over this?

386
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:42,880
