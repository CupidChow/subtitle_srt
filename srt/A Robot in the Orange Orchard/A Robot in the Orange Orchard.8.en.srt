Friday,

41
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,616
isn't there a greenhouse in the yard?

42
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,360
There's a tree in there.

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,880
It's an orange tree that I
planted with my father and mother

44
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,752
when I was little.

45
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,881
My father gave my mother
this orange necklace because

46
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:31,788
she loves oranges.

47
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,880
He said that the orange symbolizes

48

the only precious being in one's heart.

But this kind of romance

53

I've identified
that you're a bit down right now.

57
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,404
When you're down,
you need to go for a walk.

58
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,398
You can even tell this?

59

You're a cutie now so
I've decided to let you in.

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,288
It's so beautiful here.

66
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,954
I have the fondest memories here.

67
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,428
Especially, this orange tree.

68
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,108
It was such a small sapling in the past.

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,880
It's so big now.

70

master has taken care of it.

You should perform well too.

72

I will also take good care of you.

00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,510
Mr. Lu,

74
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,796
do you sometimes feel that
you are as lonely as this tree?

75
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,810
I don't know why

76
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,268
but I seem to have become
a bit different.

77
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,540
Yes, you've become different.

78
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,400
Then what do you think
is different about me?

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,740
Even you can't figure it out.

80
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,550
Your...

81
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,482
your eyes have become different.

82
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,640
There's anticipation in your eyes.

83
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,480
The anticipation of building
a close relationship with someone.

84
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,996
Simply put, you want to make friends!

85
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,510
Do you really think so?

86
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,756
Is that really what I think?

87
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,830
(Silly.)

88
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,600
(Everyone needs a friend.)

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,144
(It's just that no one has ever told you.)

90
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,270
You know,

91
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,990
I've been used to this kind of life
long ago.

92
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,670
Because of this disease,

93
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,050
I can't even be like a normal person,

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,160
let alone have a close relationship.

95
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,210
What's the disease that you have?

96
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,484
It's a very complicated
and intractable disease

97
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,360
that can kill me if I'm not careful.

98
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,440
It's not a normal disease.

99
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,852
It

100
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,230
is a very special allergy.

101
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,178
H-How special is it?

102
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,648
In the extreme case of the allergy,
I will...

103
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,186
I will...

104
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,384
How can a robot be startled too?

105
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,320
You have a lot of emotions.

106
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,600
I'll tell Fu Yang to cancel
your emotions later.

107
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,271
Okay, Mr. Lu.

108
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,640
You better do it.

109
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,040
Anyway, that's it.

110
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,480
You'd better not have any human contact,

111
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,000
let alone any close relationships.

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,790
Have you been hurt in a relationship?

113
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,880
Poor boy.

114
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,350
I have not.

115
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,550
Yes, yes, you have not.

116
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,810
You have not.

117
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,270
Right, back to the point.

118
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,720
My disease must be kept a secret,
especially from the outside world.

119
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,110
I told you because I see you as a friend.

120
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,720
Miss Kang Li'er doesn't know either?

121
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,740
She doesn't know.

122
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,230
Why did you mention Li'er?

123
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,390
According to Friday's analysis,

124
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,270
your changes these days
are related to Miss Kang.

125
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Is that so?

126
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,080
Think about it.

127
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,148
Did she say or do
anything that provoked you?

128
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,744
She...

129
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,320
She said she wants to marry me.

130
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,144
It did give me a fright.

131
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,840
We've known each other since childhood.

132
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,150
When it comes to candidates for a friend,

133
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,406
she's the only one in the world.

134
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,706
Friend?

135
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,720
Then think about it.

136
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,292
Do you have any other feelings
for her besides being friends?

137
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,448
What other feelings?

138
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,558
For example,

139
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,110
when you don't see her,

140
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,280
your heart becomes restless,
as if there's grass growing inside.

141
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,400
But when you see her, you
will suddenly feel at ease

142
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,100
and the whole world
seems to have disappeared.

143
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:29,840
It's like you two are lying on a
soft lawn on a nice afternoon.

144
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,640
You suddenly feel that
there is no rush to do anything

145
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,590
and no rush to see anyone.

146
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,150
Everything is comfortable.

147
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,502
It's as if time stood still.

148
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,424
It seems to be like this.

149
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,272
Not wanting to do anything.

150
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,754
That's the feeling.

151
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,682
What's that feeling?

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,910
If you don't know what the
feeling is, you should go to her...

153
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,910
Go to her?

154
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Yes.

155
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,590
Isn't Miss Kang your
only human friend anyway?

156
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,590
Just let her feel your dependence on her.

157
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,960
Meet up with her more often.

158
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,840
When you are free, you can
share your daily life with each other.

159
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,528
Then you will become closer gradually.

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Dependence...

161
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,690
Maybe it's because of this disease,

162
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,320
I'm always trying
to keep a little distance from her.

163
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,080
Mr. Lu, I think you need to
stop thinking about your disease.

164
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,000
Look at how natural you
act when you're with me.

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,400
You can also do the same with Miss Kang.

166
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,030
So what should I do?

167
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,760
I think the eyes are very important.

168
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,108
First, you have to look into her eyes.

169
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,590
For example, you should have a gentle

170
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,960
and determined look in your eyes.

171
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,608
This will make her
feel comfortable and secure too.

172
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,450
The ingredients I ordered have arrived.

173
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,272
Mr. Lu, wait for me!

174
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,370
(Please come in.)

175
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,580
What brings you here?

176
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,440
I came to see you.

177
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
People say you look great at work.

178
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,240
Now I see, that's indeed true.

179
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,200
The gossip about me will probably circulate
in the company

180
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,464
for some time now that you, the big
beauty, have come to the company.

181
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,320
You can't be such a smooth talker.

182
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,520
I guess I'll have to teach
you how to attract girls.

183
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,030
No need for that, my sister.

184
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,350
You know, I'm not interested in dating.

185
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,880
Besides, other girls can't attract me

186
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,904
when a beautiful woman like you
is by my side.

187
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,670
Oh right.

188
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,710
Would you like some tea or coffee?

189
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,110
I'll pass.

190
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,871
Don't you want to see
what I've got for you?

191
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,674
Why did you prepare a gift
when you're just visiting me here?

192
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,394
But I didn't prepare anything for you

193
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,400
because you came all of a sudden.

194
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
How about this?

195
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,440
Tell me what you want.

196
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,640
I'll give it to you.

197
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,350
Really?

198
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,710
I've already thought about it.

199
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,970
Are you free tonight?

200
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,422
Yes, of course!

201
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,960
Then let's go to Lu Sen's house for dinner.

202
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,304
I've already told him.

203
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Are you sure

204
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,440
you want me to go to his house
for dinner with you?

205
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,610
Crayfish?

206
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,840
Inspired by you, I
remembered that Li'er said

207
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,000
she couldn't find authentic crayfish
when she was studying abroad.

208
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,696
So I'm going to make her a crayfish dish.

209
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,590
There are many flavors of crayfish.

210
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,350
There are spicy crayfish,
stir-fried crayfish, garlic crayfish,

211
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,694
and 13-spice crayfish.

212
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,520
The 13-spice one then.

213
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,140
Li'er can't eat spicy food.

214
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,350
Okay.

215
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,816
Get cracking.

216
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,910
Do I have to wash all these?

217
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,590
Do you expect me to wash it?

218
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Friday,

219
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,694
you look like a human when you're scared.

220
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,960
I'm programmed to tremble and scream

221
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,030
at multilegged animals and insects.

222
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,730
I think that's what you meant
by being scared.

223
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,172
Why does this Fu Yang always
give you these sorts of functions?

224
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,436
Is this Team Alpha?

225
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,140
Come here for a moment.

226
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,440
Wash these crayfish.

227
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,960
I'll ask the butler to give you
double the amount you've washed.

228
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,884
Let's go, Friday.

229
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
Let's begin.

230
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,315
Why are you so good at cooking?

231
00:17:57,945 --> 00:17:59,805
Because I grew up eating alone.

232
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:02,915
Have you cooked your own food
since childhood?

233
00:18:04,905 --> 00:18:06,135
Not exactly.

234
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:09,219
At first, I could only eat
instant noodles.

235
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:13,705
But then I got really tired of them
so I made my own meals.

236
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:15,517
It was a difficult process

237
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:17,115
but I couldn't help it.

238
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:20,305
I just couldn't eat
other people's cooking.

239
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:24,793
Friday, help me get... Master,

240
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:26,505
it has been tough for you.

241
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:31,705
(Something seems to have sprouted
in my heart again.)

242
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:34,249
How did you grow up then?

243
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,671
I then found out

244
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:41,945
that premium ingredients don't
need to be cooked too much.

245
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:44,573
So it's fine
as long as you have the money.

246
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:46,975
(Sure enough, your happiness)

247
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:48,715
(is beyond my understanding.)

248
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:06,238
Friday, come and help me choose a suit.

249
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:16,305
Master, I think that if you
really don't know what to wear,

250
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:19,474
you should think about what
kind of style Miss Kang likes.

251
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:24,129
Li'er did give me a suit.

252
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,255
This one.

253
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:38,705
This one really suits you!

254
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:40,305
Miss Kang Li'er really has a good eye.

255
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,597
Master will look great in it!

256
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:47,785
Although I, your master,
look good in everything,

257
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:50,305
I've decided to take your advice.

258
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:51,505
I'll just wear this.

259
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:52,665
Yes, yes.

260
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:54,255
Master, you look good in everything.

261
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:56,215
Hurry up and get yourself dressed up.

262
00:19:56,215 --> 00:19:58,688
I'll go down and see
what else is missing.

263
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:06,826
(What a fool.)

264
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:09,025
(You don't know
how to please a woman at all.)

265
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:10,425
(Without my help, )

266
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:12,765

288
00:21:29,945 --> 00:21:31,375
My work is all done too.

289
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,719
I'll go back first.

290
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:37,305
You can't leave.

291
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:45,025
Why?

292
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,975
Look at how big this house is.

293
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,975
If you leave, isn't it strange
to see me alone in the house

294
00:21:53,975 --> 00:21:55,255
when Li'er comes over?

295
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:58,665
But aren't you alone all these years?

296
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:01,989
Isn't it more strange to suddenly
have someone else around?

297
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:06,255
What if the previous incident
happens again?

298
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:07,455
I almost died.

299
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:11,825
Then...

300
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:13,565
I'm not leaving then.

301
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:20,905
And there's a stranger
coming today besides Li'er.

302
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:22,825
I don't want him to know
that you're a robot,

303
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:26,797
so you have to act like a normal person.

304
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:33,051
I've arranged for you to
be my personal assistant.

305
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:33,946
Do you understand?

306
00:22:33,946 --> 00:22:35,577
Understood, Mr. Lu.

307
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:39,065
Put down your etiquette hands first.

308
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:47,225
This way, nothing will go wrong.

309
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:57,825
Also, you have to stay in
friend mode all night today.

310
00:22:57,825 --> 00:22:59,145
You can't jump around.

311
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:23,105
Aren't you going to open the door?

312
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:30,755
Don't get me wrong.

313
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,559
I wouldn't have come

314
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:35,955
if Li'er hadn't insisted on it.

315
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:41,701
But why is my seat so far away?

316
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:46,321
Why is my cutlery different too?

317
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:48,501
Li'er, drink some water.

318
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:52,235
Why don't I even have a cup?

319
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:56,405
Be quiet at the dining table.

320
00:23:58,425 --> 00:23:59,913
You two are really...

321
00:24:02,135 --> 00:24:05,255
But the gifts I've got for
you guys fit pretty well.

322
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:07,955
I was worried
that I might get the wrong size.

323
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:12,135
You two loved to wear the same clothes
when you were little.

324
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:13,135
Remember?

325
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:15,865
I bought the same suits specially.

326
00:24:18,215 --> 00:24:22,403
At that time, people always
asked me if you were twins.

327
00:24:23,335 --> 00:24:25,411
You were both so cute back then,

328
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:28,345
following me around every day.

329
00:24:28,615 --> 00:24:31,375
You've grown up so much
in the blink of an eye.

330
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:34,955
I miss those happy times.

331
00:24:49,335 --> 00:24:50,499
That person is...?

332
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,695
My personal assistant.

333
00:24:54,855 --> 00:24:57,195
I didn't hear you mention it last time.

334
00:24:58,335 --> 00:25:00,945
Does Mr. Lu need a human assistant?

335
00:25:00,945 --> 00:25:05,771
Mr. Lu only needs full
A.I. home appliances.

336
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:08,075
Li'er, try this duck.

337
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:19,127
I'm here to serve the food.

338
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:23,185
Mr. Lu said that you've been
studying abroad for many years,

339
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:25,909
so he specially prepared
Chinese food for you.

340
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:29,631
I do miss homemade Chinese food.

341
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,115
Lu Sen, you're so thoughtful.

342
00:25:34,215 --> 00:25:35,463
Right, Li Zhan?

343
00:25:36,855 --> 00:25:38,739
Yes, he's thoughtful.

344
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,981
Did Lu Sen make all this by himself?

345
00:25:42,495 --> 00:25:45,135
He personally prepared these
for both of you.

346
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:46,917
Both of us?

347
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:54,701
Miss Assistant, are you sure Mr. Lu
specially prepared these for me?

348
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:01,185
They are indeed not for you.

349
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,095
If you specially prepared them
for me, I wouldn't dare to eat them.

350
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,495
Who knows if you will poison me?

351
00:26:04,495 --> 00:26:05,025
I will.

352
00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:09,375
You... By the way, Mr. Lu
also said that you like crayfish,

353
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:13,371
so he prepared crayfish for you
and so many flavors of dipping sauce.

354
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:16,705
Then Miss Assistant,
what flavor do you like?

355
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:17,905
Me?

356
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:19,705
I usually like the spicy ones.

357
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:24,096
Me too.

358
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:26,376
But I can't take spicy food very well.

359
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:30,335
(This is a living person.)

360
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:31,305
(Dr. Fu, )

361
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:32,096
(is this the secret)

362
00:26:32,096 --> 00:26:34,196
(that you're afraid I'll find out?)

363
00:26:37,855 --> 00:26:39,135
Sit down and eat together with us.

364
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:40,135
She has eaten.

365
00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:47,477
Miss Assistant,

366
00:26:47,735 --> 00:26:49,679
how should I call...
None of your business.

367
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,375
I...

368
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:57,461
Lu Sen, it's not polite to keep
calling her "Miss Assistant".

369
00:26:57,545 --> 00:27:00,425
Li'er, she... Xing. Call me Xing.

370
00:27:01,215 --> 00:27:02,215
Xing.

371
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:04,637
You guys can eat.

372
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:17,025
When I first came back,

373
00:27:17,025 --> 00:27:19,025
I saw a lot of people in workwear
in the manor.

374
00:27:19,025 --> 00:27:20,025
What do they do?

375
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,375
Cleaning.

376
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:37,185
How's the company these days, Li Zhan?

377
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:40,569
You've been there for so long,
didn't you do any new projects?

378
00:27:42,545 --> 00:27:46,373
All the projects I do
are related to big data.

379
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:50,227
But Mr. Lu only loves
A.I. home appliances.

380
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,735
My projects are related to human beings.

381
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:55,493
They are not very valued.

382
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:56,905
Really?

383
00:28:01,665 --> 00:28:04,215
Why do I get the impression that Lu Sen

384
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:07,455
isn't completely indifferent
to human-related projects?

385
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:11,491
So Mr. Lu is deliberately targeting me?

386
00:28:12,495 --> 00:28:14,785
Are you going to be at
odds with each other forever?

387
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:16,345
- We're not.
- He started it.

388
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:25,585
But Lu Sen, can I get a position
at IMU with my qualifications?

389
00:28:25,585 --> 00:28:27,985
You're willing to return to the company?

390
00:28:28,255 --> 00:28:30,463
I came back this time to help you.

391
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:34,689
You can have any position
if you are willing to join us.

392
00:28:35,585 --> 00:28:38,705
Wouldn't you be better off
as the wife of the boss of IMU?

393
00:28:38,705 --> 00:28:40,025
Why not?

394
00:28:40,025 --> 00:28:41,455
IMU is a big company.

395
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:42,511
I don't mind it.

396
00:28:44,215 --> 00:28:45,215
Li'er,

397
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:46,975
I was joking.

398
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,175
Did you mean it?

399
00:28:55,585 --> 00:28:56,825
Fine.

400
00:28:56,825 --> 00:28:58,205
If that's the case,

401
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:01,165
congratulations to both of you.

402
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:03,213
I am happy for you.

403
00:29:08,495 --> 00:29:10,415
You deliberately brought me here

404
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:14,941
to tell me this news, so that I

405
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:18,205
could be the first to know
about your marriage, right?

406
00:29:24,215 --> 00:29:25,495
I've got things to do.

407
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:26,515
I'll leave first.

408
00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:27,945
Li Zhan.

409
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,135
Xing.

410
00:29:32,135 --> 00:29:35,945
Come and serve the soup to
Li'er and throw away everything

411
00:29:35,945 --> 00:29:37,025
that guy has used.

412
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:43,905
(I'm so pissed off!)

413
00:29:43,905 --> 00:29:45,375
(It's fine that Li'er gave it to him, )

414
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,735
(but why he had to wear the same as I did today?)

415
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:48,095
(If it wasn't for Li'er, )

416
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:50,375
(I would have removed it on the spot!)

417
00:29:52,455 --> 00:29:53,455
Thanks.

418
00:30:02,615 --> 00:30:04,475
Friday, come here for a moment.

419
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:07,955
Excuse me for a moment.

420
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:20,785
Mr. Lu.

421
00:30:21,495 --> 00:30:22,495
Come in.

422
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,855
It's all your fault.

423
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:27,568
How dare you make me wear
the same clothes as that guy?

424
00:30:28,025 --> 00:30:31,421
But you two look like twins
when you wear the same clothes.

425
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:32,635
You are laughing?

426
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,425
Help me choose an outfit quickly.

427
00:30:35,425 --> 00:30:38,065
I must look ten times
better than that guy, Li Zhan.

428
00:30:38,065 --> 00:30:39,685
No. A hundred times better.

429
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:44,135
Mr. Lu, are you jealous
because Miss Kang Li'er

430
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:46,055
gave both of you the same gifts?

431
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:50,305
I just simply don't want to
have an outfit clash with that guy.

432
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:52,785
(You're obviously jealous.)

433
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:54,405
(You still don't admit it.)

434
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,383
Wear this.

435
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:00,995
Do you like this?

436
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:06,805
Fine, as long as you like it.

437
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:11,375
They didn't suspect you, did they?

438
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:12,066
Of course not!

439
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:13,265
I am a real person.

440
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:20,425
Good awareness.

441
00:31:20,785 --> 00:31:21,785
Come on.

442
00:31:30,545 --> 00:31:31,545
Let's go.

443
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:48,825
Hello?

444
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,585
There's a female assistant in the villa.

445
00:31:50,585 --> 00:31:52,455
Keep an eye on her these days.

446
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:54,555
I think there's a problem with her.
