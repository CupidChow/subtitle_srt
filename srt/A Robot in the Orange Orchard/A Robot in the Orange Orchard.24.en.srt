(Episode 24, The Answer Lies In The Wind)

2
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,090
A friend of mine gave it to me.

3
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,359
I've tried it.

4
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,329
It's really sweet.

5
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,750
But why has my orange tree...

6
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,360
become like this?

7
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,289
I've looked it up.

8
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,099
It's because of malnutrition.

9
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:39,360
We need the soil from the rice paddy to turn it into mud.

10
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,530
Then, use that for irrigation.

11
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:46,770
Mr. Lu.

12
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,069
You haven't been out in a while.

13
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:49,569
It's spring now.

14
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,710
Why don't we go to the countryside?

15
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,919
Hello, Mr. Xie.

16
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,860
Get me some soil from the rice paddy.

17
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,360
Aren't you going to try?

18
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,439
Come on, give it a go.

19
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,099
I'll pull you in.

20
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,750
Why do people kiss?

21
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,349
It's out of necessity.

22
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,120
You can't hide your needs.

23
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,930
Just like...

24
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,060
how people need water when they're thirsty...

25
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,259
and go to bed when sleepy.

26
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,870
The orange leaves turn yellow,

27
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,100
so it needs muddy water from the spring soil for irrigation.

28
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,740
One needs light.

29
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:28,970
The other one shines too brightly.

30
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,040
What happens...

31
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,420
You can't help but get a little closer.

32
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,680
And a bit closer.

33
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,399
Then why did she kiss and then run away?

34
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:54,829
Because...

35
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,139
Because she wasn't sure...

36
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,810
if that person needed her.

37
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,279
Drop the act, Yang Shan Shan.

38
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,810
What did you call me?

39
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,519
When did you find out?

40
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,819
When you first came in yesterday.

41
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,490
That's why you told me to chop onions,

42
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,629
tidy up the study, sleep...

43
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,689
You were the one...

44
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,500
Why are you so mean?

45
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,629
I want to know how you really feel,

46
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,730
so I teased you on purpose without exposing you.

47
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,569
So I guess we're even.

48
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:01,300
Will you still be running away?

49
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,970
How can I run like this?

50
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,569
What do we do now?

51
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,250
Why don't you take off your shoes?

52
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,689
What if my feet sink in?

53
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,250
I'll carry you out.

54
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,519
- Here. - Hold on.

55
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:27,360
Let me get my feet out first.

56
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:28,689
Be careful.

57
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,170
What about me?

58
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,500
I'll go look for Mr. Xie.

59
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,569
Slow down. Don't trip and fall!

60
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
- Hello, sir. - Hello, sir.

61
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,949
Mr. Li.

62
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,050
What do you think?

63
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,679
The lab is pretty cool, right?

64
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,950
I told you, if you want something,

65
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,889
I'll definitely meet your demands right away.

66
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:38,990
That's true.

67
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,059
I've witnessed Mr. Li's sincerity.

68
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,330
Give and take.

69
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,960
The first mission you assigned me...

70
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,299
has already been accomplished.

71
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,929
You've unlocked the folder Orange on the USB?

72
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:02,750
It's a big gift indeed.

73
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,580
I love it.

74
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,450
I didn't expect Fu Yang's team...

75
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,049
to be studying emotional companion robots.

76
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,360
But generally speaking,

77
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,830
I think your CEO has been deceived.

78
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,059
This Friday is a real person in disguise.

79
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,700
But I'm quite interested...

80
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,330
in the real Friday.

81
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:24,899
So now, what we'll do next...

82
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,370
has become a lot easier.

83
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:42,620
Hi, Xiao P.

84
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,120
Set the temperature to 21 degrees Celsius.

85
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:47,789
Honey.

86
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:48,830
Happy anniversary.

87
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,029
I thought you had forgotten.

88
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,299
I've already made the arrangements.

How much will you embarrass me?

105

Mr. Lu.

106

Please cooperate with the investigation.

Since it has come to this,

can you be more specific?

many reporters have arrived here.

At the moment,

this company is said to have leaked many customers' information.

What are you doing?

138
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,980
Haven't you quit already?

139
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,519
Since you've quit,

140
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,220
you should distance yourself.

141

Don't be a busybody.

142

Dad.

143
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,960
The AI market relies heavily on trust.

144
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,230
If this gets out of hand,

145
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,860
it will uproot the entire company.

146

What do you mean?

147
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,500
Do you suspect your dad?

148
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,370
I'm not.

149
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:47,200
I just don't want anyone to mess with the company.

153
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,419
In your mind,

154
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,990
am I someone who is that insensible?

155
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,629
Would I destroy the company with your lifetime's work?

156
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,399
Let me ask you.

157
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,330
What's in it for us?

158
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,129
But it can't be Lu Sen.

159
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,639
He never agreed to this project.

160
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,399
How can it possibly...

161
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,340
How could it be implemented so suddenly?

162
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,309
You can't just take Lu Sen at his word.

163
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,009
You have to see if he did it or not.

164
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,049
Don't worry.

165
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,980
The company will come up with a result of a fair investigation.

166
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:41,990
Li Zhan.

167
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,460
I don't expect you to take my side for everything.

168
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:51,070
I just want you to believe that everything I do,

169
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,399
I did it for you.

170
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,070
For the sake of our family.

171
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:55,470
Do you understand?

172
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:57,980
Do you understand?

173
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,980
Dad.

174
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,649
I'm sorry.

175
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,179
It's okay.

176
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,350
No one can go to the villa now.

177
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,990
IMU's staff and a bunch of reporters are watching the place.

178
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,360
I asked the company too.

179
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:15,830
It's an urgent internal investigation.

180
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,190
Since last night,

181
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:19,700
there have been lots of complaints filed to IMU's customer services.

182
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,830
The users said that...

183
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:22,769
the smart appliances they're using...

184
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,870
are leaking a lot of their personal information.

185
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,970
The source of the information leakage...

186
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,740
is pointing to the Edge-N project.

187
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,009
The Edge-N project was originally initiated by Li Zhan.

188
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,980
At first, Mr. Lu only allowed it to be researched and developed.

189
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,210
He didn't agree to promote it.

190
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:37,879
He said there's a risk of leaking information.

191
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:39,580
But for some unknown reason,

192
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,750
the Edge-N project was activated on the Intranet.

193
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,190
That's why...

194
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,990
as our CEO,

195
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,519
he has to be held accountable for it.

196
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,230
Could it be Li Zhan?

197
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,730
He's not like that.

198
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:58,139
But...

199
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,100
he's definitely involved in this matter.

200
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,370
I'll look into it.

201
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,039
Don't worry too much.

202
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:07,139
The company's lawyer is already working on it.

203
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,210
Luckily, as long as we compensate in time,

204
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:10,750
it won't cause too great an impact.

205
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,080
But there's a catch.

206
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,149
The company might freeze...

207
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,289
all of Mr. Lu's company property.

208
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,120
Will they run into Lu Sen?

209
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,230
Probably not.

210
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:23,230
Dr. Ou is watching him too.

211
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,230
Just in case.

212
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,830
I think it's fine as long as he's safe.

213
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:27,730
Mr. Si, excuse me.

214
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,570
Judging by this situation,

215
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,340
will Lu Sen...

216
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:33,269
have enough money for his personal expenses?

217
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,139
Mr. Lu doesn't actually get paid.

218
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,669
Moreover,

219
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,840
he can't handle the transfer of ownership in person,

220
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,610
so Mr. Lu's villa...

221
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,779
is also considered the company's asset.

222
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,019
Alpha Team's lab...

223
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,379
is also a company property.

224
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,620
I'm sure it'll be confiscated soon.

225
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,960
Does that mean he'll be kicked out?

226
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,899
This won't do. I have to see him.

227
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:00,929
Don't.

228
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,070
There are reporters outside.

229
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,509
I know a place.

230
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,940
We can get him out.

231
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,889
Come on. Be careful.

232
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,129
I told you we could sneak out of here, right?

233
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,429
This is my house.

234
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,070
Why didn't I know about this?

235
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:44,169
Why aren't you wearing gloves?

236
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,009
It's okay.

237
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:47,710
What if they touch you?

238
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,350
I'll be fine as long as you're here.

239
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,279
These reporters sure are annoying.

240
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:54,250
This is all smoke and mirrors,

241
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,389
but they are harassing you for it.

242
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,460
I don't want them to slander my...

243
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:02,230
My friend.

244
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,730
I don't care what people think.

245
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:07,970
As long as I have you,

246
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:09,970
my friend.

247
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,140
Mr. Lu.

248
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,609
What are you doing here?

249
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,440
He said he was worried.

250
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,509
He had to take a look.

251
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:21,809
Mr. Lu.

252
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,509
Would you like me to book a hotel for you?

253
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,049
How much...

254
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,089
do I have in my personal account?

255
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,490
Less than 20,000 yuan.

256
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,460
How long will that last me in a hotel?

257
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,089
Based on your standards,

258
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,359
about three days.

259
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,170
Come with me.

260
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,599
If you still have 20,000 yuan,

261
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,769
you might as well give it to me.

262
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,500
Here. Put your helmet on.

263
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:46,569
Put it on for me.

264
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:36,819
Where are we going?

265
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:38,589
Home.

266
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,859
Whose home?

267
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:42,289
My uncle's.

268
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,960
Just take me to the hotel.

269
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:49,769
Mr. CEO.

270
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,170
Do you think you're not well-known enough?

271
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:53,500
As for my home,

272
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,210
my aunt is there.

273
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:56,410
My aunt is very nice.

274
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,509
She cooks really well.

275
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,509
I have a younger cousin, En Bao.

276
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:01,509
Her knees go weak at the sight of good-looking guys.

277
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:03,079
And my uncle...

278
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,150
He's a bit conservative.

279
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:09,490
But our house is neat and tidy.

280
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,990
It's much livelier than your mansion.

281
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,190
This won't do.

282
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:14,759
I'm not used...

283
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:16,690
to having more than two people in the house.

284
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:18,759
Then think of them as machines.

285
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,259
How can I?

286
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,269
And I can't live with strangers.

287
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,609
Then just think of my family as your family.

288
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,809
Will that do?

289
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:33,309
That doesn't sound right.

290
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,549
Mr. Lu, it's time for you to experience a commoner's life.

291
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:40,549
Hold on tight.

292
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,519
My uncle told me...

293
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,289
that we won't get any dinner if we run late.

294
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,059
Let's go.

295
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:52,460
See? I told you.

296
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:54,460
Just follow that robot.

297
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:57,000
The reporters are still waiting outside the gate foolishly.

298
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:00,140
That's why they are still rookies...

299
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,509
when it comes to fishing for a scoop.

300
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,059
How about I go with you?

301
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:20,589
It's okay.

302
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,789
I think I'd rather talk to him alone.

303
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,430
Fu Yang.

304
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,730
Do you think...

305
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:33,900
I'm right to have so much trust in Li Zhan?

306
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,609
If you trust him,

307
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,509
then I will.

308
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,230
I hope this will be helpful.

309
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:01,000
Thank you.

310
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,289
Li Er.

311
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:02,059
Why did you ask me out?

312
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,700
You must have heard that Lu Sen...

313
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:11,970
is being investigated.

314
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,740
How can you drink so calmly?

315
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:16,710
Or what?

316
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:19,539
What else can I do?

317
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,650
Do you know that Lu Sen...

318
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,650
He's sick.

319
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:24,680
Right?

320
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,650
Li Er.

321
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,750
I'm not afraid to tell you...

322
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:33,019
that I've had men spy on Lu Sen.

323
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,289
I just want to know what secret he's keeping...

324
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,059
by hiding in his villa all day.

325
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,430
I know the secret now.

326
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:46,940
You knew about this, didn't you?

327
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,509
You and Lu Sen.

328
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,980
Neither of you has genuinely regarded me as a friend.

329
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,980
This is so serious, but you never told me.

330
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,750
Why?

331
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,650
What happened to the three of us?

332
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:01,819
I just found out myself.

333
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:04,390
All these years,

334
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:06,490
Lu Sen pulled through it alone.

335
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,529
We both failed as his friends.

336
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:15,099
We didn't get to stand by him.

337
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,930
But we still have a chance.

338
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,809
You must know something about this matter.

339
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,440
Am I right?

340
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,160
Li Zhan.

341
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:50,299
If we miss this opportunity,

342
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,769
we won't get another chance again.

343
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,049
Did you get that?

344
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:10,619
I got it.

345
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,259
Send it to the boss.

346
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,420
Okay.

347
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:15,730
Coming.

348
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:19,960
Hi, Uncle.

349
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:22,869
Hi, Uncle.

350
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,470
You should call him "sir".

351
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:25,970
Sir.

352
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:27,970
This is...

353
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,940
Hi, I'm Lu Sen.

354
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:32,380
Hello.

355
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,049
He's carrying too many things.

356
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,720
Something is going on at his house,

357
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,279
so he's staying with us for a few days.

358
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,289
Haven't we met before?

359
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,859
Aren't you working...

360
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,019
at IMU Tech Group?

361
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:50,730
It's you?

362
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,099
Do you two know each other?

363
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,730
We had a meal together.

364
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,470
This kid is good with words.

365
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:00,869
Your name is Lu Sen, right?

366
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:03,140
Which department are you in?

367
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,910
I was working on Artificial Intelligence.

368
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,150
But I just got fired.

369
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:17,220
Just like Shan Shan.

370
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:18,019
You're unemployed.

371
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:21,089
Uncle, do you want us to stand outside?

372
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,829
Come in.

373
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,029
Go on.

374
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,960
Two pairs of slippers.

375
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,970
What is it? Do we have a visitor?

376
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,269
This is my aunt and she's En Bao.

377
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:36,470
Hello.

378
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,410
Hello.

379
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,940
Hey, handsome.

380
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:42,609
What's your relationship with my cousin now?

381
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,920
What do you mean?

382
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,390
We're just friends.

383
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:50,289
Is he just a friend?

384
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,130
Who could have sent the backstage data...

385
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,500
of the Edge-N project to Dr. Fu?

386
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,140
Whoever it might be,

387
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:08,369
he means well.

388
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:10,940
Let's patch up the system when we get back.

389
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,980
Then it is all good.

390
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,180
What's going on?

391
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,150
Excuse me.

392
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,990
This now belongs to IMU Tech Group.

393
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:28,089
During the investigation,

394
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,890
only authorized personnel are allowed in here.

395
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,569
We're not just anyone.

396
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:41,539
We're the Alpha Team.

397
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:43,710
This is Alpha Lab.

398
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:46,440
Our personal belongings and assets are in there.

399
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:49,349
Let's not make things difficult for each other.

400
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,049
We'll follow your orders and leave...

401
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,079
after we pack up our stuff.

402
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,019
All right?

403
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,950
Your personal belongings are all here.

404
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,589
You can take them whenever you want.

405
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:00,920
However, you're now no longer authorized...

406
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,130
to enter this lab.

407
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,630
No problem.

408
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,400
We'll get our personal belongings.

409
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:14,940
I'm sure IMU won't damage Friday, right?

410
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,440
We have more important things to do.

411
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:29,420
For the time being,

412
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:32,390
we'll just have to make do for now.

413
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,690
I think this might be what we're cut out for.

414
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,440
Professor Fu.

415
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,170
Friday is still in the lab.

416
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,869
Why did you get us out of there so urgently?

417
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:53,140
We can figure out a way to save Friday later.

418
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:56,049
But if the core data gets leaked,

419
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,380
then Friday will really be at the disposal of others.

420
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:02,319
It's a good thing that all the important data...

421
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,390
has been backed up.

422
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,119
But for the data from the lab,

423
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,319
we'll need to format it soon.

424
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,299
Hang on. This is our blood and sweat.

425
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,130
Now, we even have to hide it away.

426
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:17,869
What is wrong with this world?

427
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,670
Da Yun.

428
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,269
Get back to what you do best.

429
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,309
You and Li Cha De...

430
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,609
should hack into Alpha Lab...

431
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,180
and format all of our data.

432
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,440
Pai Song.

433
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,140
We're fixing the backstage of Edge-N.

434
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,880
Friday can only be returned to us by resolving Lu Sen's issue...

435
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:33,549
of information leakage.

436
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,650
I agree.

437
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,019
But sir,

438
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:38,519
can we make some time...

439
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,119
to clean this place up first?

440
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:44,359
Get to work.

441
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,559
Okay.

442
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:53,799
Didn't they say he can't be touched?

443
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,420
Li Zhan.

444
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:08,650
You're home?

445
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:16,690
Why are you still up at this hour?

446
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:23,170
Your face is all flushed.

447
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,069
Did you go out drinking because of Lu Sen's issue?

448
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,369
No.

449
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,109
I met up with friends.

450
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,109
I was happy,

451
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,509
so I had too much to drink.

452
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,349
It's okay if you're happy.

453
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:38,920
Enjoy a few days off...

454
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,180
and then join me back at the office.

455
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:45,289
Dad.

456
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:51,259
Once the information leakage issue is tackled,

457
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,430
can Lu Sen and we get back...

458
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,430
to how you and his dad were back then...

459
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,400
Li Zhan!

460
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,000
Are you stupid?

461
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:03,869
Whatever we're doing right now,

462
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,410
Lu Sen will blame us for it anyway.

463
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,779
Have you forgotten...

464
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,750
how Lu Sen suppressed you?

465
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,819
I had slaved away all my life for Lu Cheng.

466
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,319
Is his son also going to trample over my son...

467
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,420
and walk all over him?

468
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,319
Dad!

469
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:25,960
Li Zhan.

470
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,069
Don't you deserve to have a dream?

471
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,500
I do.

472
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,140
We're so close to success.

473
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,640
Why can't we achieve...

474
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,839
what Lu Sen managed to do?

475
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:44,650
You're right.

476
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,019
I'll do as you say.

477
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,750
Let me tell you something.

478
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,119
You must always...

479
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,930
hold on to your right to choose.

480
00:30:58,529 --> 00:30:59,299
Always.

481
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,539
Shan Shan.

482
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,539
I heard you brought Lu Sen home.

483
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:12,710
I've said some very harsh words to you...

484
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,779
and I'd like to apologize to you.

485
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,880
I'm truly grateful...

486
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:19,849
that you've helped Lu Sen to overcome it.

487
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,390
This is Lu Sen's first time staying at someone's house.

488
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,319
As a doctor,

489
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,589
I hope...

490
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,829
you can teach him how to be a normal person.

491
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,099
Or rather, an ordinary person.

492
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,829
Please take good care of Lu Sen.

493
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:42,210
(Lu Sen's room)

494
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:43,740
All right, let's eat.

495
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,109
Dig in.

496
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:48,579
Didn't you say we're only having braised pork and rice today?

497
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,750
We are.

498
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:51,980
We're having braised pork and rice as our main course.

499
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:55,019
Lu Sen, I don't know what you like.

500
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,390
So I've made some random side dishes.

501
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,519
It's just a simple meal.

502
00:31:57,589 --> 00:31:58,519
I hope you don't mind.

503
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:00,890
Are these just side dishes?

504
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,289
En Bao, look at your mom. She has a new favorite.

505
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,930
Lu Sen is very handsome.

506
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:08,299
What's wrong with having some crab?

507
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,869
En Bao, how can you be two-faced?

508
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,109
All right.

509
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,049
Look how thin you are.

510
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,680
You need to eat more meat right now.

511
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,480
- Eat up. - Okay.

512
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,250
Here, Guang Liang.

513
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,650
You should eat too.

514
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,519
Sure.

515
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,450
Eat up.

516
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:32,059
En Bao, have some.

517
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,420
Let her practice on her own.

518
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:36,490
She's a kid.

519
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,130
Don't just sit there.

520
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:39,430
Have some shrimp.

521
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,759
Just let me know what you'd like to eat.

522
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:42,869
I'll make them for you.

523
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,869
By the way, Shan Shan,

524
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,369
Lu Sen can have your room.

525
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:49,339
You'll sleep with me.

526
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:51,509
I've tidied it up already.

527
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,009
Where am I supposed to sleep?

528
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,140
The couch.

529
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,210
Lu Sen has long legs.

530
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,819
He's too tall to sleep on the couch.

531
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:01,019
Just make do with it for two days.

532
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,849
I didn't mean anything by it.

533
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,220
I thought that young people...

534
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:06,220
- should endure... - The couch is fine.

535
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,160
I'll sleep on the couch.

536
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,059
Right?

537
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,089
Look.

538
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,960
Dad, look.

539
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,799
We can't let our guest sleep on the couch, right?

540
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:23,440
Here, have some meat.

541
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,910
Okay, if so,

542
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,009
Lu Sen can sleep with me.
