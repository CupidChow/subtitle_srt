00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,140
(Episode 23, Reliance on the Other)

2
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,829
Lu Sen?

3
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,439
You're leaving?

4
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,039
You said you'd be on standby...

5
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,240
if I needed anything.

6
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:18,840
So you like to lie, huh?

7
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,650
This time, I won't believe you anymore.

8
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,550
Lu Sen.

9
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,620
You saw our apology video?

10
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,819
He has seen our video.

11
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,319
My lips didn't get swollen for nothing.

12
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,889
I thought...

13
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,129
you were never going to talk to us again.

14
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,560
Yes, I don't want to see you.

15
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,969
But you're coming and going as you please.

16
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,930
That's so rude.

17
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,069
Is my house a hotel?

18
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,770
You come and go as you please.

19
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:48,409
Lu Sen.

20
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,710
You can scold us however you want.

21
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,409
We'll feel at ease as long as we hear your voice.

22
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,879
- Right? - Wang Da Yun.

23
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,650
Why are you still standing here? Help me.

24
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,719
Phone call from Lu Sen.

25
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,879
What's wrong with Young Master?

26
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,150
What are you doing?

27
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:03,990
You're mistaken.

28
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,090
We're just helping Mr. Xie move things.

29
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,930
Yes, Young Master.

30
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,360
I asked them to help me organize the warehouse...

31
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,430
and take out the trash.

32
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:13,360
Lu Sen. Don't worry about me.

33
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,729
We'll be done soon.

34
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,599
Don't worry.

35
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,370
We're not leaving.

36
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,110
Who cares if you go or not?

37
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,150
I just haven't found another team to take over yours.

38
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:28,949
Sure.

39
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,419
You only care about Friday.

40
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,319
Well, until you find a new team,

41
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:34,349
how about we...

42
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,750
send Friday to you...

43
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:37,990
to test again?

44
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:46,030
Mr. Xie.

45
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:48,530
Leave all the strenuous work to me.

46
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,469
I feel like I'm overflowing with energy.

47
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,599
That's great!

48
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,900
As long as you have energy,

49
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,210
there will be work for you.

50
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,569
Come!

51
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,500
Hi, Friday.

52
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:33,370
Greetings, Master.

53
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,660
You know Yang Shan Shan too, right?

54
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,920
Yes.

55
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,930
When we're together,

56
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,860
what do you do?

57
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,129
Wait for Master's orders.

58
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:05,870
Then if I let you go,

59
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,939
you'll leave, right?

60
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:10,879
I will obey Master's orders without question.

61
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,079
But Friday,

62
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,819
why wouldn't she?

63
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,990
Master.

64
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,920
You're smiling.

65
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,230
If Friday disobeys orders like Yang Shan Shan,

66
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,670
Master will be happy?

67
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:41,939
So Friday,

68
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,879
sometimes, you don't have to listen to everything I say.

69
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,910
Let's say if I ask you to come,

70
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:50,720
I'm not really asking you to come to me.

71
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,620
It's...

72
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,089
Master.

73
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,089
You need me to do something for you?

74
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,129
No.

75
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:04,829
I just came to see you.

76
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,810
Friday.

77
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,379
You should rest for a couple of days.

78
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,149
Not only did Lu Sen not attend the board meeting,

79
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,660
I can't even get a hold of him.

80
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,490
We don't know the details either.

81
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,329
Has the file...

82
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,430
Has the file...

83
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,399
I had Super Smart to steal from Alpha Team's lab...

84
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,470
been deciphered already?

85
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,170
I've sent it to your e-mail.

86
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,439
Okay, I'll take a look.

87
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,309
I sent you some information.

88
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,679
Try to find out now.

89
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,279
What kind of illness is it?

90
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,980
Okay.

91
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,389
I still have a lot of questions about Lu Sen's condition.

92
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,090
That's why I'm hoping to find...

93
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,389
the right treatment for him soon.

94
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,629
Did something happen to Lu Sen?

95
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,700
The monitoring data on Lu Sen...

96
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,929
suddenly disappeared this morning.

97
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,799
It's probably the watch's issue.

98
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,940
Then you should go see him.

99
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,269
- If it isn't the watch... - I've contacted him.

100
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,809
He said he won't see anyone...

101
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:31,809
except for Friday.

102
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:35,279
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,620
I don't know why Friday's charger...

104
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,149
wasn't on yesterday.

105
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,220
The battery is too low. To make a move,

106
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:43,720
we have to charge her for at least two hours.

107
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:46,490
Is there any other way...

108
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,090
to let her see Lu Sen as soon as possible?

109
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,600
Shan Shan.

110
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,230
Actually, for the past few days,

111
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,799
there have been...

112
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,669
a few noticeable improvements to Lu Sen's data.

113
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,210
Although I don't know why,

114
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,279
I have to say,

115
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,840
it's probably...

116
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,509
because of you.

117
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,580
How about this?

118
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,450
I'll go take a quick look.

119
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,419
If everything's fine, I'll be right back.

120
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,720
Wait, Shan Shan.

121
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,659
You can't just go like this.

122
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,519
So many coincidences are connected now.

123
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,389
Don't you think it's strange?

124
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,830
Dr. Fu.

125
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,399
Come take a look at the CCTV footage.

126
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,129
Let's take a look together.

127
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,860
Lu Sen should be fine, I suppose.

128
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,320
I'll get going.

129
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:55,059
Bye.

130
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
If there's nothing else, I'll get going too.

131
00:10:58,429 --> 00:10:59,700
I've been busy.

132
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,830
I have a lot of work to do at the office.

133
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:02,669
Okay.

134
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:05,139
Send me out.

135
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:12,409
Everyone's gone.

136
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,210
What about Lu Sen?

137
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,649
Let's go to sleep.

138
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,750
Didn't you just sleep?

139
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,889
I'm sleepy again.

140
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,970
I should disguise as Friday and see him.

141
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,740
It's sweet.

142
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:48,009
What if it's Friday who comes and not...

143
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,279
No.

144
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,649
What am I thinking?

145
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,220
Do I still hope for that woman to fool me again?

146
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:02,889
But if she really comes later,

147
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,759
what should I do?

148
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,779
Friday.

149
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,279
What took you so long?

150
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,389
She used to stand in front of me like that.

151
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,360
Why didn't I notice?

152
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,389
What should I call him?

153
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,429
Lu Sen or Master?

154
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,269
Master.

155
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,330
I was helping Dr. Fu with the documents.

156
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,139
If there's nothing else...

157
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,539
I called you here, of course there's something.

158
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,970
But I didn't charge properly last night.

159
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,340
My battery is really low.

160
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,309
Go back and charge then.

161
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,279
I'll stay here by myself.

162
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,360
I'll stay with you for a while then.

163
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,029
Okay.

164
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,370
I called you here to tell you...

165
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,539
even though you're a robot and can't lie...

166
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,070
you're still that woman's accomplice.

167
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,909
So I'm canceling your identity as Sweetheart...

168
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,639
and lowering you to the original class.

169
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:29,309
All your privileges are revoked.

170
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,350
Yes, Master.

171
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,720
You robots don't need a room, right?

172
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,889
Yes.

173
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,090
So you don't need these clothes.

174
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:45,000
Yes.

175
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:04,080
(Sweetheart's Room)

176
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,250
Chop all these onions for me.

177
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,080
You're cutting it like this.

178
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,080
I suddenly don't feel like eating.

179
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,580
It's ruining my appetite.

180
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,159
It's your fault.

181
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:54,830
I have no choice but to eat this.

182
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:56,799
High in sugar and calories.

183
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,970
So unhealthy.

184
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,799
He didn't throw it away.

185
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,679
As a robot,

186
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,519
you had it too easy.

187
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,919
As an emotional companion robot,

188
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,450
how can you only do simple house chores?

189
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,519
You have to have the same level of mentality...

190
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,159
as your master.

191
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,460
Mentality?

192
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,029
What is that?

193
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,200
That means it's inappropriate for that book to be here.

194
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,429
It's should be on the shelf.

195
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,240
And in accordance with the library's classification.

196
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:32,940
F is for economy.

197
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,870
C is for general social science.

198
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,340
G is culture.

199
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,370
Something like that.

200
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:39,210
Do you understand?

201
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,610
Yes.

202
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,889
Look. Compared to your classification,

203
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,929
this is much better, right?

204
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,429
From the first time I tested you,

205
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,529
a long time has passed...

206
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,899
since Fu Yang adjusted your coordination.

207
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,509
I'm at the final level of this game.

208
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,080
I'm sure you can help me pass it.

209
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:17,480
What happens if I lose?

210
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,350
It'll all be in vain.

211
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,049
I...

212
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,870
Has it started?

213
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:37,629
Yes.

214
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:04,630
Are you okay, Friday?

215
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,230
Were you scared?

216
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,329
I'm sorry.

217
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,029
I lost.

218
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,569
It's okay.

219
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:16,269
I can always start over.

220
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,410
If everything can really start over,

221
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,079
then that's good.

222
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,519
I'm ready.

223
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,859
Come on.

224
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,599
Master, I'm out of battery.

225
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:43,829
I'm going back to charge.

226
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,220
I'm almost done inputting the data.

227
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:05,019
Look.

228
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,859
It's a little program I put together for you.

229
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:07,930
In the future,

230
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,089
all you have to do is enter the data here.

231
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,529
The values of each item are displayed very clearly.

232
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,230
It'll be easier for you.

233
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:23,539
What's wrong?

234
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,309
Won't working for me...

235
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,109
take up your doctor RAM?

236
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:31,750
Ninety percent.

237
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:33,220
What?

238
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:37,420
Ninety percent of my RAM...

239
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,160
is all you.

240
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,390
But I'm still a bit jealous of that ten percent.

241
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,940
It's interesting.

242
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,470
Li Er.

243
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:56,210
What are you doing here?

244
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,009
Sir.

245
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:01,309
My name is Fu Yang.

246
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,079
We met at the board meeting.

247
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,549
I remember.

248
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,319
The swindler who couldn't make it in America.

249
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,420
Dad.

250
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,730
Why did you want to see me?

251
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:17,589
We're working.

252
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,730
Working?

253
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,000
You haven't been in the office for days because of him.

254
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:23,130
I...

255
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:28,039
Sir.

256
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,069
It's my problem.

257
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,240
I'm sorry I'm meeting you like this for the first time.

258
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:36,950
I'll get going.

259
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:39,619
Wait.

260
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,289
Li Er.

261
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,390
Where are you going?

262
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:47,390
- I'm not going home tonight. - You...

263
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,390
Let's go.

264
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:52,599
Sir.

265
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,400
I'll take care of her.

266
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,920
Li Er.

267
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,150
You can throw a tantrum.

268
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:17,289
But it's not safe for you to be alone.

269
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:19,690
Who said I'm staying alone?

270
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,089
Ms. Kang, your room is 3701.

271
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:24,329
Thank you.

272
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,970
Get me another room next door.

273
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,650
I'm sorry, sir. There are no rooms left.

274
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,250
She has the last one.

275
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:32,759
Close the door.

276
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:56,089
Why don't you sleep in the other bed?

277
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,990
What difference is there?

278
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:02,160
If bad guys come, you'll be safer...

279
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,930
by sleeping in the inner bed.

280
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:08,000
All right.

281
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,609
By the way, do you snore or grind your teeth...

282
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
when you sleep?

283
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,779
Da Yun says I do.

284
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,220
But don't worry.

285
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,920
I fall asleep right away.

286
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,319
You snore and grind your teeth all you want.

287
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:30,319
I can't hear you.

288
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,420
You...

289
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,460
I'm afraid you'll wake me.

290
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,450
Why are you still here?

291
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,089
I'll go back now.

292
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:34,920
I'm sorry.

293
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,119
I hurt you.

294
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:37,420
It hurts.

295
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,119
It hurts so much that I can't move.

296
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,730
I'll go back and charge.

297
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,190
Mr. Li.

298
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,690
I liaised with Mr. Liu whom you introduced.

299
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,730
Based on the information you provided,

300
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,089
this is what he found out.

301
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,059
The condition you are looking for...

302
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,730
is probably an allergy.

303
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,230
The allergen needs to be identified,

304
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,569
including some of the rarer ones...

305
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,809
like light, water or people.

306
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,839
You mean he's not afraid of light and water...

307
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,180
but people?

308
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:36,609
Yes. You can read page five.

309
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,650
This is a very famous case of human allergy...

310
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,220
in the past two years.

311
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:44,089
But so far,

312
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,890
it's the only case in the world.

313
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,490
"Always wears gloves."

314
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,289
"Loner."

315
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,829
"Avoids crowds."

316
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:56,000
Could this be...

317
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,029
the secret why he avoids people?

318
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:02,339
Who else has access to these files?

319
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,369
Only Super Smart and you.

320
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:06,039
This is about the greater good of IMU.

321
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,650
Tell them to destroy all the copies right away.

322
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,980
Don't let this get out.

323
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:10,950
- Do you understand? - Yes.

324
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,859
Do you have the money?

325
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:31,640
Where is the thing?

326
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,500
Money.

327
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,650
Bye.

328
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,019
Hold on.

329
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,250
How long have you worked for Li Zhan?

330
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,460
It has been a while.

331
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:55,890
What do you do?

332
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,230
Keep an eye on Lu Sen.

333
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,529
Keep an eye?

334
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,130
I think he just wants to know...

335
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,700
what Lu Sen does every day.

336
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,769
Next up is our collaboration with Mr. Li.

337
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:08,240
Bear this in mind.

338
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:10,210
Don't let anyone know.

339
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,410
Including Li Zhan.

340
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,180
Got it?

341
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:15,609
Don't worry, Boss.

342
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,880
We're very familiar with Lu Sen's villa now.

343
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:21,650
Crap.

344
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,250
We didn't get the parking fee from him.

345
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,559
Those who achieve great things don't care about small things.

346
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,329
What do you mean?

347
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,730
Let's hurry. They don't charge for half an hour.

348
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,130
Go.

349
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,259
Come on.

350
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,359
The time has come.

351
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,230
It's your turn to make a move.

352
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:02,619
Gosh.

353
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:04,490
I kept pretending to be out of battery last night...

354
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,259
and Lu Sen carried me to bed.

355
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,660
I kept my eyes closed.

356
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,460
How did I fall asleep?

357
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,400
When did I fall asleep?

358
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,500
I didn't drool,

359
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:19,740
grind my teeth and snore, did I?

360
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:23,470
Yang Shan Shan, how dare you?

361
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,509
Lu Sen.

362
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,710
Did he recognize me?

363
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,349
I should leave while I still can.

364
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:04,250
Oh, no.

365
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,819
Is Lu Sen awake yet?

366
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,490
Why isn't he summoning me?

367
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,759
I guess I really didn't expose myself.

368
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,680
Shan Shan.

369
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:15,720
- Shan Shan. - Tang Tang, you're here.

370
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:16,890
Da Yun.

371
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,960
Thank you.

372
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:22,490
I made this one for everyone to share.

373
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,130
I made this one for Shan Shan to give to Lu Sen.

374
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,859
By the way, where is Shan Shan?

375
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,200
Shan Shan.

376
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:29,170
Shan Shan.

377
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,069
Isn't Shan Shan with you?

378
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,339
No.

379
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,470
Then Shan Shan didn't go home last night.

380
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,279
Well, in that case, yes.

381
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,210
What's going on?

382
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,650
It's like this.

383
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:48,049
Shan Shan went to see Lu Sen yesterday.

384
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:50,750
But right now, I think...

385
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:52,519
she's in danger.

386
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,490
Did she get caught...

387
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:55,690
and is locked up?

388
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:58,930
That's good!

389
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,099
Then I'll reward you guys with this too.

390
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,099
Hey, you're scientists.

391
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,400
Why aren't your brains working?

392
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,470
Let me ask you.

393
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,740
Have you heard from Lu Sen's doctor yesterday?

394
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,210
- No. - No.

395
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,710
That means...

396
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:16,579
they're just simply hanging out.

397
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,480
They spent a night together.

398
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,680
Hanging out?

399
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,119
Boss.

400
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,289
Hello, Dr. Fu.

401
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:28,730
Welcome.

402
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:29,529
Boss.

403
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,430
I thought you were just seeing Kang Li Er off yesterday.

404
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,299
Why didn't you come back?

405
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,500
I spent the night at the hotel with Kang Li Er.

406
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,799
What?

407
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:45,839
We were just hanging out.

408
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:47,880
Professor.

409
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,109
I absolutely believe...

410
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,950
that you were just hanging out together.

411
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,680
Have some breakfast.

412
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:56,690
It's okay.

413
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,119
I'll go take a shower.

414
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,329
From what I can see,

415
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,329
don't call this the Alpha Lab.

416
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:12,670
Change it to Shangri-La.

417
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,640
It's not up to me.

418
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,009
Last night...

419
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,509
You ran out of battery yesterday.

420
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,049
So I turned you off.

421
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,250
If there's nothing else, I'll...

422
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,519
But I still need you.

423
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,660
Are you leaving?

424
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,390
I'll stay a little longer.

425
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,099
I made extra by mistake.

426
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:42,200
Throw it away for me.

427
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:05,319
Mr. Lu.

428
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,089
You told me to keep an eye on Li Jing Cheng.

429
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,259
There has been movement again.

430
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,990
But I couldn't reach you.

431
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,130
Give me a call when you get a chance.

432
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,529
(Kang Li Er)

433
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,099
You have a package.

434
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,670
Your package.

435
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,009
Aren't you going to open it?

436
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,039
Open it for him, Friday.

437
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:33,950
This...

438
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,450
Lu Sen asked me to order this a long time ago.

439
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:38,789
Lu Sen.

440
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,759
Take it as an apology gift.

441
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,029
I'll get going...

442
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,000
and leave you two alone.

443
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,730
How did I not notice it before?

444
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,630
You're so bad...

445
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,130
at acting as a robot.

446
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,469
So it was you back then.
