1
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:39,170
(Episode 10: Settled in Your Heart)

2
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,579
Is being seen by me...

3
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,379
a lucky thing?

4
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,879
Of course it is.

5
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,189
Dr. Fu and the others are very grateful...

6
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,920
that you gave them a chance.

7
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,359
I don't care what they think.

8
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,959
You're the only one I like.

9
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,530
But Ms. Pai really wants to fulfill this dream.

10
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,969
Is Ms. Pai your master,

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,400
or am I?

12
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,210
Go to hell, Lu Sen!

13
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:18,840
(Strongly demand to restart)

14
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:19,740
No, no, no.

15
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,479
Be careful!

16
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:25,719
- Hold him still. - I'll kill you.

17
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,669
I want you to trust me more.

18
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,379
Let go of me.

19
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,310
Lu Sen.

20
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,319
Stop right there.

21
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,650
Hey, stop right there!

22
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,090
Why don't we go back?

23
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,189
Let's not go to the garden.

24
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,449
Looks like there's no one else here.

25
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,360
I rented out the whole place.

26
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,159
It's a gift for you.

27
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,120
A gift?

28
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,900
But is this the face of someone who's giving a gift?

29
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,330
Listen carefully.

30
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:47,900
Don't try to protect me when there is danger.

31
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,340
When that rock almost hit us earlier,

32
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,370
I thought I was going to lose you.

33
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:57,509
The thought of you getting hurt,

34
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,039
or having a short circuit...

35
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,509
I'd rather be the one who gets hurt.

36
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,449
My limbs are made of steel.

37
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,379
I will be fine.

38
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:07,650
Besides, you said...

39
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,550
I must prioritize my master's safety.

40
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,590
Let's input it again.

41
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,460
I'll protect you from now on.

42
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:43,860
Friday.

43
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,560
The route you lead me today doesn't seem right.

44
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,430
I'm sorry, son.

45
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,300
How dare you touch me!

46
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,930
I'm just pruning here.

47
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,399
I didn't see you there.

48
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,670
It was just a touch.

49
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,600
Why is there someone else here?

50
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,269
Do I have to buy this place?

51
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,370
No, you...

52
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,269
Forget it.

53
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,209
He, he.

54
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,379
You should go first.

55
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:08,910
That's ridiculous.

56
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,810
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,519
Mr. Lu.

58
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,350
Friday.

59
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:18,160
Is there anything on my face?

60
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,689
How about my neck?

61
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,290
Nothing.

62
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,300
That can't be.

63
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,069
What about my illness?

64
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,339
Friday.

65
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,209
Do you remember when I told you...

66
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:35,170
I have an allergy?

67
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,779
Is there by any chance...

68
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,410
that your allergy is caused by contact with humans?

69
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,449
But I'm human too.

70
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,120
What's going on here?

71
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,149
Am I...

72
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,220
really fine now?

73
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,759
Friday.

74
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:54,790
You insisted on coming out today.

75
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,329
You've done so well.

76
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:57,560
This is the best decision...

77
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,500
you've made in your robotic life.

78
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,370
I'm so happy.

79
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,139
As long as you're happy.

80
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,600
If you're happy, I'm happy.

81
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,110
Come on, I'll take you somewhere.

82
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,910
Where to?

83
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,279
Done.

84
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,310
Boss.

85
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,649
Richard and I refined a pot.

86
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,879
It's for making crayfish.

87
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:18,680
Check this out.

88
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,990
What's going on?

89
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,829
The security cameras are down.

90
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,889
Didn't anyone notice it?

91
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,360
What have you been doing?

92
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:33,870
I'm sorry, sir.

93
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,930
We didn't notice.

94
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,569
Lu Sen's Friday is fake.

95
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,470
What if something goes wrong?

96
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,279
Go to hell, Lu Sen!

97
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:48,310
Be careful.

98
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,120
Drive.

99
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:00,959
Shan Shan is in danger.

100
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,000
Are we really going in there?

101
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,970
There's a lot of scary stuff in there.

102
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,810
If anything happens,

103
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:18,509
you must protect...

104
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,410
yourself.

105
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,709
Okay.

106
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,019
If anyone comes near you,

107
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:26,850
I'll just...

108
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,149
blow them away.

109
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,389
Then,

110
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,389
we're getting off now.

111
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
If we don't get off now, the park will be closed.

112
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,129
You take me with you...

113
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,000
and I bring the injection.

114
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:42,600
I'm here, don't worry.

115
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,970
Hold on.

116
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,170
Look at this.

117
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,110
Remember what I said to you?

118
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,149
You have the injection.

119
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,419
It's okay.

120
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,850
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

121
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,360
What do you think?

122
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:47,129
It's okay.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,929
I'm really fine.

124
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:52,440
Let's go.

125
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:56,440
Look at that.

126
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,009
Water guns.

127
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,289
Mom, go faster.

128
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,230
Okay.

129
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,940
Isn't it fun?

130
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,610
Are you okay?

131
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:38,120
My parents used to take me here when I was little.

132
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,950
I thought about it countless times...

133
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:43,649
that once I am cured,

134
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,120
this would be the first place I'd visit.

135
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,889
Let's go and play.

136
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,120
This is so cute.

137
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,289
Pick one, I will give it to you.

138
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,250
That one.

139
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:11,179
I'll pick one for you too.

140
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,440
You should have that one.

141
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:14,679
Here.

142
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,450
I'll help you.

143
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,259
Mr. Lu.

144
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:26,090
I've been promoted to sweetheart,

145
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,389
so I have all the rights to you.

146
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,029
What are you talking about?

147
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,929
Let's take a picture.

148
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,850
Soon.

149
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,019
Are we there yet?

150
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:55,250
Right here.

151
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,159
Where?

152
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,399
There they are.

153
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,870
Yes.

154
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,710
I'm fine now. I'm completely fine.

155
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,409
I'm out right now.

156
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,710
There are so many people around me.

157
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,610
When we stood in line today,

158
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:25,049
I've had contact with at least ten people.

159
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,250
It's an amazing feeling.

160
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,019
What could it be?

161
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,519
You have to tell me the truth.

162
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,889
I want to see you right now.

163
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:33,659
I don't know why.

164
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:35,460
Anyway, I'm at an amusement park.

165
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,889
There are so many people around.

166
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,629
But...

167
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,899
I don't have a rash at all.

168
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
My little car.

169
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,970
Thank you.

170
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,269
It's okay. Go have fun.

171
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,169
Bye.

172
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:46,200
Bye.

173
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,769
Hello kids, come here.

174
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,809
- Our show. - Friday...

175
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,039
It's about to start.

176
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,039
Today,

177
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:58,049
welcome to the dinosaur world.

178
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,990
Today is the day...

179
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,419
we the primates fight with dinosaurs.

180
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,590
Kids, will you support us?

181
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,299
Lu Sen, are you okay?

182
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,500
Where are you now?

183
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,029
Listen, stay calm.

184
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,539
Inject yourself immediately.

185
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,799
The injection is with Friday.

186
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,120
Lu Sen.

187
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,379
Lu Sen.

188
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:08,490
Are you okay?

189
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:12,389
Dr. Ou.

190
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,460
I think I found...

191
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:16,960
the key to my recovery.

192
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:19,299
It's her.

193
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,570
My Friday.

194
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,580
Don't worry.

195
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,210
I'm fine.

196
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:17,960
It is you.

197
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:22,460
You're the key to my full recovery.

198
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:31,740
I'll buy you the best and the most durable...

199
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,340
battery in the world.

200
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,840
I want you by my side forever,

201
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,809
until the last moment of my life.

202
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:39,309
From now on,

203
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,009
you're my most precious treasure.

204
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,659
I...

205
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,600
What are you doing?

206
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,169
Is this your test for Friday?

207
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,289
I told you he's not a good person.

208
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,320
Why did he give you clothes...

209
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:59,590
for some cosplay games?

210
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,490
He is sick.

211
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,330
I want to say...

212
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:02,230
No wonder back then,

213
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:04,059
he signed the contract so quickly.

214
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,130
He has so many dirty thoughts.

215
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,299
No, he...

216
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,029
Pervert.

217
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,329
- He is mean. - So mean.

218
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,670
He's a pervert.

219
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,940
You're the boss. Say something.

220
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,200
Thank you, Shan Shan.

221
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,240
At a time like this,

222
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:19,279
you're still considerate of our team.

223
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,349
Have you been suffering all this time...

224
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,279
before we began to notice?

225
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,750
You don't have to make such sacrifices again.

226
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,259
We're the ones who wronged you.

227
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,089
Alpha Team will protect you from now on.

228
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,660
No.

229
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,730
You weren't like this before.

230
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,500
How can you say that now?

231
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,730
I didn't know you well enough.

232
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,170
I didn't expect you...

233
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,839
to be this nice.

234
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,210
Really?

235
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,009
You said I wasn't cut out for research.

236
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,079
Research is not for you.

237
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:00,119
But that's your IQ.

238
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,519
It's not a matter of character.

239
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,589
Okay, then.

240
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:14,829
But it's been a long day.

241
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:17,700
Please take me straight to the cafe.

242
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,539
I'm not going back tonight.

243
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:21,940
But you need to go back,

244
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:23,710
so Pai Song can remove your armor.

245
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,539
I'll make do for tonight...

246
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,009
and remove it tomorrow morning.

247
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,880
My friend has always wanted to see this armor.

248
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,019
Is that okay?

249
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,049
Come on, let's go to the cafe.

250
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,190
When is your friend free?

251
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:38,859
She's welcome to the lab.

252
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,289
A tour of learning witnesses.

253
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:41,930
Yes.

254
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,589
She's welcome to visit us.

255
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,660
Let's go.

256
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,009
Welcome.

257
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,279
Why are you back so early?

258
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,650
Didn't you say...

259
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,119
you were hanging out at the amusement park?

260
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:26,869
What's wrong?

261
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,210
Here, have some water.

262
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:29,640
You look down.

263
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,039
Are you tired?

264
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,980
Maybe my clothes are too heavy.

265
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,519
I can't breathe well.

266
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:41,849
Anyway,

267
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,349
what's up with the competition?

268
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,859
Did he agree to give it a restart?

269
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:47,859
Don't get me started on that.

270
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,160
Why would someone suddenly smash up the car?

271
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,730
We didn't agree to that.

272
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,700
I asked the contestants later.

273
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:55,700
They said...

274
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:57,470
he was the ex-creative director of IMU...

275
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,869
that Lu Sen fired back then.

276
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,569
He deliberately blended in...

277
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,039
for a personal vendetta.

278
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,339
With Lu Sen's personality,

279
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,779
did he offend many people in private?

280
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:10,210
Fortunately, he's fine.

281
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:11,980
But I am sure...

282
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:14,450
Mr. Si will continue to investigate.

283
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,519
We will be fine as long as we keep our distance.

284
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,920
It just means that the idea of restarting the competition...

285
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,490
will go up in smoke.

286
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,190
You can't say that.

287
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,500
Isn't something happening between you two?

288
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:29,700
What are you talking about?

289
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,869
You tell me.

290
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:34,240
Come on.

291
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:36,609
Why would a machine get to follow its master...

292
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,839
to the amusement park?

293
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,410
Machines are always at home,

294
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,210
either charging up...

295
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,180
or at work.

296
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,210
He has a special reason.

297
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:45,680
Special reason?

298
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,289
The look on your face...

299
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:49,650
is quite special indeed.

300
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:51,519
Did something special...

301
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:53,920
happen this afternoon too?

302
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,029
No.

303
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,670
No, nothing happened.

304
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,670
So you're saying...

305
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,309
Lu Sen isn't good enough...

306
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,380
and he's not your cup of tea.

307
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,210
I just feel like...

308
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,210
he's a kid.

309
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,049
Maybe it's because he's lived alone for too long,

310
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,720
so he got rusty with communication.

311
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,190
I remember someone said...

312
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,589
he's a jerk...

313
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,130
and a weirdo.

314
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,660
I'm just a robot to him, anyway.

315
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,230
I'm done for today.

316
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,630
I'll go get changed.

317
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,470
Wait, don't go.

318
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,039
I wanted to see your armor.

319
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,509
Yang Shan Shan.

320
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,920
Things around you are just getting interesting.

321
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,660
Lu Sen.

322
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,430
Dr. Ou.

323
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,700
I was worried and I couldn't reach you.

324
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,670
That's why I came.

325
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:12,799
How did it go?

326
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,769
I'm not sure.

327
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,279
It's complicated.

328
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,910
Let me check you first.

329
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,480
There's no need to. I'm fine now.

330
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,660
What did you say?

331
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,789
You didn't get a shot this time...

332
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,359
and just seeing that robot changed you back to normal?

333
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,269
I am just a normal person...

334
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:48,940
when Friday is beside me.

335
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:52,180
But once I leave her,

336
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,279
I will fall ill.

337
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:57,210
I don't know why.

338
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,890
Is she the robot that looks like a human?

339
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,519
Yes, she's the one I told you about.

340
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,900
Since that robot came here,

341
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,029
what have you two done?

342
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,029
About that,

343
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,539
we spent time together.

344
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:24,369
Together doing what?

345
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,410
Nothing special.

346
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:38,690
Let me ask you this.

347
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,359
If I say, that from now on,

348
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,660
you are not allowed to see that robot for ten days,

349
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,430
how would you feel?

350
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,599
I'd feel a bit uncomfortable.

351
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,509
The robot knows about your condition.

352
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,180
You have confided in her...

353
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,380
your inner frustrations...

354
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,480
sincerely and genuinely, right?

355
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:13,990
That means you and that robot...

356
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,160
have built a relationship.

357
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:19,759
That must be why the miracle happened.

358
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:24,000
Your allergy is psychological.

359
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,940
It comes from a distrust of human beings.

360
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,170
When such a thing...

361
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,039
that looks human, but isn't really one...

362
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,240
Sorry, I shouldn't call her "a thing".

363
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,009
Anyway, she makes you feel safe enough.

364
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,049
Being with a friend like that...

365
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,349
naturally helps with your illness.

366
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,789
A friend?

367
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,890
Build a relationship?

368
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,329
You can't bear to be apart from her.

369
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:53,960
That means you two already have a relationship.

370
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,170
Relationships are putting down roots in someone's heart.

371
00:24:58,369 --> 00:24:59,369
The robot,

372
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,339
she has settled in your heart.

373
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,799
Are you sure...

374
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,269
you're not sharing the bed with me?

375
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:35,740
I'm not sleeping with you.

376
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:36,910
My armor is too heavy.

377
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,009
I didn't want to hold you down.

378
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:39,740
Okay.

379
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,380
Then why didn't you take it off...

380
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,450
before coming to see me?

381
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,609
I thought you wanted to see a robot.

382
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:46,480
Come on.

383
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:48,890
I said I wanted to see a real robot.

384
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,390
Robots played by real people like you...

385
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,420
has been a cliche plot...

386
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,960
since I was three.

387
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,559
Okay, I'll show you next time.

388
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,359
Okay.

389
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,029
You should get some rest tonight.

390
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:06,970
- Good night. - Night.

391
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,190
So,

392
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:32,230
she has taken root in my heart.

393
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:39,269
Have I been settled...

394
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:40,670
in her heart then?

395
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,140
She doesn't have a heart.

396
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,779
I need to find the cause of the miracle.

397
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,450
Only then can you be completely cured.

398
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:51,849
Think about...

399
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:52,750
every detail...

400
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,519
of the time you spent with the robot.

401
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,890
Pick out the most important moments,

402
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:00,089
so I can piece together your healing timeline.

403
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,109
A miraculous moment.

404
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,190
What are you doing?

405
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,319
What's wrong with you?

406
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,759
You look like a decent person,

407
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,730
but in reality, you're a pervert, aren't you?

408
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:38,900
Where are your eyes?

409
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,099
Stop staring at me.

410
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,430
I'll beat you to a pulp!

411
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:52,710
Are you all right?

412
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,180
What did you just do to me?

413
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:59,180
I just figured out you need help...

414
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,819
so I aided you urgently.

415
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,059
Friday.

416
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:10,829
Thank you.

417
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,529
Friday, please pass me...

418
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,269
Master.

419
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,539
It must have been hard.

420
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:33,720
How are you feeling?

421
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:34,750
Any better?

422
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:45,960
You gave me the shot.

423
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:47,559
You saved me.

424
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:49,829
I became a monster.

425
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,170
And yet you still recognized me.

426
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:57,470
No matter what you become,

427
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,109
I will still recognize you.

428
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,519
Building relationships.

429
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:10,450
Takes root in the heart.

430
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,589
Stop the weird thoughts, Yang Shan Shan.

431
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:16,759
You and Lu Sen will soon be strangers.

432
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,329
Stop thinking about it.

433
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,720
Top ten human allergies.

434
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,460
I'm the only one...

435
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:55,769
who's feeling such distracting, budding desire,

436
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:57,630
but some robot...

437
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,339
is recharging comfortably.

438
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,039
It's so unfair.

439
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,690
Until the last moment of my life.

440
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,190
From now on,

441
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,660
you're my most precious treasure.

442
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,400
I didn't expect Lu Sen to be such a pervert.

443
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,529
The first time I saw him,

444
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,170
I knew something was off about him.

445
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,410
Could it be love?

446
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,980
To Lu Sen, she is Friday.

447
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,980
What Lu Sen has been doing...

448
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,279
is an insult to our research.

449
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,220
Maybe it was a mistake choosing him in the first place.

450
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,319
Boss.

451
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,589
The compensation is 300 million dollars.

452
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:55,789
Not three,

453
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:57,160
not 30,

454
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:58,559
but 300 million.

455
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,099
Selling the eight kidneys of the four of us...

456
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
isn't enough to pay the interest.

457
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,240
Wang Da Yun.

458
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,470
Lu Sen is defiling Friday.

459
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:09,569
He's tarnishing the work of all researchers.

460
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,170
Yes, I know.

461
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:17,079
Let me sleep on it first.

462
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,740
Lu Sen.

463
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,069
You...

464
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:45,980
How could you do this?

465
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,579
You greedy cheater.

466
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,119
How could you do this to me...

467
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,950
and to Kang Li Er?

468
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,299
Yes, speaking.

469
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,930
I've read the documents.

470
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:13,400
So this woman...

471
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,970
is not an assistant.

472
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,269
Okay, good.

473
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,240
Investigate it.

474
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,980
Find out everything.

475
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,210
When did she and Lu Sen meet?

476
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,049
What is the relationship now?

477
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,250
How far has the relationship gone?

478
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:29,720
If you can get this done,

479
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,319
I'll pay more.
