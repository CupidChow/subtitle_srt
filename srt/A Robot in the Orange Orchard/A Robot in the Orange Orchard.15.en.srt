00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,569
(Episode 15: Losing You)

2
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,239
Mr. Xie.

3
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:41,810
From now on,

4
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,579
leave it all to Friday.

5
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,250
Young Master.

6
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,150
It's not appropriate.

7
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,019
Aren't you a robot?

8
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,519
You can lift 30kg with just one hand.

9
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:57,519
What are you waiting for?

10
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,189
Do it.

11
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,000
Wait.

12
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,069
Carrying one at a time will take too long.

13
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:21,610
Take them all of it at once.

14
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,740
What can you really do?

15
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,039
Friday.

16
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,169
Can't you see how dirty it is over there?

17
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,509
Come clean it up.

18
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,419
Am I not your sweetheart?

19
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,689
But you've been bossing me around.

20
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,960
Are you my sweetheart?

21
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,030
You have such low storage.

22
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,400
I'd rather let you work instead.

23
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,729
Look how tired Dusty is.

24
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,169
Go and help him.

25
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,240
I shouldn't have put a face on Dusty in the first place.

26
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,080
There's more.

27
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,810
Once you're done here, clean up the study room.

28
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,879
If you keep making me work,

29
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,150
I'll run out of battery soon.

30
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,689
No battery?

31
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,590
You're just afraid of getting tired.

32
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:11,960
If you're tired,

33
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,590
just think about what happened last night.

34
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,300
Why don't I come clean that I'm human?

35
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,759
Do it. Tell him now.

36
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,329
Last night...

37
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,810
Last night...

38
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:31,079
You were not allergic.

39
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,250
Then why are you allergic to people?

40
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,660
Because of the lies.

41
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,730
Lie?

42
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,569
Because I was lied to by someone close to me.

43
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:00,269
Humans are nothing but...

44
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,040
a species of deceit.

45
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,079
But you're different.

46
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,410
When I see your face,

47
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,980
your iron arms, and strong legs,

48
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,980
I'm relieved.

49
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,250
Then I don't feel sick around people anymore.

50
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,860
Friday.

51
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,860
You won't lie to me, right?

52
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,529
Of course not.

53
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,500
I won't lie to you.

54
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,240
Don't think I won't boss you around just because you're being obedient.

55
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,810
Look at all this dust.

56
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,810
And that card castle.

57
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,149
You knocked it over.

58
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,420
I want you to rebuild it.

59
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,649
Build it with joy.

60
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,819
Until you remember what happened last night.

61
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,959
Okay.

62
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,879
There are so many leaves!

63
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,689
Here and here.

64
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,560
Do you see all these fallen leaves?

65
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,720
Come on.

66
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,019
The person in front of me is glowing.

67
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,089
One word of his can make me...

68
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:56,019
forget all my past grievances,

69
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,720
frustration and sorrow.

70
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,490
Even though I know the fireworks will disappear...

71
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,730
once they go off in the night sky,

72
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,269
but I still greedily want to keep its lights in my heart...

73
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,430
forever.

74
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,670
If a moment can last forever,

75
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,410
wouldn't that be nice?

76
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:09,189
Richard.

77
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,290
Let me ask you a question.

78
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,970
I have a good scientist friend.

79
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,399
It's his first date with a woman.

80
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,870
They are going to see satellite orbits.

81
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:25,779
What do you think of the date?

82
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,419
You have a good scientist friend?

83
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,720
You're talking about yourself, aren't you?

84
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,960
Get to the point.

85
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,429
If this was a first date,

86
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,330
it's not so good.

87
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,230
Why not?

88
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:54,039
Isn't that a little egoistic?

89
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,909
How is going to see satellite orbits egoistic?

90
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:58,580
She likes it too.

91
00:08:58,909 --> 00:08:59,879
I like it too.

92
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,120
Professor.

93
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,220
You're always talking about yourself.

94
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:10,549
Then how can I improve?

95
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:12,919
How do I find out...

96
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,330
what girls like?

97
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,830
Sir.

98
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,700
You're acting strange today.

99
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,899
Why are you suddenly interested in girls?

100
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,240
I'm trying to perfect Friday!

101
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,269
After all, Friday is a woman.

102
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:29,009
Professor.

103
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,779
Friday doesn't need you.

104
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,879
She has a large database.

105
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,519
Nice weather we're having.

106
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:06,210
Da Yun.

107
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,279
Let me ask you something.

108
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,580
Boss.

109
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,950
What did you say?

110
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,090
What are you doing here?

111
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:23,730
Picking flowers.

112
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,600
Your outfit...

113
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:29,600
It's pretty, isn't it?

114
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,769
I'm here for your...

115
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,240
your lab. It needs some colors.

116
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,220
I thought I'd stop by and let you see me.

117
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,490
I'm looking at you.

118
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,019
Help me pick some leaves.

119
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:51,720
The combination will look good.

120
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:02,970
Isn't it pretty?

121
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:04,840
Yes.

122
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,009
I'm talking about the flowers.

123
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:15,480
Green leaves are pretty.

124
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,309
Get more green leaves.

125
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,120
Pai Song.

126
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,389
Everything's fine.

127
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:29,960
Get ready.

128
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:34,830
Friday.

129
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,669
Try to stand up.

130
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,370
Are you checking for physical stability?

131
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:46,110
You're a professional.

132
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,679
Of course I am.

133
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,049
In the past,

134
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,120
I heard a great speech.

135
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,250
Whose speech?

136
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,149
I'm not telling you.

137
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,960
Are you okay?

138
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:08,230
I'm fine.

139
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:15,610
Kiss time.

140
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,409
Where did you learn to talk like that?

141
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,309
From TV.

142
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,950
Let's test it again.

143
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,789
Friday.

144
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:32,259
Adjust posture.

145
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:36,330
Step back.

146
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,830
Stop.

147
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,429
Sit down.

148
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,269
A robot can't do anything wrong.

149
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,679
It's the fault of those who can't forget.

150
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,980
Because it's a robot,

151
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,879
it might be unstable.

152
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,250
That's why things went wrong,

153
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,620
causing the storage to be erased.

154
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,350
Why do I have to give her such a hard time?

155
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,429
Lu Sen.

156
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,330
I have good news for you.

157
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:19,669
I finally found the second case in the world...

158
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,009
who shares your symptom.

159
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,409
Really?

160
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,480
Of course.

161
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:26,610
This patient is in Sweden.

162
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:27,809
I already checked.

163
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,649
His physical contact disorder...

164
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,779
is all healed.

165
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,919
And the key to his recovery...

166
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,019
was his girlfriend, Susan.

167
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,120
To be exact,

168
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:40,090
a stable relationship...

169
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:41,330
was what cured him.

170
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,759
I believe...

171
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:44,429
it'll work on you too.

172
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,230
I'll follow up with this patient.

173
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:50,000
Don't worry and stay at home.

174
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,840
Get along with your robot.

175
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,710
The key to healing...

176
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,210
is love?

177
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,549
So is Friday...

178
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:07,549
someone I love?

179
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,789
But it's true that she's cured me.

180
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,759
But humans falling in love with robots...

181
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,200
Play "Edward Scissorhands".

182
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,240
It's the same.

183
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,879
It's exactly the same.

184
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,120
I guess it's not so unreasonable...

185
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,190
that humans could fall for robots.

186
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,389
It's precisely why...

187
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,759
it is even more beautiful.

188
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,889
Hi, Friday.

189
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,090
Hello, Mr. Lu Sen.

190
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,059
Welcome.

191
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,259
Why don't you call me Master?

192
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
My current operational system...

193
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:26,759
is on the highest level of the Master Version.

194
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,269
You're the only Friday, aren't you?

195
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:36,710
The Alpha Team has only made one Friday for now.

196
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,779
Even if it there is a clone,

197
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,240
its functions will be exactly the same as mine.

198
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:44,750
So you are my Friday?

199
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,350
As you can see, yes.

200
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,120
How are you going to prove it?

201
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:51,220
People who don't trust others...

202
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,289
will not have anyone's trust in the end.

203
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:01,429
Do you remember what happened yesterday?

204
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,539
Are you talking about the kiss last night?

205
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,169
So you do remember.

206
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,070
All the data is backed up...

207
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:10,509
in your exclusive files.

208
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,480
You can extract it whenever you need it.

209
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:13,840
Why did you kiss me?

210
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,649
According to the TV show,

211
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,049
when there's a romantic vibe,

212
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
it's a good time to kiss.

213
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,090
So you like me too, right?

214
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,690
I've enjoyed our time together.

215
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,629
What if someone else becomes your owner?

216
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,429
If he rewires you,

217
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,730
will you say the same thing?

218
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,200
Yes.

219
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,600
Friday serves everybody.

220
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,019
Are you sure we shouldn't wait for Mr. Fu?

221
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,289
He'll come once he's found a parking spot.

222
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,889
I'm so full now.

223
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,590
I'm going to get a good night's sleep.

224
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,990
Sleep?

225
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:02,230
We have to keep working on Friday.

226
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,690
The last one there cleans up.

227
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,359
Wang Da Yun, wait!

228
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,529
I couldn't find you anywhere.

229
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,599
Fu Yang.

230
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:56,250
Tell me.

231
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,619
If I give Friday back,

232
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,420
will Lu Sen find out that we lied to him?

233
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,089
Maybe.

234
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,400
But we don't have any other choice.

235
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,369
Then maybe we should tell him the truth.

236
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,279
Friday is almost ready.

237
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,109
It won't affect our investment.

238
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,750
This way, we don't have to keep worrying...

239
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:31,849
about lying to him.

240
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,920
I know.

241
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,119
You're quite restless

242
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,519
for lying for so long.

243
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:42,759
That goes for all of us.

244
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,759
It was fine when it was just about money.

245
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,930
Once we started to accept Lu Sen as a friend,

246
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,269
we don't have any other choice.

247
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,769
You know about Lu Sen's allergy.

248
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,480
He's hell-bent on keeping Friday...

249
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:03,450
because only when he can see Friday...

250
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,519
and when it's beside him will he stop being allergic.

251
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,589
I know he's allergic.

252
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,460
I looked it up too.

253
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,160
He's allergic to humans.

254
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,960
But when we're together,

255
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:19,460
he's never had an episode.

256
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:20,730
So I thought...

257
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,369
I think...

258
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,640
it might be fine to tell him the truth.

259
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,869
When you are together,

260
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,940
he's never had an episode.

261
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:30,539
That's because he only sees you as a robot.

262
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,609
Can you imagine what will happen...

263
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,779
once we confess?

264
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:38,950
I can't.

265
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,250
He keeps saying Friday is his only cure.

266
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,190
The only cure...

267
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,700
What if he loses the only cure he has?

268
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,730
The only thing I can do now is...

269
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,009
making Friday act like you as much as possible.

270
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,279
That's the only way to reduce the chance of it happening.

271
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:06,710
Shan Shan.

272
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:09,250
I need you to imitate Friday.

273
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:11,750
Friday has to imitate you as well.

274
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,519
Maybe that's the safest thing...

275
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,619
for Lu Sen.

276
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:42,509
So...

277
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,119
You like me too, right?

278
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,220
I've enjoyed our time together.

279
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,950
What if someone else becomes your owner?

280
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:50,019
What if he rewires you?

281
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,190
Will you say the same thing?

282
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,319
Yes.

283
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,490
Friday serves everybody.

284
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,480
I still remember everything clearly.

285
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,450
But you said to me,

286
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:21,049
it's all fake.

287
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,490
So...

288
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:29,960
I'm not the only one you will obey.

289
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,529
You have room...

290
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:37,730
for someone else as well.

291
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:42,369
But the memories you've planted in my heart...

292
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:45,980
are meaningful...

293
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:50,450
to me only.

294
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,740
It's fixed?

295
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,839
More or less.

296
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:52,440
But the difference between your language system...

297
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:53,440
and Friday's is too great.

298
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:56,980
I'm worried that Friday's A.I. black box...

299
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,049
will contain unnecessary information.

300
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,289
Black boxes of AI?

301
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:05,259
There's a lot of unknown in AI.

302
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,690
All the unknown...

303
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,390
is called A.I. black box.

304
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,529
Just to be safe,

305
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,829
I have to run a full test on Friday multiple times...

306
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
to eliminate the bugs.

307
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,170
Then will Friday be just like me?

308
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:26,009
You're very expressive.

309
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,680
It's impossible for it to be completely like you.

310
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,250
Then what should we do?

311
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,079
Shan Shan.

312
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,950
We need to make this right.

313
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:40,490
You've got to behave like Friday the best you can.

314
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,529
We have to guide Lu Sen to accept how a real robot behaves.

315
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,099
And we will...

316
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,059
help Friday to match your data...

317
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,099
as best as possible.

318
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:53,970
We'll make the exchange in three days.

319
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,009
Okay?

320
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,710
Look.

321
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,750
A robot has delayed movements.

322
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,710
It is mechanical.

323
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,220
A robot gives approved answers.

324
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,920
They don't talk a lot like we do.

325
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,119
So do your best...

326
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,190
to fulfill instructions given to Friday.

327
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:14,789
After all, our real goal is...

328
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:16,690
to get Lu Sen to accept the real Friday.

329
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:22,799
Yes...

330
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:25,000
Lu Sen...

331
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:29,410
What he needs is a real robot.

332
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,109
Shan Shan.

333
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:40,650
Thank you for your hard work.

334
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,319
Thank you.

335
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,960
You don't have to thank me.

336
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,460
Get back to work.

337
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:49,690
Seriously...

338
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,390
The more robotic, the better.

339
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,960
Remember that you're a robot.

340
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:27,299
You're Friday.

341
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,769
You have no emotions.

342
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,529
Forget everything that happened.

343
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:33,000
You're going to guide him to accept the real Friday.

344
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,539
That's what's best for him.

345
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:53,259
Don't you have any questions for me?

346
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:56,130
I don't ask, so you won't talk. Is that it?

347
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,890
Master.

348
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,559
You're in a bad mood today.

349
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:02,730
I'm laughing now.

350
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,529
What makes you think I'm in a bad mood?

351
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:06,599
Because I've been watching you.

352
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,769
Yes.

353
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:10,269
Attentively observing the specimen example's data...

354
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,779
has always been your job.

355
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,880
You would observe anyone, wouldn't you?

356
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,539
Do you honestly find it funny?

357
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:41,369
Or are you smiling because of the embedded instructions?

358
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,910
In order to connect better with my master,

359
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,250
I give immediate feedback...

360
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,049
depending on my master's mood,

361
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:28,519
Unable to identify Master's facial expression.

362
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,450
Would you like me to call an ambulance?

363
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,500
You really don't remember, do you?

364
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,720
That Ms. Xing I saw at Lu Sen's house the other day...

365
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,519
has to be a real person.

366
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,460
She's too clever.

367
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,890
Why do they think she's a robot?

368
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:11,329
Is there truly such a realistic robot?

369
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,299
Lu Sen.

370
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,299
What on earth are you up to?

371
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,599
No...

372
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,410
Ms. Xing is human.

373
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,380
It's so obvious.

374
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:28,910
Something's wrong.

375
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,079
Something has to be wrong.

376
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:47,759
How is that possible?

377
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,369
No information whatsoever.

378
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:57,369
But this seems like something Lu Sen would do.

379
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:01,180
(No Match)

380
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:10,950
Wear this.

381
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:13,390
As long as you like it.

382
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,759
They didn't suspect you, did they?

383
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:19,529
Of course not. I'm human.

384
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,700
That's the spirit.

385
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,769
Come on.

386
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,259
You remember, don't you?

387
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:49,289
You have feelings, don't you?

388
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,240
Can you not look at me like that?

389
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,069
Master.

390
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,339
I'm not sure what you mean.

391
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:13,049
Are you reminding me...

392
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:17,089
not to get caught up in the eyes of a robot?

393
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,960
That I shouldn't be mad because you will obey anybody?

394
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,660
That I shouldn't care?

395
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,829
You, a robot,

396
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,970
has forgotten our memories together.

397
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,869
Input this for me.

398
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,670
I said, input this!

399
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:43,980
We're not friends anymore.

400
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,890
Only turn on Operation Mode from now on.

401
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,490
Yes, Master.

402
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,160
I'll clean up the study now.

403
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,930
Call me if you need anything.

404
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:58,329
There's no need to.

405
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,630
Just go back to the lab.

406
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,329
I still have some battery left.

407
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,799
You should go.

408
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,569
And don't come again tomorrow.

409
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:44,970
I'm late.

410
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,519
Hello, Aunt.

411
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,650
What's wrong?

412
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:07,519
Shan Shan, are you free today?

413
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,059
Your uncle and I both have to work overtime today.

414
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,430
I have a favor to ask.

415
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,700
Combining with the last checkup,

416
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:18,230
I found out that she is allergic...

417
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:19,839
to peanuts, tomatoes, egg whites,

418
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,769
and even ticks.

419
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,440
How about you take her to get a checkup first?

420
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,380
Okay.

421
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:26,410
Hey, kid.

422
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:28,680
Can you come and do a checkup with me?

423
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,210
Let's go.

424
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:34,079
Since her allergy is under control,

425
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,450
I'll prescribe some medicine for emergencies.

426
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,119
Is there anything else?

427
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,259
It's not a big deal.

428
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,930
But stay away from the allergens.

429
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:45,329
Although the chance of an emergency shock is low,

430
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,829
just to be safe,

431
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,829
I'll write you another prescription for an EpiPen.

432
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:54,170
Doctor.

433
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,910
In terms of allergens,

434
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,640
is there an allergy to humans?

435
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,079
A human allergy?

436
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,380
I think there are some cases.

437
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,180
But the chances of that happening is very low.

438
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,980
There was an Englishwoman a few years ago.

439
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:08,849
She was allergic to her newborn baby.

440
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,219
All she had to do was hold her baby...

441
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:11,389
and she'd get sores on her body.

442
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,119
It's a kind of pemphigus vulgaris during pregnancy.

443
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:15,889
Aside from babies,

444
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,289
what about an allergy that extends to all human beings?

445
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,030
I've never heard of such a case.

446
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,139
So what happened to the lady?

447
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,039
Was she cured?

448
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,570
This type of pemphigus...

449
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,510
will naturally go away in a couple of months.

450
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:34,579
So here's my advice.

451
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,980
You should take the patient to a specialized hospital...

452
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,480
to run some specified tests.

453
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:39,250
Thank you, Doctor.

454
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,079
You're welcome.

455
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,510
The follow-up was good.

456
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,679
Your numbers are all normal.

457
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:12,719
I told you.

458
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,519
You can try going out without gloves.

459
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,860
I tried last time

460
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,860
at an amusement park.

461
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,289
But now, Friday's gone.

462
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,800
You're showing off your Friday again.

463
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:31,230
Why didn't you bring her today?

464
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,269
What's wrong?

465
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,769
Is there something wrong with the robot?

466
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,110
No, she's fine.

467
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,780
Everything is as it used to be.

468
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,280
Then what's wrong?

469
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,719
The question is, how can she be the same as before?

470
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:49,750
Because of her,

471
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,449
I feel like I have grass growing inside my heart.

472
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,389
But she acts like nothing has happened.

473
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:58,289
Aren't you overthinking it?

474
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,659
She can make you feel things.

475
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,000
Isn't that good enough?

476
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,030
But I want her...

477
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,630
to love me with all her heart!

478
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:10,809
Robert.

479
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:15,579
You can't expect a robot to give you true love.

480
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,550
You need to understand.

481
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:22,420
You're only building a partnership with her.

482
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:23,820
She can keep you company.

483
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,659
She can make you feel happier and safer...

484
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,760
than you've ever been.

485
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:28,860
That was the key to your recovery.

486
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,059
But understand this.

487
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,300
Only real humans...

488
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,900
can give you the happiness you really crave.

489
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:40,139
But Friday brings me happiness.

490
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:43,139
It's fake. It's a facade.

491
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:49,250
Do you know what real life partners are like?

492
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:51,880
They have great chemistry with each other.

493
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:53,820
But it's always unexpected.

494
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:56,820
Unlike Friday, she can only follow orders.

495
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,260
I hope you can experience...

496
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,590
what it's like to feel your heart...

497
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:06,829
beating for one person only.

498
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:15,570
After you said that,

499
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:18,139
I miss her even more.

500
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,010
That's because...

501
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,849
you've been with this robot the whole time.

502
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,679
You were with her the whole time.

503
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,050
Through her, you practiced making contact...

504
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,349
and building relationships with humans.

505
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:32,590
There's no denying it.

506
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,989
Friday opened the door for you.

507
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,860
But that's all the more reason for you to go out there...

508
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:38,530
into the real world...

509
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,360
and walk among real people.

510
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,530
Do you understand?

511
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,769
So you're saying...

512
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,539
what we have...

513
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,570
is not love?

514
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:53,610
Of course not.

515
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:54,710
Robert.

516
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:56,849
You have to try...

517
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,519
to love a real girl.

518
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:01,019
A real girl.

519
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,489
Not a robot.
