(add up to 278 calories.)

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,110
You met those people

51
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,830
who wanted to visit the lab

52
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,880
and had a job that paid you 50 thousand a day.

53
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,320
You went to an arrogant business owner's house

54
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,080
and pretended to be

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,550
a robot that looks like you.

56
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,600
Most importantly,

57
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,190
after being through all kinds of
tortures and ordeals,

58
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,520
you were not exposed.

59
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,630
The important thing is

60
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,750
he is the client who owed me money

61
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,320
and kicked me previously.

62
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,390
Why am I so unlucky recently?

63
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,960
The competition was canceled.

64
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,550
The final payment was not made.

65
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,270
And I met this jerk.

66
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,360
Yang Shanshan.

67
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,550
I advise you to come to your senses.

68
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,550
You're not unlucky.

69
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,160
You came across

70
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,240
an opportunity of a lifetime.

71
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,600
I advise you

72
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,110
to use work as an excuse

73
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,880
to start dating that arrogant business owner.

74
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,030
So that your bestie, I, who's been supporting you,

75
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,110
can also have a chance to see
what a rich man looks like.

76
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,190
Stop thinking about it.

77
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,080
Let me tell you.

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,270
When I'm looking at him,

79
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,520
I'm not annoyed by others.

80
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,830
I even find Fu Yang very appealing.

81
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,800
He has

82
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,320
a weird personality.

83
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,630
I think

84
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,080
the fact that he believes you're a robot

85
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,999
is quite cute.

86
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,080
But

87
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,520
does he really not know

88
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,470
or is he pretending not to know?

89
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,640
From what I observe,

90
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,160
he really doesn't know.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,160
Don't think too much.

92
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,670
If you want,

93
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,350
think about what I can win from the competition.

94
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,480
Maybe I can make you a kept woman.

95

96

97

Why are you changing?

98
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,880

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,000
(to make the company the leader in the field.)

173
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,830
(It's one month.)

174
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,000
(How can he be fooled by us?)

175
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,270
Who are you talking about?

176
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,230
[IMU]
(Welcome, Mr. Lu Sen.)

177
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,760
(The one you fooled.)

178
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,880
(IMU's CEO, Lu Sen.)

179
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,390
(A genius with an IQ of 159.)

180
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,880
(Our IQs are not low either.)

181
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,230
153.

182
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,480
This isn't important at all.

183
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,670
How so?

184
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,760
The important thing is

185
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,510
that you only told me

186
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,270
Lu Sen is IMU's CEO now.

187
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,000
Mr. Lu.

188
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,039
She shouldn't know about this.

189
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,389
It's supposed to be confidential.

190
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,880
But every one of you
has revealed quite a bit just now.

191
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,040
Anyway,

192
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,669
Yang Shanshan,

193
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,470
it was my fault.

194
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,400
Or,

195
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,150
it might have been yours.

196
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,840
Importantly,

197
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,280
Lu Sen is not a normal man.

198
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,760
So this time,

199
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,840
you just need to try harder.

200
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,280
Be more serious.

201
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,640
I'll pay you double.

202
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,230
Dr. Fu.

203
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,550
No need.

204
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,440
This time,

205
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,110
I'll help you for free.

206
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,590
But I have a request.

207
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,230
You know that I'm homeless.

208
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,440
So pay for my food and lodgings

209
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,000
and fix a light.

210
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,840
What light?

211
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,880
Who cares?

212
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,110
It doesn't matter.

213
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,030
In 2025,

214
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,470
IMU will introduce

215
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,200
[Data report]
our plans for Edge-N.

216
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,670
This project

217
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,640
is a customized online butler for our clients

218
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,520
using artificial intelligence.

219
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,550
The users

220
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,590
will log in with their
physiological information.

221
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
By creating an account

222
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,230
using Edge-N,

223
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,440
they can connect

224
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,400
[Artificial Intelligence Online Butler]
all the smart appliances at home

225
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,670
and do local computing of data.

226
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,710
The time taken to upload data to the cloud

227
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,150
will decrease greatly.

228
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,320
At the same time,

229
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,320
we can also collect

230
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,350
every user's data.

231
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,440
For example, their daily routine,

232
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,520
music preferences,

233
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,400
even small changes of energy in their bodies.

234
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,640
We can analyze these data

235
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,230
and use Edge-N

236
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,280
to provide feedback to the smart appliances.

237
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,670
By doing this,

238
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,520
we can target the user's habits

239
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,590
to provide elevated services.

240
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,910
I predict

241
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,550
once the Edge-N plan

242
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,910
is launched,

243
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,440
as long as data is involved,

244
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,470
IMU's presence will be felt.

245
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,640
The plan for Edge-N will be
indefinitely postponed.

246
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,670
For now,

247
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,550
the company can continue its previous research.

248
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,110
Mr. Lu.

249
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,400
Now it's the best time

250
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,440
for IMU to conquer the market.

251
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,590
The Edge-N plan

252
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,910
can increase the company's profits

253
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,400
by 50, even 100 times.

254
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,030
It'll make IMU a formidable leader

255
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,400
in the technology field.

256
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,030
On the fourth page, it says

257
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
as long as the user is recognized once,

258
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,440
he or she will be recorded for life.

259
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,590
What does that mean?

260
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,030
That's our advantage.

261
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,960
And that's what clients need.

262
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,080
In this age, people search less

263
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,470
and there are more customized recommendations.

264
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,080
In the current market,

265
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,760
components are designed individually
to target the user's preferences.

266
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,790
But for us,

267
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,710
we can offer a well-rounded

268
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,280
and lifetime customized recommendations.

269
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,640
Do you know how large our customer base is?

270
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,760
Can our security system

271
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,590
ensure the confidentiality of the information?

272
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,230
Once those data are leaked,

273
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,840
we have a privacy breach.

274
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,230
With regard to data safety,

275
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:21,710
Mr. Lu,

276
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,960
I think you can take a look at

277
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,760
page 30...

278
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,590
Page 37 on data encryption

279
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,840
and page 47 on data masking.

280
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,670
I saw them.

281
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,880
Every project

282
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,440
requires a transition phase.

283
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,670
Users can be groomed.

284
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Once they experience the convenience

285
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,280
and increase in quality of services,

286
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,670
they won't care

287
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,640
about their initial discomfort.

288
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,200
And we'll become

289
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,790
the irreplaceable IMU in their lives.

290
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,320
Don't make me repeat myself.

291
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,670
In your project,

292
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,590
I don't see any development prospects.

293
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,840
All you did was repackage it.

294
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,280
It took me six years

295
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,000
to make IMU the leader of smart appliances.

296
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,520
It's not child's play.

297
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,400
I won't attend the meeting any longer.

298
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
If you need my signature,

299
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,150
usual procedure.

300
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,710
Wait.

301
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,030
About data safety,

302
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,150
I'll improve on it.

303
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,710
But everyone worked very hard

304
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,400
on the Youth Creativity Competition
for three months.

305
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,880
How could you

306
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,030
cancel it just like that?

307
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,030
It's canceled for this year.

308
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,760
Whether we bring it back next year

309
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,960
would depend on the new
creative director's ability.

310
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,280
This...

311
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,280
IMU Youth...

312
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,760
IMU Youth Creativity Competition

313
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,520
was established by Mr. Lu when he was around.

314
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,080
It's to discover young talented designers.

315
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,200
How can you cancel it like that?

316
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,030
If you have time to question me,

317
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,030
why not ask your creative director?

318
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,110
Also,

319
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,230
if the company's image

320
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,200
will be affected by the canceled competition,

321
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
I'll change the entire public relations team.

322
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,150
Okay, Mr. Lu.

323
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,230
Lu Sen.

324
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,910
We grew up together.

325
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,200
Do you have to do this?

326
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,840
Are you joking?

327
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,350
You think I can't tell?

328
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,280
I kept asking to meet you after I came back,

329
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,760
but you never showed up.

330
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,000
Why are you

331
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,790
picking up on me now?

332
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm picking up on you?

333
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,230
You're not qualified.

334
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,470
What do you mean?

335
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,400
Explain yourself.

336
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,230
Dad.

337
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,320
Happy birthday.

338
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,910
I'm sorry.

339
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,840
I canceled this year's

340
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,760
Youth Creativity Competition.

341
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Because I realized

342
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,080
someone has misappropriated
your original intentions.

343
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,150
Mom.

344
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,150
I've been dreaming of you both.

345
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,840
How are you doing over there?

346
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:01,675
[Lu Cheng, 1974-2010]
[Lin Hui, 1976-2010]

347
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,840
15 years.

348
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,280
In the blink of an eye,

349
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,350
15 years have passed.

350
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,760
Whenever I think of

351
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,590
how I worked with your dad for IMU

352
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,110
and what we went through,

353
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,590
I'll always feel touched.

354
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,000
Cheng,

355
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,000
today is your birthday.

356
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,550
Happy birthday.

357
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,840
I never expected

358
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
I would meet you here today.

359
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,960
Lu Sen, long time no see.

360
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,840
Cheng.

361
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,080
Sister-in-law.

362
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,440
It's been so many years.

363
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,230
Our children have grown up.

364
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,150
They're doing well.

365
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,880
Don't worry.

366
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,400
Recently, Li Zhan

367
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,440
is feeling stressed at work.

368
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,760
Maybe it's because he only joined for a year.

369
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,710
Compared to you,

370
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,840
he has many shortcomings.

371
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,790
But I hope you two

372
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,520
can be more than superior and subordinate.

373
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,080
You should be

374
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,030
more like brothers who grew up together.

375
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,280
Being in charge of operations,

376
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,400
he really wants to achieve some things.

377
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,230
Lu Sen,

378
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,790
help him.

379
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,030
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

380
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,440
I can't help.

381
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,030
Lu Sen.

382
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,440
I know for so many years,

383
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,280
you've been living alone.

384
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,960
If

385
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,470
you need anything,

386
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,280
you can always come to me.

387
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,030
I'll definitely help you.

388
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,470
Even if you're unwilling,

389
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,760
we still treat you as our family.

390
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,670
You will?

391
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,840
But it's okay.

392
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,840
I'm doing fine alone.

393
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,710
Cheng.

394
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,080
Your son's stubbornness

395
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
resembles you.

396
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:37,105
No one guided him since young.

397
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:40,465
He does as he pleases.

398
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:44,785
I'm afraid he'll suffer in the future.

399
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:02,865
Do your best.

400
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,815
If you don't become the female owner,

401
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,735
don't come back.

402
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:07,345
What are you saying?

403
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:08,545
I'm not interested.

404
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:09,865
This is just a part-time job.

405
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:11,734
Okay.

406
00:17:12,025 --> 00:17:13,305
Even if you work hard,

407
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:14,735
you can still date.

408
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:17,065
Let me tell you.

409
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:18,335
A love like yours

410
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,945
where you need to overcome hurdles,

411
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:22,305
is one that is exciting

412
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,335
and unforgettable.

413
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:25,424
Tang,

414
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:26,615
if I'm unsuccessful

415
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:27,615
in the Youth Creativity Competition,

416
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:30,025
I'll have to return to go to work.

417
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:31,425
So I think

418
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,095
this is my last chance.

419
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,095
I need to grab it.

420
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:34,495
Here.

421
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:36,825
Do your best.

422
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:38,255
Go, go.

423
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:04,455
(Li'er.)

424
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:05,825
Do you want to have a drink?

425
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:06,855
No need, Ms. Lin.

426
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:07,455
Thank you.

427
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:08,095
Lu Sen.

428
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,255
Give way to him.

429
00:18:09,495 --> 00:18:10,255
Alright.

430
00:18:10,425 --> 00:18:11,425
Li Zhan, do your best.

431
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,095
Dad.

432
00:18:50,705 --> 00:18:51,425
Mom.

433
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:02,425
Did today's injection hurt?

434
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:03,095
Yes.

435
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:04,705
You're so brave.

436
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:06,095
What do you want to eat my dear?

437
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:07,095
Lollipop.

438
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:08,335
Okay. Dad will buy it.

439
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:09,305
Let's buy it later.

440
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:01,215
Perfect.

441
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:03,705
Wait.

442
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:07,545
The wig is crooked.

443
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:08,735
Is it?

444
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,135
Okay

445
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:19,135
Let's go.

446
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:37,825
Welcome back, Friday.

447
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:11,425
Mr. Lu.

448
00:21:13,585 --> 00:21:14,375
Tell me.

449
00:21:14,545 --> 00:21:16,065
How did you create Friday?

450
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,825
We have unfinished work in the lab.

451
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:23,025
We'll leave first, Mr. Lu.

452
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,375
Put it on the table.

453
00:21:42,825 --> 00:21:43,545
Input.

454
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:44,665
Enter.

455
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,785
Input your emotions.

456
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:48,615
Be detailed.

457
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:53,025
Friday can understand human emotions

458
00:21:53,585 --> 00:21:54,735
because she's a product

459
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:57,615
of countless human data.

460
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,455
So when you target one individual,

461
00:21:59,455 --> 00:22:00,495
mistakes occur.

462
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:02,135
But

463
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,825
if you consistently input
the same individual's emotions,

464
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:06,425
the accuracy

465
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,585
will increase greatly.

466
00:22:07,975 --> 00:22:09,585
If Friday is treated this way,

467
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,185
she'll become a personalized Friday.

468
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:14,255
Interesting.

469
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:15,495
So,

470
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,945
how can I input my emotions?

471
00:22:19,495 --> 00:22:20,735
They're emotions to us.

472
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:22,135
But to Friday,

473
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:23,975
they're data.

474
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:27,615
But as long as you two interact,

475
00:22:28,185 --> 00:22:30,185
the longer you do,

476
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:31,665
Friday will be able

477
00:22:31,665 --> 00:22:32,825
to respond to those emotions

478
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:33,735
like a human.

479
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:36,825
We term this "company".

480
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:38,215
(Company?)

481
00:22:39,335 --> 00:22:40,375
(Company?)

482
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:44,375
If I input my data,

483
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:47,785
how do I know if it's safe?

484
00:22:48,945 --> 00:22:49,735
There's a password.

485
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:51,585
Friday can create

486
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:53,065
a personal space for you.

487
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:54,305
There's a unique password.

488
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:55,825
Even after the test ends,

489
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:57,495
no one can access it without the password.

490
00:22:59,025 --> 00:22:59,705
Moreover,

491
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:02,665
because we had limited time,

492
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:05,705
the mistakes found during yesterday's test

493
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:07,455
have not been resolved.

494
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:09,185
Mr. Lu,

495
00:23:10,095 --> 00:23:11,615
you need to be prepared.

496
00:23:12,095 --> 00:23:13,215
Are you shirking responsibility?

497
00:23:13,335 --> 00:23:14,455
I'm stating the facts.

498
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:18,425
You may leave.

499
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:20,615
By the way,

500
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:21,825
just a reminder.

501
00:23:22,455 --> 00:23:23,615
After three hours,

502
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:25,455
Friday must return to the lab to be charged.

503
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:26,335
Otherwise,

504
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,545
I can't promise she'll work normally tomorrow.

505
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:34,735
(At least you have a conscience.)

506
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:36,495
(You made sure I can have my three meals.)

507
00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:37,905
Prepare to connect.

508
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,905
My dear master, hello.

509
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:47,425
How can I help you?

510
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:48,665
Set the password.

511
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:49,855
Please enter your password.

512
00:23:51,735 --> 00:23:52,665
Orange.

513
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:53,585
Please spell it.

514
00:23:54,375 --> 00:24:00,135
(O-r-a-n-g-e.)

515
00:24:01,135 --> 00:24:01,855
Confirmed.

516
00:24:02,215 --> 00:24:04,375
Orange has been set as the password.

517
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:17,025
It's a secret between the two of us.

518
00:24:17,425 --> 00:24:18,495
You need to keep it safe.

519
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:43,825
Friday?

520
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:44,585
Friday.

521
00:24:47,305 --> 00:24:48,785
I'll keep it safe.

522
00:24:49,945 --> 00:24:50,585
Come with me.

523
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:54,735
Yesterday, you helped me at a critical moment.

524
00:24:57,615 --> 00:24:59,335
You also created an interesting

525
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:00,665
and surprising time for me.

526
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,855
(If you find it interesting,)

527
00:25:01,855 --> 00:25:03,025
(hold the competition.)

528
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:03,615
So,

529
00:25:05,455 --> 00:25:06,425
I want to reward you.

530
00:25:17,825 --> 00:25:19,495
What... what reward?

531
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,665
First, you need

532
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,495
to create a special room for me here.

533
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:28,975
No one else is allowed in,

534
00:25:29,335 --> 00:25:30,495
other than me.

535
00:25:30,785 --> 00:25:33,065
Because you belong to me only.

536
00:25:34,905 --> 00:25:35,615
Also,

537
00:25:35,975 --> 00:25:38,025
fill your brain with me.

538
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:39,375
You can only look at me,

539
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:40,945
follow me, and keep me company.

540
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:41,735
I

541
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:43,785
am your only master.

542
00:25:57,585 --> 00:26:00,095
What should I input?

543
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:02,785
First,

544
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:07,025
input the seniority ranking in this family.

545
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:11,095
(Your family?)

546
00:26:11,855 --> 00:26:14,305
(Aren't there only the two of us?)

547
00:26:17,255 --> 00:26:17,945
Friday.

548
00:26:18,455 --> 00:26:20,785
First, I want to introduce you

549
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:22,305
to Max.

550
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:25,065
He just celebrated his birthday two days ago.

551
00:26:25,065 --> 00:26:27,255
He's been here for a year.

552
00:26:28,335 --> 00:26:29,945
He's your older brother.

553
00:26:35,665 --> 00:26:38,855
Over here.

554
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:40,905
They're your uncles.

555
00:26:40,905 --> 00:26:42,455
This is Dusty.

556
00:26:42,705 --> 00:26:44,375
You can call him Mr. Dusty.

557
00:26:46,545 --> 00:26:48,095
This is Alex.

558
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:49,585
She's our smart music player.

559
00:26:49,585 --> 00:26:50,855
You can call her Ms. A.

560
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:51,855
She'll like it.

561
00:26:51,855 --> 00:26:52,905
(Excuse me.)

562
00:26:53,065 --> 00:26:56,825
(Are you really the domineering CEO of IMU?)

563
00:26:57,185 --> 00:26:58,705
Next is Vectra.

564
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:02,025
She's the most senior among you all.

565
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:06,065
Then I should call her Vectra...

566
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:08,785
The grandmother?

567
00:27:10,335 --> 00:27:12,095
That doesn't sound right.

568
00:27:12,705 --> 00:27:14,305
(Finally, you're making sense.)

569
00:27:15,185 --> 00:27:16,615
You need to call him grandfather.

570
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:17,825
He's a boy.

571
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,905
(I over-estimated you.)

572
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:23,095
Also,

573
00:27:23,665 --> 00:27:24,905
all the robots who come here

574
00:27:24,905 --> 00:27:26,305
need to take a group photo.

575
00:27:26,305 --> 00:27:27,545
Look at that photo wall.

576
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:28,615
They're group photos.

577
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:30,785
Since you're new,

578
00:27:31,335 --> 00:27:33,585
you can stand in the center.

579
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:34,705
Stand properly.

580
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:56,095
It's our tradition.

581
00:27:56,455 --> 00:27:57,665
Every new member

582
00:27:57,905 --> 00:27:58,855
needs to take a group photo.

583
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:01,455
It means that you're my friend.

584
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:05,135
You have many friends.

585
00:28:05,825 --> 00:28:06,425
Friday,

586
00:28:06,425 --> 00:28:08,335
now you're my friend too.

587
00:28:08,615 --> 00:28:10,945
(Turns out the family he mentioned earlier)

588
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:12,665
(are these electrical appliances.)

589
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:14,840
(He must be lonely usually.)

590
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
(It's comparable)

591
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,510
(to the loneliness I feel)

592
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,150
(doing things no one acknowledge.)

593
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,360
Also, Friday.

594
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,760
We work on a point system.

595
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,840
If you get a question correct, you get one point.

596
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,910
If you do something right, you get two.

597
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,760
If you make me happy, 10 points.

598
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,430
But if you make me angry, points will be deducted.

599
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,310
If you get 100 points,

600
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,270
you'll become a cutie

601
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,030
and an official member of our family.

602
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,200
(Wake up, Yang Shanshan.)

603
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,000
(Does he look normal?)

604
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,270
(Can you judge him by normal standards?)

605
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,480
(He's not lonely.)

606
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,150
(He has fun by himself.)

607
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,080
There's nothing left for you to input.

608
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,910
You may leave first.

609
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,480
Tomorrow morning...

610
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,670
You can come over at 9:30.

611
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,270
Okay, Master.

612
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,840
Oh, yes.

613
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,150
Place this on the photo wall.

614
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,310
(I haven't found a chance)

615
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,480
(to talk about the competition.)

616
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,390
(And it's over?)

617
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,150
(It's different from what I expected.)

618
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,200
Friday, see you tomorrow.

619
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
See you tomorrow, Master.

620
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,840
(The more stubborn)

621
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,390
(this man is,)

622
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,550
(the more careful I have to be.)
