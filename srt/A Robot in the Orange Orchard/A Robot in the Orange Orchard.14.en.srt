00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,200
(Episode 14, It's Kiss Time)

2
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,069
Hello, Mr. Kang.

3
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:41,439
Lu Sen.

4
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,239
Are you free tomorrow?

5
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,579
Show Li Er around.

6
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:48,680
She has been abroad for a long time.

7
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,120
She's not familiar with the local environment anymore.

8
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,750
I don't know where to take her.

9
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:57,459
My parents used to take me here when I was little.

10
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,959
I thought about it countless times...

11
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,530
that once I am cured,

12
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,900
this would be the first place I'd visit.

13
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,870
Let's go and play.

14
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,460
Then I'll take Li Er to the amusement park tomorrow.

15
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,469
Li Er.

16
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:49,210
Mom.

17
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,039
Have some milk.

18
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,280
How was your chat with Lu Sen today?

19
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,979
Have you prepared the clothes you'll be wearing...

20
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,050
to the amusement park tomorrow?

21
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,979
What amusement park?

22
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,259
(Li Er, are you free tomorrow? Let's go to an amusement park.)

23
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,090
Mom.

24
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,099
What did you say to Lu Sen?

25
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,030
You told me to learn this and that when I was young.

26
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,900
You're even arranging my love life now?

27
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,099
It's for your own good.

28
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,610
Drink your milk and go to bed.

29
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,210
No. I need to handle this right away.

30
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,250
No, I mean,

31
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,719
Lu Sen is taking Ms. Kang on a date today.

32
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,419
Why are you following me?

33
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,120
If it weren't for the key phase for Friday's test run yesterday,

34
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,020
I would have followed you too.

35
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,230
We agreed on the inspections.

36
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,899
You can't break your promise.

37
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:26,199
Where are you going today?

38
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,410
How would I know?

39
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,620
Mr. Fu, take the back seat.

40
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,930
I need Friday to navigate.

41
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,779
Where are we going?

42
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,540
The amusement park.

43
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,949
Is the coffee here really that good?

44
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,050
Trust me.

45
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,649
Didn't Shan Shan also say...

46
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:16,920
that Tang Tang is an expert on relationships?

47
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,259
She's good at tarot reading.

48
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,790
Haven't you always been single?

49
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,430
You say that like you're not.

50
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,899
Welcome.

51
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,910
You two scientists.

52
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,980
What brings you here today?

53
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,910
Can I help you?

54
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,449
We're here today for a consultation.

55
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,649
All right.

56
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,290
Make yourselves at home.

57
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:48,290
Okay.

58
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,290
Take a look at the menu if you want to drink anything.

59
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,220
Go.

60
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,689
It's on me.

61
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,459
Americano.

62
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,029
Two cups.

63
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,430
Okay.

64
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,310
Hardworking women are so charming.

65
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,410
Pai Song is also quite serious about her work.

66
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,490
That goes to show...

67
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,089
there's a big difference between people.

68
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,029
Here you go.

69
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,769
This is your Americano.

70
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,569
Thank you.

71
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,600
Be careful, it's hot.

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,009
So what brings you here today?

73
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,509
Relationship advice.

74
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,379
We're free today.

75
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,980
Dr. Fu and Shan Shan are away today.

76
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,149
Which one of you is asking?

77
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,819
We both have questions.

78
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,589
Okay.

79
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,430
But what did you just say?

80
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,759
Shan Shan went out with Dr. Fu?

81
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:05,860
What does it mean?

82
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,029
There are also Ms. Kang and Lu Sen, right?

83
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,899
Double date.

84
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,970
What an odd combination.

85
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,240
Now I'm curious.

86
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,709
This is my first time at an amusement park.

87
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,910
Most people love amusement parks.

88
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,879
You have to get used to it and fit in.

89
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,879
You're right.

90
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,420
I didn't bring my gloves today.

91
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,819
Who else are we waiting for today?

92
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,089
Li Er, over here.

93
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,689
This is Xiao Xing.

94
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,699
You've met her.

95
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,100
This is Fu Yang.

96
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,259
You should know each other.

97
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,129
Hello, Dr. Fu Yang.

98
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,569
- Hello. - Let's go in.

99
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,339
Wait, Lu Sen.

100
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,370
I have something to tell you.

101
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,149
He brought that woman to the amusement park?

102
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,660
I'll follow them to hear what they are saying.

103
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,819
I'll come and find you later.

104
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,589
Be careful.

105
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:10,800
Don't worry about me.

106
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,199
No. I mean, be careful not to stain your clothes.

107
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,230
I borrowed it from my second aunt.

108
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,839
I need to return it.

109
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,779
This is such a fantastic amusement park.

110
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,709
Yang Shan Shan.

111
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,250
You must seize the opportunity.

112
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,549
What opportunity?

113
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,350
Don't you get it?

114
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,220
- No. - No.

115
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,190
Forget it.

116
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,690
It doesn't matter.

117
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,000
The important thing is,

118
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,830
don't you think it's weird...

119
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,269
that Dr. Fu went with them?

120
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,210
Ever since Ms. Kang appeared,

121
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:55,870
Dr. Fu has been acting weird.

122
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,509
You mean they know each other?

123
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:00,879
Yes.

124
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,610
Ms. Kang has been to the lab several times.

125
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,980
She has also delivered spare parts to us.

126
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:05,750
The point is that...

127
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,090
Dr. Fu stayed out one day.

128
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,789
We found out from Ms. Kang the next day...

129
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,190
that they actually spent the night together.

130
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,960
It's perfect.

131
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:20,830
It's time for you two to make a contribution.

132
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,740
What are they talking about?

133
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:32,809
It's taking them ages.

134
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,149
It's not a confession, is it?

135
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,980
Lu Sen?

136
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,450
Who will Lu Sen confess his love to?

137
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,519
Ms. Kang.

138
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,789
I'm a robot. You...

139
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,059
Could it be you?

140
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,899
- Hello? - Hello.

141
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,129
Dr. Fu, you must stay with Ms. Kang at all times.

142
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:56,370
Why?

143
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,700
Sir, Ms. Kang knows all our secrets.

144
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Make sure you keep an eye on her.

145
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,940
That makes sense.

146
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:04,580
So you mean,

147
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,139
you see me as your best friend,

148
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:07,909
someone you can't live without in your life.

149
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,750
I feel the same way.

150
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,320
And in the meantime,

151
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,679
I don't think we can fall in love with each other.

152
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,350
Because the person that you fall in love with...

153
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,289
will make you do...

154
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,620
a lot of baffling things, right?

155
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,929
It's like...

156
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,429
you're holding a cute umbrella...

157
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,529
and you've brought it to an amusement park.

158
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:29,970
Don't get me wrong.

159
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,570
If Ms. Xing isn't a robot,

160
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,870
you'd like her, right?

161
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:36,210
You'd fall for her.

162
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,450
You can't hide your affection for someone.

163
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,149
But I've already joined the company.

164
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,720
As the boss, don't you go to the office?

165
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,330
It won't affect the business whether I go to the office or not.

166
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,500
But I think IMU Tech Group is at an impasse.

167
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,529
I've been thinking about that too.

168
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,799
But my answer is simple.

169
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,539
Technology is getting more and more complicated.

170
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,539
It's time to regress to nature and warmth.

171
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,710
The Young Idea Competition has been revived and will be held again.

172
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,049
If you come to the office,

173
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,409
why don't you take over this project?

174
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,350
It's a complete reshuffle.

175
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,350
Sure, I'm interested.

176
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,289
Let's get going.

177
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,860
I found something fun.

178
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:28,889
Let's go.

179
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,500
Come out. Don't hide.

180
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,240
Which direction should I be taking pictures in? Where?

181
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,740
Taking pictures? Put it away.

182
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,379
I just heard what they said.

183
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,750
They said the woman is a robot.

184
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:52,250
How is that possible?

185
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,679
She looks just like a human.

186
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,049
Whatever she might be,

187
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:56,389
you can try her out later.

188
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,720
We'll know once you try her out.

189
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:10,669
You...

190
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,570
Is this what you were talking about?

191
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:16,470
Maybe...

192
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,440
That looks fun.

193
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:19,379
Let's go.

194
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,509
This is it.

195
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,019
Mr. Lu, if you're scared,

196
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
I'll stay here with you.

197
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:48,009
Well?

198
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:49,769
This is...

199
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
so much like a child's play.

200
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:52,940
Let's take a ride again.

201
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,179
Why don't we play something else?

202
00:12:59,049 --> 00:12:59,750
How about this?

203
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,250
I'll take you to a more exciting one.

204
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,590
Something more exciting?

205
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:03,450
Come on.

206
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:06,490
Li Er!

207
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:09,389
Where is she going?

208
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,159
Girls get too carried away at amusement parks.

209
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,299
She'll be back soon.

210
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:17,029
Then why are you so scared?

211
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,500
I...

212
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:19,440
I...

213
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,669
That's just my setting.

214
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:24,240
It's to make my master look braver.

215
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:26,909
That's a good setting.

216
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,779
What should we play next?

217
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,480
Let's go get some dolls.

218
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,919
When Ms. Kang comes back, give them to her.

219
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,250
She'll be so surprised.

220
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,259
All right. I'll show you a true talent.

221
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,059
Come on.

222
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,039
You can do it.

223
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,029
Then let's grab the air above us.

224
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,340
How well did you do?

225
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,039
Most claw machines use a contrast circuit.

226
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,309
If I can connect the positive and negative poles,

227
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,750
I can control them with my phone.

228
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:39,419
Wouldn't that be too much trouble?

229
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,720
It's supposed to be controlled by the Internet.

230
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,190
Just hack into the Wi-Fi.

231
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:45,419
But does this count as cheating?

232
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,259
I can also handle it the normal way.

233
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,379
You're awesome, Mr. Lu.

234
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:15,789
I'll give it to you.

235
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:16,820
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

236
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,289
Look, it's so pretty.

237
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,590
Come on. Let's check it out.

238
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,190
It's beautiful.

239
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,940
Where are those two?

240
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,420
I'm sorry.

241
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,089
I'm sorry for bumping into you.

242
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,490
Can I help you?

243
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:36,690
I'm looking for someone.

244
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,660
Who are you looking for?

245
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,599
Two people...

246
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,369
Over there.

247
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:45,170
- Yes. - Thank you.

248
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:46,569
You're welcome.

249
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,650
Friday!

250
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,119
Friday!

251
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,519
Friday!

252
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,390
Friday.

253
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:06,390
How can you abandon your master?

254
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,859
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu. I was...

255
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,259
Don't go off by yourself again.

256
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,329
It's so pretty.

257
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:18,869
Let's make a deal.

258
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,509
If you can't find me,

259
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,470
wait at the place where I've left you.

260
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:24,839
I'll find you no matter what.

261
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:36,650
It's so nice under the sea.

262
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,230
I can't tell if it's day or night.

263
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:46,960
But then, what's the difference between a day and a year...

264
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,269
inside here?

265
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:50,170
For some people,

266
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:52,970
one day in life...

267
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,140
is good enough.

268
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,309
Hey.

269
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:03,049
It's true.

270
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,880
I stabbed her with this skewer.

271
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:07,819
She didn't react to it at all.

272
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,119
The skewer just snapped.

273
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,190
She really is a robot.

274
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,329
Didn't I just tell you?

275
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,329
You didn't believe me.

276
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,130
We must tell Li Zhan about this.

277
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,130
Yes.

278
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,400
Take a picture or two.

279
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,630
It has stopped raining.

280
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:57,069
Mr. Lu.

281
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:58,539
This umbrella also has a function.

282
00:19:58,869 --> 00:19:59,839
Press this button.

283
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,509
It becomes transparent from the inside,

284
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:03,109
but the rainbow pattern remains the same from the outside.

285
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,019
That's amazing.

286
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,519
I thought...

287
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,119
this was just an ordinary umbrella.

288
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,869
The person who made this umbrella...

289
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,329
must be a genius.

290
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,410
Lu Sen, do you know?

291
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,779
You're the first person ever to acknowledge my invention.

292
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:49,549
You're right.

293
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:51,660
For some people,

294
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,660
one day in life is enough.

295
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,589
You don't like amusement parks, right?

296
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,730
Why did you tag along?

297
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:04,960
What about you?

298
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,259
Why did you come here?

299
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,329
To clear things up with Lu Sen.

300
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,670
Clear what up?

301
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,599
Do you still remember the umbrella that was left on the rack?

302
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,369
Dr. Fu.

303
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:19,339
Yes, I do.

304
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,319
Did you just kiss me?

305
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,299
You...

306
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,630
How could you kiss me?

307
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,529
That's right.

308
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,400
I'm pretending to be Friday.

309
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,240
If we're going to kiss,

310
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:50,569
I should be the one to initiate.

311
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,609
I finally found you two.

312
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:03,549
It's getting late.

313
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,420
Let's go back.

314
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,099
Let's go.

315
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:19,140
I guess today's date was a success.

316
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,809
- A date? - Right.

317
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,210
You can have your jacket back.

318
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,009
Let's go.

319
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:35,390
Hey.

320
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,650
Wait for me.

321
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,720
I'm so happy...

322
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:40,220
the entire day.

323
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,089
It's the first time that I feel so romantic...

324
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,900
spending time with you.

325
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,759
It's my birthday in two days. Can we come here again?

326
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,130
Where did you get the tangerine?

327
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,700
From the tree in the back.

328
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,309
Take one. I have more.

329
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:00,880
What are you doing?

330
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,109
It's sweet.

331
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,349
You didn't spend any money. You...

332
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,980
Hey.

333
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:55,470
(Robots turn to humans)

334
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,779
Did I have my first kiss...

335
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:13,380
with just a programmed robot?

336
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,650
It's charging, right?

337
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,049
It's so quiet.

338
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:25,920
It doesn't even look like the robot who stole my kiss.

339
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,460
What's the matter, Mr. Lu?

340
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,829
This is a restricted area.

341
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:34,599
The charging area is dangerous.

342
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,670
Please come down.

343
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,400
I just have a few questions for Friday.

344
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:42,609
Friday is charging.

345
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,109
You can ask her tomorrow.

346
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,279
Ms. Pai.

347
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,019
If robots undergo deep learning,

348
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:56,789
is it possible for them to acquire human emotions?

349
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,319
What emotions?

350
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:01,490
It's when you do something intimate with someone.

351
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,230
For example...

352
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:04,430
Kiss.

353
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:08,059
That depends on the input from her master.

354
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,700
Judging from her intelligence,

355
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:10,599
it's possible for Friday...

356
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,069
to demonstrate reactions similar to human emotions.

357
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,900
For example, affection, disdain,

358
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,910
or that it might show through her reactions.

359
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:17,740
If intimacy increases,

360
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,079
our goal for Friday is to have her comfort and hug her master...

361
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,509
as her immediate reaction.

362
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,349
What did I input?

363
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,880
That's not right.

364
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,259
It's okay. Get back to work.

365
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,390
Get some rest.

366
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,279
That's not right.

367
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,180
Did I...

368
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,589
input any information for her to like me?

369
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,160
But being with someone like me day and night,

370
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,500
it shouldn't be strange to fall in love with me.

371
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,940
But how did she like me so much that she...

372
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,420
Yang Shan Shan!

373
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,789
How could you do something like that?

374
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,089
How could you kiss him?

375
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,089
No.

376
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,529
I got it.

377
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,630
It's Lu Sen's fault.

378
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,829
He was so cool under the fireworks.

379
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,470
Yes, it's his fault.

380
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,470
And it must be that the weather was too nice today.

381
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,940
Yes, the weather was too nice.

382
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,289
So...

383
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,990
how was your first kiss with Lu Sen?

384
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,890
Da Tang Zi, how did you know?

385
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,500
You were yelling so loudly.

386
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,299
The only thing missing is announcing it on a loudspeaker.

387
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,670
But I'm not surprised...

388
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,400
that you two actually kissed.

389
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,369
So?

390
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,339
When are you going to tell him the truth?

391
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,980
Confess to him?

392
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,180
What are you talking about?

393
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,880
I'm talking about coming clean.

394
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,680
How badly do you want to confess?

395
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,990
He doesn't even know if you're a robot...

396
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,089
or a human being, okay?

397
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:50,059
You should be careful.

398
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,759
You're wearing your heart on your sleeve now.

399
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:56,369
It's easy to tell that you're a human.

400
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,000
A pubescent girl.

401
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:00,099
How could you say that?

402
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:01,299
Who's a pubescent girl?

403
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,369
Who? I'm not!

404
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,339
Okay, fine. You're not.

405
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,839
Let me give you some advice.

406
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,349
Use this opportunity to explain it to him.

407
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,049
Then you can confess to him.

408
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,180
Think about it.

409
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:38,609
On top of that, I've checked with the Alpha Team.

410
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,109
They said...

411
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,349
that if the robot undergoes deep learning,

412
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,849
it's possible for it to acquire human emotions.

413
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,220
So...

414
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,890
I think Friday likes me.

415
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,890
I'm quite troubled by this.

416
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:54,519
Stop right there.

417
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,630
So did you call me for help...

418
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,029
or did you call me to brag...

419
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,529
about your robot falling in love with you?

420
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,559
I'm calling for help.

421
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,269
What's going on...

422
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:04,069
between Friday and me now?

423
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,500
What do you mean?

424
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,640
For the first time in 15 years, someone likes you.

425
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,569
That's what happened.

426
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:11,670
So...

427
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,710
how am I supposed to respond to her?

428
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:17,049
Respond?

429
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,579
To a robot?

430
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,789
Excuse me. I haven't studied robot psychology yet.

431
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:27,990
What if I regard her...

432
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:29,460
as an ordinary human girl?

433
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,490
What would...

434
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,859
a girl want the person she likes to do?

435
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:41,000
Are you considering other people's feelings?

436
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,140
You're in a good state of mind.

437
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,369
I've never seen you like this before.

438
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:45,440
Keep it up.

439
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:47,380
- Is she... - All right.

440
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,849
Wash up and go to bed.

441
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,880
You can talk to me later.

442
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,329
It's so annoying...

443
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,029
to be liked by someone.

444
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,089
Shan Shan.

445
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,059
Let's eat.

446
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,660
- Here. - I'll pass.

447
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,029
The four of you went on a date yesterday.

448
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:43,470
How was it?

449
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:46,500
Nothing special.

450
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,740
Ms. Tang predicted...

451
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,410
that at least the two of you would undergo dramatic emotional changes.

452
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:52,579
Who could it be?

453
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,779
Who could it be?

454
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,849
How would I know?

455
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,349
Do you believe what she said?

456
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,579
I'm going to get changed.

457
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,950
I'll join you after breakfast.

458
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,160
I think Tang Tang was right.

459
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,029
What do you think?

460
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,529
I don't think so.

461
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,680
Li Er.

462
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:30,910
Mr. Li, do you have time to spare?

463
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,880
Sure.

464
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:32,980
Have a seat.

465
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,650
So?

466
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:36,490
How are you adjusting to the company?

467
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:37,349
I'm all good.

468
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,319
That's good.

469
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:41,220
Right.

470
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,789
How was your weekend?

471
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,190
I went out with Lu Sen.

472
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,660
You went out with Lu Sen?

473
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,569
Did he ask you out?

474
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,140
That's right.

475
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,369
Li Er, don't you think it's strange?

476
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,180
Lu Sen has never been out all these years.

477
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:03,349
Now that you're back,

478
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,880
why did he ask you out so eagerly?

479
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,779
Li Zhan, you're thinking too much.

480
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,250
I'm overthinking it?

481
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,119
This project,

482
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,389
the Young Idea Competition.

483
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:15,429
I think it's good.

484
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,630
Why did you object to it?

485
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,659
The Young Idea Competition is fine.

486
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,730
And the social benefits are good.

487
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:25,699
It's a tradition at IMU.

488
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:27,340
But...

489
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,539
Lu Sen rejected it this year.

490
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,639
He said I could give it a try.

491
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,610
He said you can have a shot at it?

492
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:41,579
Did Lu Sen change his mind again?

493
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:49,389
I have no problem with you doing it.

494
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,429
Let me know if you need anything.

495
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,099
Thank you, Mr. Li.

496
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,699
I have a meeting, so I'll get going now.

497
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,730
Let's have dinner sometime.

498
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:56,869
Name the place and time.

499
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:16,949
Kang Li Er was there.

500
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:19,219
She was even able to get so close to Lu Sen.

501
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:21,619
Who is this woman?

502
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:26,099
That Ms. Xing is a robot.

503
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:28,030
Her torso is very hard.

504
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:29,269
We tested it ourselves.

505
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:31,070
I heard Lu Sen say it himself.

506
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,739
It's a newly discovered secret.

507
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,739
Remember. Pay us extra for this.

508
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:38,269
I'm begging you guys.

509
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,210
Can you guys be more reliable?

510
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,880
I've seen that woman.

511
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,610
She's a real person.

512
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:45,110
I told you to find out...

513
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,750
what her relationship with Lu Sen is.

514
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,050
You're now hoodwinking me with this result?

515
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:52,889
You guys just don't get it or have you lost your mind?

516
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:57,929
Well...

517
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:00,260
What should we do next?

518
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,300
Next, we need to find even more solid evidence.

519
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,170
Otherwise, Li Zhan won't believe us.

520
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,670
If he doesn't believe us, he won't pay us a penny.

521
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:24,289
Last night...

522
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:30,429
It was my fault.

523
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,730
There was a problem with your input.

524
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,199
That's why you ended up like this.

525
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,369
Friday.

526
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,570
Input this command now.

527
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,869
You can be my best friend.

528
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:44,340
But you can't love me.

529
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,179
And...

530
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,710
what happened last night...

531
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:51,210
must not happen again.

532
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,349
Do you understand?

533
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,719
What happened last night?

534
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,590
Did I do something to you yesterday, Master?

535
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,519
You don't remember?

536
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:02,929
Yesterday...

537
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:06,429
You did that to me.

538
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,070
No matching image was detected.

539
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,400
I have no idea what you're talking about.

540
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:15,269
What a jerk.

541
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,269
Your words don't suit your image, Master.

542
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,210
Operation Mode.

543
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:25,349
Friend Mode.

544
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:27,079
What now?

545
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:28,579
"What now"?

546
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,820
Why are you being so casual with me?

547
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:31,789
You switched to this mode...

548
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:32,690
and just tell me what you want to say.

549
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,019
You have a problem with me, don't you?

550
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:36,190
I have no idea what you're talking about.

551
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,730
Can you say that again, Master?

552
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:40,300
You were in Friend Mode.

553
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,059
Why are you suddenly switching to Operation Mode?

554
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:43,969
Due to a recent glitch,

555
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,170
you can only use Operation Mode.

556
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:46,500
Are you kidding me?

557
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:47,539
Friday.

558
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:48,599
Friend Mode.

559
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,809
Due to a recent glitch,

560
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:51,210
you can only use Operation Mode.

561
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,679
Friday!

562
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,489
Well done, you.

563
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,190
It's not raining.

564
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,730
Why do you have an umbrella, Master?

565
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,730
Look at this umbrella.

566
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,730
Does that ring a bell?

567
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,429
No.

568
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:17,630
Think hard.

569
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,800
There are some memories about this umbrella that you must recall.

570
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,010
I don't quite understand what you're talking about.

571
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:29,710
How about this?

572
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,219
Think. Recall it right away.

573
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,320
Is it a memory I must recall?

574
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:39,190
No. It's a memory you must erase.

575
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,019
Since it's a memory that must be erased,

576
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,059
why should it matter now that I can't recall it?

577
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,690
What are you going to do, Master?

578
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,829
No...

579
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,599
I'm the only one who remembers.

580
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,429
That makes me...

581
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,269
Then you can delete it too.

582
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:52,670
I'm not a robot.

583
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:53,440
I'm human.

584
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,739
I can't just delete some memories or forget them as I wish.

585
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,510
Statistically, time.

586
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,239
Time can erase any memory.

587
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:02,550
I don't think you understand.

588
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,880
Some memories can't be erased.

589
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,420
When I witnessed the same scene and heard the same music,

590
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
they will make me remember it.

591
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:09,619
Just like I am right now.

592
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:12,719
This umbrella reminds me of that moment.

593
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:15,090
What do you want me to do?

594
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,730
So you're picking a fight with me now, Master?

595
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,059
Yes.

596
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,739
Listen up.

597
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:27,769
You'd better not remember it.

598
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,139
Don't ever think about it again.

599
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,309
Don't you dare remember it.

600
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,440
If you do, I'll tear you apart.
