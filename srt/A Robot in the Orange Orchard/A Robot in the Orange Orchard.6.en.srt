"Meet me at the top of the mountain at 4 PM."

This guy only goes out once in a while.

Thank you so much, thank you.

But why install

50
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
such a high-level security x-ray scanner at home?

51

Here's the thing.

Our address is confidential,

some people send weird things here,

54

like garbage, glass fragments,
and even razor blades.

55

Last time,

It seems that Mr. Lu has offended many people.

59
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,879
Think about it. At such a young age,
he is a genius boss

60
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,359
who has inherited such a big company

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,720
and has shouldered so many responsibilities.

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,999
He has his own method
of dealing with people.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,599
Naturally,
some people will resent him and envy him.

64
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,159
No one is perfect.

65

He is just a 26-year-old after all.

67
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,600
How can you ask a
26-year-old to be a saint?

68
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,959
A normal 26-year-old

69
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,269
would have just graduated from university.

70

Right.

71
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,189
So I have to take this approach

72

by the outside world.

must be checked as well.

00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,150
Can you still walk without any power?

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,550
I...

172
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,200
Right.

173
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,880
Caring can help me charge the battery.

174
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,960
Let's go. I have a little power now.

175
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,200
Let me treat the wound for you.

176
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,200
You have a rip in your clothes.

177
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,549
Did it happen while coming down the mountain?

178
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,759
Did you get hurt?

179
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,440
I'm fine.

180
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,549
I think you're broken.

181
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,470
Otherwise,
why do you keep challenging my authority?

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,079
I'm not challenging your authority.

183
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,639
This is friends helping each other.

184
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,759
Humans are like robots,
they need to be taken care of.

185
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,000
It works better than getting charged.

186
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,640
Mr. Lu.

187
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,440
Thank you for carrying me down the mountain.

188
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,839
Then remember, you owe me one,

189
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,000
cause less trouble in the future.

190
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,790
I think you're not arguing back because you broke.

191
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,960
Why does it feel so hot?

192
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,200
Is it excessive power consumption?

193
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,400
Hurry back and get charged.

194
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,440
Shanshan hasn't come back yet.

195
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,840
She hasn't contacted us either.

196
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,640
Did something happen?

197
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,440
Did he find out?

198
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,200
He found out and detained her?

199
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,520
Doomsayer.

200
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,640
Are you alright?

201
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,670
What happened?

202
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,200
The battery is too weak.

203
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,149
I just took her climbing

204
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,759
and she almost exhausted her battery.

205
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,229
Also,
her weight needs to be improved.

206
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,840
I'll take her in for a checkup.

207
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,880
Let's go.

208
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,520
She

209
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,999
is an A.I. home companion robot.

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Who would make this
type of robot go climbing?

211
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,960
Shouldn't a companion
robot accompany its master?

212
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,760
Although you are her master,

213
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,349
I won't let anyone hurt Friday.

214
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,229
I'm her master,
of course, I'll protect her.

215
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,230
You are her creator.

216
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,960
Instead of improving her,
you're accusing me?

217
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,999
Go run some checks
and make improvements.

218
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,640
Additionally,

219
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,709
reducing Friday's weight

220
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,320
will also help reduce her energy consumption.

221
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,840
Still not going?

222
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,230
Shanshan, are you okay?

223
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,910
I'm fine.

224
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:51,029
You don't look so good.

225
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,910
Did you catch a cold?

226
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,670
It's nothing.

227
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,960
How come we couldn't reach you earlier?

228
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,350
Probably because there was no signal
on the mountain.

229
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,589
Take off your contact lenses.

230
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,640
I'll check them.

231
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,080
Yang Shanshan.

232
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,030
Yang Shanshan.

233
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,710
Look at you.

234
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,519
You have to remember that
you are a robot of Team Alpha.

235
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,470
You have to be under my control at all times.
Do you understand?

236
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,029
I don't have the energy to argue with you right now.

237
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,230
I'm so tired and so sleepy.

238
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,229
She...

239
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,910
Sir.

240
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,030
Shanshan seems to be sick.

241
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,470
This is friends helping each other.

242
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,520
Humans are like robots,
they need to be taken care of.

243
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,590
It works better than getting charged.

244
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,590
Mr. Lu.

245
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,440
Thank you for carrying me down the mountain.

246
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,790
Weird.

247
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,229
What's happening to me?

248
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,640
Why is my heart beating so fast?

249
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,790
It's as if something is sprouting.

250
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,459
Li'er.

251
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,609
Sorry, I'm late.

252
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,490
Welcome back.

253
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,099
What age are we in
and you're still gifting flowers?

254
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,299
Your flirting skills have room for improvement.

255
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,130
I haven't flirted with anyone else before.

256
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,809
Why is it just me?

257
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,809
Where is Lu Sen?

258
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,419
You didn't tell him you're back?

259
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,420
Of course.

260
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,860
I want to surprise him.

261
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,490
Surprise?

262
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,780
Am I not a surprise to you?

263
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,130
Friday?

264
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:11,610
Friday?

265
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:15,850
Fri...

266
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,660
Friday.

267
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,700
You are so lucky to have
such a great master like me.

268
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,210
Sir.

269
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:37,249
Shanshan has a fever, her head is very hot.

270
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,580
Don't wake her up,
let her sleep a little longer.

271
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,820
I'll go get a glass of water for Shanshan.

272
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,579
I'll go get some fast-acting cold medicine.

273
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,370
A fast-acting medicine will work better.

274
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,540
Why hasn't she come yet?

275
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,900
She has been charging for 12 hours.

276
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,660
Hi, Friday.

277
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:35,850
Master.

278
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:37,819
What is your order?

279
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,450
Friday.

280
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,210
Friend mode.

281
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,019
Hello.

282
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,369
Dear Mr. Lu Sen.

283
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,819
What is your order?

284
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,370
Come here as soon as you're charged.

285
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,579
Sir.

286
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,370
What's this?

287
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,489
Mr. Xie just dropped it off.

288
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,490
He said Lu Sen got

289
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,299
these new clothes for Friday,

290
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:00,970
Clothes?

291
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,299
What's wrong with our clothes?

292
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,659
It's made of specially processed,

293
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,019
aviation-grade fiber material.

294
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,129
It can maximally guarantee

295
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,130
the stability and rate of Friday's charging.

296
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,370
What material is this made of?

297
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:14,970
Cotton.

298
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,579
Good-looking is the highest grade of material.

299
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,210
Shanshan.

300
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,060
You're awake.

301
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,899
- Feeling better?
- How do you feel?

302
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,730
Feeling better?

303
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,659
If you want,

304
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,540
you can wear what you like
when you go to Lu Sen's house,

305
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,660
Friday will wear her own clothes while charging.

306
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,129
Shanshan is awake.

307
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:39,900
Here, have some water.

308
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,130
Here, take the medicine.

309
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,449
Shanshan.

310
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,019
Rest well.

311
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,129
Lu Sen hasn't called yet.

312
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,020
You can sleep a while longer.

313
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,019
Time is up, right?

314
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,490
I have to get ready.

315
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,250
Yang Shanshan.

316
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,060
You've worked hard.

317
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,019
Why are you getting emotional?

318
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,369
If you have the time,
go train your robot.

319
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,369
I had to make up a few functions,

320
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,329
you have to make improvements ASAP.

321
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,540
Don't worry about it.

322
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,449
Friday knows how to cook and etc.

323
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,780
She is the best, better than...

324
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,659
Let's leave.

325
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,730
Let Shanshan get ready.

326
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,490
Call us if you need something.

327
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,209
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

328
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,370
Always dawdling.

329
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:51,784
Friday.

330
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:52,975
What are you doing this time?

331
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:55,025
Surprise.

332
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:56,785
Li-Li'er.

333
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:59,249
Why-why are you back?

334
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,779
To give you a surprise.

335
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,900
You're not going to buzz me in?

336
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,660
Shanshan.

337
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,660
If you really don't want to go,

338
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:18,899
get Mr. Fu to ask for a day off.

339
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,209
Don't push yourself too much.

340
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,129
Get a day off by telling him
something is wrong with me again?

341
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,249
It's easy to lie but hard to finish a lie.

342
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,970
And don't worry,
I feel great right now.

343
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,129
Comrades, I'm leaving.

344
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:29,660
Bye-bye.

345
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,730
Hello, Mr. Xie.

346
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,969
Is something wrong?

347
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,820
Mr. Xie.

348
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,129
You scared me.

349
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,129
I thought someone just popped up.

350
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,780
High tech is high tech.

351
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,369
Mr. Xie.

352
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,850
What's going on?

353
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,329
We're cleaning the manor today.

354
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,130
I've come to ask the scientists to help out.

355
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,660
Okay.

356
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,779
I haven't been here in so long.

357
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,130
Your place has changed quite a bit.

358
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,580
Why did you come back suddenly
without saying anything?

359
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,330
What? I'm not welcome?

360
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,449
Sit wherever.

361
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,210
What would you like to drink?

362
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,730
Coffee.

363
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,900
Childish guy.

364
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,490
Good luck.

365
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,730
You too.

366
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,019
You were able to come out the other side

367
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,020
after the passing of your parents,

368
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,060
I'm really happy for you.

369
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,129
You haven't been back in so long.

370
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,450
The last time was four years ago.

371
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,730
Then why didn't you come to the UK to visit me?

372
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,179
A big-shot CEO like
you never goes abroad?

373
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,419
Even Li Zhan knows to stop by to have a meal with me.

374
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,580
You never came.

375
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,060
What?

376
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,699
Did I treat you badly when we were kids?

377
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,940
Or have you forgotten about your older sister?

378
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
I don't have a passport.

379
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,900
That is a really good excuse.

380
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,939
Oh right.

381
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,419
I have a present for you.

382
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,490
Come and see.

383
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,899
This is...?

384
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,209
Didn't you say that buttons
on suits are hard to do up?

385
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,580
I bought you a suit that's very easy to do up.

386
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,939
But in order to keep it as a surprise,

387
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,900
I didn't ask for your size,
I guessed.

388
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,060
You even know this?

389
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:43,969
Oh right.

390
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,329
Are you free tomorrow?

391
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,300
I'll invite Li Zhan here for dinner.

392
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,250
We haven't seen each other for so long.

393
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,970
Now that I'm back,
you two have to welcome me, don't you?

394
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,180
You can come alone.

395
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,090
What?

396
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,209
So the rumor I heard about
the two of you having a feud

397
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:01,940
is true?

398
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,819
How old are you?

399
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,699
Are you going to stop talking
to each other like a couple

400
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,180
because of some disagreements at work?

401
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,610
Come on.

402
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,899
Childhood friends can't
just go separate ways.

403
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,450
Have a meal together and reconcile.

404
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,299
I'm older. Listen to me.

405
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:29,900
Pinky promise.

406
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,820
Let's say I've agreed.

407
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,210
You're so reluctant, Mr. Lu.

408
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,250
Making me come in such a
hurry just to let me see this?

409
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,610
Wait, she's...?

410
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,369
Darn.

411
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,090
[Darn]
Darn?

412
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,579
She's the woman that Lu Sen
said is very important to him.

413
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,089
Kang Li'er. Twenty-seven years old.

414
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,580
Double Masters in Economics
and Intelligent Business Operations.

415
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,249
Such an impressive resume.

416
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,899
She's pretty too.

417
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,849
Look at how fond Lu Sen looks.

418
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,209
He never looks like that when he's with me.

419
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,490
He's always mean.

420
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,660
Here, take these.

421
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,699
Our wise and intelligent scientists.

422
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,660
Here.

423
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,020
Sorry to trouble you today.

424
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,019
Today,
we need to clean this plank road inside and out.

425
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:41,249
Since we all live here together,
we're family,

426
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,780
so you think of it as
your own business.

427
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,779
Makes sense.

428
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,969
I'll leave the cleaning to you.

429
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,059
Mr. Xie. I'm busy.

430
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,020
I'm leaving first.

431
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,940
Miss Beautiful Scientist.

432
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,699
How can something like
this get done if a girl like you

433
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,580
is missing?

434
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,420
That's right.

435
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,300
Look.

436
00:27:04,301 --> 00:27:05,900
Our place is so big.

437
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,490
With you young people here,

438
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,940
my job got a lot easier.

439
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,729
I'm leaving it to you.

440
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:14,539
Please.

441
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,969
Thank you.

442
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,130
Please.

443
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,369
Wait.

444
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,420
Did he use words to
stimulate my pleasure center?

445
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,419
I shouldn't have agreed, right?

446
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,089
We shouldn't have repaired that scanner for him.

447
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:29,820
A black hole.

448
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,820
A never-ending black hole of housework.

449
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,060
Oh right.

450
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,849
My dad told you about us getting married, right?

451
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:38,939
Getting married?

452
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,089
When?

453
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,089
Why?

454
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,300
Why didn't I know?

455
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,329
I just found out as well.

456
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,130
What a coincidence, right?

457
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,899
When we were young,

458
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,489
the elders always liked to pair us together.

459
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,780
My dad probably took it seriously.

460
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,609
Besides, you're so great.

461
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,539
You are the ideal son-in-law
candidate in my dad's heart.

462
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,490
So as soon as I came back,

463
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:01,059
he started trying to get us together.

464
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,060
What kind of idea is this?

465
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,970
The Kang family's
"business connections through marriage" idea.

466
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
You're okay with it?

467
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,579
Actually,
I want to know how you'd feel if you were

468
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,540
to marry me now as well.

469
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,370
Do you like me?

470
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,419
She's so close, I really want to run away.

471
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,490
Automatic recognition.

472
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,779
How do you feel about marrying me?

473
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,210
Do you really like me?

474
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,940
They're talking about marriage.

475
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,180
I'd better hide first.

476
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,779
Are we even scientists?

477
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,129
I almost forgot

478
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,939
I am a genius who earns his living with his IQ.

479
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,020
We should invent a machine that does this.

480
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,580
How can human hands do this?

481
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,370
Repeating a single action

482
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,420
will cause great damage to human joints.

483
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,580
Friday is different.

484
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,330
Friday...

485
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,780
I suddenly got an idea.

486
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,180
I'm going to make adjustments to Friday.

487
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,660
You guys keep going.

488
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,780
That was a pretty good excuse.

489
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,370
"I suddenly got an idea".

490
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,180
I can't hold it in any longer.

491
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,490
I'm not here to force you to marry me.

492
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,780
I just want you to be careful of my dad.

493
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,610
Alright, don't be so serious.

494
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,779
I just missed you,

495
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,730
missed the three of us hanging out together.

496
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,369
Then it's a date.

497
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,330
I'll come to visit you with Li Zhan tomorrow.

498
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,899
I think...

499
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,940
A date is a date.

500
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,539
You... You go back first.

501
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,329
I have some things to deal with.

502
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,130
Keep in touch.

503
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,449
What's wrong with this kid?

504
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,580
He's acting all weird.

505
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,450
Friday.

506
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,180
