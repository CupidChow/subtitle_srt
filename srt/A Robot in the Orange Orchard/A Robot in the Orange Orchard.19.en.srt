1
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,700
(Episode 19: Mine and Yours)

2
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,180
Shan Shan is back.

3
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,079
Shan Shan is back.

4
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:51,879
So?

5
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,349
Did the finals go well?

6
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:56,049
You didn't go unnoticed, did you?

7
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,290
How is that possible?

8
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:58,489
I was really popular.

9
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,019
It must be hard for you, Shan Shan.

10
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,290
You are finally being acknowledged.

11
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,730
I knew you were the best.

12
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,330
Why is your little face so red?

13
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,669
Are you okay?

14
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,069
Maybe it's because I caught a cold.

15
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:13,969
I have a headache.

16
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:15,870
I'll go in and get some rest.

17
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,580
Go to your room and rest. Go.

18
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,710
Shan Shan!

19
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,409
Shan Shan, are you okay?

20
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,550
Don't scare us.

21
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:31,659
Doctor.

22
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:33,689
Why did get such a high fever...

23
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,759
all of a sudden?

24
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,159
She has overworked.

25
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,759
And on top of that,

26
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,199
she has been feeling uncomfortable in her heart.

27
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,939
The body's immune system is sending an alarm.

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,039
While she was out of it,

29
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,639
I heard her calling for someone named Lu.

30
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,710
Did something happen to her?

31
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,780
No.

32
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:54,909
She's just talking in her sleep.

33
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:56,409
Thank you, doctor.

34
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,979
Okay, let her rest.

35
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,949
Okay, thank you.

36
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:05,560
In front of us, Shan Shan...

37
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,659
acts optimistic and strong.

38
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,189
All this while,

39
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,699
she's the one having the hardest time.

40
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:14,129
We did wrong to Shan Shan...

41
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:16,469
and Lu Sen.

42
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,539
All right now.

43
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,169
Don't frown.

44
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,580
I'll take care of Shan Shan.

45
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,409
If you are really concerned, go back.

46
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,909
Keep an eye on Lu Sen for her.

47
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:31,650
Right, this.

48
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,020
Boss told us to give this to Shan Shan.

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,949
Dad.

50
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,449
You're drinking?

51
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,339
I remember.

52
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:31,980
Wasn't this your favorite horse when you were a kid?

53
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:35,949
You gave it away.

54
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,750
Do you know why I gave it away?

55
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,290
Why?

56
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:48,829
I paid a lot of money...

57
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,029
to pick out this nice stallion out of a million for you.

58
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,399
It was bred to compete.

59
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:55,300
But you...

60
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,139
wanted to keep it as a pet.

61
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,139
Back then,

62
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:02,240
you couldn't bear to train him at all.

63
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,449
Even though it has a natural talent for winning,

64
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,879
if you don't train or make the most of it,

65
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:14,019
it's a form of destruction to the horse.

66
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,959
Of course, I gave it to an owner who wants it to win.

67
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,500
I heard that at today's competition,

68
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,029
you and Lu Sen had a confrontation...

69
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:31,740
over the same lamp.

70
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,269
Yes.

71
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,649
Do you feel embarrassed?

72
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,350
Yes.

73
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,290
In front of everyone,

74
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,360
you were dumbfounded by Lu Sen.

75
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,589
At that time, did you feel...

76
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:57,430
a strong sense of defeat?

77
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,600
Yes.

78
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,100
You know why?

79
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,069
Why?

80
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,610
That's because you haven't found the horse...

81
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,680
that your rival truly cares about.

82
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,149
If you want to mess with someone else's horse,

83
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,449
you need to be able to protect yourself first.

84
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:18,750
Otherwise, you'll end up like Lu Sen's dad.

85
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,319
I don't know whose horse he messed with.

86
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,920
In the end,

87
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,560
I had to take care of his son.

88
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,160
All right.

89
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,360
Don't think too much. Get some rest.

90
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,430
But you know it yourself.

91
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,370
I don't give losers...

92
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,040
too many chances.

93
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:10,029
Lu Sen...

94
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,439
Are you really that kind of person?

95
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,019
Like Friday said,

96
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,560
live like a normal person.

97
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,019
- Hi. - Good morning.

98
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,559
I really hate it when the chairman comes to work.

99
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:41,529
Me too.

100
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,330
Every time he comes, the company is in an uproar.

101
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,899
I'm so nervous that I can't focus on work.

102
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:48,929
He's so annoying and demanding.

103
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,899
As long as it's his project,

104
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,370
you won't get results in a year or two.

105
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,639
You can only look at the other teams get the bonuses.

106
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,710
Actually, I think...

107
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,909
except when he first got here,

108
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,110
everything else is fine.

109
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,450
And I've worked on his projects before.

110
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:07,220
He is professional and sharp.

111
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,450
Don't try to flatter him.

112
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,690
People like him are called Three Nos.

113
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,159
No elegance, no class, no substance.

114
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,960
But he's not bad-looking, I guess.

115
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,129
Kind of like me.

116
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:19,730
Like you?

117
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,730
What?

118
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:27,139
Mr. Lu...

119
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,240
- Mr. Lu. - Tell me.

120
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,580
How are we the same?

121
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,279
I was talking nonsense.

122
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:39,019
Oh, right.

123
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

124
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,320
I'll resign with HR later.

125
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,919
I didn't say I'm firing you.

126
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,460
Tell everyone.

127
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,129
I'll come to work every day from now on.

128
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,159
Every day?

129
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:57,740
Good morning, everyone.

130
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,600
Mr. Lu is here.

131
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:08,450
I guess I was a little scary back then.

132
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,149
I'll take my time.

133
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,090
She woke up a few times today.

134
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,590
But the doctor said...

135
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,190
to play it safe...

136
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:23,029
and have her stay in the hospital for a while.

137
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,299
Tang Tang.

138
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:28,129
Thank you for taking care of Shan Shan.

139
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,230
As her aunt and uncle,

140
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,269
we're so incompetent.

141
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,269
Don't say that.

142
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,769
I know that this brat...

143
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,879
is stubborn.

144
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,779
All this while,

145
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,279
she misses you guys.

146
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:43,779
And I know...

147
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,250
that she wants you two...

148
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:47,950
to acknowledge her effort.

149
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,159
- Shan Shan. - Shan Shan.

150
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:55,460
- Shan Shan. - Shan Shan.

151
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,029
You're awake. How do you feel?

152
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,029
What are you doing here?

153
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:03,830
Shan Shan.

154
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,870
We all know about your competition.

155
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,009
I was wrong.

156
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,039
I was too strict with you.

157
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:15,409
I wasn't good with my words either.

158
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:16,779
Don't take it to heart.

159
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,720
Here's the thing.

160
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,649
Since you want to work, from now on,

161
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,149
do it well.

162
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,860
I'll support you no matter what.

163
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,190
Okay?

164
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,590
I only have two things to do from now on.

165
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,759
One is to take care of our family.

166
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:32,960
Another is to mind my tongue.

167
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,399
Shan Shan.

168
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,080
I guess I didn't check carefully before.

169
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,649
Every contract and every single payment.

170
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,519
Now that I look at it, there are a lot of problems.

171
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,590
Mr. Si.

172
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,090
I'll give you top executive authorization...

173
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:57,889
to the company's system later.

174
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,659
I want you to find...

175
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:01,889
all the projects Li Jing Cheng is in charge of.

176
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,600
Are you suspecting...

177
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,230
Embezzlement.

178
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:15,039
When I wasn't in the office,

179
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,710
the creative department wasn't the only one exploiting loopholes.

180
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,679
Some people...

181
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,080
are trying to take away the CEO's power.

182
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,490
Good timing. Li Jing Cheng.

183
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,120
You gave me the opening yourself.

184
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,799
Dad.

185
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,730
Mr. Li.

186
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,100
Li Zhan.

187
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,269
Take a look at this document.

188
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,139
Your good friend, Lu Sen,

189
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,450
completely disapproved of your Edge-N Project.

190
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:56,649
So it's because of a scientific liar...

191
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,149
and a robot that no one knows about.

192
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,889
I think...

193
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,720
he was tricked by Fu Yang.

194
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,490
IMU's future is at stake here.

195
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,360
Dad.

196
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:08,490
I've heard of him.

197
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,129
A laboratory in the UK just issued a clarification statement for him.

198
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,899
I heard that's also ordered by Mr. Lu.

199
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,600
This Lu Sen...

200
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,570
Does he know or not that he's the CEO?

201
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,240
How could he be so careless?

202
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,480
He's too impatient.

203
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,679
I can't believe he trusted that a science con artist...

204
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,610
is capable of creating an amazing robot.

205
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,120
Could Lu Sen really have been tricked?

206
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,750
Fu Yang is fooling him with a real person.

207
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,389
That can't be.

208
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,860
Lu Sen won't be fooled so easily.

209
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,990
I'm sure he'd check for himself.

210
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:44,500
- One more thing, Mr. Li. - Go ahead.

211
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,799
I heard from someone in Operations.

212
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,629
Mr. Lu has been going to the office a lot lately.

213
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,629
He has been reading up on the projects and contracts.

214
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,240
Especially the overseas project we're in charge of.

215
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:58,809
I got it.

216
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,879
Go on.

217
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,049
- Goodbye, Mr. Li. - Okay.

218
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:10,649
Who does Lu Sen think he is?

219
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,190
He's openly checking my accounts in the office.

220
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,129
Dad.

221
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,090
It's probably nothing personal.

222
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,659
He just came to work recently.

223
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,759
He has to do something.

224
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,600
Nothing personal?

225
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:23,769
Then what is it?

226
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:26,200
Are you dumb or just pretending to be dumb?

227
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:29,070
At this point, you're still siding with others?

228
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,940
I'm warning you. It's not just me he's after.

229
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,409
He's coming for us.

230
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,649
He's coming for the Li family!

231
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,250
He wants to destroy the Li family!

232
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,480
Jing Cheng.

233
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,350
How could you do such a thing?

234
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,090
Don't you know it's illegal?

235
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:44,789
I know, Lu Cheng.

236
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,360
Lu Cheng...

237
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,389
I...

238
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,330
I'm sorry. I know I was wrong.

239
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,460
Please forgive me just this once.

240
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,299
If you and I don't say anything about it,

241
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,539
no one will ever know I embezzled the company funds.

242
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,639
I beg...

243
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,110
You'd better resign on your own.

244
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,720
Like father, like son.

245
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,690
I want to see how long...

246
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,889
this loser is going to keep this up.

247
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:18,259
Dad.

248
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,789
What are you planning?

249
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,129
Maybe I'm just overthinking it.

250
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,029
Lu Sen is the CEO of the company, after all.

251
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,529
You're overthinking it?

252
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,129
Do you know what Lu Sen's dad...

253
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,240
did to your dad, me,

254
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,840
back then?

255
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,909
I've worked for the company for so many years.

256
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,940
No one has ever dared to plot against me...

257
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:38,210
on my watch.

258
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:40,309
He's trying to mess with me now?

259
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,210
Go ahead. Come at me.

260
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,720
I'm going to see who gets the last laugh.

261
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:46,750
Dad.

262
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,049
I don't know what happened between you and Mr. Lu.

263
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,360
But Lu Sen...

264
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:53,720
You watched him grow up, after all.

265
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:56,960
I hope...

266
00:15:58,429 --> 00:15:59,360
you can spare him.

267
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,600
Are you really my son?

268
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,740
Am I your biological father?

269
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:07,570
Listen.

270
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,840
Sometimes, in the back of my mind,

271
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,179
I keep thinking you're not my real son.

272
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,940
I'm sorry.

273
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,610
I got a little carried away.

274
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,120
I said those things.

275
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,950
Did I hurt you?

276
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,220
Don't take it personally.

277
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,140
I just hope...

278
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,069
you don't get bullied in IMU...

279
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,410
or be an outcast.

280
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,279
Li Zhan.

281
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,309
I can't be with you forever.

282
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,410
You're too young and kind.

283
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,750
When it comes to scheming,

284
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,450
you don't stand a chance against Lu Sen.

285
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,950
I just hope that while I'm still alive,

286
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:33,920
I can take care of you and your mom.

287
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,730
Dad.

288
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:45,839
You've already done a great job.

289
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,180
Silly boy.

290
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,019
I know.

291
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,920
You're a sentimental person.

292
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:04,920
An affectionate child.

293
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,759
But have you thought about this?

294
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:10,730
Try to recall.

295
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,799
All these years,

296
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,430
how has Lu Sen treated you?

297
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,039
No matter where you were,

298
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,569
no matter how many people there were.

299
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,509
There was no understanding nor support as a friend.

300
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,410
One time, he called you out in public.

301
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,809
Did he not embarrass you?

302
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,109
Did that happen?

303
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,019
I won't harm you.

304
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,319
I'm your family.

305
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,630
Dad.

306
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,630
I got it.

307
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,569
Here.

308
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,769
So?

309
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,240
How do you feel now that you're back?

310
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,210
Nothing special.

311
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,279
But those people seem pretty worked up.

312
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:06,650
They're scared of me.

313
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,049
They talk about me behind my back.

314
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:12,089
That's normal.

315
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,829
That's how people in the workplace are.

316
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,059
It's to relieve stress.

317
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,230
I understand.

318
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,759
I didn't get at them.

319
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,000
Don't forget your watch and your injection.

320
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:24,940
Just in case.

321
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:31,309
But these past few days, I don't feel that nervous...

322
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,079
in the crowd.

323
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,210
I even tried to use my hands...

324
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,680
to try and touch them.

325
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:39,450
I was fine.

326
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,690
Good.

327
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:47,660
In such a short time,

328
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:49,329
you could achieve this much.

329
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,099
It might not take long...

330
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:53,799
for you to be completely cured.

331
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,519
I think so too.

332
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:26,829
Mr. Si.

333
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,130
Contact the participant of the Young Idea Competition...

334
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,369
who made Aiya Lamp.

335
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:34,400
Okay, Mr. Lu.

336
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,200
No.

337
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,230
Didn't anyone teach you?

338
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:03,430
To make rice, water covering the palm...

339
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,339
or the fingertip is enough.

340
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,569
But we're not making rice.

341
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,470
It's porridge.

342
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,180
We need to add 200ml more water.

343
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:13,410
It's porridge?

344
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,180
Oh, right.

345
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,650
Vegetables.

346
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:20,950
- Do the math, Li Cha De. - What are you doing?

347
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:26,759
We're cooking.

348
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,190
Cooking?

349
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,430
It's pumpkin porridge.

350
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:38,970
Do you like it?

351
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,569
It's not good.

352
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,569
Give it to me.

353
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:18,779
I thought you said it wasn't good.

354
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,180
You made it for me, so it's mine.

355
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,380
If you want it,

356
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:23,579
make it yourself.

357
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,559
I hope you can spend more time...

358
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,630
with Lu Sen on my behalf.

359
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,400
Because you guys...

360
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,900
made him learn to rely on Friday,

361
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:46,940
you can treat him...

362
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,869
like a real best friend.

363
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,109
Don't leave him all alone again.

364
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:52,079
Okay?

365
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,690
It's not as good as mine.

366
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,720
What a waste of ingredients.

367
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,789
And you're forcing me to finish it.

368
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,529
How inhumane.

369
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,279
This is nice.

370
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,079
It's limited edition.

371
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:08,519
Do I have to queue up to buy it?

372
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,210
Hello. Who are you looking for?

373
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,809
What took you so long to pick up?

374
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,319
I want you to help me buy a figure.

375
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,450
Any conditions are fine.

376
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,190
I acknowledge what you can do.

377
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:49,890
Just don't do what you did last time...

378
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,230
and spoil the packaging.

379
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,470
Hello?

380
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:00,170
Are you there?

381
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,140
Why aren't you saying anything?

382
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:08,680
Do you know what time it is?

383
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,710
I'm not here to entertain you.

384
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,190
Sorry.

385
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,150
I didn't know it was so late.

386
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,460
I can pay you by the time.

387
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:23,089
Can you stay on the phone?

388
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,430
A friend of mine went far away.

389
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,029
I want to talk to someone.

390
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:34,700
Don't you have other friends?

391
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,009
No.

392
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,880
Don't you have any other friends?

393
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,809
I do.

394
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,750
But she was the best.

395
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,470
Listen carefully.

396
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,009
I won't be able to get the figure for you.

397
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,839
I'm leaving.

398
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,009
Where are you going?

399
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,279
Somewhere...

400
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:23,049
Somewhere far away.

401
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,549
That won't do.

402
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,490
Then who will I ask to shop for me?

403
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:29,160
Ask whoever you want.

404
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,759
You...

405
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:38,130
Don't ever call me again.

406
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:41,809
Hello?

407
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,799
Your dad was the same before he passed away.

408
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:49,940
When he couldn't sleep, he would come here...

409
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:51,170
to look at the orange tree.

410
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,009
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

411
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,579
What for?

412
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,650
Because my surname is Xie?

413
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:04,420
Mr. Xie.

414
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,559
What kind of person was my dad like?

415
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,089
Your dad?

416
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,329
He was a horrible person.

417
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:12,829
Really?

418
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,329
He was weird...

419
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:16,930
and stubborn.

420
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,170
He was too opinionated...

421
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:20,599
and didn't have many friends.

422
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:23,339
None of us understood what he was trying to do.

423
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,779
Was he that bad?

424
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,009
However,

425
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,849
everyone liked him.

426
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,720
Because he always...

427
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:36,920
did everything well.

428
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,720
We felt that the decisions he made...

429
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,660
were all correct.

430
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,160
Then were you friends?

431
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,529
I think I was.

432
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,140
Mr. Xie.

433
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,440
After my dad passed away,

434
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:55,869
did you miss him?

435
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
Of course I did.

436
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,049
I couldn't help but cry.

437
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,049
You were only this big.

438
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,750
You locked yourself in your room all day.

439
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:13,759
Mrs. Xie and I felt so terrible.

440
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:17,329
But life has to go on.

441
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,630
You grew up so strong on your own.

442
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,799
We shouldn't just remember the sadness...

443
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,740
but be like you...

444
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:31,369
and move forward.

445
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,450
In a blink of an eye,

446
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,079
you were all grown up.

447
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,460
Look.

448
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,720
The oranges grew so well this year.

449
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:49,390
Look at that bunch.

450
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:50,890
They're huge.

451
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,500
How are you feeling today?

452
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,769
Much better.

453
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:37,210
Not bad.

454
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,440
You're recovering well.

455
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:40,039
Doctor.

456
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:41,809
When can I get discharged?

457
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,609
Maybe after a day or two.

458
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,519
If you don't have a fever,

459
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,220
you can go home and rest.

460
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:50,220
Thank you.

Here's your lamp as promised.

I hope your thoughts can be seen.

465

Hi, Mr. Lu.

466
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,460
Hello.

467
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,299
So Li Jing Cheng can't sit still already.

468
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,930
Keep an eye on him.

469
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,869
Let me know if there's any news.

470
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
It's me.

471
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,190
Do you know?

472
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,329
The meeting room on the top floor is occupied.

473
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,200
Really?

474
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,329
I've been here for so long.

475
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,799
I've never seen the top floor open.

476
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:46,940
Sit.

477
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,640
We're holding an extraordinary shareholder's meeting...

478
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,779
because the shareholders want to discuss...

479
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,819
the Edge-N Project previously rejected by Mr. Lu...

480
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,750
and the future development plan of IMU.

481
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:06,119
The Edge-N Project was not approved by the board.

482
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,089
And it wasn't a core project candidate.

483
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,160
Mr. Li.

484
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,859
Is it necessary...

485
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,700
to hold a board meeting for that?

486
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,700
Due to your willfulness and arbitrary decision,

487
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:19,569
many promising projects the company used to have...

488
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,170
were all halted.

489
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,710
Considering the future of IMU...

490
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:25,640
and the rights of the shareholders,

491
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,380
I can't stand by and do nothing anymore.

492
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:29,980
I want to ask you, Mr. Lu.

493
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,450
As the largest shareholder,

494
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,089
do you treat the company as your personal possession...

495
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,490
and practice autocracy?

496
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,460
What did you say?

497
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,359
An extraordinary shareholders' meeting?

498
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,559
Yes. I heard the meeting has already started.

499
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,759
And there's a rumor...

500
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,829
that they want to reduce Mr. Lu's decision-making power...

501
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,269
through the Edge-N Project he rejected last time.

502
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,740
They're trying to dismiss Lu Sen.

503
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:57,869
Killing two birds with one stone.

504
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,039
No, it's a trap.

505
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:01,279
- I have to stop them. - Ms. Kang.

506
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,309
It's no use.

507
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:04,109
Shareholders without the access card to the top floor...

508
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,049
can't get in.

509
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:19,630
If Mr. Lu voted against Li Zhan's project...

510
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,829
purely because of personal reasons,

511
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,929
wouldn't that be too biased?

512
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:26,570
I've also heard...

513
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,840
of the corporate management issues.

514
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,269
But as shareholders,

515
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,039
we wouldn't want anyone...

516
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,610
to bring personal issues...

517
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:34,210
into the projects.

518
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,409
That's right.

519
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,679
As the chairman,

520
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,150
if you always judge the company's development...

521
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,320
using your personal feelings,

522
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,250
that wouldn't be appropriate.

523
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,260
But everyone has seen it.

524
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,789
Mr. Lu made so much money for us.

525
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:53,730
How can you only think about money and neglect the company's growth?

526
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,800
So what you mean is...

527
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,800
I'm not fit to continue being the chairman.

528
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:02,670
Is that right?

529
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,170
This isn't my personal opinion.

530
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,639
It's the final decision of the shareholders.

531
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,809
We, the shareholders, agree...

532
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,480
that if you insist on stopping...

533
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,650
the Edge-N Project with a promising future,

534
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,760
you need to give us...

535
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,659
at least one good reason to object to it.

536
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,489
If you can't give us one today,

537
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,929
that means you admit to autocracy.

538
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,230
You decided the company's affairs based on personal grudges.

539
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,639
- That's right. - Yes.

540
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,840
Because I've already found a project...

541
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,239
that can bring new development to IMU.

542
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,440
If you're curious,

543
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,110
I can announce it in advance.

544
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,380
However,

545
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,550
on one condition.

546
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,150
What is it?

547
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:53,360
If the project is revealed...

548
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,460
and everyone agrees to it,

549
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,590
I wonder if Mr. Li has the guts...

550
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,300
to resign voluntarily.
