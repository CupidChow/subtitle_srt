00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,500
(Episode 17: I Love You, Goodbye)

2
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,909
As fan of yours, I want to ask you something.

3
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:50,280
What is it?

4
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,049
What if Lu Sen likes Shan Shan?

5
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:56,549
No way.

6
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,060
We treat her like a human,

7
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,760
but Lu Sen only sees her as a robot.

8
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,659
Didn't you say...

9
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,629
that Lu Sen doesn't feel that way about Friday?

10
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,530
Yes.

11
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,870
I mean,

12
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:13,199
he doesn't feel that way about her,

13
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,409
but the same can't be said for Shan Shan.

14
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:18,909
If Lu Sen really likes her,

15
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,509
will you set them up?

16
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,919
No.

17
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:31,560
Why?

18
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,189
Because Lu Sen has his eyes...

19
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:35,759
only on Friday the robot.

20
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,199
No matter how long Shan Shan has been with him,

21
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,699
she's still a phony Friday.

22
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,069
But you and I both know...

23
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,210
that Lu Sen needs Shan Shan.

24
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,580
Shan Shan has given Lu Sen...

25
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,110
something Friday doesn't have.

26
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:55,610
I know.

27
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,550
I know, but Lu Sen...

28
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,060
It was just his luck...

29
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:07,789
that he met Shan Shan.

30
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,430
What he needs...

31
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,900
is the smart robot Friday...

32
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,569
which can propel IMU...

33
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,439
to the forefront of the industry.

34
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,139
I have an idea.

35
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,939
I'll have the real Friday sent back...

36
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:26,610
under the pretext of resetting her.

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,319
You never cease to amaze me, Dr. Fu.

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,530
Wang Da Yun.

39
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,900
Why are you dressed so brightly?

40
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:51,240
It makes you look darker!

41
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,370
What's your problem?

42
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,180
I need some data on Friday...

43
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,649
to make Lu Sen something.

44
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,649
What data?

45
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,089
Come over.

46
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,519
We need to talk.

47
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,199
I'll help you with the data.

48
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:53,730
Lu Sen needs me.

49
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,129
Okay.

50
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,139
Da Yun,

51
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,569
get down here.

52
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,879
Fu Yang.

53
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,250
There are some things I'm not privy to,

54
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,550
so I'm not in a position to intervene.

55
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,649
But...

56
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,920
I think we need to talk.

57
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,720
When you're free.

58
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,689
Okay.

59
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,069
You asked me...

60
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:33,339
to have my emotions inputted into a robot.

61
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,509
I did what you asked.

62
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:41,850
And she cured me.

63
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,149
I fell in love with her.

64
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,050
Did you expect it...

65
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:49,790
to turn out like this...

66
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,720
in Friday's deep learning program?

67
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,370
I don't know when it started,

68
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,139
but I started waiting for her eagerly.

69
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,480
I like it when she looks at me,

70
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,079
talks to me,

71
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,879
and smiles at me.

72
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,449
Once she's gone,

73
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,060
time goes by so slowly.

74
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,529
Because she's the only one you have.

75
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,699
Lu Sen, do you know...

76
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,230
that you're shifting your emotions...

77
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,240
to a robot?

78
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,009
She's just a robot.

79
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,110
Snap out of it.

80
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:42,910
I know.

81
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,180
But I just can't help...

82
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,720
thinking about her.

83
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:54,920
Fu Yang.

84
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,759
Tell me.

85
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,800
What should I do?

86
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,339
Reset her.

87
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,040
So everything will go back to the way it was.

88
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,579
Lu Sen.

89
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,319
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,620
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:42,500
Is doing that...

92
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,000
going to be better for Friday?

93
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,180
It's for your own good, and hers.

94
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:06,790
Let me spend one more day with Friday.

95
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,689
Then we'll...

96
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,199
reset her.

97
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:21,740
Okay.

98
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,070
It's on.

99
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,009
It's on!

100
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,279
At last.

101
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,009
It's working.

102
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:02,950
Guys,

103
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,149
you guys are amazing.

104
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:06,919
Hey.

105
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:08,419
Aren't you guys geniuses?

106
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,190
I've been working on it for so long, but I couldn't figure it out.

107
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,860
You got it done in no time.

108
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,129
Actually, you were almost done.

109
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,929
We just tweaked it a little.

110
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,830
This is nothing.

111
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,360
You can figure it out on your own.

112
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,500
Shan Shan.

113
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,129
Did you study quantum physics?

114
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,570
It's quantum entanglement.

115
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,740
Quantum entanglement.

116
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,370
Say, two quanta make up a pair,

117
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,610
and when one particle acts,

118
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,039
it can immediately alter the action of the other article.

119
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,409
No matter how far apart they are,

120
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,179
they can also be brought back together.

121
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,549
I don't really get that.

122
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,919
So the real genius is here.

123
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:47,190
But is this the only lamp?

124
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,490
Of course not.

125
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,029
This lamp is actually a basic prototype.

126
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,759
I've also invented glowing bolsters...

127
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,759
and glowing figurines.

128
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:56,370
I actually want to get my ideas approved...

129
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,940
so I can get back to inventing.

130
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,139
Then I'll order a figurine.

131
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,340
I'd like a bolster.

132
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:02,440
Think about it.

133
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,139
It's so soft and plump,

134
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,110
it makes you feel safe.

135
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,509
It's like hugging each other.

136
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,409
Then you do need it.

137
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,820
Shan Shan.

138
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,120
This quantum entanglement lamp...

139
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,090
This Aiya Lamp...

140
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,860
It's very high-tech.

141
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,429
I'm inviting you to join Alpha.

142
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,100
Will you join us?

143
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,509
Of course I will.

144
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,289
I mean, you know...

145
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,289
I'll have to leave, anyway.

146
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,639
I have one tiny request.

147
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:22,750
I hope you can spend more time...

148
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,860
with Lu Sen on my behalf.

149
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:26,919
Because you guys...

150
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,360
made him learn to rely on Friday,

151
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,659
you can treat him...

152
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,629
like a real best friend.

153
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,830
Don't leave him all alone again.

154
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,940
Okay?

155
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,879
It's not a problem.

156
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,120
Thank you, guys.

157
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,029
Is it tight?

158
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:08,970
No.

159
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,870
It's my last day.

160
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:16,340
You can do it, Shan Shan.

161
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:17,639
It won't take long.

162
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,860
Friday.

163
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:35,730
Friend Mode.

164
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:38,860
Hello.

165
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:40,129
My best friend.

166
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,769
You've been through a lot.

167
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,269
It's okay.

168
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,669
I'm not as petty-minded...

169
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,240
as you think.

170
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:57,649
Let's go out today.

171
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:00,950
Just don't suddenly malfunction...

172
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,620
and jump into Operational Mode.

173
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,220
Okay.

174
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,789
But it might be raining outside.

175
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,500
We can still do...

176
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:15,429
a lot of the stuff...

177
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,399
we agreed to do.

178
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:20,639
How much power do you have left?

179
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:25,210
Eight hours to standby.

180
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,350
Eight hours.

181
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:32,919
You can do a lot with that.

182
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,590
Just don't run out on me.

183
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:37,789
I can't carry you.

184
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,230
Okay.

185
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,379
This is the elementary school I went to.

186
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,279
It has been 15 years since I last came here.

187
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,450
Master.

188
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,149
I believe there were many girls...

189
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,460
sending you love letters as a child.

190
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,759
Love letters?

191
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:16,990
Not really.

192
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,899
I was quite ugly as a kid.

193
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:23,799
And...

194
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,720
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

195
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:48,490
Monster!

196
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,230
Lu Sen's a monster!

197
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,929
Look at him.

198
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,200
Teacher,

199
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,600
Lu Sen is sick.

200
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,250
Anyway, since then,

201
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,519
I have never gone back to school.

202
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,419
That means...

203
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,789
you didn't even finish elementary school.

204
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:20,720
Don't be silly.

205
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,259
I know what you're thinking.

206
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,399
While I was stuck at home,

207
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,870
I somehow managed to complete...

208
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,769
my MBA at MIT,

209
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,440
Financial Economics at Birmingham,

210
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:36,070
Legal Studies at Harvard,

211
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,240
and a Master in Financial Management at Tsinghua,

212
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:40,409
all self-taught online.

213
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,710
That means you're a genius.

214
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,620
So in your eyes,

215
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,720
I, your master, am a fool.

216
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,490
Who knows?

217
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:58,730
Anyway, since then,

218
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,759
I couldn't be around people.

219
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,899
But because of you,

220
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,769
I was cured.

221
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,370
It was truly amazing.

222
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,529
Do you want some flowers, handsome?

223
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:35,600
Handsome.

224
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:36,870
Flowers!

225
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,370
Come here.

226
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,639
What kind of flowers do you like?

227
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:44,779
What's your favorite flower?

228
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:48,580
I like sunflowers.

229
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:52,679
Then I'll take all the sunflowers here.

230
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:53,850
All right.

231
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:58,120
Here you go.

232
00:16:59,059 --> 00:16:59,789
Here.

233
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:04,859
Take care.

234
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,599
Goodbye.

235
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,670
It's my first time giving flowers to a girl.

236
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,140
A girl?

237
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:19,009
I know you're a robot.

238
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,710
But you're also...

239
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,079
the cutest girl I've ever seen.

240
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,049
Mr. Lu.

241
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,789
What kind of flowers do you like?

242
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,859
I don't like flowers.

243
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:36,089
You're lying.

244
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,099
I saw you sniffing earlier.

245
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,230
You're mistaken.

246
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,130
I told you.

247
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,930
I hate liars the most.

248
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,000
I know.

249
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:56,710
But because of you,

250
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,750
I'm starting to like sunflowers.

251
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:16,529
It's raining.

252
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:19,160
Friday.

253
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,930
You know what?

254
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,029
I like reading a lot.

255
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:26,240
But I've never been to a bookstore before.

256
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,650
Do you want to hear a story?

257
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,990
- Hold this for me. - Okay.

258
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,519
(The Velveteen Rabbit)

259
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,690
There was once a velveteen rabbit...

260
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
who was as chubby as a rabbit should be.

261
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,670
The rabbit hopes that someday,

262
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,930
he can become...

263
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,329
a real rabbit.

264
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,970
An old leather toy horse told him,

265
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,670
"When a child truly loves you,"

266
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,880
"then you'll become a real rabbit."

267
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:08,450
So the velveteen rabbit looked forward every day...

268
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,309
to a child that would like him.

269
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:13,650
One night,

270
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:14,720
this velveteen rabbit...

271
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,750
was stuffed into the hands of a little boy.

272
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,789
The boy held on to him...

273
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,460
and fell asleep.

274
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:25,700
The boy's arms...

275
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,400
clutched the velveteen rabbit tightly.

276
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,329
The rabbit also tucked himself firmly...

277
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,029
under the boy's warm chin.

278
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:32,670
Every day after that,

279
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,099
they would embrace one another...

280
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,640
and fall asleep together.

281
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,869
Eventually,

282
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,910
the boy started talking to him.

283
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,650
In the boy's eyes,

284
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,279
he was indeed a real rabbit.

285
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,529
But...

286
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:02,930
he'll never find his rabbit now.

287
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,579
The end.

288
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,519
It stopped raining.

289
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,150
The sun is out.

290
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,990
Let's go.

291
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,099
Are you about to run out of battery?

292
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,700
Is there anything I can do...

293
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,630
to keep you by my side for much longer?

294
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,670
I want to go home with you.

295
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,710
Let's go home.

296
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,000
Everything is still like the first day we met.

297
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,299
But nothing seems the same.

298
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:52,480
But you're still shining brightly...

299
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:54,579
like the first time we met.

300
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,019
Hearing you praising me...

301
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,549
instead of dissing me...

302
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,490
I haven't quite gotten used to it.

303
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,329
I'm so sorry for all the troubles...

304
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:12,799
I've caused you all this while.

305
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,910
Friday.

306
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,279
I'll praise you well from now on.

307
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:34,890
Thank you...

308
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,960
for bringing back 15 years of my life.

309
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,759
You're my friend.

310
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,200
My cure.

311
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,799
You made me open the door to a new world.

312
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,470
The days I spent with you were a miracle for me.

313
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,339
Thank you.

314
00:23:58,809 --> 00:23:59,640
You know what?

315
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:03,880
Actually, I didn't cure you.

316
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,019
It's what you've longed for...

317
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,150
that healed you.

318
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:12,089
So even if it wasn't me,

319
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:14,089
anyone...

320
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:15,589
could've healed you.

321
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,630
You're the best master I've ever had.

322
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,000
You're the best master in the whole world.

323
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:24,369
You helped me find my self-worth.

324
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,670
You...

325
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,440
are also my most precious friend.

326
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,450
Thank you, Lu Sen.

327
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,269
Reset me now.

328
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:05,009
Hold that button for five seconds,

329
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:07,109
and I'll go into reset mode.

330
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:10,509
All of my memories will be deleted.

331
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,150
They will never be restored.

332
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:45,880
But before that,

333
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,849
I have one more thing to tell you.

334
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:56,059
That too...

335
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,630
will be deleted after I'm reset.

336
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:20,950
Friday.

337
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,420
I love you.

338
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,180
Initializing the reset immediately.

339
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,049
Five.

340
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,019
Four.

341
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:55,890
Three.

342
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,119
