(Episode 27: My Warmth Has Found Its Master)

2
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:39,969
Mr. Si.

3
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:41,939
You mean, you looked into...

4
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,180
an offshore account related to Li Jing Cheng,

5
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,640
and there have been recent transactions?

6
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,250
Then, send me the data.

7
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,060
Li Er.

8
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,859
Can you send me the company's financial reports...

9
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,760
for the past 10 years?

10
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,989
I don't get much from what I have now.

11
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,560
Perhaps we should utilize...

12
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:05,459
Mr. Kang's connections.

13
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,370
Great, that's all. Thank you.

14
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,039
Where are you going?

15
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:15,539
I see you're busy, so I don't want to bother you.

16
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,569
I'll be outside.

17
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:19,979
Feed me.

18
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,919
Let's see if it's sweet.

19
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,349
Is it sweet?

20
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,289
Not bad.

21
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:32,090
Not bad?

22
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,360
You try one too.

23
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,009
I see that Lu Sen looks handsome...

24
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:50,879
when he's hard at work.

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,180
I'm working too.

26
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,750
I work hard.

27
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,819
But you're not handsome enough.

28
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,090
Tom.

29
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,960
Friday's systems are already going haywire.

30
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,699
We have no means to control her.

31
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,430
At this rate,

32
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,870
she could be scrapped.

33
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:17,740
Shut up!

34
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,509
Okay.

35
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
That's it for today.

36
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,219
Has Friday's system been breached?

37
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,520
Mr. Li.

38
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,750
- Hello, Mr. Li. - Do your work.

39
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:35,219
Here, Mr. Li.

40
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,620
Here.

41
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,090
Mr. Li, I have some other good news for you, actually.

42
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,930
To be honest,

43
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,659
Mr. Li,

44
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,300
although I've resolved...

45
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,300
Friday's fundamental issues,

46
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,000
Fu Yang and his folks are one heck of a nuisance.

47
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,199
On one hand, we're dealing with...

48
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,539
the robot's technical difficulties,

49
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,069
and one the other, we have to deal with their constant attacks.

50
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:57,580
So in order to overcome all these problems,

51
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,110
I'm going to need more time.

52
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,509
How long will it take?

53
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,419
It's hard to tell.

54
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,849
You see, Mr. Li,

55
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,319
even I couldn't overcome...

56
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:11,759
Friday's technical difficulties.

57
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,330
Even if you give this task to any scientist...

58
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,990
other than the Alpha Team,

59
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,329
it won't make a difference.

60
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,300
And by the time the new one is released,

61
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,269
it'll take us a lot of time to debug.

62
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,069
You'll lose more than you gain.

63
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,839
I suggest that we dismantle...

64
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,680
Friday's core components...

65
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,980
and sell her to some foreign robot developers...

66
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,910
at a high price.

67
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,120
Sell her out?

68
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,490
I'm trying to convert Friday's prospects...

69
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,459
into IMU's true power,

70
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,490
and you want me to sell her?

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,199
What were you thinking?

72
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,300
I understand, Mr. Li.

73
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,800
So I have another bit of good news for you.

74
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,170
A while ago, I got a call from Bode Group in England.

75
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:03,069
They are willing...

76
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,509
to offer you a very satisfactory price.

77
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,910
They also requested for a joint development.

78
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,949
Once the funds come in,

79
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,819
your shareholders...

80
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,850
won't stop you over the project, will they?

81
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,689
I'll think about it.

82
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,629
They said they wanted to hold a teleconference...

83
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,360
to take a look at Friday.

84
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,029
Is that okay?

85
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,100
Sure.

86
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,769
You schedule it.

87
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,899
All right.

88
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:54,189
They're all asleep.

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,259
You're here.

90
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:02,000
Have a seat.

91
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:08,769
There has been a development on Friday.

92
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:12,310
Now we've made Tom avoid booting up.

93
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,110
Nothing else will happen for now.

94
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,319
I told them to go to bed.

95
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,879
What about you?

96
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,750
It's like you're forever on standby.

97
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,060
Someone has to keep an eye.

98
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:27,860
I'm not sleepy.

99
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,029
Come on.

100
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,269
Lean on me and get some sleep.

101
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:44,980
But...

102
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,310
No one is looking at you.

103
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,680
Just rest for a little while.

104
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,879
I'll keep an eye on Friday.

105
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,290
Thank you.

106
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,529
I'm going to sleep.

107
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,740
According to the latest data from Lu Sen,

108
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,910
Bode Group and IMU will hold...

109
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,509
a teleconference on AI robots today.

110
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,850
Although we have enough time...

111
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,509
to pinpoint Friday's exact location,

112
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:23,819
today,

113
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,449
it's when their defenses are at their weakest.

114
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:27,819
Pai Song.

115
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:29,319
Watch Friday closely.

116
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,449
Any remote communication they perform...

117
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,689
will surely give themselves away...

118
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,389
and lock us on to Friday's location in no time.

119
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:34,930
Li Cha De, Da Yun.

120
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:36,889
Stay connected to Friday.

121
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,899
Don't be afraid to push yourselves.

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,759
At this moment,

123
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,029
Tom will not set off the self-destruct program.

124
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,680
Sir, they're on.

125
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,910
It's somewhere in Chengxi Tech City.

126
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,480
Narrow down the search area.

127
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,750
Send Lu Sen the location.

128
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,589
The rest is up to him.

129
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,129
Lu Sen?

130
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,930
Yes, Mr. Wilson.

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,269
So Friday's system is perfect.

132
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,569
Yes.

133
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,310
We need more details...

134
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,670
about your concept.

135
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,410
I know.

136
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,040
Then we can decide how we can collaborate together.

137
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,910
What happened?

138
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,450
What's wrong?

139
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,960
What happened?

140
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:41,529
Our system is under attack.

141
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,860
We're under attack?

142
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,899
Hello.

143
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,370
What?

144
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,240
Lu Sen is at our office?

145
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,039
What's he doing there at a time like this?

146
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:58,710
I see.

147
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:00,909
Tom.

148
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,710
Solve the problem right away.

149
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:03,450
Yes, sir.

150
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,250
I have to head back.

151
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,450
Okay, Mr. Li. Take care.

(New World Center)

153
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,179
It's not so bad being the boss.

154
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:36,980
Where are you?

155
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,220
Get back here!

156
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,820
The system's under attack.

157
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,090
It's about to crash.

158

Hurry up! Come back here!

159
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:54,169
You are our family.

160
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,230
Our Friday is freaking smart, isn't she?

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,840
There's nothing like our Friday.

162
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:02,870
You're the best we've ever had.

163
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,210
Friday.

164

You're the most obedient and the smartest.

165

You're a great girl.

You lost him?

Did you see anyone else?

It can't be.

Turn back.

Go.

I know. I'm looking everywhere.

Friday is missing?

Aren't you the one who has been keeping and controlling her?

205

How could she have gone missing?

206
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,809
What worries me the most now is that she may be heading to Fu Yang's.

207
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,179
If her recording of us gets out to the press,

what should we do?

You're asking me what we should do?

That's what I'm asking you!

211

If she exposes everything we did,

she'll blow up.

she won't be a threat to us.

Why is she dressed like that in the cold?

I think she's odd too.

It has been half a year...

since we've worked on smart robots.

266

Maybe someday,

267
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,929
we can set up a high-tech business.

00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:33,529
Stop!

00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,370
Hey, stop.

272
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,669
Dude,

273
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,570
you can't park here.

Yes, she...

277
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,610
There's no one with her.

278
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,909
Dude, can I get a closer look at her?

279
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:50,909
Back at the lab,

280
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,779
they wouldn't even let me go near her.

281
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,519
No.

282
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,750
Now that we've accomplished our mission,

283
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,519
we shouldn't make contact with our target anymore.

284
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,889
If you want to succeed in the future,

285
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,659
you've got to have that level of expertise.

286
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,460
Fine.

287
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,090
Friday looks...

288
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,259
lost.

289
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,900
She's such a high-end robot.

290
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,160
Her owners must be worried sick.

291
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,240
Then, let's talk to her.

292
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,000
Just don't get us in trouble.

293
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:13,799
Okay.

294
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,009
Friday.

295
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,319
Friday.

296
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,650
Where are you going?

297

Home.

298

Are you lost?

299
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,059
The GPS signal is weak.

300
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,559
My power is low.

301
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,690
Hey,

302
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:38,700
look at this.

303

Hello, Smarty Liu.

304
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:56,650
Hey, she knows me!

305
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,279
Because we're friends.

306
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:02,920
All these years,

307
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,690
no one has ever considered me as their friend.

We have to get her home.

309
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:12,799
Please.

310
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,670
Get in.

311
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,529
Come on.

312
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,359
But why did you say...

313
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,200
Friday might come here?

314
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,759
You told me.

315
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,170
Let's make a deal.

316
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,230
If you can't find me,

317
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,240
wait for me where we last met.

318
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,539
I'll wait for you there.

319
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:55,539
So you remember...

320
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:56,470
what I told you.

321
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,039
So Friday will remember too.

322
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:01,039
Her last known location...

323
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:03,450
is at the Orange Garden lab.

324
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,619
This is the only way to that place.

325
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,650
She'll be back.

326
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:21,200
It's Friday.

327
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:28,170
Friday.

328
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:29,440
Are you okay?

329
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,710
There are two Fridays?

330
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:33,509
Also, there's Lu...

331
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,279
Lu... Luckily, we came to the rescue.

332
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,279
Now that she's home, let's go.

333
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,319
Who are you?

334
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:40,450
And how did Friday end up with you?

335
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:42,250
Thank you.

336
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:44,920
This...

337
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,990
This is the first time someone thanked us.

338
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,730
Also, a high-tech way of doing that.

339
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,500
Let's go.

340
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,769
Let's hide over there.

341
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,240
Friday.

342
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,420
Lu Sen found Friday.

343
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,289
This is a cause for celebration.

344
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,190
Yes.

345
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,630
Oh, no.

346
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,769
Why is Friday's self-destruction program activated?

347
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,950
Connecting to Friday's back-end...

348
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,720
should stop the program.

349
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,519
Connect to the Orange Garden lab.

350
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:51,250
Now!

351
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:57,630
Lu Sen.

352
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,160
Listen carefully.

353
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,299
Friday's self-destruction program has been activated.

354
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,970
You have to get to the Orange Garden lab now.

355
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,369
It's the closest to you.

356
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,940
You only have 15 minutes.

357
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,170
Friday's self-destruction program might cause an explosion.

358
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:13,380
Be careful.

359
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:16,710
We don't have time.

360
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,349
Friday's self-destruction program has been activated.

361
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,650
We have 15 minutes to head to the lab.

362

You boys, come here.

365
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:45,509
Are you all right, sir?

366
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:47,009
I think I broke my back.

367
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,009
Oh, no.

368
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,250
I left the stove on.

369
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,049
Hurry.

370
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,650
Get in and turn off the stove.

371
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,920
- Hurry. - Are you okay?

372
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,289
Go.

373
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,960
Get me a doctor.

374
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,059
Call an ambulance.

375
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,359
Call the doctor.

376
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,779
Three minutes left.

377
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,049
Now what?

378
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,619
We have some instructions for you to do the manual override for us.

379
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:31,660
But you must not make a single error.

380
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:35,660
Otherwise, it might cause Friday to self-destruct early.

Friday will self-destruct.

No.

Stay where you are.

00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:24,559
to obey your orders.

Hello, Mr. Li.

Friday...

431
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:44,240
Friday has blown herself up.

432
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,130
Are you tormenting yourselves?

433
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:49,839
As you can see,

434
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,640
Friday made that decision herself.

435
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:53,809
What robot...

436
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,710
can make its own decisions?

437
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,319
Friday was the most wonderful robot in the world.

438
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:09,559
Why would she send us...

439
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:12,000
a file called Orange at the end?

440
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:13,960
I think you know best, Shan Shan.

441
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,869
"Orange" was the password we shared.

442
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,410
This document...

443
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,440
holds all of our memories.

444
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,950
I believe Friday wanted to say...

445
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,049
that we were all her most precious friends.

446
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,789
That's right.

447
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,460
It's her way of telling us...

448
00:28:39,589 --> 00:28:41,720
that she cherished her time with us.

449
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,559
As Friday.

450
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:47,299
She was trying to help us win this battle.

451
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,599
Even if she couldn't reach us in the end,

452
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,869
she still strived to get home.

453
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:55,970
I'm sure she received...

454
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,339
the sentiment that we tried to protect her.

455
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,210
She wanted to protect that sentiment.

456
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,509
We must not let her down.

457
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,049
As for those who harmed her,

458
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,759
we must make them pay the price.

459
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,200
What?

460
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,470
What dashcam?

461
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:29,369
How did the driver...

462
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,240
end up with the dashcam footage?

463
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,150
Even if I drive myself,

464
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,380
you still have to check whether the dashcam...

465
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,680
is turned on or off beforehand, okay?

466
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,789
I don't need your explanations.

467
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:44,690
I'm telling you to find that driver...

468
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,089
and get me the dashcam footage.

469
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,960
Is that clear?

470
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,650
Who would you like to see?

471
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,160
Him.

472
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:26,359
Mr. Kang.

473
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,339
We don't have much here.

474
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,210
I hope you don't mind.

475
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:39,480
You're dating my daughter,

476
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:41,980
so you should keep tidy.

477
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:50,289
I'm sorry, Mr. Kang.

478
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,319
Don't be sorry.

479
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,259
I haven't given my consent yet.

480
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:58,930
I know.

481
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,730
I was planning to pay you another formal visit...

482
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,000
when Friday was to be announced.

483
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,839
But now,

484
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,410
I'm no longer fit to do so.

485
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,009
I heard about what happened to the robot.

486
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,450
Don't be sad.

487
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,319
The man who built it...

488
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,279
is still standing right before me, isn't he?

489
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,089
What gave you the idea...

490
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,559
to work with IMU in the first place?

491
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:39,670
We did a screening on most domestic investors.

492
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,869
After that,

493
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,940
we found that Lu Sen was the best fit for our project.

494
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,509
Because...

495
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,880
he doesn't just use robots to make money.

496
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,750
Lu Sen is just like his dad.

497
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,490
Pure of heart.

498
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,660
Looking at you now...

499
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,930
reminds me of many things we did in the past.

500
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
IMU...

501
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,200
also started out as an office converted from a factory.

502
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,279
Being able to make robots that span eras here...

503
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,480
You are amazing.

504
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:30,250
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

505
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,299
By the way,

506
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,130
don't tell Li Er that I was here.

507
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:48,769
Okay.

508
00:32:58,349 --> 00:32:59,019
Come in.

509
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,319
Mr. Li.

510
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:04,990
Well, is it done?

511
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:05,789
Yes.

512
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,490
We intercepted it before the secretary...

513
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,319
could trade with the driver.

514
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,990
The video is now with us.

515
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,200
Has anyone watched it?

516
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:14,960
No.

517
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:17,029
The memory card is old.

518
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:18,230
I just had it repaired.

519
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,339
Okay, you can go now.

520
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,519
Lu Cheng.

521
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:35,220
Will you give me another chance?

522
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,119
I...

523
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,119
I know it's wrong for me to embezzle public funds.

524
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,859
But I'll think of a way to make up for it as soon as I can.

525
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,460
You know, we've been friends for so many years.

526
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:44,490
You can't just sit there...

527
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,799
and watch me go penniless.

528
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:46,529
Right, Lu Cheng?

529
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,349
What on earth were you doing?

530
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:12,019
I only told you to cause a tiny error...

531
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,489
to hold up Lu Cheng's shareholders' meeting, okay?
