00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,040
(Episode 29, Willing to Trade Everything for You)

2
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:37,799
Lu Sen.

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,239
I finally understand...

4
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,480
how scared you must feel being all alone...

5
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,709
in the boundless darkness.

6
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:04,760
Mr. Li.

7
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,900
Mr. Lu is here.

8
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,169
Let him in.

9
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,610
After you, Mr. Lu.

10
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,740
Why am I always a little off?

11
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,009
You have Shan Shan.

12
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:24,550
Sit down.

13
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,060
Lu Sen.

14
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,930
The place you're sitting in now...

15
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,030
is also where your dad sat back then.

16
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,800
I remember when your dad was sitting there back then,

17
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,770
he even sounded so relaxed.

18
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:51,009
He persuaded me to quit my job at IMU.

19
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,550
Let's cut the crap.

20
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,419
Here you are, Mr. Lu.

21
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,889
You aren't feeling well now.

22
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,960
I promised Lu Cheng I'd take good care of you.

23
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,530
I think you can use this reason...

24
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,430
to officially hand over your position as the CEO.

25
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,099
I've been making money for IMU...

26
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,599
with this sick body.

27
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,069
None of that matters.

28
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,909
You've already done your part.

29
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,310
Do you understand?

30
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,849
Open a press conference at the company tomorrow.

31
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,080
Give everyone an explanation...

32
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,550
about the information leak.

33
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,919
As IMU's CEO,

34
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,090
you should take the responsibility...

35
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,159
that you're meant to shoulder.

36
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:40,729
There's one more thing.

37
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,389
The video you have...

38
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:46,759
is all in the past.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,270
I think there really are some misunderstandings between us.

40
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:51,500
Don't you think so?

41
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,669
Think about it. After your dad left,

42
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,370
who has been taking care of you since you were little?

43
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,810
I have.

44
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,780
We're a family after all.

45
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,949
Hand over the video to me.

46
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,819
Okay?

47
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,319
If you lay a finger on Shan Shan,

48
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,219
I can make you lose everything.

49
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,470
Who are you to bargain with me?

50
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:22,930
Lu Sen.

51
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,100
You'll lose.

52
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,610
You're definitely going to lose.

53
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,769
And you're going to fail miserably.

54
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,639
It's not because I'm a sleazeball or anything,

55
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,379
but because you've been poisoned.

56
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:36,149
You're badly poisoned.

57
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,079
As long as I hold your antidote in my hand...

58
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,220
and shake my finger,

59
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,589
you'll obediently kneel in front of me.

60
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:48,430
Do you understand?

61
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,199
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

62
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:58,939
See the guest out.

63
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,620
Shan Shan.

64
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,220
Wait for me.

65
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,740
Do you know how to drive?

66
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,410
Li Zhan.

67
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:14,709
Shan Shan is missing.

68
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:15,709
What did you say?

69
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,480
Your dad has lost his mind.

70
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,250
Yang Shan Shan is a human being.

71
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,389
Are you sure you can bear the responsibility for kidnapping?

72
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:22,449
Kidnapping?

73
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,019
If she's missing, you can look for her.

74
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:24,920
What does it have to do with my dad?

75
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:28,589
Li Zhan, stop right there!

76
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:32,860
Li Zhan.

77
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,699
It's still not too late if we save her now, Li Zhan.

78
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:37,870
Li Zhan!

79
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:46,939
Dad.

80
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,449
Please let Yang Shan Shan go.

81
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,449
Why are you still so stubborn?

82
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,420
Do you think I don't know...

83
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,389
that you secretly told the chauffeur to get the video?

84
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,490
Dad.

85
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:03,899
Do you know this is a crime?

86
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,399
Let me tell you.

87
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,500
If they take Yang Shan Shan away again this time,

88
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,000
you know what the consequences are.

89
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't care about the consequences.

90
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,699
But at least we can still sit down and negotiate with them.

91
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:14,810
Negotiate?

92
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:15,740
About what?

93
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,009
Do we beg them to feed us?

94
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,149
You silly boy.

95
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,220
Do you know what will happen...

96
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,550
if Lu Sen has the video?

97
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,290
He'll make sure the Li family...

98
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,920
hits rock bottom!

99
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,860
Right now,

100
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,300
he's holding a knife...

101
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,040
and we're at their mercy.

102
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:50,209
Are you stupid?

103
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,209
You...

104
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,149
You handed that knife to him yourself, son.

105
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,490
Dad.

106
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,189
Do you really want to drive Lu Sen...

107
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,600
and Yang Shan Shan to their doom?

108
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:13,870
I'm not driving them to their doom.

109
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,800
You drove your dad to his doom.

110
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,910
There's no turning back now.

111
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,009
There's no turning back.

112
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,649
Fool.

113
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,559
Li Zhan.

114
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,730
No matter what you do,

115
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,659
I won't blame you.

116
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,669
It's because you're my son.

117
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,139
It's okay.

118
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:56,269
I just want to ask you something.

119
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:59,340
Do you really want to side with an outsider...

120
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,809
to punish your dad?

121
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,620
It's okay...

122
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,519
if that's what you really want.

123
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,389
I'll wait for you upstairs.

124
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,759
Once you think it through, you can call the police anytime.

125
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,730
Tell them to take your dad away.

126
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,769
I just want to tell you this.

127
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,909
Throughout all these years of raising you,

128
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,879
this is the first time...

129
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:36,279
I feel heartbroken.

130
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:42,220
Dad.

131
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:45,419
It's okay, kid.

132
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,029
It's okay.

133
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,149
Get someone to watch over him.

134
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,090
Don't let him interfere with our plan tomorrow.

135
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:17,190
Yes, Mr. Li.

136
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,289
Then we stick to the plan.

137
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,090
I'll get the car.

138
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,389
I'm heading off now.

139
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,570
- They're here. - They're here.

140
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,149
- Mr. Li. - Step back.

141
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,879
Please cooperate.

142
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,789
Come on, please cooperate.

143
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,490
- Mr. Li. - Mr. Li.

144
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,289
Mr. Li.

145
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,389
- Mr. Li. - Mr. Li.

146
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,629
- Mr. Li. - Mr. Li, over here.

147
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,429
Mr. Li.

148
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:03,360
Mr. Li,

149
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,299
is IMU Group calling this sudden press conference...

150
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,899
to announce some kind of new technology?

151
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:08,830
We hear there will be a big personnel change in IMU.

152
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,100
- Is that true? - Is it?

153
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,409
I know all of you have a lot of questions right now.

154
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,710
Just like you guys,

155
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,269
I also have a lot of questions...

156
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,710
regarding this decision that Mr. Lu made.

157
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,580
But it's okay.

158
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,409
I hope...

159
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,850
you can save all your questions for now.

160
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,279
When Mr. Lu gets here,

161
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:25,879
you can ask him.

162
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,450
- Okay? - Mr. Lu is here!

163
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,490
- Mr. Li. - Mr. Li.

164
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:29,620
Please explain.

165
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,720
Be orderly and don't push.

166
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,559
It's Mr. Lu.

167
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:36,259
Mr. Lu.

168
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,129
- Mr. Lu, please explain. - Mr. Lu.

169
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
- Mr. Lu. - Please don't push.

170
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,000
- Step back. - Mr. Lu.

171
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,000
Step back.

172
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,169
- Don't push. - Step back.

173
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,470
- Mr. Lu. - Mr. Lu.

174
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:46,700
Please explain.

175
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,769
Please explain the situation, Mr. Lu.

176
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:51,080
- Mr. Lu, please explain. - Can you please explain?

177
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,840
- Mr. Lu, explain. - Please explain.

178
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,909
I can't believe IMU's CEO...

179
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,649
is a coward who can't even face reporters.

180
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,220
- Please explain. - Please cooperate.

181
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:04,090
You don't have to go up.

182
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,090
Do what I told you yesterday.

183
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,730
- Go. - Okay.

184
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,730
Back up.

185
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,700
Please cooperate.

186
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:13,360
Stop moving forward.

187
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:16,600
- Excuse me. - Move aside.

188
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,500
- Excuse me. - Excuse me, please move aside.

189
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,440
- Mr. Lu. - Mr. Lu.

190
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:25,139
Please move aside. Don't push. Excuse us.

191
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:25,940
- Excuse me. - Step back.

192
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:36,820
Excuse me.

193
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,259
Mr. Lu.

194
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:49,330
I accept your terms,

195
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,830
but you have to promise me...

196
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,740
that she'll show up unscathed in front of me.

197
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,809
That depends on you, Mr. Lu.

198
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,139
Welcome, members of the press.

199
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,279
I'm the host of today's press conference.

200
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:05,419
IMU Tech is holding a last-minute press conference today...

201
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,120
to share some very important changes...

202
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,250
and decisions with all of you.

203
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:11,120
Let's welcome today's star,

204
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,590
Mr. Lu Sen, the chairman of IMU.

205
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,350
Hello, everyone. I'm Lu Sen.

206
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,149
Thank you all for coming today.

207
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,350
Right here,

208
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,750
I have a few announcements to make.

209
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,059
Lu Sen.

210
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,500
Please don't do anything stupid.

211
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,870
The first thing...

212
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,769
is the reason...

213
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,809
I've never been in touch with the public all these years.

214
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,549
After my parents died in a car accident...

215
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,419
when I was 12,

216
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,519
I got a disease.

217
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:22,789
It's a condition called physical contact disorder.

218
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,799
Because of this illness,

219
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,769
whenever I'm around people,

220
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,409
I'll develop an allergy.

221
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:40,740
If I don't take my medication in time,

222
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:42,610
within minutes,

223
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:46,419
I'll suffocate to death due to difficulty in breathing.

224
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,419
To hide the fact that I'm sick,

225
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,120
I never appeared in public.

226
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,929
When I really have to,

227
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,090
I make sure I'm armed.

228
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,740
What is a physical contact disorder?

229
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,039
Is it contagious?

230
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:14,509
No wonder the CEO never showed his face.

231
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,379
Can you tell us what the specific symptoms are?

232
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,379
Do you have medical proof?

233
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,580
How can you prove that you're not putting on a show...

234
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:20,450
to get exposure?

235
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,019
If what you say is true,

236
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,889
then shouldn't IMU get a new CEO?

237
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,309
Guang Liang.

238
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,549
Guang Liang.

239
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:50,909
Come.

240
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:53,820
Check this out.

241
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,389
Isn't this Lu Sen?

242
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,529
How could this happen?

243
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,400
Wasn't he fine...

244
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,930
when he slept with you that day?

245
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,170
Yes.

246
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,000
I was up all night watching him.

247
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,539
I didn't see anything strange.

248
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,660
What are you doing?

249
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,740
Yes.

250
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,509
This is what I look like when my condition acts up.

251
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,609
Because of this illness,

252
00:17:58,579 --> 00:17:59,450
I don't have any friends.

253
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,549
I have no family.

254
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,420
I also know...

255
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,059
I'm not capable of continuing to be the CEO of IMU.

256
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:08,789
Therefore,

257
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,890
I hereby resign...

258
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:12,960
from my position as the CEO of IMU.

259
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,400
Also, for the time being,

260
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:18,740
I'll be taking responsibility...

261
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,099
for the information leakage compensation matter.

262
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,109
Today,

263
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,740
I'm also announcing...

264
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,609
the candidate for IMU Group's future chairman.

265
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,210
He is...

266
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,680
the person who has been filling in for me,

267
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,150
Li Zhan.

268
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,660
This is so sudden.

269
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:49,730
Before we can confirm that Shan Shan is safe,

270
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,170
we can't let Li Jing Cheng get his way.

271
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,170
Even after all this,

272
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,839
you guys still trust Li Zhan so much.

273
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,960
Li Zhan.

274
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,759
After the press conference,

275
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,730
I'll go with Li Jing Cheng to find Shan Shan.

276
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,769
If you don't want him to continue his mistakes,

277
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,440
call the police.

278
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,109
Lu Sen.

279
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,849
You've got some nerves.

280
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,819
How dare you make your own decision?

281
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,819
Do you want Yang Shan Shan to die?

282
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:46,920
Mr. Li.

283
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,190
The chairman is your son.

284
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,930
What more do you want?

285
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,670
Getting full control of the company is not that easy.

286
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,799
If you let me see an unscathed Yang Shan Shan,

287
00:19:58,269 --> 00:19:59,269
I'll give you...

288
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,740
whatever you want.

289
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,509
Are you bargaining with me?

290
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,009
Haven't I been nice enough?

291
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,490
Put the blindfold on him.

292
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,619
I forgot.

293
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:22,630
He's a sick man.

294
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,630
Put the blindfold on the tip of his umbrella.

295
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,559
He can put it on himself.

296
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,329
One more thing.

297
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,730
Tell him to pass over his phone.

298
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,130
This guy...

299
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,670
Other people can't touch his body.

300
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:37,569
If he tries anything funny,

301
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:40,579
just grab him with your hands.

302
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,440
Tom.

303
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,250
We have a score to settle.

304
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,450
What else do we have to settle?

305
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,720
I just got paid to do someone's dirty work.

306
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:30,490
Besides,

307
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
even if I didn't do it,

308
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,670
your robot would still fall into someone else's hands.

309
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:36,930
It was you.

310
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,740
You killed Friday.

311
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,869
Killed?

312
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:43,410
Do you call that killing?

313
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,079
She's a robot.

314
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:47,740
Fu Yang.

315
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,549
Your biggest problem is that you find robots...

316
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,910
more important than anyone else!

317
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,220
At least she's more human than you.

318
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:56,250
Okay.

319
00:21:57,789 --> 00:21:58,759
You just want money, don't you?

320
00:21:58,819 --> 00:21:59,660
Tell me. How much do you want?

321
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,420
I'll give it to you.

322
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:03,890
Nothing can compensate for Friday.

323
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:06,329
You don't even deserve to mention her.

324
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,029
If you have anything to say, say it in court.

325
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,740
What do you mean by that?

326
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,740
Did you call the police?

327
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,109
Move!

328
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:24,980
Move.

329
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,750
Why isn't it Lu Sen?

330
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,349
This is bad. We've been tricked.

331
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,670
We're here.

332
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,170
You can remove the blindfold.

333
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,789
You won't get away with this.

334
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,259
It's no use, Tom.

335
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:48,670
You can't run.

336
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,259
Are you okay?

337
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,200
I'm fine.

338
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,470
Fu Yang!

339
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,380
- Move. - Be gentle, you two.

340
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,650
Don't hurt Mr. Lu.

341
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,049
Get out of my way!

342
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:47,819
That's strange.

343
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,130
Those two just touched you.

344
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,460
How are you okay?

345
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,029
Do you think you have control over me...

346
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,369
just because you have Shan Shan?

347
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,900
You're wrong.

348
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:03,269
Let him in.

349
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:11,450
Shan Shan.

350
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,779
Shan Shan, wake up.

351
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,289
What did you do to her?

352
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,049
What did I do to her?

353
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:19,119
What do you think I did?

354
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:21,289
What about your promise?

355
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,259
Don't you just want my shares?

356
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,660
I'll give them to you.

357
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,380
That's more like it.

358
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,190
Shan Shan, you're awake.

359
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:55,289
Lu Sen.

360
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,029
Are you feeling all right?

361
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,940
What a heroic act.

362
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,910
Lu Sen.

363
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:18,480
Two shares transfer contracts are in my hands now.

364
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:20,049
I also have the flash drive.

365
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,220
We're just giving each other what we need.

366
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:26,589
But from now on,

367
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:29,930
you'll never be able to set foot in IMU again.

368
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:35,569
Those shares are like a curse.

369
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,029
They've trapped me for over 20 years.

370
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:39,539
Trading them for you...

371
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,069
is totally worth it.

372
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:43,809
Let's go.

373
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,019
Tom has been arrested.

374
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,819
Stop those two!

375
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:58,250
Mr. Luo, you sure had some good tricks.

376
00:26:58,819 --> 00:26:59,720
Mr. Li.

377
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,690
I'm just following orders.

378
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:02,759
Otherwise,

379
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,059
- I wouldn't dare lie to you. - Okay.

380
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,160
Then as the chairman of the company, I command you.

381
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,900
Tell me right now.

382
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,470
Where is the factory that my dad bought?

383
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:13,740
Well...

384
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,670
Where is it?

385
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:17,509
I'll tell you.

386
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,119
You arrested Tom.

387
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:29,089
Nice move.

388
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:31,759
I was wondering why you signed the shares transfer contract...

389
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,690
so easily just now.

390
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:36,390
You want Tom to rat me out.

391
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,930
Then this shares transfer contract...

392
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,559
will turn into nothing but a pile of scrap paper.

393
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,430
All right.

394
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,930
In that case,

395
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,799
neither of you is getting away today.

396
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,269
Let me tell you.

397
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:51,539
For someone who's allergic to humans,

398
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:54,779
it's the same no matter where you die.

399
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,049
- Don't let him get away! - Get him!

400
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,019
Let's go.

401
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,289
Lu Sen!

402
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,259
Shan Shan!

403
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,869
Shan Shan, let's go!

404
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,410
Nobody moves!

405
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,650
You two poor lovebirds.

406
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:39,990
Do you think you two can really get away?

407
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,359
You think you're so smart.

408
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,990
Do you think everything will be fine once you catch me?

409
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:45,430
Don't be impulsive, okay?

410
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:54,869
Lu Sen.

411
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,369
Dad.

412
00:28:58,579 --> 00:28:59,839
Li Zhan, you're here.

413
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,349
Li Zhan.

414
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,650
Do you know what you're doing?

415
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:06,549
Hurry up and leave.

416
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,150
Go!

417
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:10,289
Are you out of your mind?

418
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,089
Dad.

419
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,359
Just let them go.

420
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:15,589
- Let him go? How can I... - Dad!

421
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,329
Dad, I've called the police.

422
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,829
Please stop.

423
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:28,569
Shan Shan, hang in there.

424
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,809
We'll be at the hospital soon.

425
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:31,809
If you take one more step today,

426
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,509
I'll die right here.

427
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,619
Dad.

428
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:46,160
If I have to turn my back on my friend...

429
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,920
to side with you,

430
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,829
then I have to use my own way to put an end to this.

431
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,299
I can take all the blame for you,

432
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,930
but I'll never be like you.

433
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:14,480
Shan Shan.

434
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:17,690
Shan Shan, wake up.

435
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,089
Shan Shan.

436
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,759
We're at the hospital, Shan Shan.
