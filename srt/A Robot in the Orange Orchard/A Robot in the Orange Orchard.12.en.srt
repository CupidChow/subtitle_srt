00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,840
(Episode 12: You've Opened Up Someone's Heart)

2
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,819
Wipe it off.

3
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,549
No, I'll make it dirty.

4
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,890
Just wash it then give it back.

5
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,830
The guys you just had dinner with...

6
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,469
are all powerful investors in the tech world.

7
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,039
What?

8
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,110
Lu Sen didn't give you enough money?

9
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,550
Dr. Fu.

10
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,550
You have to understand one thing.

11
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,849
I know all your secrets,

12
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,520
so that makes us friends, doesn't it?

13
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,930
I hope you won't hide anything from me.

14
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,000
Whatever happened between you and Lu Sen is not my business.

15
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,360
But if it's against the company's interest,

16
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,030
I will put a stop to it.

17
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:45,469
I'm not hiding anything from you.

18
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,110
You won't understand even if I tell you.

19
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,009
If I don't get it,

20
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,879
then maybe you're not expressing yourself well, Dr. Fu.

21
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,090
Friday has a duty.

22
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:08,330
I know Friday isn't perfect right now.

23
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,889
But not too far in the future,

24
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,759
Friday is going to help human beings...

25
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,330
fix their shortcomings,

26
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,330
and take mankind to a higher level.

27
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,770
She'll be a perfect companion robot.

28
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,840
Lu Sen kissed her.

29
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,879
Of course I know...

30
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,009
mankind will invest emotionally on Friday.

31
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,449
But there's no way...

32
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:34,889
I'll let Friday's future...

33
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,319
be destroyed for such shallow purposes.

34
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,189
I thought Lu Sen knew this.

35
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,599
I'm so disappointed.

36
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:31,009
Stop it!

37
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:36,980
Xiao Chen.

38
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,720
What did they do to you?

39
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,050
Mr. Lu.

40
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,089
It's broken.

41
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,290
We're fixing it.

42
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:48,959
Yes, we're working on it.

43
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,029
Friday, you talk to him.

44
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,000
He can give us the robot.

45
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,600
We're really good at this.

46
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,009
Don't worry.

47
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,310
Great.

48
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,449
Friday, you have to see this.

49
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,579
Xiao Chen is fine now.

50
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,480
Xiao Chen is making a face!

51
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,459
There was dust all over the brakes.

52
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,689
That's what caused the jam.

53
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,720
During the repair,

54
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,189
we modified it a little bit.

55
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,259
If it's too dusty, it'll make a sad face.

56
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:57,730
If it's normal, it'll smile.

57
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,100
You just have to pay attention.

58
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,129
Thank you.

59
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,800
It was nothing. You're welcome.

60
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,939
This robotic vacuum cleaner has been with him for a long time.

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,970
So look.

62
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,939
That's Lu Sen for you.

63
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,209
He would name all the appliances...

64
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,379
in his house...

65
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,439
as if they were his friends.

66
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,079
So you really think of robots as your friends?

67
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,319
Of course.

68
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,100
I see.

69
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:39,269
Do you want anything else? Anything to eat?

70
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,139
I have a lot to thank you for.

71
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,779
I'm kind of craving for kebab.

72
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,110
Beer and kebab would be better.

73
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,480
Sure. Coming right up.

74
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,779
Let me ask you.

75
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:22,209
If you go to Sagittarius now...

76
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:24,750
to pioneer the land for mankind,

77
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,050
but you can only bring one book,

78
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:28,850
which book do you choose?

79
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,120
The dictionary.

80
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:35,329
No matter how many books you bring, you'll finish them all,

81
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,230
but not the dictionary.

82
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,629
You can take out many words from it...

83
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,529
and make lots of stories.

84
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,100
Aren't I smart?

85
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,740
No...

86
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,709
If it were me, let me tell you.

87
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:53,240
I'll bring an encyclopedia on potato cultivation.

88
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,449
Why?

89
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:57,480
Because the topic I mentioned earlier...

90
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,149
was that you would be going to pioneer for mankind.

91
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,589
It's not like you're going to enjoy a spiritual world alone.

92
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,360
Am I right?

93
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,060
I see.

94
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:09,930
You're so smart.

95
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
I'll drink then.

96
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,129
No.

97
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,670
I have one more question.

98
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,310
Mr. Si gave you a lot of money.

99
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,209
Why didn't you accept it...

100
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,450
and persuade Fu Yang not to leave?

101
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,860
Because the professor has made a decision.

102
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,360
You trust him so much.

103
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,629
What if he decides to stay?

104
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:48,399
Then we'll stay.

105
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,769
You must trust him a lot.

106
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,279
"A hero dies for his soul mate."

107
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:01,879
You know what?

108
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,049
When we were nothing,

109
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,490
Dr. Fu trusted us.

110
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,460
He believed we could make...

111
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,090
the greatest robot in the world.

112
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,830
One who doesn't trust,

113
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,100
will not be trusted.

114
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,429
He believed us first.

115
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,600
We're doing the same for him.

116
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:28,840
It's that simple.

117
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:33,580
"One who doesn't trust,"

118
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:38,320
"will not be trusted."

119
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,120
What are you saying?

120
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,590
Do you have chicken wings?

121
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,590
Find me one.

122
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:45,960
You can't eat the wings.

123
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:49,330
If you eat chicken wings, you'll fly away.

124
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,429
Friday.

125
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,730
You can't eat the wings.

126
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,370
Or you'll fly away.

127
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:21,659
Lu Sen, be careful.

128
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,730
We're almost there.

129
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,289
Friday.

130
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,429
Don't leave me.

131
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:10,169
Friday.

132
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,720
Lu Sen.

133
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,659
I don't want to leave you either.

134
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:36,889
I'll pick up the car another day.

135
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,799
You're a lightweight.

136
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,970
Think carefully about terminating the contract with Lu Sen.

137
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,769
Hello, Fu Yang speaking.

138
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:27,409
Yes, you can test it in advance.

139
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,379
Tomorrow will be fine.

140
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,750
Okay, I'll call you.

141
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,419
Yes, sir.

142
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,690
You're back?

143
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,519
So soon?

144
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,860
We...

145
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,889
We went out for a walk.

146
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,730
We'll be back soon.

147
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,799
Okay, see you later.

148
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,429
Look.

149
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,769
We'll say...

150
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,769
we went out for a walk.

151
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,970
We can't let Dr. Fu know...

152
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,740
that we had a fun and wonderful evening...

153
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:29,139
at Lu Sen's place.

154
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,039
Okay?

155
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:32,879
What should I say then?

156
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,580
You...

157
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,980
Say you didn't come yesterday.

158
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:38,679
You only came to get your stuff this morning.

159
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,220
Okay. Let's go.

160
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:47,360
Friday.

161
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:50,860
Friday.

162
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,539
Da Yun.

163
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,940
Li Cha De.

164
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,779
Pai Song...

165
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,570
Why are you here as well?

166
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,440
You know...

167
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,769
I went to pack my things.

168
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Yes, that's right.

169
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,279
They told you about this?

170
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,019
I have good news.

171
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,090
There's an investor for Friday.

172
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:49,789
If the audition goes well,

173
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,919
they'll sign the contract for 30 million yuan.

174
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,889
I would like to bring Friday in tomorrow.

175
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,289
So soon?

176
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,429
But we can't do a perfect audition right now.

177
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,429
Why don't we perform a test on her first?

178
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,370
We don't have time.

179
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,799
Finding an investor that's willing to spend so much money...

180
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,539
is not easy.

181
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,470
Friday only has mild coordination problems.

182
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,210
Everything else is running smoothly.

183
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,639
We can use a wheelchair.

184
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,580
I'll explain the rest.

185
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:18,480
Let's get to work then.

186
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,190
Mr. Lu.

187
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,299
I've found out more about...

188
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,200
Dr. Fu's time in England.

189
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,100
In 2013,

190
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,769
when Dr. Fu worked at a London lab in England,

191
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,899
he used a computer IP provided by the lab...

192
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,210
to work on his research.

193
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:42,740
When they turned on the computer,

194
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,039
the monitor showed, "Secure data transmitting".

195
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:46,580
Dr. Fu was believed to be...

196
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,580
leaking confidential information.

197
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:50,179
On top of that, he was dealing with...

198
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,220
very important clients...

199
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,649
and the superiors of the lab.

200
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,820
Dr. Fu was fired from the lab.

201
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,960
It left a stain on his moral reputation.

202
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,960
It should be noted that...

203
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:01,889
he used to teach at a school...

204
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,529
where Ms. Kang Li Er went.

205
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,500
I see.

206
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,640
Li Er.

207
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,670
When you were studying in England,

208
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:16,170
did you know someone called Fu Yang?

209
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,309
A little.

210
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,009
As far as you know,

211
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,109
what kind of person is he?

212
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,680
Before prying into other people's business,

213
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,349
I need to understand your intentions first.

214
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,619
The Xiao Xing you came to know...

215
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,859
is actually a robot.

216
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,660
To me, she is actually very special.

217
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,730
I couldn't help but kiss her on the forehead.

218
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,730
But Fu Yang misunderstood me.

219
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,569
No matter how much I apologized, he wouldn't change his mind.

220
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,369
Isn't he too stingy?

221
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,470
When I was studying in England,

222
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,410
Fu Yang was a professor there.

223
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:55,210
He's known to be old-fashioned and stubborn.

224
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,349
Everyone else was working on industrial robots.

225
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,579
Only he worked tirelessly...

226
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,079
to make humanoid robots.

227
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,049
You should know that based on estimates,

228
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,450
humanoid robots would take...

229
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,119
at least 50 years to complete.

230
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:06,519
No one...

231
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:07,930
wanted to waste a lifetime of scientific research,

232
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,730
except for him.

233
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,160
I didn't expect that...

234
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,759
he could've made one so quickly.

235
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:13,529
Lu Sen.

236
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,000
You picked up a genius.

237
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,599
Why did they fire a genius...

238
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,799
for a little mistake?

239
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,369
I guess you've found out...

240
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,970
he was fired for a character flaw.

241
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,180
But this is yet to be proven.

242
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:26,940
Given Fu Yang's capability at that time,

243
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:28,779
he wouldn't use a transmission to leak information.

244
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:29,980
He wasn't that stupid.

245
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,650
This is an insult to scientists.

246
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,549
And based on estimates,

247
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,990
humanoid robots would take too long to make profits.

248
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,019
Perhaps the investors and the lab superiors...

249
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:41,119
made a backroom deal?

250
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,259
No one knows for sure.

251
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,559
Fu Yang's project was killed.

252
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:45,829
The corresponding funds...

253
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,630
were transferred to other projects.

254
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:48,900
I think...

255
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,140
he is a man who dedicates everything to science.

256
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,509
A scientist who dedicates his time for a robot...

257
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:56,339
wouldn't do anything bad.

258
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,309
But I don't want to affect your judgment.

259
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:01,650
However, Fu Yang...

260
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,910
should be worthy of your scrutiny.

261
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,279
Okay.

262
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,349
But you kissed the robot.

263
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,390
What happened after that?

264
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,990
What do you mean?

265
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,559
She's a machine.

266
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:17,690
Just like Xiao Chen. Just like Max.

267
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,200
Okay, fine. It's just a robot.

268
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,099
I'm hanging up.

269
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,880
Why are you staring at me?

270
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,819
You look pretty.

271
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,220
I kept telling myself...

272
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,660
not to look at you.

273
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,759
But I still want to.

274
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,200
I just want to look at you.

275
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:06,809
May I come in?

276
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,819
Dr. Fu.

277
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,079
I want to talk to you.

278
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
Let's talk outside.

279
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,970
What are we doing here?

280
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:35,210
It won't take long.

281
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,609
That's not necessary.

282
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,079
We're leaving soon anyway.

283
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,009
I've never brought anyone in here.

284
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,819
But there's something...

285
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,890
I need to say to you inside.

286
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,069
Shan Shan, come.

287
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:29,789
Can you see well?

288
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,529
Just vaguely.

289
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,299
How could the boss enter this mysterious place?

290
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,069
What's over there?

291
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:44,569
It contains Lu Sen's most precious things.

292
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,990
I'm sorry for all the damage...

293
00:21:59,059 --> 00:21:59,920
I've caused you.

294
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,990
I'll transfer the penalty as soon as possible.

295
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,230
I knew what happened...

296
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,200
when you were in England.

297
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
What's your point?

298
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,470
Okay.

299
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:17,869
It doesn't matter how you knew about my past,

300
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,680
or what you think of me.

301
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:21,650
What's important is the present.

302
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,650
My decision at the moment is that...

303
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,920
I can't work with you anymore.

304
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:26,950
I'm sorry.

305
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,880
Hold on.

306
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,549
In this day and age,

307
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,319
people trust data more than humans.

308
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:35,059
To be more precise,

309
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,390
people prefer to believe...

310
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,630
what they see with their eyes and not what they feel.

311
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,900
Let's say Siri makes an error.

312
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,230
People will just reboot it.

313
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,970
But if a person is misunderstood,

314
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,740
people refuse to give him a chance to explain.

315
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:53,579
Compared to humans,

316
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:56,309
they are more tolerant with software.

317
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,650
So what?

318
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:03,920
Dr. Fu.

319
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,390
No matter which investor you meet,

320
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,059
they'll prefer to believe in news and data.

321
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,400
They'll use your past to judge you...

322
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:15,200
without knowing the real you,

323
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,799
nor what kind of existence...

324
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,799
Friday represents.

325
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,569
But I'm not one of them anymore.

326
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:25,839
Fu Yang.

327
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,049
A man who sees Friday as his aspiration...

328
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,009
is incapable...

329
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,519
of doing things like leaking information.

330
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:42,490
If you want to stay,

331
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:44,829
I'll hire the best design team...

332
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,559
in the name of IMU...

333
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,970
to help you perfect Friday's design.

334
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:51,230
I will make you and IMU...

335
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,839
a miracle in the history of science.

336
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,069
So...

337
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,769
You understand it all.

338
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:58,839
You know it all.

339
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,609
You know what Friday is to Alpha and the world.

340
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,650
So why?

341
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,690
Why?

342
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,200
No matter what, thank you for trusting us.

343
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,700
But I can't trust you right now.

344
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,829
I mean it.

345
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,940
This is the end of our partnership.

346
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:27,140
Li Cha De said this.

347
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,470
Someone who doesn't believe in others...

348
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,809
won't be able to gain anyone's trust.

349
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,809
Fu Yang.

350
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,420
If I tell you everything,

351
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,190
will you trust me again?

352
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:52,930
What are you doing?

353
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:55,930
Let go.

354
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:05,039
I'll die without Friday.

355
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:06,880
She's my friend.

356
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,509
She's also my cure.

357
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,420
Did someone kneel down?

358
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,890
Is Lu Sen kneeling in front of our boss...

359
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,150
just for us to stay?

360
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,490
I didn't know kissing robots is forbidden.

361
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,900
If what I did hurt you,

362
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:30,000
then I'm sorry.

363
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,799
I'm calling an ambulance.

364
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,440
There's no need.

365
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,289
Have some water.

366
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:10,869
What's going on?

367
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:19,049
Some people are allergic to sunlight.

368
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:21,349
Some are allergic to sports.

369
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,690
Some are allergic to cell phones.

370
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,190
Some are allergic to water.

371
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,759
And my allergy,

372
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:35,329
is human beings.

373
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:39,470
Since I was 12,

374
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,240
I developed a phobia of physical contact.

375
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,109
I've tried everything...

376
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,240
and all kinds of anti-allergy medication.

377
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,480
Nothing could fix me.

378
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:57,650
But Friday came.

379
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,890
As soon as she got here,

380
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,529
I started to show signs of recovering.

381
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:08,569
It's as if when I look at her,

382
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,599
I heal on my own.

383
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:13,940
My doctors...

384
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:16,569
couldn't explain this phenomenon.

385
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,309
Friday allowed me...

386
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,109
to regain contact with mankind and the world.

387
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,049
Without her,

388
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:31,019
I could die at any moment.

389
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,589
About this...

390
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:37,829
Who else knows?

391
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,559
My doctor,

392
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:43,299
housekeeper,

393
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:45,240
Friday,

394
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:50,670
and now you.

395
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,650
My parents left when I was 12.

396
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,589
At the same time,

397
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,289
my ability to touch humans left with them too.

398
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,460
The only thing that watched me grow up...

399
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:14,630
is this orange tree.

400
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,480
I know I've done a lot of things you can't accept.

401
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,650
It's like how I have an umbrella all the time.

402
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,619
It's not about being gentleman-like.

403
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:38,859
It's for protecting myself.

404
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,589
I shut people out...

405
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:43,890
because a simple touch...

406
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,559
will suffocate me.

407
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,470
I'd gotten used to it.

408
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:54,740
But Friday showed up.

409
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:56,269
It was you.

410
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:00,640
The robot you built saved me.

411
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,009
When I look at her,

412
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,609
I feel like I can recover on my own.

413
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,519
It's such a great thing.

414
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,319
So I sincerely hope that you,

415
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:15,259
your team,

416
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,289
and Friday,

417
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,130
can all stay.

418
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,660
He's coming out.

419
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,410
Sir...

420
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,250
Is everything okay?

421
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,890
Let's go.

422
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,519
Bye.

423
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,099
Mr. Lu.

424
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,000
Are you okay?

425
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:34,740
I showed him all the sincerity...

426
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,640
I had in my body.

427
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:16,410
The professor has been sitting there for three hours.

428
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,880
I feel like we're really leaving.

429
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:21,680
If he's really leaving,

430
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,009
I'll pick a fight with him.

431
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:51,710
Let's pack up, guys.
