33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,799
Didn't you tell me to not come down?

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,309
I'm so going to come down.

35
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,719
Didn't you tell me to clean?

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,359
I'm so not going to clean.

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,589
You don't know what kind of person you are,
right?

38
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,589
Come on, I'll tell you.

39
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,310
You are

40
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,629
an unscrupulous capitalist

41
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,549
who ruins other people's dreams
with just a casual sentence.

42
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,759
You are a fool who can't tell the difference

43
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,229
between a human and a robot.

44

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,189
Friday, how can you...?

48
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,269
Low battery.

49
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,160
Goodbye, Master.

50
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,830
Come over right now.

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,799
Do I have a Husky?

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,909
This Friday seems to be
listening to me and does as I say,

53
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,630
but actually...

54
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:26,750
She does whatever

55
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,629
she wants to do.

56
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,829
And makes things end up
with the worst results possible.

57
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,720
This is simply...

58
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:32,800
- world's number one.
- World's number one.

59
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,270
You seem to understand how I feel.

60
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,000
I've had the experience.

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,359
It can be said that death would be better.

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,669
I'm the one who wishes I could be dead, alright?

63
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,080
My house is going to be demolished.

64
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,319
Don't think that you don't have to
take responsibility

65
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
because you pretend to feel the same way.

66
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,320
Then...

67
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,520
why did the gentle Friday

68
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,749
that everyone loves
become so despicable

69
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,800
after arriving at your place?

70
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,549
So it's my problem now?

71
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,270
Not necessarily.

72
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,440
The problem lies with that
unpredictable Husky after all.

73
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,270
I'm so hungry.

74
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,599
Fighting a battle of wits and guts
against Lu Sen every day

75
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,760
is too hard.

76
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,199
I saw prawns today.

77
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,510
I have to eat some

78
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,550
seafood-flavored instant noodles later.

79
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,160
I want to throw up
when you mention instant noodles.

80
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,039
Why?

81
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,439
That guy can eat so much
delicious food at the villa.

82
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,720
We can only eat instant noodles.

83
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,509
This is what we've got here.

84
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,070
The robots are still in the debugging stage.

85
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,479
Although we received the deposit,

86
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,920
we still have to improve Friday.

87
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,270
Otherwise, we won't get the rest of the money.

88
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,639
We couldn't even pay
the electricity bill a while ago.

89
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,600
Things are okay right now.

90
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,829
Occasionally, the butler next door

91
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,440
gives us something to eat.

92
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,600
Do you want to have a hot pot?

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,110
Sometimes, she doesn't
understand commands at all.

94
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,669
Firstly,
when perfume and her master were both in danger,

95
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,039
she saved the perfume.

96
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,159
I told her to prioritize "protecting the master",

97
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,200
she started talking to me about physics.

98
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,069
Can't she communicate emotionally?

99
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,320
Why can't I
communicate with her?

100
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,549
I think there must be something majorly wrong

101
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,110
with Friday's thinking programming.

102
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,390
Mr. Lu!

103
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,229
Did you get infected by that Husky?

104
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,040
Or does she take after you?

105
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,509
We should have a thorough
discussion about optimization.

106
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,950
Your experience is very valuable.

107
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,719
All I want is an obedient,

108
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,599
highly efficient, highly aesthetic

109
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,039
Robot Butler whose temperament

110
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,110
is highly consistent with mine,

111
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,439
not a Robot Husky.

112
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,199
The current Friday does not
live up to my standards at all,

113
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,829
let alone put it on the market.

114
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,070
That makes perfect sense.

115
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Keep going.

116
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,719
Why did he throw away such good food?

117
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,109
This guy only eats foods
that have been produced on the day of.

118
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,790
He'd throw them away even if they haven't expired.

119
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,949
When we were making the robot,

120
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,950
we set up an initial personality for her.

121
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,639
And this initial personality

122
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,199
is very close to your description, Mr. Lu.

123
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,550
But Friday is different.

124
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,270
Friday

125
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,319
has the ability to learn.

126
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,599
That is to say that Friday
makes self-adjustments based on

127
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
your emotional feedback.

128
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,159
If Friday

129
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,480
has deviated too much
from her original personality,

130
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,320
then

131
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,550
you should think
about whether you have

132
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,270
inputted inappropriate content, Mr. Lu.

133
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,109
So it came back to me again.

134
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,270
I'm trying to solve the problem.

135
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,480
But I didn't teach her to demolish the house.

136
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,160
Wait.

137
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,549
Friday.

138
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,639
What do you see?

139
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,109
The dog is saving a person.

140
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,670
Yes.

141
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,439
I'm that person,
and you are that dog.

142
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,999
When we run into danger,

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,440
you have to save me like
how that dog saved its owner.

144
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,110
I showed her a movie about dogs.

145
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,039
But I asked her to learn from their cleverness,

146
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,200
not their naughtiness.

147
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,600
What do I do now?

148
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,600
Hold on.

149
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,640
What are you doing?

150
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,200
Hot pot with wine, a match made in heaven.

151
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,550
I think we can adjust

152
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,480
the input method.

153
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,830
For example, you can treat her more gently.

154
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,999
Like how you would treat a real dog.

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,830
You can also...

156
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,110
I'll try it tomorrow.

157
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,040
I haven't finished.

158
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,949
I've already got it.

159
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,760
No, you haven't.

160
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:21,829
Establish a relationship.

161
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,510
Establish a relationship
Relationship.

162
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,600
Emotional communication.

163
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,760
Didn't you say "input" before?

164
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,879
Input is a method,
while "relationship"

165
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,840
is what we want to achieve.

166
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,230
When you are inputting content,

167
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,840
you have to input your emotions too.

168
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,439
This way, Friday will provide you

Make more physical contact with your pet

213
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,669
to increase your pet's
dependence on you, the owner,

214
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,710
and the pet will naturally become docile.

215
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,959
I've never felt this way before.

216
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,109
It feels kind of heart-warming.

217
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,109
Take your pet out for more outdoor activities

218

and establish a playmate relationship with it

219

in a relaxed and natural environment.

No.

Not many people know where Lu Sen lives.

If I just send it like this,

it'd seem like I've been to his place

and I might leave a trace.

244
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,110
Return the necklace to me.

245
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:24,029
Did you see it? I asked you for your address.

246

00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,299
"All things fall and are built again.

338
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,210
And those that build them again are gay."

339
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,899
"All things fall and are built again.

340
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,660
And those that build them again are gay."

341
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,129
Correct.

342
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,610
Your reward

343
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,780
is to rebuild this castle gayly.

344
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,660
You have one month.

345
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,059
But didn't it take you fifteen years?

346
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,849
But aren't you the best robot ever?

347
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,490
But...

348
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,660
But...

349
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,250
But...

350
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,730
It'll block the sunlight once it's built.

351
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,299
Then let's change the shape.

352
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,020
I'll have Fu Yang input it for you.

353
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,660
Any other questions?

354
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,330
No.

355
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,539
Good Friday.

356
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,730
As long as you can correct your mistakes.

357
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,969
You still look conscience-stricken.

358
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,730
Then you'll be in charge

359
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,060
of all the housework today.

360
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,490
Starting with breakfast.

361
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,850
You're not going to wash your hands?

362
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,539
Robots also need to wash their hands?

363
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,780
You can get wet, right?

364
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,450
Wait.

365
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,059
It looks pretty cute.

366
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,660
Try it.

367
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,020
I didn't like having breakfast,

368
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,130
so my mom would make this for me.

369
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,180
After so many years,

370
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,610
this is the first time someone has made it for me.

371
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,250
My gosh.

372
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,369
Is there poison gas in here?

373
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,060
How is it?

374
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,540
It tastes pretty good.

375
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,020
Really?

376
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,449
I need to compliment her.

377
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,450
Encouraging education.

378
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,699
It really is delicious.

379
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,659
I'm obviously very talented in cooking.

380
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,249
But my aunt complained that even pigs

381
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,420
wouldn't eat what I make.

382
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,300
Someone, help me.

383
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,540
Mr. Lu, it's me.

384
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,299
I'm going upstairs to get changed.

385
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,210
Make two cups of tea.

386
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,130
Okay.

387
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,450
Delicious?

388
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,060
I didn't think I could cook.

389
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,059
Mr. Lu.

390
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,539
The Edge-N plan
is currently on hold.

391
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,130
Mr. Li Junior is working
to fix the security bug.

392
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,970
How about the Youth Creativity Competition?

393
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,179
After the announcement of the cancellation

394
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,609
of the final round
of the Youth Creativity Competition,

395
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,900
some contestants do feel dissatisfied.

396
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,249
As per your orders,
after discussions with colleagues

397
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,899
in the marketing and legal departments,

398
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,019
I've come up with
a set of relatively complete plans.

399
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,370
There shouldn't be any significant impact
on the company.

400
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,780
Don't implement it yet.

401
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,020
Are there any shortcomings in the plan?

402
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,370
No.

403
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,450
I was just thinking,

404
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,089
between human judgment

405
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,659
and the conclusion based on machine analysis,

406
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,020
which is more accurate?

407
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,210
Of course, there should be
no problems with my decisions.

408
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,580
Only, Friday questioned it.

409
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,940
And that pissed me off a little.

410
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,249
My suit.

411
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,330
Are you blind?

412
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,539
Isn't that the man that I
spilled coffee on yesterday?

413
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,130
He is Lu Sen's subordinate.

414
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,019
Yang Shanshan.

415
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,940
Some luck you have.

416
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,540
Thank you.

417
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,130
Friday.

418
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,700
What's wrong with your hair?

419
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,700
I... I didn't notice.

420
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,540
Since you're here,
let me officially introduce you.

421
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,449
This is the project you will be working on next.

422
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,969
She is an AI robot developed
by Fu Yang and his team,

423
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,700
Friday.

424
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,580
So this is Friday.

425
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,539
She can work and
communicate like a human?

426
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,059
Friday is great, okay?

427
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,700
Friday.

428
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,019
This is my private secretary.

429
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,820
Get to know him.

430
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,489
Mr. Si.

431
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:32,250
Si Jiali, 26 years old,
Master's special assistant.

432
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,490
"Jiali" as in "to start and family
and establish a name for oneself".

433
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,940
Mr. Lu needn't worry about my name.

434
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,020
Same with Friday.

435
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,490
Where are you going?

436
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,900
Have you found the person who stole my necklace?

437
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,849
Still searching.

438
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,539
Because phone privacy is under protection,

439
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,369
I'm still unable to get
information on the account holder.

440
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,299
I'm searching through other channels.

441
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,539
The statement of charges has been drawn up.

442
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,209
Once the person is found,
I believe we can get her

443
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,180
one to two years in prison.

444
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,939
Keep an eye on her.

445
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,059
What are you searching for?

446
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,849
Didn't I say I'll send it to you?

447
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,059
Stupid secretary.

448
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,369
Did I steal gold or silver?

449
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,899
Sentencing me to one to two years?

450
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,850
Also, just a reminder

451
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:17,060
that you need to join the meeting this afternoon.

452
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,849
Got it.

453
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:19,940
You may go.

454
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,060
Before that...

455
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:23,970
Friday.

456
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,019
It's nice to meet you.

457
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,700
I look forward to meeting you again.

458
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,020
Goodbye.

459
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,130
Robots really are strong.

460
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,150
[Lu's Residence]

461
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,900
Take photos.

462
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,249
Did you get the shot?

463
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:13,900
Yes.

464
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,330
Hey.

465
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,129
Is this Lu Sen

466
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,419
really going to help us become
the top entertainment reporter?

467
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,330
Definitely.

468
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,129
Look.

469
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,819
He rarely leaves his house,

470
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,539
plus that weird umbrella and injection.

471
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,370
With my years of investigative experience,

472
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,090
there must be an unspeakable secret.

473
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,330
Where did your years
of investigative experience come from?

474
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,130
The experience of pouring tea and water.

475
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,820
You forgot what I used to do?

476
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,419
So many people come in and out of the teahouse
every day.

477
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,610
Each one of them is harder to serve.

478
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,020
Besides,

479
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,580
I've found someone
who can help us.

480
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,450
Just wait.

481
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,130
Friday.

482
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,089
You looked really scary just now.

483
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,209
Input this.

484
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,490
Pay attention to your appearance in the future.

485
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:04,700
Also,

486
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,450
help me analyze

487
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:10,250
what kind of person is Mr. Si.

488
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,089
He is a cold, ruthless person

489
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,490
who likes to make poor suggestions.

490
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,300
Really?

491
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,250
It seems that even though he has been
by my side for so many years,

492
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,020
I never really got to know him.

493
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,579
He's not that bad.

494
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,130
Not important.

495
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,420
As long as he can work hard

496
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,729
when I pay him.

497
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,330
I wouldn't trust anyone anyway.

498
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,129
If you let him work for you,
why don't you trust him?

499
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,130
Because trust means deception.

500
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:46,940
Who's there?

501
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,299
Let me see. Who's there?

502
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,300
Who dares to deceive our famous Mr. Lu?

503
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,250
I don't see anyone.

504
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,450
You really are pretty interesting.

505
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,699
Look, it's so great when you smile like that.

506
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,820
You should smile more.

507
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,539
I can only smile more in front of you.

508
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,180
Why?

509
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:05,330
Because you are not human.

510
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,850
Because I want to look more intimidating.

511
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,780
I don't want others to look down on me.

512
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,729
Whenever someone dares to
underestimate you in the future,

513
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,779
come find me.

514
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,580
My arm can throw him
from here to over there.

515
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,699
This mode of yours is really interesting.

516
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,129
Let's make "friend mode" the default from now on.

517
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:31,730
Okay.

518
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,129
Go back and get charged.

519
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,660
I'll notify you of the time tomorrow.

520
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,489
Lu Sen.

521
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,540
There are no outsiders today.

522
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,940
Let's speak openly and honestly.

523
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:59,540
You also think that Edge-N is a good project,
right?

524
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,330
If you consider nothing good to be a good thing.

525
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,730
I don't want to argue with you today.

526
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,729
Can we let go of our personal prejudices

527
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,089
and only talk about the interests of the company?

528
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:14,249
So you asked to hold an
emergency video conference

529
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,660
just to talk to me about this?

530
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,180
Of course not.

531
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,700
Our last proposal

532
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,369
was indeed incomplete.

533
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,090
This time, I've added in everything.

534
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,780
I'll send it to you.

535
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,539
Mr. Lu.

536
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,909
Please take a good look this time.

537
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,920
[Edge-N Plan]

538
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,370
What did you change?

539
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,970
You just gave it a more beautiful look.

540
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,579
If I were prejudiced against you,

541
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,019
your project would've been scrapped long ago,

542
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,130
instead of getting further developed.

543
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,059
Lu Sen.

544
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,849
Mind your words.

545
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,819
At least,
I brought forth my Edge-N honestly,

546
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,019
instead of doing something shady

547
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,489
with others behind the company's back.

548
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,130
You know what I mean.

549
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,540
Li Zhan.

550
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,019
Don't pay too much attention to me.

551
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,454
I'll misunderstand.

552
00:31:01,455 --> 00:31:03,305
I'm paying attention to you.

553
00:31:04,215 --> 00:31:07,024
I'm paying attention
to you for your sake

554
00:31:07,025 --> 00:31:08,334
and for our company's sake.

555
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:08,855
Lu Sen...

556
00:31:11,735 --> 00:31:13,065
What the heck...

557
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,970
What did Li Zhan find out?

558
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,699
Whenever someone dares to
underestimate you in the future,

559
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,779
come find me.

560
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,540
My arm can throw him
from here to over there.

561
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,900
What's going on?

562
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:07,300
When I think of Friday,
those troubles seem to be gone.

563
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,820
Friday.

564
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,300
The sun is shining today.

565
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,300
Let's go hiking.

566
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:29,940
See you at the top of the mountain.

567
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,880
It'll block the sunlight once it's built.

568
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,730
Looking at it this way,

569
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,570
I really get this feeling

570
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,240
of suddenly seeing the light.
