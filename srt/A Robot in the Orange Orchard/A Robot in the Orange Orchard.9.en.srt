33
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,152
Li'er.

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,720
This suit looks good too.

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,870
Xing chose it for you, right?

36
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,612
So it seems that Fri...

37
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,270
Xing's taste isn't bad.

38
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,192
Have a seat.

39
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,470
So far away?

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,997
I think it's fine.

41
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,765
It's raining.

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,968
The rain turned many days
into unforgettable memories.

43
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,810
Yeah.

44
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,236
So we should cherish those
who gave us umbrellas in the rain.

45
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,720
Do you remember when we
were young, You, Li Zhan, and I

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,024
went out to sea together?

47
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,876
It also rained heavily that day.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I hid Li Zhan's sea fishing rod.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,822
He started crying
when he couldn't find his fishing rod.

50
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,982
I asked him

51
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,270
why he cried when he couldn't find the fishing rod?

52
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,436
He said

53
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,110
because that was Lu Sen's birthday present to him,

54
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,140
he couldn't lose it.

55
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,840
Can you tell me what
really happened to you guys?

56
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,990
I've forgotten about the past.

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,152
Just

58
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,373
think of me as an indifferent person.

59
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,670
Be careful on your way back.

60
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,937
Drive safe.

61
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,968
Thank you for your crayfish.

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,090
Bye, Xing.

63
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,650
Bye-bye.

64
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,070
It's finally over.

65
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,510
I'm exhausted.

66
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,814
Yes, exhausted.

67
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,550
But you're really great at
pretending to be human, Friday.

68
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,230
Even Li'er couldn't tell you are a robot.

69
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,094
Not bad.

70
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,904
Let's go.

71
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,270
Shanshan told me that Lu Sen's
first girlfriend came back today.

72
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,459
Concentrate on your own business.

73
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,480
Don't pay attention to other people's gossip.

74
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,323
We just need to pay attention

75
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,819
to our robot.

76
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,760
His first girlfriend is pretty.

77
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,830
Her skin is so good.

78
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,040
Right?

79
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,270
There are twenty steps to
my daily skincare routine.

80
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,390
You're quite something.

81
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,326
Twenty...

82
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,323
Sir, we have a guest.

83
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,352
It's you again.

84
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,054
I told you we're not open to visitors.

85
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,688
Please leave.

86
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,288
I know about your
fake robot secret.

87
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,729
Dr. Fu.

88
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,616
Lu Sen's first love?

89
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,600
You misunderstood.

90
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,270
He and I are just good friends.

91
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,321
However,

92
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,344
shouldn't you confess
to his good friend?

93
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,760
So, your main point is...?

94
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,640
Who is the girl pretending to be a robot?

95
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,685
Oh no.

96
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,077
I think we should prepare to sell
our kidneys to pay back the money.

97
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,110
Are you acknowledging it?

98
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,428
Tricking my friend with a real person.

99
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,790
You came here
alone without Lu Sen.

100
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,409
This means

101
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,060
you haven't told Lu Sen.

102
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,070
Very clever, Dr. Fu.

103
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,320
I'm here today to confirm whether
my friend bought an outstanding

104
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,494
high-tech product.

105
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,160
You more or less know
what my good friend is like.

106
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,760
If he were to find out about
the secret, the consequences...

107
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,430
Your point is...?

108
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,810
Let me take a closer look at your robot.

109
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,337
Hi, Friday.

110
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,200
Hello, Doctor.

111
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,483
How can I help you?

112
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,600
Friday.

113
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,387
I will also cherish you who gave me an umbrella.

114
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,950
Really?

115
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,326
You will cherish the umbrella I gave you?

116
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,288
There is something wrong with your logic.

117
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,384
Listen to a song.

118
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,440
Alex.

119
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,938
Play music.

120
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,078
This is how it is.

121
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,197
We had no choice but to ask Yang Shanshan

122
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,153
to pretend to be Friday.

123
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,320
The reason Lu Sen signed the contract with you

124
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,640
is because he thinks Friday
is a robot that will bring

125
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,541
a new future to IMU.

126
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,030
I do, too.

127
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,636
I hope Friday really can.

128
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,069
I believe Lu Sen wouldn't be wrong about a person.

129
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,857
Neither would I.

130
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,286
So...

131
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,276
You've agreed to
keep our secret?

132
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,320
From now on, I hope
you'll be prepared

133
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,030
to be checked by me at any time.

134
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,030
I'll come by often.

135
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,640
I need to supervise you
on behalf of my good friend

136
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,590
to make sure that his interests

137
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,196
and IMU's interests would not be damaged.

138
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,893
Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't
be able to keep this secret.

139
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,059
Okay.

140
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,200
This is it for today.

141
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,467
Good night, everyone.

142
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,416
Why do I feel like we've
attached another timed bomb?

143
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,320
Is she really not going to tell on us?

144
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,682
Isn't she Lu Sen's first love?

145
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,760
She's so pretty.

146
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,550
I think she should be the type of person
who keeps her word.

147
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,520
Pretty?

148
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,960
Does being pretty conflict with lies?

149
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,030
Being pretty and lies
are often entangled.

150
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,470
Hearing you say that, why
do I feel like you're jealous?

151
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,960
How am I jealous?

152
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Humanity is the most uncontrollable aspect.

153
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,590
Even robots have a 1.3% chance
of accidentally telling the truth.

154
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,470
If she... I won't let her.

155
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,200
Sir, what do you want to do?

156
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,222
I want

157
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,426
to keep thinking about it.

158
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,590
It's time.

159
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,318
Bring Shanshan back.

160
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,982
What do you think?

161
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,432
Friday?

162
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,029
Are you out of battery?

163
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,004
Friday.

164
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,234
Thank you for coming.

165
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,256
(We got Friday back.)

166
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,200
Shanshan.

167
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,280
I'll help you take the wig off.

168
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,800
I'll leave it be, I'm too tired.

169
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,880
I saw red marks on your body.

170
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,651
Let me help you put on some ointment.

171
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,427
Shanshan?

172
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,421
Did you see the way he looked at Shanshan?

173
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,334
Does he have feelings for Shanshan?

174
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,840
How is that possible?

175
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,670
In his eyes, Shanshan
is the robot Friday.

176
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,200
He could have feelings for a robot.

177
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,640
It doesn't matter if he really does.

178
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,440
After all, love knows no bounds.

179
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,320
Look.

180
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,840
Don't we love Mini
C and Friday too?

181
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,670
Forget it. You're too young to understand.

182
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,700
We're not talking about the same thing.

183
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,446
Friday is an emotional companion robot.

184
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,880
She's not just limited to romantic love.

185
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,710
She was developed for a greater, more complex,

186
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,760
more comprehensive emotional companionship.

187
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,710
Right.

188
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,280
But Boss, the more
human-like a robot is,

189
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,320
the harder it is for people
to distinguish emotional boundaries,

190
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,242
right?

191
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,030
Not to mention that he is dealing
with a real person, to begin with.

192
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,564
He can't control himself either.

193
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,400
I think you should stop
thinking about this nonsense.

194
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,520
Lu Sen is emotionally
unstable, but

195
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,962
he is a professional
artificial intelligence expert.

196
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,230
The parts will be here soon.

197
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,801
We'll start
the software and hardware tests tomorrow.

198
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,488
IMU, change channels.

199
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,899
IMU, change channels.

200
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,150
IMU, shut down.

201
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,269
(What's happening to this world?)

202
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,960
(Why do people need to be in relationships?)

203
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,880
(Why do people need to kiss?)

204
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,790
(Why is the TV)

205
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,840
(showing me, someone who will never get married, )

206
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,338
(this kind of content?)

207
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,760
What happened to our IMU TV?

208
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,589
How can it be so unintelligent?

209
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,832
I think you need a girlfriend.

210
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,531
You...

211
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,563
What is a girlfriend?

212
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,626
I don't need a girlfriend at all.

213
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,040
Right, Dusty?

214
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,790
Right, Max?

215
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,960
Sorry, Master.

216
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,918
I didn't hear what you said clearly.

217
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,414
Vectra.

218
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,170
What's happening to me?

219
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,416
I think I'm becoming really strange.

220
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,562
It feels like grass is growing in my heart.

221
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,867
It's as if I'm looking
forward to something, but.

222
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,124
I don't know what I'm looking forward to.

223
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,312
It'd be great

224
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,213
if I can talk to Friday right now.

225
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,834
Vectra.

226
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,930
It would be great if I can
charge Friday at any time.

227
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,693
This way,

228
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,442
she can always stay by my side.

229
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,042
Vectra. Look.

230
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,167
The moon is so round.

231
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,020
Any new progress?

232
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,942
Yes.

233
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:35,226
Recently, we've been keeping a
close watch, not daring to slack off.

234
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,180
My big brother never slacks off.

235
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,620
How is the situation?

236
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,940
After dozens of hours
of following and shooting,

237
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,940
we've got the full itinerary.

238
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
Second brother.

239
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,905
Photos.

240
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,940
Only the three of us are in this gym.

241
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,071
You two really don't have to do it this way.

242
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,780
If we want to succeed,
details are important.

243
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,545
My big brother always pays attention to details.

244
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,724
Details?

245
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,940
Look at the photos you took.

246
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,380
Where is he?

247
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,330
Look.

248
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,743
Here, and here.

249
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,130
Can you tell who this is?

250
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:40,893
Yes.

251
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,970
I asked you to follow Lu Sen.

252
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,130
So you should take good
photos, take close-up photos.

253
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:47,700
To follow him?

254
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,300
If we do that, the two of us will disappear.

255
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,841
Say that again?

256
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,060
How about this?

257
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,540
We'll pay more attention next time.

258
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,610
We'll take the photos with us this time.

259
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,604
Wait.

260
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,970
What about the female assistant
I asked you to keep an eye on?

261
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,610
We Got really
clear photos of her.

262
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,210
We followed her all morning.

263
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,141
Everything about her is in here.

264
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,070
So you can accomplish something.

265
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:24,020
For a professional
team, this is just the job.

266
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,940
Yes.

267
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,078
It's what we should do.

268
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,610
Seriously?

269
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,604
Professional?

270
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,284
Very good.

271
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,450
I pay you tens of thousands every month

272
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,490
and you took photos of
the old housekeeper lady?

273
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,370
Assistant!

274
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:50,850
Assistant!

275
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,154
I want information on the assistant
not the housekeeper!

276
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,809
It's really something to be paparazzi like you.

277
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,916
Get yourselves back there
and keep watching them.

278
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:14,327
If you still can't get any useful information
next time,

279
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,474
I'll make you into photos.

280
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,364
(Why can't I fall asleep?)

281
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,780
It's like if you can't see her,

282
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,833
you feel restless
like there is grass growing in your heart.

283
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,450
That does seem to be the case.

284
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,420
And when you see her, it's as
if the whole world disappears.

285
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,370
Yes.

286
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,940
Meeting her would make me feel better.

287
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,345
Right, that's how it feels.

288
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,364
What kind of feeling is this?

289
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,545
I will also cherish you who gave me an umbrella.

290
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,420
Really?

291
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,818
You will cherish the umbrella I gave you?

292
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,060
(Okay.)

293
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,450
(Lu Sen seems to trust me now.)

294
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,250
(It's time to put an end)

295
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,970
(to the Youth Creativity Competition.)

296
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,180
(First, make him feel guilty
with the contestants' eagerness.)

297
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,406
(And then, let him feel the power of invention.)

298
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,970
My lovely umbrella, whether we
can restart the Creativity Competition

299
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,540
is up to you.

300
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,975
Today, we can only succeed,

301
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,855
we cannot fail.

302
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:15,951
(Okay.)

303
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,370
I'll leave the contract to you.

304
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,631
It must be dealt with today.

305
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,540
Friday.

306
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,250
Report today's weather.

307
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,660
The highest temperature today is seven degrees,

308
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,060
the lowest is minus two degrees.

309
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,020
Air Index, 51, good.

310
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,540
But it's going to rain,
so bring an umbrella.

311
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,175
It's going to rain on such a sunny day?

312
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,300
We'll be going out
today, bring an umbrella.

313
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,956
It's ready for you.

314
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:47,353
This is for me?

315
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,503
You're not going to open it up?

316
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,404
Looks like you remembered what I said.

317
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,593
Then I'll give you a present too.

318
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,850
Really?

319
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,592
Can it be anything?

320
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,044
Then...

321
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,100
Can you restart the Creativity Competition?

322
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,390
Why?

323
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,652
Because

324
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,375
as long as you restart
it, I'll be the champion.

325
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,020
Okay, Friday.

326
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,826
You're awesome.

327
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,940
I'm going to sponsor
you with all my money.

328
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,590
IMU's future depends on you.

329
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,610
Okay.

330
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,223
Worship me.

331
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,487
What are you thinking about? Speak.

332
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,532
Because...

333
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,553
Because...

334
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,180
Because Pai signed up too.

335
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:00,450
After the competition got canceled,
she was really sad and listless.

This won't work.

337
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,700
The company has already decided.

338
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,665
Pick something else.

339
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,540

Why are you thinking of others?

342
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,540
I'm your master, you
should be thinking of me.

343
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,830
For example, you can ask

344
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,130
for a better battery so that you
can stay with me longer every day.

345
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,780
Does that count
as a present for me?

346
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,300
Regardless, it can't be about someone else.

347
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,337
Pick something else.

348
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,610
What if I pick something else
and you still say no?

349
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,223
Impossible.

350

Take me out for a walk.

352
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,490
I just happened to have made an appointment
for a garden.

353
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,610
Garden?

354
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,730
Oh right, Friday.

355
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,730
If you come early in the
future, just find something to do.

356
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,370
This is one weakness about you robots,

357

I have to give instructions for everything.

358
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,300
Can I give instructions for every little thing?

359
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,020
Look at Dusty, he starts
working when it's time.

matter what time it is.

was this delivered?

372
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,700
Mr. Xie dropped it off this morning,

373
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,098
saying it's a small gift for Team Alpha.

374
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,210
Did Shanshan offend him again?

375
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,940
Is he taking revenge on us?

376
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,726
It's not a bomb, is it?

377

Don't panic.

378
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,660
We are in Lu Sen's manor.

At least 100.

like this is unnecessary.

don't have another Friday?
