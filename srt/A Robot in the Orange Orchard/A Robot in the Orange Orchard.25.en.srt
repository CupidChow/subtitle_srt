You're not even shy so why would I be?

172
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:26,720
Get in.

173
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:28,889
What are you doing?

174
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:30,559
Stand still.

175
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,730
Stand still.

176
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:36,629
I know you two are friends.

177
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,970
I didn't get things wrong.

178
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,740
I like Sen.

179
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,139
You're okay with that, right?

180
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,779
He isn't my future brother-in-law anyway.

181
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:46,909
I can marry him when I grow up.

182
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,049
You little...

183
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,679
How are you not embarrassed?

184
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,690
But I think that Sen...

185
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,659
doesn't like En Bao a lot.

186
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,360
How did you tell?

187
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,960
Why else would he avoid you?

188
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:06,029
Think about it.

189
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,329
An individual's expression and movement...

190
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,069
can reflect his innermost self, you know?

191
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,910
I don't believe it either.

192
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,509
How can anyone not like...

193
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,109
our dear En Bao?

194
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,410
Maybe I am wrong...

195
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,009
about Sen's real attitude.

196
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,809
That's why I think we need to prove it.

197
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,279
Prove it how?

198
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:37,690
Sen!

199
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,109
Here, Lu Sen.

200
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,279
Eat more vegetables.

201
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:57,049
What's wrong? Slow down.

202
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,950
Let him do it first.

203
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,420
I'll get you some soup.

204
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,130
Let me help you.

205
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,470
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

206
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:20,470
No, thank you.

207
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,750
What are you watching?

208
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:36,819
Let me watch it too.

209
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:41,220
Shan Shan.

210
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,220
Shan Shan.

211
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,829
Sen.

212
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:11,779
Thank you.

213
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,089
Hello, Aunt.

214
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,130
Shan Shan.

215
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:05,230
En Bao's grandma called us and said she was sick.

216
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:06,630
Your uncle, En Bao and I...

217
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,730
are going over there.

218
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Why all of a sudden?

219
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:10,329
Is it bad?

220
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,440
It's okay. Don't worry.

221
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:13,269
It's probably just an old illness.

222
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,809
Take care of yourselves.

223
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,970
Have a safe trip then.

224
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:17,839
All right.

225
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:20,809
Is everything okay?

226
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:21,750
Yes.

227
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,950
Wait.

228
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:27,650
That's not right.

229
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:29,490
They're not coming home...

230
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,420
so it's just me and Lu Sen tonight?

231
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,789
We'll be all alone.

232
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,700
It's full of chemicals.

233
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,799
This one is better.

234
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,670
Let's go.

235
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,140
Is it really okay to let Shan Shan...

236
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,740
spend the night alone with that guy?

237
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,210
It feels inappropriate.

238
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,740
It's all right.

239
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:53,880
They're both adults.

240
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,079
Is your mom's illness...

241
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,250
really that bad?

242
00:22:59,319 --> 00:22:59,980
How serious is it?

243
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:01,019
It's nothing serious.

244
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,819
Are you telling me to go alone?

245
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,990
No, what I mean is...

246
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,559
En Bao should stay at home.

247
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,329
Don't think I don't know.

248
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:11,390
Every day, as long as those two are here,

249
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,099
you make En Bao third-wheel them...

250
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,230
by clinging onto Lu Sen.

251
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,500
Mom, Shan Shan is the third wheel.

252
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:18,400
Stop talking nonsense.

253
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,369
Do you think they're in love?

254
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,710
If they're really dating,

255
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:28,039
I will definitely disagree.

256
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:28,980
I'm serious.

257
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:32,049
He doesn't deserve Shan Shan.

258
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,150
Though he's not bad-looking...

259
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,220
and he's quite smart.

260
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:36,920
But...

261
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:38,089
But what?

262
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,319
But...

263
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,990
Let me think of the wording.

264
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,089
That guy...

265
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,089
To be frank,

266
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,900
you're just trying to pick a fight.

267
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,130
Lu Sen is handsome, polite,

268
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:50,500
diligent, and hardworking.

269
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:51,230
Most importantly,

270
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,839
he can discuss inventions with Shan Shan.

271
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,470
Although he has been fired,

272
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:57,769
people like him can easily get jobs.

273
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,880
He seems pretty all right to me.

274
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:02,849
Let me tell you...

275
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:03,710
All right.

276
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:04,880
I know.

277
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,119
Even if the man closest...

278
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,250
to perfection in the world stands before you,

279
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,349
you won't let him have Shan Shan.

280
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:12,720
Of course.

281
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,319
She's my niece.

282
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,490
How can I not worry?

283
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,029
I think they're a good match.

284
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:34,710
I...

285
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,250
I forgot to buy you slippers.

286
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:40,980
Shan Shan.

287
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,420
I'm starving.

288
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,619
Are you starving?

289
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,890
But we need the slippers.

290
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,589
Dad, I'm so tired.

291
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,089
Can you hold me?

292
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,329
No, Xiao Dong.

293
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,700
You're all grown up now,

294
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,599
a real man.

295
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,829
We'll be home soon.

296
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,200
Hold this.

297
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,910
Put me down.

298
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,279
Put me down.

299
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,480
- Put me down. - No.

300
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,009
You're so annoying.

301
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,180
Don't let anyone see me.

302
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:15,750
I'll hit you.

303
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:16,920
My head!

304
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:22,059
Take off your shoes.

305
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:47,049
(Lu Sen's room)

306
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,220
He's gone.

307
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:06,970
Sixty-five seconds.

308
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,539
You left me out here for 65 seconds.

309
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:16,980
What are you doing?

310
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:28,460
Well...

311
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,230
When you were pretending to be Friday,

312
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,799
I wanted to give them to you.

313
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:35,099
Who would've known...

314
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,170
they belonged to you all along.

315
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,569
So?

316
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,140
So...

317
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,710
The light is on.

318
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,450
Do you know what that means?

319
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,490
What?

320
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,460
It means that...

321
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,059
I forgive you.

322
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,230
Shan Shan.

323
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,000
Let's make up.

324
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,200
Give me a hug.

325
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:10,960
It's done.

326
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,400
I know Mr. Si called you just now.

327
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,670
Did something happen to the company?

328
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:22,269
No, it's just some daily reports.

329
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,609
Okay.

330
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,009
Look at you.

331
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,910
This was you when you first met Mr. Si.

332
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,750
Lu Sen.

333
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,049
What about you?

334
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,349
Don't touch my hair.

335
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:44,829
My arm.

336
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:56,009
I...

337
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,069
I'm going to bed.

338
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,410
I want you to leave.

339
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,309
I want to tell you a story.

340
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,150
Then I want a story about the bunny.

341
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:15,759
Once upon a time,

342
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:17,490
there was a bunny.

343
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,160
It learned the secret...

344
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:22,799
that it could eat the moon in the sky.

345
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,440
When the moon was full,

346
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,940
he climbed up the hill,

347
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,369
reached out,

348
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,579
took the moon and put it in its mouth.

349
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:35,180
The moon tasted really sweet.

350
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,049
The bunny is gluttonous.

351
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:39,180
It sat on the hillside and waited...

352
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,549
while the moon was still crescent.

353
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,490
Then, it bumped...

354
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,190
into a little red-tailed fox.

355
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,390
That bunny...

356
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,589
stuttered.

357
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,430
It wanted to let the fox have the moon,

358
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,329
but it couldn't make up its mind.

359
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,369
"Let me say it first."

360
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,269
The fox said,

361
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,680
"I come here every night because..."

362
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,980
The fox's face turned so red.

363
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,849
It's as red as its fur.

364
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:12,880
"It is because..."

365
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,119
"I like you a lot, bunny."

366
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,160
The bunny was shy.

367
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,160
It said,

368
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,359
"I like you too."

369
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:29,170
Little fox heard it...

370
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,299
and it jumped for joy.

371
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:33,440
It reached out...

372
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:36,369
and got many stars on the hillside.

373
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,809
It picked them up with his two little paws...

374
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,079
and gave them to the bunny.

375
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,079
He said,

376
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,650
"Try them."

377
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,720
"I was too shy to tell you before."

378
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,690
"You can eat the stars on the hill."

379
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,519
"They taste very sweet."

380
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,190
The bunny took a star...

381
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,329
and put it in its mouth.

382
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,000
It's really sweet.

383
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,140
Good night.

384
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,809
My little bunny.

385
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,480
The little fox...

386
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,450
will get you all the stars...

387
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,519
in the sky.
