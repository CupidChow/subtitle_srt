00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:38,069
(Episode 22, The Hardship of Lying and The Possible Happiness)

2
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,989
Don't drink if you can't.

3
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:58,489
It doesn't suit you.

4
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,969
Are you really giving up on Friday?

5
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,639
I have to, sooner or later.

6
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,569
Before Lu Sen fires us...

7
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,379
hurry up and find a reliable team for the handover.

8
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,250
Then tell me.

9
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,280
Is there a better research team than yours?

10
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,949
None.

11
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,719
That's what I think too.

12
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,030
Fu Yang.

13
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:36,560
I feel at ease when I'm with you.

14
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,300
I'm willing to take one step closer to you.

15
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,099
But sometimes,

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,840
the closer we get, the less sure we are.

17
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,139
I don't know if one day...

18
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,669
you will give up on me like Friday...

19
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:50,110
just to protect me.

20
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,479
You and Friday are different.

21
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,319
You know it.

22
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,620
That's enough.

23
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,349
I'm afraid I'll sound more desperate than Lu Sen.

24
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,159
If I stay,

25
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,830
I'm confident I can do a better job on Friday.

26
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,000
I will be more helpful to Lu Sen.

27
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,599
Besides staying away from him,

28
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,069
what else can I do?

29
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,069
Give Lu Sen what he really wants.

30
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,250
Actually, maybe he doesn't even know what it is.

31
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,159
Walnut cake.

32
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,159
I peeled the walnuts one by one myself.

33
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,729
Eat it. It's good for your brain.

34
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:49,770
Da Tang Zi.

35
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Do you have more coffee?

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,870
Don't drink too much coffee.

37
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,909
Even if you drink it all, you can't become...

38
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,710
a doctor of medicine in one night.

39
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:01,780
I have to do something.

40
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,379
There will be a way.

41
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,750
But you still need to eat and sleep.

42
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,319
Now, take a bite of the cake.

43
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,289
Dopamine secreted from eating sweets...

44
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,389
will wash away all the frustrations.

45
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,389
Then you can go to sleep right away.

46
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,160
Okay.

47
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,269
I'll go to bed after this.

48
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,339
Okay.

49
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,810
I'm not sleepy anyway.

50
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,209
I'll stay here with you.

51
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,370
Let me know how you're doing when you're awake.

52
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,439
I'm worried.

53
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:31,970
The data is fluctuating.

54
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,870
What happened?

55
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,040
Da Tang Zi.

56
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,240
Da Tang Zi, come here.

57
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,879
It's morning already.

58
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,680
You didn't sleep all night?

59
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,149
Look at this guy. He's not dead.

60
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,990
Based on my level four English knowledge,

61
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,730
the Danish patient...

62
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,329
is not dead.

63
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,240
It's because he later...

64
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,540
found his lover back...

65
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,910
and they lived happily ever after.

66
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,110
Something like that.

67
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,509
Does that mean I can be like him?

68
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,550
And help Lu Sen get better?

69
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,089
Why...

70
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:01,860
did Dr. Ou tell me that this man is dead?

71
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,600
Is it because he doesn't want me to see Lu Sen again?

72
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,959
Or...

73
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,029
it was Lu Sen's idea?

74
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,810
Shan Shan.

75
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:21,110
Dr. Ou had no choice.

76
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,319
Everyone is just crossing the bridge when they come to it.

77
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,250
The hardest part is...

78
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:27,850
Lu Sen's current condition.

79
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,790
He can't touch people.

80
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,420
I...

81
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,389
I can stay away from Lu Sen.

82
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,029
But I just really want him to get better.

83
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,529
All right, Shan Shan.

84
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,240
Just do whatever you want.

85
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,670
Even if the whole world says you're wrong,

86
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,709
I'll scold them for you.

87
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:49,269
Don't worry.

88
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,709
If you have any requests,

89
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:53,810
just tell me.

90
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,649
Even if I have to use the ten pounds of meat on my body.

91
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,480
I don't mind exchanging them.

92
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,649
You're such a good friend.

93
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,220
Of course.

94
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,149
We're best friends.

95
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,920
We share happiness and burdens.

96
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,300
Da Tang Zi.

97
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:15,500
What's wrong?

98
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,769
Teach me how to cook.

99
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,670
You're cooking?

100
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:23,009
Here. This place.

101
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,839
Remove the prawn vein.

102
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,040
Here, try it.

103
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:29,680
Are you okay?

104
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,259
Come on.

105
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,970
Shan Shan, don't worry.

106
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,070
I'm here.

107
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,240
I'll take good care of Mr. Lu.

108
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,539
Mr. Xie, how about this?

109
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,909
Take the porridge. Just say you made it.

110
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:58,940
Okay?

111
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,549
He needs to eat it while it's hot.

112
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,279
It's good for his health. Please.

113
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:06,320
Mr. Xie.

114
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:24,639
Are...

115
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,669
Are you okay?

116
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,610
Who let you in?

117
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,039
I just wanted to sneak in...

118
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,509
and leave after dropping this off.

119
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,480
Who gave you the right...

120
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,450
to come in and out of my house?

121
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,990
I just wanted to see you.

122
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,460
See me?

123
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,690
What for?

124
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
To make fun of me?

125
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:56,570
I forgot.

126
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,570
You've always been like this.

127
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,139
You pretended to be a robot...

128
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,639
to make a fool out of me.

129
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,110
You pretended not to know me...

130
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,710
to rip my heart out.

131
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:13,879
To tell you how much I missed the robot in front of you.

132
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,220
Now...

133
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:20,259
What more do you want?

134
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,490
Do you want me to die in front of you?

135
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:25,429
- Come on. - Lu Sen.

136
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,029
Lu Sen.

137
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,799
Ever since I met you,

138
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,470
you're the first thing I see every day.

139
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:39,440
Every day, I just want to make sure...

140
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:42,450
if you are happier than yesterday.

141
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,879
We used to be fine.

142
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:46,519
Now...

143
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,090
Can we start over?

144
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,960
It's all fake.

145
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,519
All lies.

146
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:55,860
Right now,

147
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,129
I only wish for one thing.

148
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:02,370
That is...

149
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,340
to have never met you.

150
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,519
Lu Sen.

151
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:58,389
I'm sorry.

152
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,299
I know I lied to you.

153
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:07,629
But I can't lie to myself.

154
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,769
You said you couldn't live without me.

155
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,169
But actually,

156
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,309
I'm the one who needs you more.

157
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,720
I'm sorry...

158
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:36,159
Your 24 hours late-night mode has been set.

159
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:38,629
Your numbers improved a lot today.

160
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:39,960
Did you do...

161
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,100
or eat something?

162
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:54,679
IMU, close the curtains.

163
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,840
Easy.

164
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:08,419
It's okay.

165
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,450
You can do it.

166
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,100
I've done the inventory.

167
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,500
You're free to hand over Friday.

168
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,679
It's a mistake of our own.

169
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,909
We should be the ones to make up for it.

170
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,259
It's done!

171
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:56,600
Shan Shan.

172
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,070
I really can't let you in this time.

173
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,440
Don't put me in the spot, okay?

174
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:03,139
How about this?

175
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,210
You take my stuff inside.

176
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,779
I'm not going in there. Is that okay?

177
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,639
Shan Shan.

178
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,450
Mr. Lu's orders.

179
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,309
Anything from you...

180
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,220
can't go through this door.

181
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,320
Go home.

182
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,169
IMU.

183
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:09,240
Sleep mode.

184
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,769
Why did you buy so many oranges?

185
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,330
There are orange trees in Lu Sen's residence.

186
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,970
But he prefers sweet oranges.

187
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,799
If I find the sweetest oranges for him,

188
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,039
he's going to love it.

189
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,580
It's sweet. Try it.

190
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,149
Still not enough.

191
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,359
IMU.

192
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,440
Your numbers are good these days.

193
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:21,480
Were there any changes?

194
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,480
I saw her come by.

195
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,490
I'm hungry.

196
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,400
(Your numbers are good these days. Were there any changes?)

197
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,240
(I'm hungry.)

198
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:04,660
How did she get in?

199
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,579
Is he getting better...

200
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,680
because of her?

201
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,680
Why are you still working on it?

202
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,849
Look at the time.

203
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:37,549
Lu Sen has no appetite nowadays.

204
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,660
I need to find a familiar taste.

205
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,759
Maybe he'll eat then.

206
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,339
This is nice.

207
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,079
This orange is green.

208
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:02,349
It's not ripe, is it?

209
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:05,349
If even the green one is sweet,

210
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,319
this batch of oranges must be really good.

211
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:11,859
Not bad.

212
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:13,960
This is it.

213
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:53,000
Nice.

214
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:52,509
It is because of her.

215
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,650
You're here.

216
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,690
It's warm.

217
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,529
In late autumn,

218
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,130
it gets cold at night.

219
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,099
Come closer and you'll feel warmer.

220
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,930
This distance is perfect.

221
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:48,690
Stop opening the door for her.

222
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,660
Mr. Lu, you've wronged me.

223
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,390
I've never opened the door for her.

224
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,930
Do you think...

225
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,730
our door can stop her?

226
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,000
Mr. Xie.

227
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:05,240
Have you ever lied to me?

228
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,339
In life,

229
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:12,809
how can one say they've never lied?

230
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:15,079
Since you're asking,

231
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,849
then what about you?

232
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:20,750
You said you'd buy me the tools for the trees.

233
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,450
It has been over a year.

234
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,819
You didn't buy me anything either.

235
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:29,559
I'm sorry.

236
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:34,000
Don't apologize for the smallest things.

237
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,700
Things that are easily forgotten...

238
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,599
means that they are not important.

239
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,539
They can be replaced.

240
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,569
Things that don't leave the mind...

241
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,579
are what you care about the most.

242
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,549
It's hedgehogs.

243
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:58,019
They came here last year.

244
00:26:58,089 --> 00:26:59,259
I've seen them.

245
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:00,460
Great.

246
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:01,730
They're here again this year.

247
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:07,000
The hedgehogs have it tough in the winter.

248
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,329
When it's cold,

249
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,029
they will huddle together.

250
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,009
When their bodies come close,

251
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,640
it's inevitable for their spines to stab one another.

252
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,710
Then, they will separate.

253
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,410
Once they separate,

254
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,950
they could freeze to death.

255
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,420
And so,

256
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,690
they snuggle together again.

257
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,789
They probably think that instead of fighting the cold,

258
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,529
the pain of being stabbed by the other...

259
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,500
is easier to deal with.

260
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,029
But compared to animals,

261
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,700
I think humans are more afraid of pain.

262
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:52,680
People get attached to each other through hugs.

263
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,480
When there is attachment,

264
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,450
it will naturally hurt.

265
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,720
Why don't you go check out that orange tree in the greenhouse?

266
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,960
I wonder what's going on this year.

267
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:12,029
The leaves are a lot yellower.

268
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,349
What is it that you need?

269
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,400
I'm sorry, Lu Sen.

270
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,670
Lu Sen.

271
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,039
We were wrong.

272
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,039
I'm so sorry we lied to you.

273
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,039
We're going to tell you...

274
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:37,049
everything about Shan Shan pretending to be Friday.

275
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,720
But I want you to know...

276
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:41,119
that Shan Shan has nothing to do with this.

277
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,349
I was the one who forced Shan Shan to help me.

278
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:47,059
Friday.

279
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:49,759
If anyone lies,

280
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,390
please call them out right away.

281
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,200
That's all.

282
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,740
That's the whole process of our mistakes.

283
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,680
We don't expect you to trust us again...

284
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,380
or forgive us.

285
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:10,450
If you don't want to see us anymore,

286
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,250
the only thing we can do is to give you Friday.

287
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,049
It's the only thing we can do to make it up to you.

288
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,890
Of course,

289
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,460
if you need us,

290
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,400
we'll always be here.

291
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,599
Lu Sen.

292
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,599
You know I can't eat spicy food.

293
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,769
As long as you forgive us,

294
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:38,109
I'll eat a facing heaven pepper in front of you.

295
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:55,089
What's so special about eating facing heaven peppers?

296
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,289
Eat Carolina Reaper if you dare.

297
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,130
Or the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion.

298
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:47,609
No. That was what we agreed on.

299
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,880
I know you produce less.

300
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,480
Yes, I'm on my way.

301
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:51,779
You must save it for me.

302
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:52,819
Okay.

303
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:04,390
Are you okay?

304
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,329
Are you okay?

305
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,099
I'm sorry.

306
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,230
Should I take you to the hospital?

307
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:11,529
I got it.

308
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,130
Lu Sen.

309
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,829
You're so gullible.

310
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,489
What are you doing?

311
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,030
I made this myself.

312
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:55,199
Try it.

313
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,869
And this orange may look green,

314
00:34:57,969 --> 00:34:59,469
but it's actually really sweet.

315
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,769
I've tried it in secret for you.

316
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,070
If you really don't want to eat it,

317
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,780
you can put it around the house.

318
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,880
It's quite aromatic.

319
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,610
I thought it'd cheer you up.

320
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,050
I don't need you to do that.

321
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:16,949
Then what do you need me to do?

322
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:21,489
I don't need anything.

323
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:23,059
You can just leave.

324
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:29,030
Okay.

325
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:31,800
Then when you need me,

326
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:32,800
tell me.

327
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,340
I'll wait for you.

328
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,679
Lu Sen!

329
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,650
Listen.

330
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:26,989
The orange is really sweet.

331
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:28,989
You have to try it.

332
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,300
Please.
