(Episode 28, Jealousy is the Sweetest Taste)

2
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,469
Lu Sen.

3
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:28,520
You boys.

4
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,189
Can't you be serious?

5
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,090
Li Er, come and help me.

6
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:32,990
Li Er.

7
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,129
We're a team.

8
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:35,729
Let's defeat Li Zhan together.

9
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,199
I'm my own team.

10
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,169
Li Er, come and help me.

11
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,349
Mr. Xie.

12
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,680
You're here.

13
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,150
You know, don't you?

14
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,520
I'm talking about Lu Sen's condition.

15
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,990
How can I not know?

16
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:07,960
He has been sick for 15 years.

17
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,900
Back then, the chairman and his wife died in an accident.

18
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,099
He was in a lot of pain.

19
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:14,800
Ever since then,

20
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,400
he has locked himself in here for 15 years.

21
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,669
He can't be around people.

22
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,669
He has to cook for himself.

23
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,680
He endures it even if he's sick.

24
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,409
Most importantly, no one came to see him.

25
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,280
Why didn't you visit him back then?

26
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,159
We've let him down.

27
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,090
It's not your fault.

28
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,930
It was an accident.

29
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,599
You never know.

30
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,169
It could've been avoided.

31
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:49,699
What do you mean?

32
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,699
I mean...

33
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:53,069
there must be a reason...

34
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,840
Lu Sen is avoiding me.

35
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:59,240
If you feel sorry about that,

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,610
then you should say that to his face.

37
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:07,120
Unfortunately, a simple apology...

38
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,949
can't simply make up for some mistakes.

39
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,259
But I'll tell him that I'm sorry properly.

40
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,600
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

41
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,269
(People who help are the happiest)

42
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,050
Li Zhan.

43
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:40,819
What are you doing here?

44
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:42,920
Lu Sen.

45
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,259
Let's talk.

46
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,300
So you're apologizing for Friday?

47
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:54,529
For Friday...

48
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,000
and for you.

49
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,040
Li Er came to see you?

50
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,209
There's no evidence.

51
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,079
But are you willing to trust me?

52
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:18,990
This...

53
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,660
is my dad's dashcam from back then.

54
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,500
It's yours now.

55
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,730
But I have one condition.

56
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,199
I hope to be the only one to take the blame...

57
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:31,470
all the mistakes.

58
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,250
So it's all true.

59
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,790
I can promise you that.

60
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
But Li Jing Cheng...

61
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:58,629
might not agree.

62
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,800
So you knew everything.

63
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,000
Then why are you still keeping us in the company?

64
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,009
Because sometimes,

65
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,079
I don't want to believe it either.

66
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,449
I have my choice.

67
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:21,290
What about you?

68
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,920
If your dad doesn't come to his senses,

69
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,860
what would you do?

70
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:29,490
What can I do?

71
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,100
I don't know.

72
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,870
But I'll do my best not to let anything worse happen.

73
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,810
If...

74
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,480
I'm saying if anything bad happens,

75
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,519
I'll stay with my dad.

76
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,720
See?

77
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,689
The choices we make are all the same.

78
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,149
Lu Cheng.

79
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,819
Will you give me another chance?

80
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:26,649
I...

81
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,750
I know it's wrong for me to embezzle public funds.

82
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,519
But I'll think of a way to make up for it as soon as I can.

83
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,089
You know, we've been friends for so many years.

84
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:36,389
You can't just sit there and watch me go penniless.

85
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:37,199
Right, Lu Cheng?

86
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,170
What on earth were you doing?

87
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,870
I only told you to cause a tiny error...

88
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:46,269
to hold up Lu Cheng's shareholders' meeting, okay?

89
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,759
Why does this scene feel so familiar?

90
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,960
It seems as if it happened a long time ago.

91
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:02,049
Did you take care of the lab?

92
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:04,149
I took care of it as you asked.

93
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,019
All the paperwork is being done under Tom's name.

94
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,450
He hid it as you instructed.

95
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,460
But...

96
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:14,529
He's in a bit of a hurry. He asks when will you see him off.

97
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,399
Tell him to wait.

98
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,629
At a time like this,

99
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:22,370
make sure he doesn't contact me first.

100
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,669
Yes, Mr. Li.

101
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,940
And...

102
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:28,570
Mr. Lu sent you an e-mail today.

103
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,210
He wants you to take the initiative to be investigated...

104
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:32,710
regarding the leak.

105
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,850
Otherwise,

106
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,450
he will reopen the embezzlement case from 15 years ago.

107
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,590
He really is Lu Cheng's good son.

108
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,059
Am I someone...

109
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,590
who can be threatened so easily?

110
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,360
Investigate me?

111
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,200
He has no proof.

112
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:01,139
Also, in his e-mail,

113
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,870
he attached a few photos from the dashcam footage.

114
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,649
That time when you drove out 15 years ago.

115
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,779
Didn't you say...

116
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,519
Didn't you say you took care of the footage?

117
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,350
How did he get his hands on it?

118
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,519
- Say something! - About the footage,

119
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,090
after we paid the driver,

120
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,759
he just disappeared.

121
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,659
We used every resource at our disposal...

122
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,830
to get the information back.

123
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,529
Every resource? What are you saying?

124
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,970
Keep looking until you find him!

125
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,529
- You hear me? - I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

126
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,539
Mr. Li.

127
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,879
Should we pull some tricks to stop Mr. Lu...

128
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,240
from going to the company?

129
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,610
No.

130
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,350
Not only will I let him to go to the company,

131
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:45,950
I will also make him take the initiative...

132
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,120
to make me the chairman of the board.

133
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,259
I'll tell them. He needs our help.

134
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,529
We have to do our best, right?

135
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,340
Let's get started.

136
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,379
Uncle.

137
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,120
Be my guest.

138
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:58,659
Let's talk about Shan Shan.

139
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:02,090
Do you know why is she so obsessed with inventing?

140
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,299
What do you think?

141
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,200
It's because of her ignorant dad.

142
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,169
You probably don't know.

143
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,370
Shan Shan's first invention...

144
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,639
was an ugly car wash machine.

145
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,610
She said she made it for her uncle.

146
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:22,009
And an alarm clock that can't be caught.

147
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,220
She said En Bao inspired her.

148
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,919
This kid. Such useless inventions.

149
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:37,759
Do you really think so?

150
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:40,970
Whatever it is,

151
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:43,669
as long as Shan Shan can't live a good life with it,

152
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,539
I will think it's useless.

153
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,480
Both of you don't say it...

154
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:55,509
but deep down, you care about each other.

155
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:57,279
This kind of care...

156
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,450
is what gives Shan Shan's inventions...

157
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,490
the charm that warms the heart.

158
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,090
You're the first...

159
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,629
who understands Shan Shan like that.

160
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:16,299
But I'm not the only one...

161
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,740
who is given warmth by Shan Shan.

162
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:20,470
If you give me your permission...

163
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,769
to be with Shan Shan,

164
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:25,509
I must be the happiest person...

165
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,309
in the world.

166
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,019
You're waiting for me here?

167
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,649
Uncle.

168
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,149
As soon as I'm done with things at the company,

169
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,950
I'll tell her how I feel.

170
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,029
You're very quick-witted.

171
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,570
You'll be able to provide for your family in the future.

172
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,139
Man to man.

173
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,470
Don't forget even after drinks.

174
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,250
Actually, what I'm most worried about is...

175
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,690
you and Shan Shan...

176
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,350
are from different worlds.

177
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:15,490
Yes.

178
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,200
Indeed, back then,

179
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,230
we were from different worlds.

180
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,669
My world is lonely and cold.

181
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,070
But Shan Shan warmed my heart.

182
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,370
She took me...

183
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,480
to her rich and interesting world.

184
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:34,610
So to me,

185
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,379
she is my world.

186
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,950
Her family is my family.

187
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,019
But her assets are not yours.

188
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,259
Don't even think about the inheritance.

189
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,529
No. All my assets are yours too.

190
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:52,559
No, you...

191
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,929
Where are your manners?

192
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,700
- Drink up! - Okay.

193
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,019
Hello, Mr. Luo. It's me.

194
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,350
I'm looking at the latest reports.

195
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:15,850
Something's not right with the cash flow...

196
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,889
of your department.

197
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,960
The outflow of this money...

198
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,659
is said to be still conducting an important project experiment.

199
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,600
What is it?

200
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,799
Even I didn't know.

201
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,500
Mr. Li.

202
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:28,769
Well, the thing is,

203
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:29,870
this project...

204
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,600
is managed directly by the board of directors.

205
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,870
It's highly confidential.

206
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,210
Our R&D department only provides resources.

207
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,070
The rest is out of my hands.

208
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,809
So you're saying...

209
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,250
I'm not qualified enough?

210
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,779
I wouldn't dare.

211
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,450
I'm loyal to you and your dad.

212
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,350
He knows about these projects.

213
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,419
So far, only the factory is bought.

214
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,860
You are a busy man.

215
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,690
I didn't want to bother you with such a trivial matter.

216
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,360
I can just approve it.

217
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,159
I remember now.

218
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,370
My dad did mention it to me.

219
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,370
I guess I forgot because I was busy.

220
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,570
Organize the details of this project...

221
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,610
and the location of the factory...

222
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,269
and send them to me.

223
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,210
If I have questions,

224
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
- I'll ask my dad directly. - Okay.

225
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:15,779
Okay.

226
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,490
Friday is already gone.

227
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:23,320
What would my dad want with a factory?

228
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,659
Mr. Lu, the smoke bomb has been released.

229
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,200
Do you think will Mr. Li do next?

230
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,129
No matter what he does,

231
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,929
he will leave a trace in a short time.

232
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,399
I see. I'll be watching him.

233
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,679
Lu Sen.

234
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,850
Uncle is drunk.

235
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,419
- Be careful. - Why did you drink so much?

236
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,919
If you can't drink, drink less.

237
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,789
It's okay.

238
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,090
It really is. Come on, let's go.

239
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,329
(Small Pot Noodles)

240
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,529
Watch your head.

241
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,640
Lu Sen, are you all right?

242
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,339
- I'm fine. - Okay.

243
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:16,009
You should go back now.

244
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,339
Okay. We'll go back on our own.

245
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,779
All right. Take care of him.

246
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,609
Don't worry.

247
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:22,279
I'm off.

248
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,309
- Bye. - Bye.

249
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,420
Be careful.

250
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,119
You made my uncle drink so much.

251
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,190
He's on my side now.

252
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:35,930
You're stealing my uncle now?

253
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:42,230
I'm going to steal you from everyone who likes you.

254
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,640
You're not drunk at all, are you?

255
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,539
I'm drunk.

256
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,609
You're drunk?

257
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,039
So what do we do?

258
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,009
I can't walk anymore.

259
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,349
You can't walk anymore?

260
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,920
Since you can't walk,

261
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,220
you can stay here.

262
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,750
I think a lot of people would want to take you in.

263
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:04,490
Stand still.

264
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,660
What will you do if I get picked up?

265
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,930
Then...

266
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,960
Then I'll take in someone else.

267
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,640
- Don't follow me. - It's not right.

268
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,240
How annoying.

269
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,680
Lu Sen.

270
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,720
Can I borrow Shan Shan for a minute?

271
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,259
You can go up first.

272
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,960
I'll buy you some hangover tea.

273
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,099
Shan Shan.

274
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,000
It's okay.

275
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:54,039
Don't you want to apologize?

276
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,009
I'm afraid you'll say something to piss me off first,

277
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,309
so I'll forgive you first.

278
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:02,980
How have the last two days been?

279
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,250
It's okay.

280
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,519
Everyone just doesn't know what to do.

281
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,390
Even so,

282
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,190
it's better than when you first came back.

283
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,329
You used to live in a shabby warehouse...

284
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,289
and had to calculate what to eat.

285
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,160
And you had a bad rap.

286
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:24,640
You were so rude to me, the delivery person.

287
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:27,640
You said you were producing the greatest robot in the world.

288
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:29,769
That bad, huh?

289
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,740
I'm sorry then.

290
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:32,809
Sorry?

291
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:34,980
I just think...

292
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,779
you're very cool.

293
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:42,819
You know why I always followed you?

294
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,059
Because...

295
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,789
I think you're always doing what you want to do.

296
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,390
And you always believe...

297
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,329
that you can make your dream come true.

298
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,359
I...

299
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:56,900
I want to be like you guys.

300
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,569
It's a pity.

301
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,940
You can make Friday.

302
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,640
I can only pretend to be Friday.

303
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,579
You know why we only order what you deliver?

304
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
It's because I'm nice.

305
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:11,849
Do you think anyone would do it?

306
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,819
Because we wanted Friday to be like you.

307
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,319
Friday is an emotional companion robot.

308
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:21,059
She was supposed to be based on someone...

309
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,089
who has warmth and is full of life.

310
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,000
Anyway, the longer Friday was with us,

311
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:29,970
the more boring she would get.

312
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,569
You even want to take advantage of me like that.

313
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:35,009
That's why, without you...

314
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,440
there is no Friday.

315
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,480
If that's the case,

316
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:48,690
I must be the kind of person...

317
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,319
who is written in a science book, right?

318
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:53,490
Even so, it will come after my name.

319
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,390
No, after the Alpha Team.

320
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,259
Fine, they can write about you.

321
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:59,359
At most, they will have a photo of you.

322
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,730
But I'm on the cover. Friday has my face.

323
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,000
That makes sense.

324
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,470
Everything will be okay.

325
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,240
Aren't you buying me hangover tea?

326
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,509
Where's the tea?

327
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,579
I've said everything I wanted to say.

328
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:21,890
I'll get going.

329
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,220
Shan Shan.

330
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:26,890
I'm glad that Friday was modeled after you.

331
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:28,529
Thank you.

332
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:38,339
You're sober?

333
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,269
I don't have to buy tea then.

334
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:43,240
You said you'd buy me some hangover tea.

335
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:45,480
But in truth, you were chatting for so long with him.

336
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,039
Get up here now.

337
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:51,549
Then give me 15 seconds.

338
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:56,150
Ready, go.

339
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:02,289
How many seconds was that?

340
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,700
Sixty-five.

341
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,799
Sixty-five?

342
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,660
Let's go.

343
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,569
- Carry me. - Okay.

344
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:18,740
Dr. Ou is on a business trip.

345
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:19,980
He gave me a device.

346
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,309
He said it can test...

347
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,049
the values.

348
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,880
And then...

349
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,690
Anyway, it's complicated.

350
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,049
You won't understand even if I tell you.

351
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:32,089
Yes, I don't.

352
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:34,519
Come here.

353
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,890
I'll check.

354
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:43,930
You can really see it.

355
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:44,869
Look.

356
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:46,400
You have a big heart.

357
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:49,410
This big?

358
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:50,809
Pretty much.

359
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,950
I think I should listen to it,

360
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:02,950
only then will we know.

361
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,500
You're so close. It'll only beat faster.

362
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:17,299
Really?

363
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,920
It's really faster.

364
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:37,789
Have you heard enough?

365
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,589
No.

366
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,140
This is where...

367
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,799
I bought your favorite oranges.

368
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:54,940
Is this not it?

369
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:56,009
Of course not.

370
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,509
Then...

371
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,480
I went through a lot of trouble to buy them.

372
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,109
Gosh...

373
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:04,779
Do you want some?

374
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,849
It's sweet, right?

375
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:10,789
Thank you.

376
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:11,789
It's okay. Go.

377
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,359
Why are you nicer to the kids...

378
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,730
than to me?

379
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,259
You're jealous of a child?

380
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:20,160
Jealous?

381
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:22,900
I don't know what jealousy is.

382
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,740
Would you like to try it then?

383
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,019
So jealousy is actually sweet.

384
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:47,589
Have another one.

385
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,230
It's really sweet.

386
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,190
It's sweet, right?

387
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,299
How are things going with the company?

388
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,400
Still working on it.

389
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,630
Almost done, I think.

390
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:01,769
Shan Shan.

391
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,839
We agreed not to get you involved.

392
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,279
I still made you worry in the end.

393
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,779
This isn't just about you anymore.

394
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,150
I promise you.

395
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:16,319
No matter what happens,

396
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:18,960
I'll always be by your side.

397
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:42,579
Shan Shan.

398
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,450
Shan Shan!

399
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,289
Shan Shan!

400
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,900
That means...

401
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,869
When Tom was trying to force format Friday,

402
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,039
the AI black box created by Friday...

403
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:12,279
stopped the formatting.

404
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:15,279
From this point on,

405
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,779
we will have to take into account of an extreme case like this.

406
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,019
Did Li Jing Cheng make a move?

407
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,059
Shan Shan...

408
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,289
She is in trouble.

409
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,390
Help!

410
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,799
Help!

411
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,069
Even if you yell all day long...

412
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,400
and your throat bleeds,

413
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:42,940
no one can hear you.

414
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,210
It's you.

415
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,640
Why did you bring me here?

416
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,609
Although it's our first time meeting,

417
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,380
shouldn't you greet your elder...

418
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,019
when you see them?

419
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:56,849
That's so rude.

420
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:00,259
That's what Lu Sen taught you?

421
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,430
It's none of your business.

422
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,470
Ms. Yang.

423
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:17,839
Do you really think you know Lu Sen?

424
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,509
Lu Sen, that kid.

425
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,450
I watched him grow up.

426
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,089
On the surface, he looks innocent and naive.

427
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,519
But in fact, everything he does...

428
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:36,960
is only for his own personal profit.

429
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,759
If it weren't for me,

430
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,799
the company wouldn't be what it is today.

431
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,799
But what about him?

432
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,640
Not even a thank you.

433
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,250
Such a heartless child.

434
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,210
Do you think it's worth it...

435
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,680
for you to suffer for him?

436
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,250
Let's split up.

437
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,119
Search every possible place.

438
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,460
Pai Song.

439
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,319
Get Lu Sen's phone monitored.

440
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,460
Track any calls made from unknown numbers.

441
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:11,430
Got it.

442
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,960
Li Cha De, give me a hand.

443
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,700
Should I call the police?

444
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,569
I need to find out more about Li Jing Cheng.

445
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,799
If we push him too hard,

446
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,039
Shan Shan may be at a disadvantage.

447
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:23,569
I'll go with you.

448
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:25,809
No. Report to the police according to the situation.

449
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,150
And...

450
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,220
please inform Da Tang Zi.

451
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,420
Tell her to call Shan Shan's uncle.

452
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:35,390
Say...

453
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,650
The truth?

454
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,349
Or...

455
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,359
Lie?

456
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:46,000
Say...

457
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,369
that Shan Shan will be staying with Da Tang Zi for a few days.

458
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:54,140
Look at all this effort.

459
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,609
Just tell me what you want.

460
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:05,619
Tell me everything you know about Lu Sen.

461
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,089
Is it that as long as you're with him,

462
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,319
his condition won't act up?

463
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:15,559
Where's my money?

464
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,789
Where's the check?

465
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,160
Shouldn't they be ready by now?

466
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,630
Do I look that hard to bribe?

467
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,609
Do you really think I'm playing around?

468
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:35,849
Listen up.

469
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,950
Lu Sen's family is long gone.

470
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,450
But you still have yours.

471
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,519
Don't you have a younger sister?

472
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:46,890
She's still in elementary school.

473
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,599
So listen up.

474
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,869
Don't try anything funny.

475
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,309
Of course, you can choose not to say anything for Lu Sen.

476
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:08,950
You don't have to.

477
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,509
But you'll lose everything.

478
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,519
I want to see...

479
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,690
how long he can hold out...

480
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,720
if Lu Sen loses you.

481
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,160
Ms. Yang.

482
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,730
Li Jing Cheng.

483
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:30,930
Don't do anything to Lu Sen.

484
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:36,740
We'll see.

485
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,380
Li Jing Cheng.

486
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,480
Li Jing Cheng!

487
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:47,480
Let me out!
