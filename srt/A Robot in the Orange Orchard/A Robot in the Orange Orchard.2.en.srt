[A Robot in the Orange Orchard]

32
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,750
[Episode 2]
[Hello, Enemy]

33
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,830
This is such a fairy-tale glasshouse!

34
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,000
(I'm Mr. Lu's secretary.)

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
(Are you Mr. Si?)

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,550
(Yes.)

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,270
(Hello.)

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,000
(From now on,)

39
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,080
(this will be your laboratory.)

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,270
(I need to give you all)

41
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,080
(a heads up about a few things.)

42
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,080
(You are about to move into the private manor)

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,120
(of Lu Sen, the chairman and CEO)

44
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,400
(of IMU Technologies.)

45
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,000
Mr. Lu is the sole owner of this place.

46
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,160
Therefore,

47
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,190
you have to follow the rules I'm about to mention.

48
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,000
First,

49
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,440
as this is the personal property of Mr. Lu,

50
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,960
you have to protect its confidentiality

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,000
and keep it a secret.

52
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,880
If you need to enter or leave the manor,

53
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,670
please let me or the butler know.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,600
Second,

55
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,160
you cannot leave the manor

56
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,240
earlier than 10 AM.

57
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,880
And if you are back after 7 PM,

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,720
you will not be able to enter.

59
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,160
Third,

60
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,160
all the belongings have to be examined

61
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,390
before entering the manor.

62
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,880
What about our meals?

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,320
Will you examine the food we ordered as well?

64
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,750
You cannot order any takeouts.

65
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,750
The manor's own food supply chain

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,320
will provide you with the ingredients.

67
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,720
You can eat anything you want.

68
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,880
The delivery of the takeouts
will expose the address here

69
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,880
and it is unhygienic.

70
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,550
We will not order any takeouts.

71
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,830
No one will deliver food here anyway.

72
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,440
Another thing I need to remind you

73
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,550
is that although this place
is located in the same manor

74
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,520
as Mr. Lu's villa,

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,240
his villa has a separate gate.

76
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,470
No one is allowed to enter

77
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,880
without permission.

78
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,470
The most important point

79
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,270
is that the glasshouse is Mr. Lu's private space.

80
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,800
Please

81
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,320
stay away from it

82
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,750
or else.

83
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,750
Dr. Fu, please send Friday to Mr. Lu's villa

84
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,600

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,030
Of course.

We've arrived.

88
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,800
The armor is so heavy!

89
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,360

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,750
You made a robot based on my appearance?

93
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,160
And you want me to pretend to be it?

94
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,520
Are you out of your mind?

95
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,390
Miss Shanshan,

96
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,550
please let us explain.

97
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,080
It was mostly my fault.

98
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,320
I took your face

99
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,720
as the face of the model

100
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,960
and handed it to the factory.

101
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,440
Then why didn't you make another one?

102
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,080
We had no money.

103
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,030
I'm sorry,

104
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,000
but Miss Shanshan,

105
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,440
just as your name,
[*"Shan" means "kindness"]

106
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,630
you must be the kindest woman in the world.

107
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,800
Please, help us.

108
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,880
Yes, I am kind,

109
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,669
or how would you be able to enjoy

110
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,910

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,240
Where is your boss?

112
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,190
Why isn't he asking me for help?

113
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,160
Dr. Fu.

114
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,640
Our great Dr. Fu,

115
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,480
when did we become friends

116
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,040
who will help each other?

117
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,070
Do you remember what you said to me

118
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,390
when I sent you my resume?

119
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,480
Stupid

120
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,110
and useless.

121
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,440
I'm sorry.

122
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,200
I didn't mean to hurt you.

123
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,440
I was simply stating the truth.

124
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,350
I'm giving you another chance.

125
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,550
I will forgive you if you get out of the car,

126
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,830
apologize to me, say I'm a genius

127
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,000
and point out ten strengths of my work.

128
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,760
I only acknowledge real technology.

129
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,110
See?

130
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,950
So please leave

131
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,040
and delete my number.

132
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,350
Also, use another face

133
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,350
for your precious robot.

134
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,880
From now on, don't reach out to me

135
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,670
even if he's gone crazy

136
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,110
or your robot starts to malfunction.

137
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,950
If I ever see you again,

138
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,920
I will sue you

139
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,350
for violating portrait rights.

140
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,320

00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,670
50,000 yuan.

142
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,640
If you are willing to be Friday for a day,

143
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,040
I will give you 50,000 yuan.

144
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,230
I know it is not a lot...

145
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,720
Do I look like someone who only cares about money?

146
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,790
I can show you all the technologies

147
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,720
Friday involves.

148
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
I know the reason

149
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,790
why you are coming all this way

150
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,440
to deliver the pizza is our technology, right?

151
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,040
Deal.

152
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,000
It really looks just like me.

153
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,070
Friday,

154
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,880
say hello to her.

155
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,790
Hello, Yang Shanshan.

156
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,510
Hello, Friday.

157
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,070
This... This is so cool!

158
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,640
(I feel so amazed and happy.)

159
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,720
(What's going on?)

160
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,390
(Such an extraordinary robot)

161
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,070
(looks just like me!)

162
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,040
You have to mimic the way she behaves.

163
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,390
Lu Sen had a conversation with her before.

164
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
She can speak 26 languages,

165
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,920
ten of which are minority languages.

166
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,830
You,

167
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,880
have to know at least three of them.

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,720
Yang Shanshan,

169
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,160
this is how you normally behave,

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,670
but Friday,

171
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,230

She's smart

518
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:12,495

519
00:26:12,975 --> 00:26:14,185
I have a feeling

520
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:16,735

It's all my fault.

578
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:50,585
You didn't test the defense system

in the right place?

582
00:29:59,785 --> 00:30:01,185
The control system is so unstable,

A robot will not curse.

590
00:30:26,135 --> 00:30:27,705
It's a disorder of the language system.

591
00:30:28,305 --> 00:30:29,455
To provide you with a better experience,

592
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:30,615
we installed four more language systems.

But we haven't tested them all,

Initialing such an unprepared project

600
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,975
is irresponsible to the customers of IMU.

601

00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,265
we haven't got the money yet.

690
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:48,985
We will change it immediately when we receive it.

691
00:35:49,195 --> 00:35:49,745
This

692
00:35:50,155 --> 00:35:51,395
is to pay for your work today.

693
00:35:56,225 --> 00:35:57,225
I will take this.

694
00:35:57,435 --> 00:35:58,985
Save the rest for yourselves.

695
00:35:59,075 --> 00:35:59,595
Alright.

696
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,195
I'm leaving.

697
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:31,985
This guy

698
00:36:32,225 --> 00:36:33,945
not only lives in a strange place

699
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:36,945
but also fails to tell a person from a robot.

700
00:36:38,745 --> 00:36:39,505
Forget it.

701
00:36:39,505 --> 00:36:41,435
I will forget about your final payment.

702
00:36:41,705 --> 00:36:43,465
Consider it my compensation for lying to you.

703
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,155
Such a weird fool.

704
00:36:49,115 --> 00:36:49,745
Master,

705
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,595
your sugar intake today has exceeded the limit.

706
00:36:51,595 --> 00:36:53,265
Please reduce the consumption
of the relevant food.

707
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:54,545
Max,

708
00:36:55,025 --> 00:36:57,835
when you are too serious about your work

709
00:36:57,835 --> 00:36:59,985
and fail to be flexible, it's dull.

710
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:00,975
[Sugar]

711
00:37:07,635 --> 00:37:08,305
Master,

712
00:37:10,155 --> 00:37:11,355
Timely energy intake

713
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:12,595
can boost work efficiency,

714
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:13,595
but please don't be excessive.

715
00:37:26,465 --> 00:37:27,155
Master,

716
00:37:27,635 --> 00:37:29,595
your collection proves your insight.

717
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:30,635
Could you tell me more about it?

718
00:37:37,675 --> 00:37:38,265
Master,

719
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:39,355
let's play together.

720
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:44,075
This is the robot

721
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:46,025
I want to have.

722
00:37:55,785 --> 00:37:56,435
Lu Sen?

723
00:38:00,265 --> 00:38:01,115
How's it going?

724
00:38:07,305 --> 00:38:08,225
Starting from tomorrow,

725
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:10,305
send Friday to the villa for a month.

726
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,115
I need to evaluate it thoroughly.

727
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:16,025
Did we agree

728
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:17,505
that it's a one-day evaluation?

729
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:18,225
What?

730
00:38:18,635 --> 00:38:20,985
As your superior, I need to explain my decision?

731
00:38:21,395 --> 00:38:21,985
Also,

732
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:23,355
about the deposit,

733
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:25,025
I've asked Secretary Si to make the transfer.

734
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:27,075
Thank you,

735
00:38:27,915 --> 00:38:29,785
but I'm afraid it's not going to work.

736
00:38:31,355 --> 00:38:32,915
Give me an acceptable reason.

737
00:38:34,075 --> 00:38:35,075
It's the power.

738
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:37,195
Friday has powerful features,

739
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:39,195
which consumes the battery rapidly.

740
00:38:40,155 --> 00:38:41,675
It operates for only a short period of time.

741
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,435
Give me a week

742
00:38:43,985 --> 00:38:45,195
to switch the battery,

743
00:38:45,195 --> 00:38:46,875
and this can be solved permanently.

744
00:38:47,155 --> 00:38:47,985
I don't care.

745
00:38:48,265 --> 00:38:49,985
As long as it works
when there's some battery power left.

746
00:38:49,985 --> 00:38:52,025
She can stay in the lab to get charged
for the rest of the time.

747
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:54,155
We really can't do that.

748
00:38:56,705 --> 00:38:58,305
Don't bargain with me.

749
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:00,635
I need to see Friday tomorrow,

750
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:02,465
or you are going to pay for breaking the contract.

751
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:13,875
So,

752
00:39:15,115 --> 00:39:17,075
why are the parts in Africa?

753
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:20,225
It was 3-2 just now, right?

754
00:39:20,395 --> 00:39:20,915
Come on.
