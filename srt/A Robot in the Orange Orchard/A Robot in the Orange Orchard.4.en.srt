Shanshan.

77
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,110
You've been working on this lamp for half a year,

78
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,880
but there's still no progress.

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,030
That's not true.

80
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,390
You may not see much change on the surface.

81
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,390
But in fact,

82
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,960
it has taken a qualitative leap.

83
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,440
For example, my Love Lamp

84
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,630
can light up already.

85
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,670
Lamps are designed to light up.

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,240
Isn't it incredible?

87
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,080
Can my lamp be compared to your ordinary lamp?

88
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,110
This is what carries my expectations and dreams,

89
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,880

What did she tell you?

About... about dreams.

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,830
Don't listen to her nonsense.

114
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,790
You should be focusing on your studies now,

115
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,790
not daydreaming.

116
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,670
Studying hard and getting full marks,

117
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,000
is all you need to do.

118
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,350
Getting full marks is indeed my dream.

119
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,950

how's the job search going?

130
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,320
Not really satisfied.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,790
Since you don't have
much work experience, it's natural

132
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,160
for people to be dissatisfied with you.

133
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,320
Just keep searching.

134
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,200
That's right, keep searching.

135
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,790
It's not that they're dissatisfied with me.

136
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,920
I'm the one who's not very satisfied with the job.

137
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,110
I think

138
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,000
it's good to work part-time now.

139
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,880
The most important thing

140
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,510
is that I can allocate my time freely.

141
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,480
I can do something I like...

142

Allocate your time freely?

143
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,230
Just for the junk of yours,

144
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,790
am I right?

145
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,640
-Guangliang.
-I...

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,760
Those are not junk.

147
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,790
I invented them

148
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
because others need them too.

149
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,790
And Uncle,

150
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,160
if you get to understand more,

151
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,670
you will like them too.

152
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,510
My lamp

153
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,920

I just hope

164

you can find a good job

165
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,040
and be down to earth.

166
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,230
This way,

167
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,000
I can be answerable to your mom.

168
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,350
If my parents were still around,

169
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,950
they would definitely support me.

00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,230
Support you in what?

171
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,760
Support you in messing around
with that stupid umbrella,

172
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,720
and getting into debt

173
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,790
because of the bank loan?

174
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,480
It's not that you can't invent anything.

175
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,510
But you haven't had

176
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,320
a job

177
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,200
since graduating from college.

178
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,920
Is invention easy?

179
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,720
If it were that easy,

180
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,200
everyone would have become a scientist.

181
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,390
I'm an adult now.

182
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,920
I can take responsibility for myself.

183
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,950
You... What kind of attitude is this?

184
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,950
Guangliang!

185
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,640
Can you stop it?

186
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,110
Can we just have our dinner first?

187
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,070
I just want her to realize

188
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,070
that we are just plain ordinary people.

189
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,350
Those so-called designs or inventions,

190
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,440
you can't make a living out of them.

191
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,160
Guangliang!

192
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,950
This has been my dream since I was a child.

193
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,830
It is also a promise between me and my father.

194
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,110
I don't ask for your support.

195
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,550
But can you stop breaking my spirit,

196
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,390
even if it's only for a day?

197
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,040
I'm not trying to break your spirit.

198
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,920
I promised your mother

199
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,320
that I'd take good care of you.

200
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,950
Words like "take good care"
are that easy to act upon?

201
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes, I'm just an ordinary person.

202
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,920
But I'll keep going.

203
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,640
You're really hopeless.

204
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,880
Can't you keep a guard on your tongue?

205
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,670
It's not easy to get Shanshan back for dinner!

206
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,350
Shanshan! Shanshan!

207
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,390
The water is boiling. It's boiling.

208
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,110
Add some veggies.

209
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,910
We need more vitamins.

210
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,470
Richard,

211
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,280
stop reading.

212
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,670
Are you sick?

213
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,320
Nope.

214
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,030
I... I'm kind of hungry.

215
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,670
Aren't food and accommodation included?

216
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,400
Food's ready.

217
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,840
Come over.

218
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,030
Smells good.

219
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,840
Thank you.

220
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,000
Have you

221
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,590
cooked frogs in this?

222
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,080
We are into artificial intelligence,

223
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,760
not artificial breeding.

224
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,590
At most, we have boiled motor oil and the like.

225
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,640
That's even more disgusting.

226
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,400
This is what you guys usually eat?

227
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,790
At least, we have something to eat.

228
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,590
Thanks.

229
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,000
What's that?

230
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,150
That's Mini C.

231
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,080
Don't judge by its size.

232
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,320
It's also a product of artificial intelligence.

233
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,110
Every day, it picks up various wireless networks

234
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,590
in our laboratory,

235
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,000
and it's also good for shifting small stuff.

236
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,880
Why is it called Mini C?

237
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,710
Because it's our pet,

238
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,550
the center of attraction.

239
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,880
So why not promote it?

240
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,550
Promote it?

241
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,320
Who's going to buy it?

242
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,400
It's made up of scraps,

243
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,350
with unflattering appearance

244
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,350
and outdated technology.

245
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,080
Although you mentioned that it's made of scraps,

246
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,470
I wonder who's that person

247
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,910
who squatted there and repaired it all night

248
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,320
when Mini C's system got burned out.

249
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,440
Mini C was the work of Senior Pai Song

250
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,960
in the UK laboratory.

251
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,760
She's had it with her since she came back.

252
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,400
Hi, Mini C.

253
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:17,700
[Hello]

254
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,110
According to seniority,

255
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,960
you should be called "uncle".

256
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,150
Uncle?

257
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,080
I... I'm just joking.

258
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,150
Pai,

259
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,470
you look so young.

260
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,960
Why do they address you as "Senior"?

261
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,030
Because of her good grades,

262
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,880
she kept skipping grades,

263
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,110
hence saving a lot on tuition fees.

264
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,590
So you are a genius.

265
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,200
Is there anyone here who isn't a genius?

266
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,880
You're already the bottom line for Team Alpha.

267
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,110
But I am also 25 points

268
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,470
above ordinary people.

269
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,280
When placed among the crowd,

270
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,790
it's also considered
as a progress of human society.

271
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,470
It turns out that I'm the ordinary people

272
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,520
you guys are talking about.

273
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,880
No, you're not ordinary.

274
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,350
That's because I've been
around you guys long enough,

275
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,320
which turns me into a genius too.

276
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,880
The IQ of ordinary people has to reach 90.

277
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,640
Yours is not enough.

278
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,640
Is your high IQ useful?

279
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,110
I don't see you using your brain much either.

280
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,520
You might as well take your brain out,

281
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,640
sell it on the second-hand market,

282
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,110
and use the money to pay Alpha's electricity bill.

283
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,640
What's your full name?

284
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,470
My full name is Li Chade.
["Li Chade" sounds similar to "Richard"]

285
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,280
My dad's surname is Li,

286
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,960
and my mom's hoping
that I can be like the great physicist,

287
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,230
Richard Feynman.

288
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,280
Who's that?

289
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,470
I don't know him.

290
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,640
Dayun,
[*meaning "good luck"]

291
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,030
why were you given this name?

292
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,350
To compensate for what's lacking.

293
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,960
Pai Song,

294
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,790
could "Pai" be your surname?

295
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,200
My dad's surname is Pai, and my mom's surname is Song.

296
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,230
In "The Thousand Family Names",

297
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,710
the surname "Pai" is the 2017th surname.

298
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,200
The Thousand Family Names?

299
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,080
You can even remember that?

300
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,760
Do you guys know about sun worms?

301
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,080
Protozoa,

302
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,910
Sarcodina,

303
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,880
single-celled organisms.

304
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,910
That's it.

305
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,200
There is one of us here

306
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,640
who is just like a sun worm.

307
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,150
His name

308
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,710
contains the character "Yang".
[*"Yang" means "sun"]

309
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,030
Do you know why he's like a sun worm?

310
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,400
He's like a single-celled organism.

311
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,350
Really.

312
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,880
And he's worse off than that worm.

313
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,960
Our boss mentioned

314
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,200
that he only needs science and robots.

315
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,760
Humans can no longer satisfy his desires.

316
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,880
Have you finished eating?

317
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,590
Then the rest is mine.

318
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,110
I'm going to take everything.

319
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,710
Scoop some for me.

320
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,960
Pass me the chopsticks. Chopsticks!

321
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,110
The secret is safe with me.

322
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,030
Vectra,

323
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,590
we have another new friend.

324
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,470
A friend who's very much like a human.

325
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,110
Dear Master,

326
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,150
good morning.

327
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,230
Today, I'm going to input

328
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,550
the rules and restricted areas of my house.

329
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,790
See that glass house?

330
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,590
That is the place

331
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,230
where you are not allowed to enter.

332
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,590
Have you keyed in?

333
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,470
Yes.

334
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,440
This is my photo wall.

335
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,910
These are the most important people to me.

336
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,030
Key them in.

337
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,790
Are they your parents?

338
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,590
Where are they now?

339
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,030
They've been gone a long time.

340
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,000
I've been living here

341
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,840
for as long as I can remember.

342
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,280
But in the last few years,

343
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,550
I've renovated the place again.

344
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,760
You didn't expect your master

345
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,150
to have a flair for design, did you?

346
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,960
Hello, who's that?

347
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,550
(You thief, you're finally)

348
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,760
(answering the call.)

349
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,550
Thief?

350
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,030
You got the wrong number.

351
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,080
Did you take my necklace?

352
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,440
So it's you.

353
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,960
I'm warning you,

354
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,640
you have to drop that complaint.

355
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,440
Otherwise...

356
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,000
Otherwise, you'll never see

357
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,440
the light of dawn.

358
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,960
Before I sue you,

359
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,840
you'd better return it to me immediately.

360
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,840
Instead of paying me, you turn the tables on me.

361
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,550
You're...

362
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,470
If you don't

363
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,000
return the necklace today,

364
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,470
be prepared to receive
the summons from the court.

365
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,550
Don't let me see you,

366
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,320
or I'll bash you up every time I see you.

367
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,640
The necklace is...

368
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,440
It's something
that's also very important to me.

369
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,640
It's my parents' love toke

370
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,520
but has been stolen by a crook.

371
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,440
Maybe you wronged a good person?

372
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,790
Impossible.

373
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,470
Friday, key this in.

374
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,760
I, your master, hate deception the most.

375
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,200
Stealing a necklace and not admitting it

376
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,440
can be considered as deception.

377
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,230
I will make all those who deceive me

378
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,790
pay the price.

379
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,550
Friday,

380
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,110
please analyze this for me.

381
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,230
Were they in love

382
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,110
judging by the photo?

383
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,230
From the upturn of your mom's mouth

384
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,110
and the muscle texture
at the outer corner of your dad's eyes,

385
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,000
it can be inferred

386
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,550
that they were truly in love.

387
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,150
Shanshan has started work so early?

388
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,840
They were truly in love.

389
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,000
Who is this little girl?

390
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,710
Her name is Kang Li'er.

391
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
She

392
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:30,735
is a very important person to me.

393
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:34,225
Master,

394
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,985
what should I name this photo?

395
00:16:37,225 --> 00:16:38,175
My tummy...

396
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:39,495
Darn it.

397
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:42,375
Darn it?

398
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:46,175
The person in the photo has been saved as "Darn it".

399
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,425
I... I mean...

400
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:55,225
I've been wanting to ask

401
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:57,375
whether this card castle is a model?

402
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:58,905
It's huge!

403
00:16:58,905 --> 00:16:59,695
You can't go in.

404
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:02,545
This is another restricted area of my house.

405
00:17:02,785 --> 00:17:03,665
Only I

406
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:05,055
can go down this step.

407
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,495
I have built this card castle

408
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:09,425
on and off for fifteen years.

409
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:11,575
It can be considered a work of art.

410
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:13,855
(Come on. Hurry up.)

411
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:15,135
Get out of there.

412
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,095
Are you the only one using the bathroom?

413
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:18,975
Don't touch me.

414
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:19,855
Leave me alone.

415
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:21,545
You guys are also...

416
00:17:21,785 --> 00:17:23,585
I've been feeling unwell
since I woke up this morning.

417
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:27,065
The instant noodles we had last night
were brought from the old warehouse.

418
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:28,665
They've probably expired.

419
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:33,375
Shanshan.

420
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:36,455
Over here, you can see my collections.

421
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:37,255
And over there,

422
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:39,425
are the core kernel samples
of our company's products

423

of past generations,

424
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:43,855
which are very important to our company.

Friday.

426
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:47,975
Friday?

427

Where are you going?

428
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:54,785
I...

429
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:58,025
I would like to scan the bathroom.

430
00:17:58,585 --> 00:17:59,495
It's not necessary.

431
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:02,255
I'll emphasize again.

432
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:03,705
These are all...

What's that sound?

435
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:17,545
According to the scent analysis,

436
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:19,215
you farted.

437
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:20,975
Did I?

438
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:21,975
If it wasn't you,

439
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:23,455
could it possibly be me?

440
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:27,255
That's not possible.

441
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:29,735
But...

442
00:18:30,665 --> 00:18:32,025
Why didn't I feel anything?

443

00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,095
So, is your master not valuable?

505
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:55,615
Friday,

506
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,065
you are a robot.

507
00:23:57,255 --> 00:23:59,735
Your body is a murder weapon for humans.

508
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:00,905
Besides,

509
00:24:01,135 --> 00:24:02,425
don't you robots

510
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:05,095
follow Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics"?

511
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:07,425
Protecting the owner is the first law.

512
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,185
Let's put it this way,

513
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:14,785
even if you were to fall,

514
00:24:15,215 --> 00:24:16,665
you should avoid me.

515
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:19,585
(From the physics point of view,)

516
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:21,585
as compared to the velocity vector of my fall,

517
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,185
Mr. Lu,

518
00:24:22,185 --> 00:24:24,255
the velocity vector of your fall is larger.

519
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:27,255
So it is more reasonable
for you to dodge on your own.

520
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:29,975
From the physics point of view,

521
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:32,335
it is more reasonable
for you to dodge on your own, Mr. Lu.

522
00:24:35,065 --> 00:24:36,705
(I'm a real genius right now.)

523
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:39,825
Do you think you're smart?

524
00:24:40,135 --> 00:24:41,215
I'm talking about attitude.

525
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:42,305
Is that the attitude

526
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:43,335
you should have as a robot?

527
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:47,905
I don't understand what you mean,

528
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:48,425
Mr. Lu.

529
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:52,305
This robot still has a lot to learn.

530
00:24:55,135 --> 00:24:55,905
Let me ask you.

531
00:24:56,305 --> 00:24:59,905
If Dr. Fu and I both fell into the sea,

532
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:00,785
who would you save first?

533
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:02,305
(This is not an illusion.)

534
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:04,615
(I'm really fighting with a woman.)

535
00:25:04,785 --> 00:25:05,495
(Childish.)

536
00:25:06,945 --> 00:25:08,455
Of course, I'll save you first.

537
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:10,065
That's the correct answer.

538
00:25:10,615 --> 00:25:12,305
Because Dr. Fu knows how to swim.

539
00:25:15,585 --> 00:25:16,735
I know how to swim too.

540
00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:18,375
But in any case,

541
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,255
you should always put your master first.

542
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:20,785
Do you understand?

543
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:24,495
That's so perfunctory.

544
00:25:25,615 --> 00:25:26,375
Operation mode.

545
00:25:26,545 --> 00:25:28,665
(Do I have to switch
to an undignified status again?)

546
00:25:28,665 --> 00:25:29,825
(What is this guy going to do again?)

547
00:25:29,825 --> 00:25:31,305
I got it, Master.

548
00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:34,735
That's more like it.

549
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,025
I need to find a way

550
00:25:37,785 --> 00:25:39,375
to impress on you

551
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:41,975
that I'm the most important person to you.

552
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:01,825
IMU, stop.

553
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:04,375
Friday,

554
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:05,665
what can you gather from this?

555
00:26:05,735 --> 00:26:06,975
The dog is saving someone.

556
00:26:07,185 --> 00:26:07,735
That's right.

557
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,335
I'm that person

558
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:12,375
and you're that dog.

559
00:26:12,585 --> 00:26:13,945
When in danger,

560
00:26:14,095 --> 00:26:15,735
you have to save me just like the dog's

561
00:26:15,735 --> 00:26:16,495
saving its owner.

562
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,135
Take this as a command

563
00:26:18,135 --> 00:26:18,665
and key it in.

564
00:26:18,665 --> 00:26:19,735
The input is unsuccessful.

565
00:26:20,255 --> 00:26:21,615
The dog did that

566
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:22,615
because the owner

567
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,375
showered it with enough love.

568
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:25,705
Then...

569
00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:28,585
Then you have to show your loyalty

570
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:29,585
before I can love you.

571
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:30,855
If you love me half as much

572
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:31,665
as that person did,

573
00:26:31,665 --> 00:26:33,025
I'll do the same for you.

574
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,185
By the way, Friday,

575
00:26:39,785 --> 00:26:42,705
would you still recognize me

576
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,135
no matter what I've become?

577
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:47,215
What else could you be?

578
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:48,495
Isn't this what you are,

579
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:49,495
Master?

580
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:51,825
Wait here.

581
00:26:57,135 --> 00:26:58,135
That's strange.

582
00:26:58,975 --> 00:26:59,855
(Friday,)

583
00:27:00,905 --> 00:27:03,185
you have to study Mr. Lu thoroughly.

584
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,545
(He's a one-of-a-kind specimen.)

585
00:27:06,855 --> 00:27:08,825
He compared Yang Shanshan to a dog.

586
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:11,855
I really can't argue with that.

587
00:27:12,825 --> 00:27:14,495
I'm telling you guys that I can hear you.

588
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:24,495
IMU, continue playing.

589
00:27:38,215 --> 00:27:39,095
Friday!

590
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:42,095
Friday, help!

591
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:43,065
Help me!

592
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:44,665
Friday!

593
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:46,215
Friday, save me!

594
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:47,215
Friday!

595
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:51,185
Friday, help!

596
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:53,095
Quick! Save me, Friday!

597
00:27:53,335 --> 00:27:54,255
Friday!

598
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:00,375
Oh, it's Master.

599
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:04,065
It's a cat.

600
00:28:04,545 --> 00:28:05,255
It's Master.

601
00:28:05,585 --> 00:28:06,305
It's a cat.

602
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:07,735
It's Master.

603
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:13,095
I thought you said

604
00:28:13,095 --> 00:28:14,855
you can recognize any human?

605
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:16,425
Why can't you recognize me?

606
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:19,545
It's Master.

607
00:28:21,495 --> 00:28:22,305
It's Master.

608
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:23,585
It's Master.

609
00:28:23,975 --> 00:28:24,825
It's Master.

610
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:26,065
It's Master.

611
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,455
It's Master.

612
00:28:27,585 --> 00:28:28,425
It's Master through and through.

613
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:30,945
You're smiling.

614
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:33,455
Friday,

615
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:36,545
no matter what I've become,

616
00:28:37,455 --> 00:28:38,305
you have to recognize me.

617
00:28:41,945 --> 00:28:43,185
If you can do that,

618
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:46,495
I will cherish and love you.

619
00:28:46,785 --> 00:28:48,455
It sounds a bit sultry,

620
00:28:48,665 --> 00:28:50,305
but why does it feel

621
00:28:50,305 --> 00:28:51,945
like I am a real dog?

622
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:07,135
Now,

623
00:29:08,975 --> 00:29:10,975
I want to talk to you about something serious.

624
00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:13,025
If one day,

625
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:15,545
I turn into someone you don't recognize,

626
00:29:17,185 --> 00:29:18,705
go to the drawer of my bedroom,

627
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:19,705
take out the syringe

628
00:29:20,785 --> 00:29:21,705
and give me an injection.

629
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:24,185
Is that clear?

630
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:26,305
(Why does he look so solemn?)

631
00:29:26,495 --> 00:29:28,025
(Turning into someone I don't recognize?)

632
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:29,025
(What does he mean by that?)

633
00:29:29,455 --> 00:29:32,375
(This guy is childish and annoying)

634
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,305
(most of the time.)

635
00:29:33,615 --> 00:29:35,945
(But at times, he can appear really pathetic.)

636
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:37,095
(What's wrong with him?)

637
00:29:37,215 --> 00:29:38,495
If you can do that,

638
00:29:39,185 --> 00:29:40,495
you can disregard the points

639
00:29:40,665 --> 00:29:41,825
and go straight to being a cutie.

640
00:29:42,545 --> 00:29:44,975
(It feels like he has some secrets and worries.)

641
00:29:44,975 --> 00:29:46,375
(Wait for a second, Yang Shanshan.)

642
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:48,585
(Is this the time for you to care about others?)

643
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:50,615
(Don't forget about your purpose here.)

644
00:30:17,905 --> 00:30:19,735
As soon as you cleared some space,
your stomach starts growling?

645
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,615
Friday,

646
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:26,785
have you learned to cook this simple

647
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:27,945
seafood noodle soup?

648
00:30:28,665 --> 00:30:29,335
Simple?

649
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:32,945
It's just about putting in a bit more effort.

650
00:30:33,495 --> 00:30:34,705
You have to learn it as soon as possible,

651
00:30:34,705 --> 00:30:36,855
so I don't have to do it myself.

652
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:38,975
(If I had this talent,)

653
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:40,615
(I would be a big restaurateur by now.)

654
00:30:40,615 --> 00:30:42,455
(Who's going to have the time to entertain you?)

655
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:45,665
Try it?

656
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:47,305
Can I?

657
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:51,375
Although you are a robot

658
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:52,375
and can't really eat,

659
00:30:52,495 --> 00:30:55,185
I still want you to experience what it is like

660
00:30:55,185 --> 00:30:56,095
to be a human being.

661
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:00,975
Inhuman.

662
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:02,095
Moral decline.

663
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:03,215
Frenzied mind.

664
00:31:03,215 --> 00:31:04,335
Prodigy.

665
00:31:05,495 --> 00:31:07,735
In order to make
the dining environment better for you,

666
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:09,735
I'm going to play you a piece of music.

667
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:15,735
Max,

668
00:31:15,735 --> 00:31:17,665
play one of Master's
favorite classical music.

669
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:20,185
This is supposed to be your function.

670
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:21,305
What have you been doing before that?

671
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:23,905

Why is this being played all of a sudden?

682
00:31:46,735 --> 00:31:47,945
Max, turn it off.

683
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,375
Sure, Master.

684
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,455
Master,

685

this competition
has a very good influence on society.

686

Everyone is saying that IMU

687
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:59,735
has supported a lot of aspiring young designers.

688
00:32:00,255 --> 00:32:01,215
Master, it's really cool

689
00:32:01,215 --> 00:32:02,585
that your company is doing something

690
00:32:02,585 --> 00:32:03,735
so meaningful.

691
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:04,705
So?

692
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,975
Not long ago, it has been discontinued

693
00:32:07,975 --> 00:32:08,855
for some unknown reasons.

694
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:09,905
Everyone is very disappointed.

695
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:13,335
I'm the one who canceled it.

696
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:15,905
You canceled it?

697
00:32:16,495 --> 00:32:17,735
The cancellation notice

698
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:18,825
was made public,

699
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:20,665
and efforts were made to appease those involved.

700
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,455
Don't mention

701
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:23,495
such time-wasting issues again.

702
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:27,425
But there are many aspiring designers

703
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:28,735
who have been waiting for this opportunity.

704
00:32:28,735 --> 00:32:30,095
They've been waiting
for a talent scout like you

705
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:31,095
to discover them.

706
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:33,095
I, your master,

707
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:35,335
am the CEO and chairman of the group,

708
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:37,425
and I have no time to handle such trivial matters.

709
00:32:37,785 --> 00:32:39,095
If that's a trivial matter,

710
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,135
then in your eyes,

711
00:32:40,135 --> 00:32:41,705
what do you see as being important?

712
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:43,735
You have a lot of questions today.

713
00:32:44,975 --> 00:32:45,495
I...

714
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,025
just want to know more about you, Master.

715
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,090
Knowing what kind of person you are

716
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,570
can allow me to serve you better, Master.

717
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:53,905
As your master,

718
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:55,595
what kind of person am I?

719
00:32:57,425 --> 00:32:58,075
Firstly,

720
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:01,595
I'm a rich man.

721
00:33:01,835 --> 00:33:04,265
A rich man with lots of money.

722
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:05,835
So your life

723
00:33:05,835 --> 00:33:07,475
can only be described as being rich?

724
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:10,305
Not entirely.

725
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:11,505
Next,

726
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:14,635
I'm the absolute boss of IMU,

727
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:16,075
a young entrepreneur,

728
00:33:16,235 --> 00:33:17,715
and a person of great value

729
00:33:17,715 --> 00:33:18,875
to society.

730
00:33:20,305 --> 00:33:21,425
Is that all?

731
00:33:23,025 --> 00:33:23,955
Not really.

732
00:33:25,355 --> 00:33:28,665
What kind of person are you then, Master?

733
00:33:29,145 --> 00:33:29,995
Do you have dreams,

734
00:33:29,995 --> 00:33:32,505
or is there something

735
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:34,235
you want to fight for desperately?

736
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,995
Something to fight for desperately?

737
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:38,185
Yes.

738
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:40,835
It's...

739
00:33:43,545 --> 00:33:44,355
Friday,

740
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:46,075
is it your turn

741
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:47,905
to chat with me now?

742
00:33:48,955 --> 00:33:50,545
Can you see Mini Chen being busy over there?

743
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:53,665
You don't even feel bad chatting here with me?

744
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,905
You asked me here to key in the commands.

745
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,025
If I don't key in the commands,

746
00:33:59,265 --> 00:34:00,305
you are not able to do anything?

747
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:01,715
I've lost my appetite.

748
00:34:01,995 --> 00:34:03,115
Clear the dishes later.

749
00:34:06,235 --> 00:34:06,835
Also,

750
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:09,715
wash the dishes and mop the floor.

751
00:34:15,995 --> 00:34:17,875
You don't even know what kind of a person you are,

752
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,635
and you are still here instructing me?

753
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:20,985
Childish.

754
00:34:22,505 --> 00:34:23,115
Pai Song.

755
00:34:23,705 --> 00:34:24,545
Remember to improve

756
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:25,985
the waterproof function of Friday,

757
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:29,115
and it must be based
on Yang Shanshan's behavior patterns,

758
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:31,305
so as to ensure a seamless transfer in the future.

759
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:32,505
Sure, sir.

760
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:34,945
Now I understand

761
00:34:35,265 --> 00:34:37,355
why Yang Shanshan wants us to fix her lamp.

762
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:39,155
For the creative competition
in the advertisement just now?

763
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:43,195
I reckon she agreed

764
00:34:43,195 --> 00:34:44,155
to pretend to be Friday

765
00:34:45,075 --> 00:34:46,705
in order to convince Lu Sen
to restart the competition.

766
00:34:50,075 --> 00:34:52,635
I guess Yang Shanshan
really likes inventing stuff.

767
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,155
It's almost time.

768
00:34:55,435 --> 00:34:57,265
Today has finally passed safely.

769
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,155
Didn't you restrict me from coming down?

770
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:03,545
I'm coming down no matter what.

771
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,155
Didn't you ask me to do the cleaning?

772
00:35:05,155 --> 00:35:06,395
I'm not going to do it.

773
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:07,595
You don't know

774
00:35:07,595 --> 00:35:09,125
what kind of a person you are?

775
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:10,735
Here, let me tell you.

776
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:11,975
You

777
00:35:12,495 --> 00:35:14,125
are an unscrupulous capitalist who can destroy

778
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,775
people's dreams with a single word.

779
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:19,325
You are also a simpleton
who can't tell the difference

780
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,325
between a human and a robot.

781
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:21,885
What's more, you are a fool

782
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:25,935
who would celebrate the birthday of a robot.
