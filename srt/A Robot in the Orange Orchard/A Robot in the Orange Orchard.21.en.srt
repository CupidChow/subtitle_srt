1
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,700
(Episode 21)

2
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,870
(East and West Island, 21 km)

3
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,280
Isn't this too small?

4
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,650
If it's too small, you can leave.

5
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,159
It doesn't matter.

6
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,859
Whether it's here or at a hotel,

7
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,189
it's nothing like my home.

8
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,230
You're still full of yourself and you sound just as harsh.

9
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,359
You'll have to make do.

10
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,400
Hold on.

11
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,569
What's wrong?

12
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,300
If...

13
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,210
What if I want some water?

14
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,639
If you're thirsty,

15
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,909
there's a water purifier on the first floor.

16
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:23,280
There are also vending machines.

17
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:24,580
If you're hungry,

18
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,349
there are complimentary instant noodles.

19
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:27,419
Any more questions?

20
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:30,889
Hold on.

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,919
What now?

22
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,759
What room are you in?

23
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,360
I...

24
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,770
Are we close enough to exchange room numbers?

25
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,240
No...

26
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,539
I just wanted to...

27
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,770
If I can't find something,

28
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,439
I can ask you.

29
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:57,120
If you want services like those of a five-star hotel,

30
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,819
get a room there.

31
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,180
If you still want to stay here,

32
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,349
just keep your mouth shut...

33
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:02,590
and stay in this room.

34
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,419
You can leave tomorrow.

35
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:04,960
Do you understand?

36
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,490
How did it get hacked?

37
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,219
Lu Sen isn't here right now.

38
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,530
I don't want any problems with Friday's project.

39
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,300
It's all done. Don't worry.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,860
I remember those two guys' faces.

41
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,000
I just saw this.

42
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,400
Lu Sen is now staying at the hostel of Yang Shan Shan's grandma.

43
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,310
What is going on?

44
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,439
I'll bring him back.

45
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,039
We'll go with you, Dr. Fu.

46
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,409
It's okay.

47
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,050
We're short-staffed in the lab now.

48
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,580
Dr. Fu is right.

49
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,319
Friday needs to be managed.

50
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,319
And what if you get hacked again?

51
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:10,250
I'll go with you.

52
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,219
It's easier for me to talk to Lu Sen.

53
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:12,990
Okay.

54
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:27,569
(Lu Sen)

55
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,310
(Lu Sen, Call connecting...)

56
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:36,350
Hello?

57
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,220
Lu Sen.

58
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,279
Are you at Xiang Hua Hostel?

59
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:43,089
How do you know?

60
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,529
Friday's prototype.

61
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:49,329
That part-timer called me...

62
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,100
and said that a strange man had been stalking her.

63
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,670
She's very scared.

64
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,129
She thinks...

65
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,339
you're a pervert and asked me to pick you up.

66
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:59,439
I just find them too similar.

67
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,240
It's fascinating.

68
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,410
I ended up here before I knew it.

69
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:05,879
Listen to me.

70
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:08,079
Just stay put.

71
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:09,379
Don't do anything.

72
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:11,019
I'll pick you up now.

73
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:12,819
Hang on.

74
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,250
You're on your way here now?

75
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:16,620
Yes.

76
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,959
Under such circumstances, how can I stay put in the lab?

77
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:22,060
Fu Yang.

78
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,860
Is she really just a character model?

79
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,699
You're not lying to me, are you?

80
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,209
What are you talking about?

81
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,810
Don't act rashly.

82
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,579
Wait for me.

83
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:45,480
We have to believe in Shan Shan.

84
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,579
After all, we've already discussed how to explain this situation.

85
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:54,389
I hope so.

86
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,930
What are you doing?

87
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:08,829
Oh, my gosh!

88
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,199
What are you doing up so late?

89
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,740
I couldn't sleep.

90
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,740
You can't sleep? Just go and...

91
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,550
Go and get some air by the sea.

92
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,620
Lu Sen.

93
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,620
Why aren't you in bed as well?

94
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,189
I'm just taking a walk.

95
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,259
Is this your first time in Xiwan Bay?

96
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,529
The night view here is beautiful.

97
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,560
Ask Shan Shan to take you to the beach.

98
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,899
Grandma.

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,569
I'm sleepy if he's not.

100
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,699
You look bright-eyed and alert.

101
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,310
Lu Sen is my VIP guest.

102
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,339
You have to take care of him.

103
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,810
Since when did he become a VIP?

104
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,480
I just decided that now.

105
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,050
Whoever is handsome...

106
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,680
is a VIP guest to me.

107
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,579
Go on.

108
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,860
Is that your grandma's house?

109
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,860
This isn't my grandma's house.

110
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,529
It's my friend's grandma.

111
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,560
I work part-time here.

112
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,300
That's amazing.

113
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,540
What's amazing?

114
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,709
I've never thought...

115
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,769
about strolling on the beach...

116
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:24,910
with Friday.

117
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:26,480
I'll say it again.

118
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,279
I'm a human, not a robot.

119
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,980
Stop saying that.

120
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,649
I'm 26 years old.

121
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,789
No, I'm turning 27 soon.

122
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,059
What about you?

123
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,320
We're about the same age.

124
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,230
Can I be your friend?

125
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,399
No.

126
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,570
- Why? - No reason.

127
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,399
I think it's going to rain.

128
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,039
I love the rain.

129
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,440
It was also raining that day.

130
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,649
And there were fireworks in the sky.

131
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,379
She was standing right in front of me.

132
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,490
Then all of a sudden...

133
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,389
Can I tell you...

134
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,259
about the story between me and Friday?

135
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:19,460
If you're not in a really bad mood,

136
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,070
I want to tell you my story.

137
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,669
I don't know why,

138
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:26,870
but you're the only one that I wish to tell it to.

139
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:36,809
Go ahead.

140
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,230
From the first day she was sent to my house,

141
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,360
I knew she was special.

142
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,850
But in the end,

143
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,019
I made a foolish decision.

144
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,720
I reset her.

145
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:17,990
It all...

146
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:19,759
came to an end.

147
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,090
What happened next?

148
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,129
Are you cured?

149
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,659
Are you still alone?

150
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,529
You didn't say any of that.

151
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,029
You can't just tell half of the story.

152
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,240
None of that matters.

153
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,669
Nothing matters.

154
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,970
But I want to know.

155
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,480
I'm cured and I've made friends.

156
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,879
But it still hurts...

157
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,549
deep down.

158
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,789
I found it hard to breathe for quite some time.

159
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:55,159
It has gotten better with time.

160
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,860
It's starting to feel like what Friday said.

161
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,070
Be strong and live bravely.

162
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,509
That's why...

163
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,710
I go to work alone.

164
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:12,740
I eat alone.

165
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,809
I go to the bookstores alone.

166
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,809
I go to the movies alone.

167
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,720
I travel alone.

168
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,090
It all seems so fulfilling.

169
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,919
But my heart feels empty.

170
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,429
If Friday knows,

171
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,860
she'll be very happy for you.

172
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:32,860
No.

173
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,299
This is what she'd say.

174
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,600
"Well done."

175
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,440
Why are you crying?

176
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,610
Are you not feeling well?

177
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,620
I just thought that your story was so touching.

178
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:55,850
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,490
I made you sad.

180
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,460
Then why did you say...

181
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,889
it was foolish of you...

182
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,289
to reset Friday?

183
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,730
If...

184
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,330
If you would be my friend,

185
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,340
I'll tell you.

186
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,740
You behave so much like Friday.

187
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,210
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,080
I forgot you don't like me saying that.

189
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,990
Okay, I'll be your friend.

190
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,019
Really?

191
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,960
But just for tonight.

192
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,169
Later on,

193
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:47,809
after Friday was reset,

194
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,409
I did everything I could.

195
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,080
I commanded her to do deep learning.

196
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,179
I kept inputting data.

197
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,080
But...

198
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,820
the Friday that I knew was never recovered.

199
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,389
And then I realized...

200
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,159
what she had made me feel was all real.

201
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,960
It's because I'm scared,

202
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:11,730
that's why I ignored it.

203
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:13,259
And...

204
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,230
I was punished for that.

205
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,570
So...

206
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,240
all I can do is sit here and keep telling you about her.

207
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,480
You've heard so much about me.

208
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,039
You must be sick of it.

209
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:29,610
Let's hear your story then.

210
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,250
Who is there in your family?

211
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
My family?

212
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,250
My mom's brother and his wife...

213
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,919
and my younger sister, En Bao.

214
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,490
Then you must be staying at your uncle's.

215
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,759
If you're here,

216
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,870
it means that you're not employed.

217
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,500
Next question.

218
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:56,769
Who do you want to see the most right now?

219
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,480
I miss my dad the most.

220
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,480
But he...

221
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,879
My dad passed away.

222
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,389
I remember when I was a kid,

223
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,559
he was a mechanic at a garage.

224
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,700
I felt as if he could...

225
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:20,460
fix any car no matter how broken they were.

226
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,700
I was so envious of him.

227
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,269
I wanted to be like him,

228
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,200
someone who can do what they do best.

229
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:29,240
So are you doing it now?

230
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,779
I...

231
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,679
You know what?

232
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:36,279
There's a gap between ideal and reality.

233
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,080
Sometimes, your talent and luck...

234
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,590
aren't good enough for your dream.

235
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,720
Since ages ago,

236
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,090
I've thought of myself as a useless person.

237
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,960
But I had this friend.

238
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,460
He always tells me...

239
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,899
that I am really competent.

240
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,269
He even trusts me.

241
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,600
He told me to hold on to my dream.

242
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,639
If your friend knows...

243
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:04,110
that he means so much to you,

244
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:06,539
he'll be very happy.

245
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,149
Is that so?

246
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,679
When a person knows...

247
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,990
that he means so much to someone,

248
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,620
he should be very proud of it.

249
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:23,960
Sure.

250
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,200
Then...

251
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,129
When I see him next time,

252
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,299
I'll definitely tell him.

253
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,779
I've heard so many stories about you tonight.

254
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:45,450
Then tomorrow, shouldn't you...

255
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:46,919
pull yourself together...

256
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,590
and get ready to leave?

257
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,750
I don't think...

258
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,620
we should see each other again.

259
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,399
Okay, you have my word.

260
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,120
Let's head back.

261
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:21,889
Okay.

262
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,429
Shan Shan.

263
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,740
Lu Sen is not only handsome,

264
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:42,570
but he's also a great cook.

265
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,809
You're really lucky to have made...

266
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,610
such a good friend.

267
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,009
Stop pouting.

268
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,480
Thank you, ma'am.

269
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:52,220
- This is for you. - Okay.

270
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,250
This is for you.

271
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,960
Right. Aren't you going shopping today?

272
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,629
How about this? Take Lu Sen with you.

273
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,659
He can carry things for you...

274
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,200
and you can show him around.

275
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,400
Check out the scenery.

276
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,730
I'm fine with that.

277
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,769
I'm really strong.

278
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,799
Grandma, he's leaving today.

279
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:14,970
Hello?

280
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,339
We have guests.

281
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,809
Are you checking in?

282
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,180
Yes, ma'am.

283
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,480
No.

284
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,779
Ma'am, we're not checking in.

285
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,819
We're here to pick someone up.

286
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,890
Excuse me, Ms. Yang.

287
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,490
Sorry to bother you for so long.

288
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,490
Don't do this again.

289
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,000
It won't happen again.

290
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,470
Lu Sen.

291
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:42,970
Pack your things.

292
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:48,269
We can leave after we help her with her shopping.

293
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:49,109
I don't need any help.

294
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,140
You'll be bothering Ms. Yang.

295
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,380
It's my birthday.

296
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,819
Your birthday?

297
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,950
It's on August 20.

298
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:02,220
Not today.

299
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:04,819
I don't celebrate it on August 20.

300
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,089
Li Er, I thought you knew that.

301
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,430
Why?

302
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,400
That's the day...

303
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,000
my parents were killed in a traffic accident.

304
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:17,269
Li Er is the only one who sends me a birthday card every year.

305
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,700
I'll leave tomorrow...

306
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,170
after celebrating my birthday.

307
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,539
This is my last request.

308
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,230
Everything here feels like a dream.

309
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:45,660
Once you wake up from it,

310
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,400
it's time to get back to reality.

311
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,500
Since fate brought you both back together again,

312
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,140
just enjoy the day.

313
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:55,609
Be good friends with him.

314
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,210
But I'm scared.

315
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,779
But I'm more scared...

316
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,210
that you'll regret in the future...

317
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,849
for giving him a cold shoulder and avoiding him today.

318
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,480
Lu Sen has spent so many years all by himself.

319
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,950
He cherishes every second he spends with you.

320
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,259
I can't...

321
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,519
I can't do this anymore.

322
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,660
I know...

323
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:17,859
how it is to be disappointed when you get your hopes up.

324
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,910
I saw a lot of good food over there.

325
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,140
Let's take a look.

326
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:30,440
Sure.

327
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:38,519
Give them some time alone.

328
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,920
But let's not lose track of them.

329
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:54,700
- Sir, can I have one of these? - Sure.

330
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,200
It's so hot.

331
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:57,029
What's this?

332
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,799
(Oden)

333
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,539
Is it good?

334
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,940
I've seen this on television.

335
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,269
It looks delicious.

336
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,309
It's nothing like the Kobe beef...

337
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,940
and Boston lobsters I've had at home.

338
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:08,480
I'm sorry.

339
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:09,250
Enjoy your food.

340
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,250
Come on.

341
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,890
Here you go.

342
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,960
How did you know I wanted to eat this?

343
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:30,299
Shan Shan, you're the best.

344
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,769
Sir.

345
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:35,039
Here's your candy.

346
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,240
I'll give you this.

347
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:40,539
Cotton candy.

348
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:57,359
The cotton candy is so good.

349
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,230
You two are walking too fast.

350
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,000
I swear.

351
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,299
Both of you will be on my blacklist of shopping buddies.

352
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,529
Li Er,

353
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,339
you bought quite a lot of stuff.

354
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,140
How about...

355
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,140
putting me on your blacklist too?

356
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,140
What?

357
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,549
Do you want me to add you to my blocked contacts?

358
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:16,680
Don't bother then.

359
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,490
These are the leaked documents.

360
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,789
I'm glad there wasn't anything important.

361
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,289
Didn't we already delete this file?

362
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,359
"Marmalade."

363
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:08,970
What does that mean?

364
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,200
I don't know.

365
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,900
I didn't set up this folder.

366
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,200
Me neither.

367
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,509
Judging by the name, Dr. Fu didn't set it up either.

368
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:17,970
Who else can it be?

369
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,210
Friday.

370
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,049
Did you set up the Marmalade folder?

371
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,250
Yes.

372
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:27,920
You did?

373
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:31,519
Friday.

374
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,089
You can't just...

375
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,829
restore any random file from the recycling bin.

376
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,059
It's not a recycled file.

377
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,700
This was generated before the reset.

378
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,200
You...

379
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,740
are also my most precious friend.

380
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:47,700
I could feel that Master was reluctant to delete it.

381
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:48,740
So the folder was set up.

382
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,450
(Marmalade)

383
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,279
What does it mean?

384
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,720
After the reset, wouldn't the file be automatically deleted?

385
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,690
That means the leaked documents...

386
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:09,289
are Lu Sen's videos on deep learning.

387
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,609
Have you decided what you're going to wish for?

388
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,349
I just hope...

389
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:37,119
the person I wish to see will appear before my eyes.

390
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:47,700
You can't say your wish out loud.

391
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,900
It won't come true if you do.

392
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,329
Make another wish.

393
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,400
It doesn't matter.

394
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,839
My wishes never came true anyway.

395
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,079
Thank you for celebrating my birthday with me,

396
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,079
Yang Shan Shan.

397
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,059
Thank you for remembering my name.

398
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,559
I wish I could tell Friday about you.

399
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,970
I think this is the end of our relationship.

400
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,740
Go back to your city tomorrow.

401
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,480
I'll stay on my island.

402
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:34,710
From now on,

403
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,079
let's live our lives well.

404
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,180
Okay.

405
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,829
It's almost ready!

406
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,960
We're coming.

407
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:57,829
Come on.

408
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,539
Light this.

409
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,680
I'm here.

410
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,039
Here you go.

411
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,150
Thank you.

412
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,089
Kang Li Er said that there aren't enough rooms.

413
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,490
So tonight,

414
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:26,960
we'll share a room.

415
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,740
I have presents for everyone.

416
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,099
This hot water bottle is for Pai Song.

417
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,140
And this Rubik's Cube is for Li Cha De.

418
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,640
This humidifier is for Da Yun.

419
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,109
You don't have an inner child,

420
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,380
so I got you this astronaut's water bottle.

421
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,490
Why are you buying us gifts?

422
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
That's not all.

423
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,359
I've decided that...

424
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,259
I'm going to spend every holiday with you.

425
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,559
For instance,

426
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,930
Children's Day,

427
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,869
Youth Day, and that...

428
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,640
Tree...

429
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,839
Arbor Day?

430
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,009
Yes.

431
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,680
Fu Yang.

432
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:18,880
You...

433
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,849
Do you know Shan Shan well?

434
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,019
No.

435
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,960
Why bring up Yang Shan Shan?

436
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,529
Because I think...

437
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,299
she's like the Friday...

438
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,000
I used to know.

439
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,140
No.

440
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:41,940
She's...

441
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:45,009
nothing like her at all.

442
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,849
Friday is the most perfect robot in the entire world.

443
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,289
But...

444
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,720
every time I see her,

445
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,130
it's as if I see Friday.

446
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:07,059
My heart beats so fast.

447
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,799
And there's the feeling of having...

448
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,140
grass growing in your heart.

449
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:16,809
I can't eat or sleep well when I don't see her.

450
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,480
But the moment I see her,

451
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,410
I feel happy.

452
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,019
What are you doing?

453
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,799
This is the necklace I gave to Friday.

454
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
Why do you have it?

455
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:33,519
Oh, my gosh!

456
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,819
Oh, my gosh!

457
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,190
Lu Sen.

458
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,329
Hear me out.

459
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:44,829
So...

460
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,700
you've been lying to me right from the start?

461
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,509
Lu Sen.

462
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,819
I remember the cup is...

463
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,079
So...

464
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,150
you've been lying to me too, right?

465
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,700
- Lu Sen. - Lu Sen.

466
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,799
- Lu Sen. - Lu Sen.

467
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:27,640
Don't touch him!

468
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,740
The syringe. Bring the syringe! Hurry!

469
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,769
The syringe!

470
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:34,480
Lu Sen!

471
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:44,549
Hurry!

472
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,299
What's going on?

473
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,940
Why didn't any of you tell me about something so important?

474
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,859
Shan Shan.

475
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,400
I'm asking you to be honest with me.

476
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:35,140
Okay?

477
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,420
Are you out of your mind?

478
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:53,319
You lied to a patient.

479
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,759
Someone who could die at any moment from an allergy.

480
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,930
I'm sorry.

481
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,259
I'm sorry.

482
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,099
I don't know what to do.

483
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,200
I'm sorry.

484
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,769
He had a relapse this time...

485
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,470
without being in contact with anyone.

486
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:12,410
Listen.

487
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,140
I've only seen two cases of Lu Sen's illness worldwide.

488
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,009
The other patient is Danish.

489
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:18,450
A while ago,

490
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,619
he died.

491
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,150
It was because the nurse that he had fallen in love with...

492
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,849
ran away with his money.

493
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,269
What are you doing?

494
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,230
Dr. Ou.

495
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:19,900
At least tell us how Lu Sen is.

496
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,539
You don't get it, do you?

497
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,940
Who on earth did this to him?

498
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,009
I'm sorry.

499
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:34,279
Please.

500
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,859
Lu Sen's current condition...

501
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:42,529
is worse than ever.

502
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,960
Even when I get close to him,

503
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,759
his condition worsens.

504
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:50,130
I can't even imagine...

505
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,839
how he'll react if he sees you...

506
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,339
when he wakes up.

507
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,019
Dr. Ou.

508
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:10,250
Is he out of danger now?

509
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,719
He's alive.

510
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,659
But his connection to the world...

511
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,199
has been ruined by you.

512
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:27,840
Then he...

513
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,340
Can he be as he once was?

514
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,909
It took me nearly 15 years...

515
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,309
to get him to how he used to be.

516
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,409
Do you think that's possible?

517
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,480
I'm begging you.

518
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:43,219
If you have any conscience,

519
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,349
stay away from Lu Sen.

520
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,059
The last person he wants to see right now...

521
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,730
is you.

522
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,900
Dr. Ou, I'm sorry.

523
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,809
Please take good care of Lu Sen.

524
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,949
Can you hand this over to him?

525
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,519
I'll make up for all the harm I've caused him...

526
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:17,750
in due course.

527
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:44,550
Shan Shan.

530

(Da Yun)

531
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,050
These are the gifts that Lu Sen got us...

532
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,820
before he got sick.

533
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:31,289
Lu Sen is so kind to us.

534
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,260
We don't deserve his gifts.

535
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,730
I don't even deserve to think about it.

536
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,969
I wonder if Lu Sen has even eaten.

537
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,000
It's such a big and cold house.

538
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,139
He's so sick,

539
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,579
but there's no one to care for him.

540
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,010
Someone can.

541
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:04,559
Friday belongs to Lu Sen.

542
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:07,500
We should return it to its rightful owner.
