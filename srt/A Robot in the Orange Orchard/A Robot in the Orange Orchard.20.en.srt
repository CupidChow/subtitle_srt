1
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,170
(Episode 20, Fateful Meeting)

2
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,170
Because I've already found a project...

3
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,480
that can bring new development to IMU.

4
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,510
If you're curious,

5
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,209
I can announce it in advance.

6
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,510
However,

7
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,650
on one condition.

8
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:54,319
What is it?

9
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,489
If the project is revealed...

10
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,489
and everyone agrees to it,

11
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,700
I wonder if Mr. Li has the guts...

12
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,430
to resign voluntarily.

13
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,439
I have a question for you.

14
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,680
How did IMU manage to gain its foothold so fast...

15
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:22,180
all these years?

16
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,280
Isn't it obvious?

17
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,349
It's our products, of course.

18
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,479
I think it's our tech.

19
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,349
No.

20
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,419
It's our users.

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,090
When my father was still around,

22
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:32,389
he told me this.

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,990
"Give me peaches, I will return you plums."

24
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,430
We trust our users.

25
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:40,569
Our users trust us.

26
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:43,330
That is why I paused Edge-N Project...

27
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,439
instead of aborting it.

28
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,469
I thought you'd get the hint,

29
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,469
sort out the breach...

30
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,210
and improve user security yourself.

31
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:52,210
Mark my words.

32
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,050
It's about the safety of our users' info,

33
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,650
not our tech.

34
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,050
Secondly, it's innovation.

35
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,349
We do not prioritize imitating or buying someone else's tech.

36
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,219
Instead, we put innovation first.

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,719
We were to gain a foothold...

38
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,860
by using our tech from the fundamentals.

39
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,129
Innovation?

40
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,300
The word "innovation"...

41
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,330
is music to anyone's ears.

42
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,770
So Mr. Lu,

43
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,969
are you going to present a new and innovative project...

44
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,740
that will impress...

45
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,680
old folks like us?

46
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,280
To explore upgrades to our AI,

47
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:29,810
we have intelligent humanoid companions.

48
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,520
As you all know,

49
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,750
I love researching novelties like these.

50
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,389
Now, let's hear it...

51
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,830
for the Companion Robot Team...

52
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,759
that created the world's first humanoid AIs.

53
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:05,520
Hello.

54
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,289
I'm the head of the Alpha Team,

55
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,319
Fu Yang.

56
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,990
- We're going to introduce... - Mr. Lu.

57
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,060
Don't tell me your new project is going to be led...

58
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,000
by a bunch of science frauds.

59
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,930
Give us a chance...

60
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,529
and we'll show you...

61
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:23,870
if we're frauds or not.

62
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,730
Hello, I'm Friday,

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,730
a new type of smart humanoid developed by Team Alpha.

64
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,000
With multi-sensor information fusion processors...

65
00:04:58,069 --> 00:04:59,470
and bionic technology,

66
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,540
I am developed to serve humans.

67
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,779
I am equipped with 20 deep learning capabilities...

68
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:05,779
in human emotions, intelligent speech,

69
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,850
AI healthcare, fintech,

70
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,449
and so on.

71
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,250
Please enjoy Friday.

72
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,920
This is just holography.

73
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,790
How do you pull it off?

74
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,189
Or rather, how did you not pull it off?

75
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,860
This is nothing but showboating.

76
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,930
It's only a pre-recorded video,

77
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,529
and you call that...

78
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,829
IMU's core project?

79
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,100
Lu Sen.

80
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,339
This bunch of frauds you hired...

81
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,600
must have a lot of tricks up their sleeves.

82
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,870
What else have you got?

83
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,040
Keep them coming.

84
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,410
By frauds,

85
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,649
do you mean Team Alpha?

86
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,279
Britain's most authoritative tech site...

87
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,279
has verified Dr. Fu's credentials.

88
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,689
Friday has prepared the report for you.

89
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:51,089
Please read it carefully and you'll see that it's real.

90
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,189
Nice one, Friday.

91
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:57,160
You did a good job.

92
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,560
You may go now.

93
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,629
Alright. Goodbye, everyone.

94
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,149
I'm sure that by now,

95
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,819
anyone who can read...

96
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,149
can tell that Dr. Fu wasn't lying,

97
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,420
in addition to knowing my prospects...

98
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,360
for this project.

99
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,560
If approved by vote,

100
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,629
Team Alpha will be IMU's core project team...

101
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:32,360
for the next five years.

102
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,870
They'll contribute to us...

103
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,370
more forward-thinking technology.

104
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,439
Now I'm asking you.

105
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,139
Mr. Li.

106
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,639
Will you resign?

107
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,350
It's me.

108
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,350
I failed you.

109
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,490
I hereby announce...

110
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:03,290
my resignation as Chief Operating Officer of IMU.

111
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,209
We'll see about that.

112
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:24,319
Just you wait.

113
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,089
Li Er.

114
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,930
How did the shareholders' meeting go?

115
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,730
Did Li Jing Cheng give you a hard time?

116
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,600
Of course he did.

117
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,439
But I won't let him trample on me.

118
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:48,470
You've got yourself a good partner.

119
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,610
Even I as his girlfriend...

120
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,310
didn't know about the meeting.

121
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,480
That means you have good taste.

122
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,009
You have a way with words.

123
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,750
I won't bother you about work.

124
00:07:58,819 --> 00:07:59,850
If only you tell me the truth.

125
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,819
I was worried sick out there.

126
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,720
Okay.

127
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,389
Actually,

128
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:07,329
Lu Sen came prepared.

129
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,689
It's still up to you and Friday.

130
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,300
That's the Alpha I chose.

131
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,329
Lu Sen.

132
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:22,769
Don't make me do it.

133
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,649
Listen up.

134
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,490
I have something to tell you.

135
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:47,100
I also have something important to tell you.

136
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,570
But you have to pay up first...

137
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,669
for this operation.

138
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,250
Here.

139
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,059
Shan Shan,

140
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,419
eat more vegetables.

141
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,389
It boosts your immunity.

142
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,490
Thank you, Uncle.

143
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,429
You're home early today.

144
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:19,500
I just didn't have much to do.

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,399
So that's why you came right after work.

146
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,570
Here.

147
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,070
Shan Shan?

148
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,070
Can I have one of your lights?

149
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,610
I want to give it to my tablemate.

150
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,049
I'd like one too.

151
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,649
Your aunt and I like them.

152
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,149
I can set up a unit.

153
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,389
You see.

154
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,820
Well, our wedding anniversary...

155
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:48,059
is around the corner,

156
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,929
and I want to gift this to her.

157
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,629
So when I think of her,

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,029
she'll see it.

159
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:55,899
Right?

160
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:57,970
Shan Shan.

161
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,000
You have to charge him.

162
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,299
No more under-the-counter.

163
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,139
Double the fee.

164
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,169
Let's make a toast...

165
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,080
for Shan Shan's invention, okay?

166
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,039
- Here. - Cheers.

167
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,309
- Cheers! - Cheers!

168
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,620
Thank you.

169
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,090
Lu Sen is busy with his work.

170
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,490
I'm so sorry that he asked me...

171
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:23,860
to treat you to dinner in his place.

172
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:24,629
It's okay.

173
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,299
He's just like that.

174
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,230
We're used to it.

175
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:28,330
No one is bothered, right?

176
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,870
Watch how you eat.

177
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:35,870
It seems that apart from work,

178
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,110
he hasn't met us much.

179
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,450
I wonder if seeing us reminds him of Friday.

180
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,879
And thinking of Friday makes him miss Shan Shan.

181
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,620
Right?

182
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,519
Indeed.

183
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,419
He may seem better than before,

184
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,559
but in reality...

185
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,889
You've been watching too many romantic dramas.

186
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,830
I think Lu Sen has been quite upbeat lately.

187
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,870
Dear.

188
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,669
If only you could pay attention to people...

189
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
one-tenth as much as you'd do to a robot.

190
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:16,879
Suddenly, I feel so full.

191
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,649
Why don't we...

192
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,820
take a walk later?

193
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,450
No, I'm not full yet.

194
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,860
All right.

195
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,659
Let's go for a walk.

196
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,000
Look at my belly.

197
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,100
Let's go.

198
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,399
I just remembered.

199
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,639
Friday is going to IMU soon.

200
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,210
Shouldn't we run the whole program again?

201
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,710
It will take you...

202
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:46,509
five to six days to do that.

203
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,379
That's if it's done automatically.

204
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,279
If the three of you run it separately,

205
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,620
we'll be done by tonight.

206
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:56,320
Then we wouldn't have the time to go to the bathroom.

207
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,029
So what are you waiting for?

208
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:10,029
I'm full.

209
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,970
Let's go.

210
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,009
Hurry up, Da Yun.

211
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,970
The last one has to clean up.

212
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:27,419
I knew you wouldn't give this for free.

213
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,490
Not bad.

214
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,389
You're looking more and more like a leader.

215
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,500
How absurd.

216
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:44,029
Where should we go for a walk later?

217
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,470
Come with me.

218
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:56,450
It's good, right?

219
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,120
No wonder you didn't eat at the dinner.

220
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,490
I didn't know there was such a good place.

221
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,659
This is my secret place.

222
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,860
I've eaten here since I was a kid.

223
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,129
When my parents weren't around,

224
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,330
I'd drop by here.

225
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:15,629
I don't know why,

226
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,340
but when the couple who run this place are around,

227
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,240
the noodles are exceptionally good.

228
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,370
Maybe I could use some company...

229
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:24,440
when I dine here.

230
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,549
What?

231
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,649
You didn't know this side of me?

232
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,919
You need to pay more attention to me.

233
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,389
I have a lot of surprises.

234
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
R240,

235
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,129
G235,

236
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,070
B205.

237
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,870
It's the RGB value of your favorite color.

238
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,309
Your car and most of your clothes.

239
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,840
They're all apricot-white.

240
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,409
You're 170cm tall.

241
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,320
And your shoe size is...

242
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:05,950
It's 37.

243
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,919
You never eat chopped onion.

244
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:09,850
You're even less interested in Western food.

245
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,759
You have a weak stomach so you only drink warm.

246
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:13,789
And...

247
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:16,860
you're a thrill seeker.

248
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,529
That's what I learned through observation.

249
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,740
So my attention on you...

250
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,840
is way over 10 percent.

251
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,480
What's the percentage?

252
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,120
It's about 56 percent.

253
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,990
You're not there yet.

254
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,029
Maybe 57?

255
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:54,370
Perhaps 58 percent?

256
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,039
Or 62 percent?

257
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,840
Maybe 62.2?

258
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,009
Perhaps 62.5?

259
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,009
Or 65?

260
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,649
Honey.

261
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,919
Look at this.

262
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,250
Is that the company...

263
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,860
that Shan Shan joined the competition for?

264
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:22,759
I think so.

265
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:24,730
It's IMU.

266
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,299
Why are you looking it up?

267
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,100
I need to find out if this company is for real.

268
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,539
I don't want her to be cheated like last time.

269
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,509
It's a big company, okay?

270
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,870
It's a listed company.

271
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:39,110
What do you know?

272
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:41,309
This website could be full of lies.

273
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,179
No.

274
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,049
I want to try sending my resume to them.

275
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,090
I need to investigate them.

276
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,860
We've spoken to HR.

277
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:58,360
We're sorry to keep you waiting.

278
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:00,559
I prepared a staff meal for you.

279
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,529
In the afternoon,

280
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,399
HR will be with you as soon as possible.

281
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:04,340
Okay.

282
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,309
How interesting.

283
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,409
It's fully automated.

284
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,409
Do they serve free staff meals here?

285
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,610
Yes.

286
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,279
What about the other perks?

287
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,600
What is this?

288
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,929
Your new invention?

289
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:34,830
It's kind of cute.

290
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:36,200
By the way,

291
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,169
your competition is over now.

292
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,399
What's your plan?

293
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:45,240
Suddenly, I don't know what to do.

294
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,509
But these days, I keep thinking about our childhood.

295
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,879
The days when I'd run wild by the sea with you.

296
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,120
Come to think of it, I want to visit our hometown.

297
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:57,789
That's great.

298
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,720
You should go see my grandma for me.

299
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,990
That old imp...

300
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,799
has been causing trouble for her homestay again.

301
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:06,759
A lot of trouble.

302
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,130
But she seems happy.

303
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,569
Sure.

304
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,769
I'll go back and check her out.

305
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,970
Welcome.

306
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,109
Not bad.

307
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,819
- Okay. - Hello, Mr. Lu.

308
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,619
What about accommodation?

309
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:28,220
We have living quarters.

310
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,349
Living quarters?

311
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,319
Is it free?

312
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,019
Is this taken?

313
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:33,160
Hello, Mr. Lu.

314
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,259
Let's go.

315
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,890
Mr. Lu.

316
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:39,799
Mr. Lu.

317
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:41,829
Hello, Mr. Lu.

318
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,240
It's quite a feast.

319
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,910
There's meat, greens, and fruits.

320
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,579
It will boost my vitamins.

321
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,480
Smile...

322
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,049
and ask naturally.

323
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:03,319
How's the food today?

324
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:10,559
It's not bad, but it could be better.

325
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,630
The MSG is a bit too much.

326
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:15,500
That's weird.

327
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:17,069
Everyone ran off when you showed up.

328
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,539
It is weird.

329
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,039
Aren't you eating?

330
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,279
Not bad.

331
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,079
It's decent.

332
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,410
Are you new here?

333
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:34,750
Yes, I am.

334
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:36,920
You're dressed too casually.

335
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,960
Dress up for work next time and wear your ID nicely.

336
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,190
Okay.

337
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:51,539
What do your parents do?

338
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,569
My parents?

339
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,410
Are they doing fine?

340
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,250
No.

341
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:08,690
They're both gone.

342
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,390
What a coincidence.

343
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:19,960
What's wrong with this kid?

344
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,569
When Shan Shan starts working here,

345
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,400
I'll have to keep her away from him.

346
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,670
Good.

347
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,839
I'm getting one step closer to my staff.

348
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,069
Where are you from?

349
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:33,440
I'm from Changzhou.

350
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,180
I'm from Xiwan.

351
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,549
Xiwan.

352
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:42,650
Is it great there?

353
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,559
I haven't been out of Changzhou much.

354
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,089
Xiwan is a small island.

355
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,990
It's different from this city.

356
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,859
It's exactly what it sounds like.

357
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,230
Xiwan is a place...

358
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,569
that makes you forget your troubles.

359
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:04,579
A place to forget your troubles?

360
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,630
I'll leave the company to you.

361
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,730
If Li Jing Cheng does anything suspicious,

362
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,500
call me right away.

363
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,009
Hello.

364
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:15,480
Hello.

365
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,650
May I know your name?

366
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,089
Do we know each other?

367
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:29,559
I have a friend who looks just like you.

368
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,430
Is that so?

369
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,630
That's an old pick-up line.

370
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,299
I'm serious.

371
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,000
Listen here.

372
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:41,269
If you harass me again, I'll call the police.

373
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,150
Hey.

374
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,289
Hello, Fu Yang.

375
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:57,819
Can I ask you something?

376
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,789
What is Friday's face based on?

377
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,799
There was a model.

378
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,029
So it's not built from scratch.

379
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:09,200
Friday's face, movements, and habits...

380
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:12,000
were created and modeled with reference...

381
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,640
to real-life people.

382
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,269
Why do you ask?

383
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,009
I was just curious.

384
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,980
If you see some random girl on the street...

385
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,509
who looks exactly like Friday,

386
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:23,279
how would you feel?

387
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:26,019
That's highly unlikely.

388
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,089
But if...

389
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:30,750
If you've come across the person...

390
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:32,490
which Friday is based on,

391
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,990
I want you to pretend you don't know her.

392
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,299
Because...

393
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,859
when she worked on the project,

394
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,099
she requested...

395
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:44,970
that no one shall intrude on her personal life.

396
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,970
Do you understand?

397
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,569
Okay.

398
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,069
Did you run into her?

399
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,269
I said I'm just curious.

400
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,650
I'm sorry. I'm late.

401
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,329
Dr. Fu.

402
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:14,559
Look at these.

403
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,069
Can you tell me who she is?

404
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,799
Is she also Friday?

405
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,609
Or shall I answer for you?

406
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,710
Well,

407
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:25,279
she's not a robot.

408
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,839
She's a real person.

409
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,309
Right?

410
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,720
Why isn't Fu Yang picking up at this critical moment?

411
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:50,970
I ran into Lu Sen.

412
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,140
I have a bad feeling about this.

413
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:54,240
Call me when you get this message.

414
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,079
She is...

415
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,250
indeed a real person.

416
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:09,819
She's the model Friday is based on.

417
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:12,890
You can call her a live model.

418
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:14,690
Does this have anything to do with you, Mr. Li?

419
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,930
It doesn't matter.

420
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,930
But the one with Lu Sen,

421
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,430
is it Friday or is it her?

422
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,170
I don't understand.

423
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,140
What do you mean?

424
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:29,740
Don't play dumb, Dr. Fu.

425
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:33,079
Everyone knows what you were up to in the UK.

426
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:35,180
You're a bunch of intellectual rogues...

427
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,380
with no reverence for science.

428
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,349
You're frauds.

429
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,579
I wonder how you enchanted Lu Sen...

430
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,019
to gamble the entire future of IMU...

431
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,519
with you on this.

432
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,220
You're not getting away with it.

433
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:48,690
You're absolutely making a personal attack on me.

434
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,029
Alpha only answers to Mr. Lu.

435
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,400
We don't need your approval.

436
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:53,700
And let me ask you.

437
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,329
All info about this girl is private and confidential.

438
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,799
How did you obtain it?

439
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,210
You must have resorted to underhanded means.

440
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,569
You snooped on the project in private.

441
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,779
That, I'll tell Mr. Lu.

442
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:07,079
He'll deal with you.

443
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,880
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

444
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,089
Keep an eye on him...

445
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,589
over there.

446
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,900
And keep me posted if anything.

447
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,230
Yes, Mr. Li.

448
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,839
Friday.

449
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,309
Do you know me?

450
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,079
I want to get to know you too.

451
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:47,849
Stop!

452
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:54,990
Who are they?

453
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:55,990
Dude, relax.

454
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:58,829
We're from IMU's Design Team.

455
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:01,400
How did you get here before us?

456
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:02,930
Do you have to move now?

457
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
The professor isn't back yet.

458
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:05,170
We're here today...

459
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,400
just to take a measurement in advance.

460
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,269
We have to do this to arrange...

461
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:11,039
a lab for you scientists later.

462
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,509
We're almost done.

463
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,980
Now, it's all down to this part.

464
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,880
Yes.

465
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,220
Ask me if you have any issues.

466
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,480
Please don't tamper with anything, okay?

467
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,549
Okay.

468
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,750
Come here, Da Yun.

469
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:23,549
What is it?

470
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,259
You guys go ahead. We'll be quick.

471
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,089
This marmalade folder.

472
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,660
- Did you make it? - No.

473
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:30,930
Did you?

474
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,829
No, not me.

475
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,559
Maybe it's just junk.

476
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,200
If it's of no use, delete it.

477
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:38,640
Write it down.

478
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:39,740
Sure.

479
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:41,670
Length.

480
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:43,970
Forty-five.

481
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,009
The Trojan horse is in.

482
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,349
Start deciphering.

483
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,650
Analysis completed.

484
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,319
Hash encryption and message digest algorithms...

485
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,289
are within range.

486
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,829
Is everything alright?

487
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,430
Yes.

488
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,130
We're done measuring.

489
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,829
We'll get going then.

490
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,039
See you later.

491
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:14,240
Bye.

492
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:15,069
Bye.

493
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:18,480
Come on.

494
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,109
She's stunning.

495
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,049
Your Friday...

496
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,319
is stunning.

497
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,319
Silly us. Thank you.

498
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:36,859
Shan Shan, you're back.

499
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,259
Shan Shan, you're home.

500
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:41,029
Okay, have fun. Be good.

501
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,130
Mr. Kang. Mr. Liu.

502
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,640
You're back.

503
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:47,500
Look at her.

504
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:48,609
She bought crabs...

505
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,440
for Grandma Tang when she's away.

506
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,109
Have fun. I'll go in first.

507
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,980
Okay.

508
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,450
Come on.

509
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:08,220
How did a virus get in?

510
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:09,160
We're still checking.

511
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,230
Pai Song,

512
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,599
analyze virus pattern and restore system.

513
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:15,029
Da Yun,

514
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,299
counter-pursuit the output path.

515
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:17,299
Li Cha De,

516
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,740
check if there are any leaked documents.

517
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,000
- Got it. - Got it.

518
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,220
The virus was implanted externally...

519
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,279
at 2:23 pm.

520
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:35,890
Who was here?

521
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:39,789
We're here today...

522
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:41,930
just to take a measurement in advance.

523
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,930
We have to do this to arrange...

524
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,630
a lab for you scientists later.

525
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,259
Yes.

526
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's those two.

527
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,039
Deploy your defenses.

528
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,039
Let not a single file on Friday leak out!

529
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:56,069
- Okay! - Okay!

530
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,339
Dr. Fu.

531
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:02,579
I found the IP.

532
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,480
It's from Yunlin district in Changzhou.

533
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:05,579
Pai Song.

534
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:08,079
Reverse the output path and send the virus back at once.

535
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,920
Got it!

536
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,230
What kind of people are they?

537
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,759
They're not skilled enough...

538
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,400
to take on the Alpha Team.

539
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,970
- Check it again. - Okay.

540
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,869
Even if it's backed up, it can't be leaked.

541
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,210
I got a call from the Design Team.

542
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,180
The measuring has been delayed.

543
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,009
They didn't send anyone today.

544
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:09,579
Who could it be?

545
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,750
What's wrong?

546
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,160
We only got a few files.

547
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:20,490
We have to decrypt them.

548
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,859
Can you crack them?

549
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,789
The files are encrypted in a weird way.

550
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,059
We'll do our best.

551
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,170
Grandma.

552
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,299
I'm home.

553
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,769
You're back, Shan Shan.

554
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,809
I missed you so much.

555
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:37,369
Let me take a look.

556
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,170
Grandma, look.

557
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,079
It's for you.

558
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:41,980
You've lost a lot of weight.

559
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:42,880
Who, me?

560
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,220
Do you mean the crabs?

561
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,519
You're thinking about them, aren't you?

562
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,950
Of course, it's you.

563
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,450
Why did you lose so much weight?

564
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:52,759
Did you break up?

565
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,690
I didn't even make out.

566
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,059
What made you think of that?

567
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,529
I'm just on a diet.

568
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,759
Don't I look better?

569
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:00,430
But you're still prettier.

570
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,799
You're such a sweet talker,

571
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,069
unlike Tang Tang.

572
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:08,069
She'd point at my wrinkles,

573
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,740
saying that I look like a pleated skirt.

574
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:10,940
It's awful.

575
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,309
You see,

576
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,079
she's only playing mind games.

577
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,180
She's jealous...

578
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,410
and afraid you're prettier than her.

579
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:22,549
Looks like you've spread honey on your lips.

580
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:24,089
You know what?

581
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,289
When I'm here,

582
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,089
just let me do all the work.

583
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,190
Look at you.

584
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:31,289
You just came and you already want to work.

585
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,700
Don't do this to me.

586
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,430
You should get some rest.

587
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:36,029
Hello.

588
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,900
Can I stay here?

589
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,599
Of course.

590
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,769
Young man.

591
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:45,380
I can tell that you're here on vacation.

592
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,180
Is it just you alone?

593
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:50,650
Yes, just me.

594
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:54,049
Hey, aren't you that pervert?

595
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,920
Are you stalking me?

596
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,259
He doesn't look like a bad person.

597
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,990
I didn't expect to see you here either.

598
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:06,730
Maybe we're fated to meet.

599
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,569
Yes, you are.

600
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:12,039
You are fated indeed.

601
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:13,069
Young man.

602
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,000
We have a lot of rooms here.

603
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:16,539
Come on in.

604
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:17,869
Come in.

605
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,180
Grandma, it's not appropriate.

606
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:21,680
Why not?

607
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,180
Go get some tea.

608
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,210
Come on.

609
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,289
Lu Sen secretly followed me back to my hometown.

610
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,690
Do something, guys.

611
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,430
I'm afraid he'll recognize me.

612
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:45,769
Shan Shan.

613
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,339
Hello.

614
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,369
What's up, Shan Shan?

615
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:50,640
Da Tang Zi.

616
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:51,670
Well...

617
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,380
You see...

618
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,579
He's at Grandma's place.

619
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,450
What should I do?

620
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,619
Really?

621
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:01,880
I guess...

622
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,589
fate must have brought you together.

623
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,660
Stop it.

624
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,390
My heart is beating so fast right now.

625
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,490
Tell me, what should I do?

626
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,059
That's easy.

627
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:13,230
Just treat him...

628
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,230
like a stranger you met...

629
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:16,529
for the first time today.

630
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,900
No matter what he does,

631
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,740
you two just got to know each other today.

632
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:22,269
But...

633
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:23,769
No buts.

634
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:25,579
I have to go now. I have a customer.

635
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:55,039
Shan Shan.

636
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,869
What's taking the tea so long?

637
00:33:58,609 --> 00:33:59,309
I'm coming!

638
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,050
Grandma.

639
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,119
How much do you make a month?

640
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,860
Excuse me.

641
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,730
That's a secret.

642
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:31,710
Thank you.

643
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:32,739
Shan Shan.

644
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,809
You two know each other, right?

645
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,179
Are you friends?

646
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,119
We meet at last.

647
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,119
We don't know each other.

648
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,090
I understand.

649
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,889
Why don't you two youngsters...

650
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,599
have a nice chat?

651
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,030
Grandma.

652
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,630
The sink is broken.

653
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:58,469
Don't use it.

654
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,670
I'll have it fixed this afternoon.

655
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,369
I'm not using the kitchen.

656
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:03,210
Take good care of our guest.

657
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:08,280
Hold on.

658
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,079
My name is Lu Sen.

659
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,420
You're Shan Shan, right?

660
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,619
What's your last name?

661
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,260
I admit it.

662
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,929
I followed you here.

663
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:26,400
But I'm not a pervert.

664
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,300
What do you want?

665
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,329
I want you to scold me.

666
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,599
Are you sick?

667
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,570
Yes, I'm sick.

668
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:35,400
Why are you laughing?

669
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,179
I haven't had so much fun in a long time.

670
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:59,429
I have a friend who looks just like you.

671
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:04,130
We had a lot of meaningful moments together.

672
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:09,139
Go to the hospital if you're sick.

673
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:11,409
I can give you the address if you want it.

674
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:14,039
Her name is Friday.

675
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:19,880
Okay, then.

676
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:22,820
It's Dr. Fu Yang, right?

677
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,019
He has a robot called Friday.

678
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,960
I modelled for him.

679
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:28,590
Four years ago,

680
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:30,460
I did a gig for 20,000 yuan.

681
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:33,460
That's why I'm human, not a robot.

682
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,329
Do you understand?

683
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,530
I know.

684
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,170
You know and you still followed me.

685
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:41,969
What's wrong with Fu Yang?

686
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:43,869
When I signed the confidentiality agreement,

687
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,880
he promised it wouldn't affect my personal life.

688
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,380
I'm so sorry.

689
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
I don't need to hear that.

690
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:52,780
I want you...

691
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,119
to leave now.

692
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:56,449
Shan Shan.

693
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,250
What are you talking about?

694
00:36:58,619 --> 00:36:59,460
Young man.

695
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:01,519
I've tidied up your room.

696
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:02,590
I'll take you there.

697
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:03,329
Let me carry this.

698
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,010
Right now,

699
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,039
my heart is roaring like a tsunami.

700
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,480
But I can't let anyone know.
