[I think that's the most important.]

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,960
[I thought maybe it's time to date.]

4

[A relationship that goes naturally
all the way to the end?]

[It's okay if he's not lively,]

73

[I hope he's taller than me.]

75

a lot of courage.]

to talk about based on himself.]

114

[Lee Hyun Jun: That impressed me a lot.]

115
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,640
[But the atmosphere
becomes awkward again]

[but there are moments
where we get butterflies in our stomachs.]

124

[I might look cold on the outside]

125
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,080
[and difficult to talk to,]

126
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,480
[but once we talk,
I'm actually very outgoing.]

127
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,480

strong "I'm angry" vibes.]

135
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
[Eum Hyeok Jin: It was a strong feeling.]

136
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,200

What is it?

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,520
[Cho Yun Jae: Ah...
Someone who's unemployed.]

373
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,960

he was a freelancer.]

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,800
[Kim Sun Wook: He stood out the most
at the beginning.]

385
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,400
[Kim Han Gyeol: I thought]

386
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,640
[Kim Han Gyeol: Taichi's the most
handsome.]

387
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,200
[Kim Han Gyeol: So he left
a deep impression.]

388
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,440

390
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:34,320

their Japanese survival program.]

was "Boys II Planet."]

-Season 2? The latest one?
-Really?

394
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,590
Yes, the latest one.

395
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,160
[Taichi: But I was eliminated quickly.]

396
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,040
[Eum Hyeok Jin: Why didn't I see you?]

397
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,460
[Park Jae Ha: That's amazing.]

Right.

399
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,480
[Eum Hyeok Jin: When Taichi said
he was an idol trainee,]

400
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,600
[Park Jae Ha: I thought,
how could I not know him?]

401
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,560
[Eum Hyeok Jin: On top of everything,
he was from JYP.]

402
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,320
[Park Jae Ha: I think Taichi
would be popular.]

403
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,520
[Park Jae Ha: He's handsome.]

404
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,520
[Taichi: I thought what if there's someone
more handsome than me?]

405
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
[Taichi: But I guess
I can be relieved about that.]

406
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,160
[Taichi: When I go to Hongdae, there'd be
girls who ask me for my number.]

407
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,360
[Taichi: I guess I'm kinda (popular).]

or older, but he's a year younger.]

412
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,680
[Kim Sun Wook: I like
those older than me.]

413
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,120

414
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,640

now.]

[Kim Su Min: My gaze
kept meeting Han Gyeol's.]

420
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,480
[Kim Su Min: More than a signal,
I think we're just curious?]

421
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,200
[Kim Su Min: Because we were
facing each other.]

422
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,880
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I'm curious
about Han Gyeol.]

423
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,360

I have never seen before.]

424
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,400

to walk with him.]

[Taichi: I like people around my age.]

429
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,240
[Taichi: So I thought it was good.]

430
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,920
[Taichi: I was sitting beside him.
I thought he was handsome.]

431
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,880

no one asked me questions.]

442
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,720

00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:56,260
[Lee Hyeok Jin: You stood out
the most.]

652
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,700
[Lee Hyeok Jin: "What kind of person
is he?"]

653
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,700
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I was curious about that,
so I chose you.]

654
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,300
[Kim Han Gyeol: Thank you.]
[Lee Hyeok Jin: It's nothing.]

655
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,060
[Happy]

656
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,020
[Kim Han Gyeol: I didn't expect that]

657
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,540
[Kim Han Gyeol: I would get selected
as a date]

658
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,700
[Kim Han Gyeol: as soon as I arrived.]

659
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,660
[Kim Han Gyeol: It felt nice.]

660
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,420
[Lee Hyeok Jin: You're 25?]

661
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:20,930
[Kim Han Gyeol: I'm 24, born in 2002.]

662
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,020
-I'm 24, born in 2002.
-24.

663
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,420
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Ah... I see...]

664
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,620
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Let's
drop the honorifics.]

665
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,740
[Kim Han Gyeol: You were born
in 2005, right?]

666
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,020
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Yes, I was born in 2005.]

667
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,820
[Kim Han Gyeol: Then
let's speak casually?]

668
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:35,500
["Let's speak casually!"] ["Sure"]

669
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,700
[Kim Han Gyeol: Sure, Hyeok Jin.]
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Sure, Han Gyeol-hyung.]

670
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,700
[Shy]

671
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,260
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I don't think
I should drop the "hyung."]

672
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,780
[Shy]

673
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,450
I see.

674
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:56,380
[Gradually, Hyeok Jin and Han Gyeol
open up their hearts]

675
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,060
[Warm tea and cut cake
are served to melt the frozen hearts]

676
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,460
[Kim Han Gyeol: It looks delicious.]
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Yeah.]

677
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:07,740
[Kim Han Gyeol: Didn't we agree not to use honorifics? Why are you using it?]
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Right.]

678
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,870
It looks delicious.

679
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:11,740
Didn't we agree to not use honorifics?

680
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,860
[Lee Hyeok Jin: It's hard for me
to speak casually.]

681
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:20,300
[Kim Han Gyeol: It looks delicious.]

682
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,900
[Lee Hyeok Jin: You'll burn your tongue
if you drink it.]

683
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,060
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Just the two of us
sitting side by side]

684
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,620
[Lee Hyeok Jin: drinking tea or coffee—]

685
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,180
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I really liked
the atmosphere.]

686
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,260
[Kim Han Gyeol: It's delicious.]

687
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,900
[Nom]

688
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,820
[Sweet]

689
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,580
[Kim Han Gyeol: Perfect sugar recharge.]

690
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:50,460
[Kim Han Gyeol: Not as sweet as chocolate.
So I keep going for another bite.]

691
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,140
[Pfft]

692
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,180
[Kim Han Gyeol: With just the two of us,]

693
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,540
[Kim Han Gyeol: it's easier to talk.]

694
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,980
[Kim Han Gyeol: I freeze up
in places with many people.]

695
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,740
[Lee Hyeok Jin: It seemed so too.]

696
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:09,580
[Lee Hyeok Jin: You looked stiff.]

697
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,780
[Kim Han Gyeol: I like 1:1 conversations.]
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Thankfully.]

698
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,260
[Kim Han Gyeol: That's my strength.]

699
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,060
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Thankfully, I chose you.]
[Kim Han Gyeol: Right.]

700
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,860
[Lee Hyeok Jin: It was my first time
to choose someone.]

701
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,860
[Lee Hyeok Jin: There were many things
I didn't know about.]

702
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,300
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I was curious.]

703
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,900
[Lee Hyeok Jin: What should I do
to make him like me]

704
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,740
[Lee Hyeok Jin: or take a liking to me?]

705
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,700
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I thought about those
a lot.]

706
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,500
[Hyeok Jin wants to
approach Han Gyeol more actively.]

707
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,780
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I want to ask what is
your first impression of me?]

708
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,580
[Kim Han Gyeol: First impression?]
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Yeah.]

709
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,980
[Kim Han Gyeol: You have
really delicate features.]

710
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,200
[Kim Han Gyeol: Your face
is really small.]

711
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,460
-In my opinion.
-Really?

712
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,220
[Kim Han Gyeol: Your face is really small
but your eyes are really big.]

713
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,860
[Kim Han Gyeol: It's nicely
distributed.]

714
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,020
[Kim Han Gyeol: "Wow,
his face is so small."]

715
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,660
[Kim Han Gyeol: And "he has good style."]
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Oh.]

716
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,540
[Kim Han Gyeol: Including your hairstyle.]

717
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,780
[Lee Hyeok Jin: That's great.]

718
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,620
[Lee Hyeok Jin: That I look not bad
in your eyes.]

719
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,860
[Kim Han Gyeol: Your eyes
are really beautiful.]

720
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,660
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Really?]

721
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,780
[Shy]

722
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,660
[Shy]

723
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,420
[Lee Hyeok Jin: In your partner...]

724
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,660
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Simply put,
what is your ideal type?]

725
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,900
[Kim Han Gyeol: My ideal type?]

726
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:35,140
[Kim Han Gyeol: People
with their own beliefs.]

727
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,700
[Kim Han Gyeol: Or someone
with strong will?]

728
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,860
[Kim Han Gyeol: I like people like that.]

729
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:44,260
[Kim Han Gyeol: I like it even if
they can be stubborn some times.]

730
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,460
[Kim Han Gyeol: Compared to
being indecisive...]

731
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,060
[Kim Han Gyeol: I like that type.]

732
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,060
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Very...]

733
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,660
[Lee Hyeok Jin: How should I describe it?]

734
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,020
[Kim Han Gyeol: Isn't it special?]
[Lee Hyeok Jin: It's interesting.]

735
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,220
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I've never seen
someone like that.]

736
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,220
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Wow. I see.]

737
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,300
[Lee Hyeok Jin: What about in terms of
looks?]

738
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,660
[Kim Han Gyeol: As for looks,
I've been...]

739
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,100
[Kim Han Gyeol: Looks...]

740
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,540
[Kim Han Gyeol: It's not that
I don't look at looks at all.]

741
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,820
[Kim Han Gyeol: But I think I'll look at
their personality first.]

742
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,340
[Lee Hyeok Jin: When asked
about one's ideal type,]

743
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,300
[Lee Hyeok Jin: people tend to
talk about looks first.]

744
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,220
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I found it
quite interesting.]

745
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,700
[Kim Han Gyeol: What's your ideal type?]

746
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,660
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I also like people
who are not too frivolous.]

747
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,940
[Lee Hyeok Jin: When they do something,]

748
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,420
[Lee Hyeok Jin: even if
it's something trivial,]

749
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,220
[Lee Hyeok Jin: like using
the bowl and fork...]

750
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,420
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Even when doing
basic things like this—]

751
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,540
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I hope they do it
with certainty.]

752
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,820
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I don't like people
who do things like benching.]

753
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,460
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I like someone
who's not frivolous.]

754
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,540
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Even with their tone.]

755
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,900
[Kim Han Gyeol: Seems like the "feel"
is the most important.]

756
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,820
[Kim Han Gyeol: Humans are
really hard to understand.]

757
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,380
[Lee Hyeok Jin: That's right.]

758
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,020
[Lee Hyeok Jin: What's your ideal type
exactly?]

759
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,940
[Lee Hyeok Jin: You only mentioned it
personality-wise.]

760
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,900
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Do you really
not care about their appearance?]

761
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,620
[Kim Han Gyeol: In terms of appearance,]

762
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,700
[Kim Han Gyeol: I don't like people
who look kind that much.]

763
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,220
[Kim Han Gyeol: I like people
with stronger features;]

764
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,580
[Kim Han Gyeol: or those who look tough.]

765
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:31,300
[Kim Han Gyeol: I like people
who give off tough vibes.]

766
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,580
[Kim Han Gyeol: That'd leave me
with a deep impression.]

767
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,180
[Blank]

768
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,860
[Straight to the point]
[Lee Hyeok Jin: What about me?
Do I look tough?]

769
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,660
[Kim Han Gyeol: You?]

770
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,500
[Kim Han Gyeol: Your features fill up
your whole face.]

771
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,900
[Kim Han Gyeol: You look tough in my standards.]
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Really?]

772
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:52,540
[Hyeok Jin confirms Han Gyeol's interest
clumsily]

773
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,900
[Lee Hyeok Jin: A tough person... I see.]

774
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,500
[Kim Han Gyeol: Someone
with strong features.]

775
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,580
[Hyeok Jin keeps talking about
Han Gyeol's ideal type]

776
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,100
[Kim Han Gyeol: It was...]

777
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,420
[Kim Han Gyeol: It was really awkward.]

778
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,500
[Kim Han Gyeol: The atmosphere
suddenly changed.]

779
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,420
[A moment that requires a new conversation
to take away the awkwardness]

780
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,140
[Kim Han Gyeol: What about you?]
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Me?]

781
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,900
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I like someone
who looks pretty when they smile.]

782
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,220
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I do like people
with thick lips.]

783
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:40,140
[Lee Hyeok Jin: But my ideal type is just my ideal type.]
[Kim Han Gyeol: Your ideal type is just your ideal type.]

784
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,500
[Kim Han Gyeol: You just
fall in love with them.]

785
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,790
[Lee Hyeok Jin: That's right.
I've never dated someone my ideal type.]

786
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:49,830
Really?

787
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:55,060
[Lee Hyeok Jin: They are all
very different (from my ideal type).]

788
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,980
[In the same space,
very different feelings are arising]

789
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,120
[A difficult and skittish first date
where one can't talk too much on]

790
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,090
So cold.

791
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,300
[Lee Hyeok Jin: But I'm glad we got
this chance to get close.]
[Kim Han Gyeol: Right.]

792
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,340
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I'm glad we became comfortable.]
[Kim Han Gyeol: It feels like]

793
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,690
[Kim Han Gyeol: there's someone
I'm familiar with now.]

794
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:17,630
Yes.

795
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:24,220
[The two have an interesting change
in feelings after their first meeting]

796
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,420
[Kim Han Gyeol: Since it's the first day
and our first date,]

797
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,260
[Kim Han Gyeol: I was nervous and didn't
seem to be focused on the date.]

798
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,180
[Kim Han Gyeol: I was happy.]

799
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,900
[Kim Han Gyeol: But it's still
quite a pity.]

800
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,900
[Kim Han Gyeol: Hmm...]

801
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,940
[Kim Han Gyeol: I felt...]

802
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,700
[Kim Han Gyeol: Kinda confused.]

803
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,540
[Kim Han Gyeol: I don't know
what (this feeling) is yet.]

804
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:53,460
[Kim Han Gyeol: I'm going
to understand it slowly.]

805
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:59,380
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I'm actually
really worried.]

806
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,220
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Since it's
the first day...]

807
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,380
[Lee Hyeok Jin: It's the first day...]

808
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,980
[Lee Hyeok Jin: While it's normal that
there are no heart-fluttering feelings,]

809
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,220
[Lee Hyeok Jin: but to me,
it was a very simple choice.]

810
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,300
[Lee Hyeok Jin: The someone
I'm interested in]

811
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,780
[Lee Hyeok Jin: is 100% Han Gyeol.]

812
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,820
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I want to
take the initiative to get closer to him.]

813
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,860
[Lee Hyeok Jin: To someone
I'm interested in.]

814
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:31,180
[Though brief, there were strong feelings]

815
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:37,100
[Where will the two men's hearts
go towards?]

816
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,220
[A warm moment is needed
in the midst of winter]

817
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:05,900
[The first date where Taichi & Yun Jae
express their hearts]

818
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,580
[Taichi: What did you order?]

819
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:11,300
[Cho Yun Jae: I ordered
an ice peppermint tea.]

820
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,700
[Cho Yun Jae: Did you order chocolate?]

821
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,860
[Cho Yun Jae: Was it a hot one?]

822
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,140
[Taichi: Cause it's too cold...]

823
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,700
[Taichi: Aren't you cold?]
[Cho Yun Jae: I'm fine.]

824
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,860
[Cho Yun Jae: Taich.]

825
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,660
[Taichi: It's Taichi!]
[Cho Yun Jae: Taichi.]

826
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,410
[Awkward]
[Taichi: "Chi" for "chicken."]

827
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:28,910
Chicken...

828
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,580
[Taichi: How old are you?]

829
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,260
[Cho Yun Jae: I'm 28. I'm old, right?]

830
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,460
[Taichi: 1998?]
[Cho Yun Jae: Yeah.]

831
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,460
[Cho Yun Jae: You're 21, right?]

832
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,660
[Taichi: I was born in 2005.]

833
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,540
[Amazing]
[Cho Yun Jae: Born in 2005?]

834
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,180
[The Japanese Taichi
who's good at calculating the birth year]

835
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,260
[Cho Yun Jae: Do you like older people?]

836
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,300
[Cho Yun Jae: Or do you like
younger people?]

837
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,900
[Taichi: To date someone younger than me]

838
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,300
[Taichi: doesn't feel quite right.]
[Cho Yun Jae: Right.]

839
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:03,380
[Nodding]
[Taichi: And with my personality,
I feel more comfortable with those older.]

840
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,460
[Cho Yun Jae: When did you
start learning Korean?]

841
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,380
[Taichi: After I came to Korea.]

842
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,660
[Taichi: About three and a half years
ago.]

843
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,660
[Taichi: I also got
my Korean language certification.]

844
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,580
[Taichi: I have also made
extra preparations,]

845
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,060
[Taichi: so I'm more confident than some foreigners.]
[Cho Yun Jae: Right.]

846
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:29,220
[Cho Yun Jae: You speak Korean
better than me.]

847
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,570
[They start their conversation smoothly]

848
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,750
Thank you.

849
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,050
[Pass]

850
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:36,100
Thank you.

851
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,900
[Taichi is being considerate
as the younger one]

852
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,660
[Tough]

853
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,780
[Pfft]

854
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:48,890
[Cho Yun Jae: Shall I do it?]

855
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:50,370
-Shall I do it?
-Yes.

856
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,610
[The first date that is not that easy]

857
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,140
I can't open it.

858
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,740
[Cho Yun Jae: Shall we just dig into it?]

859
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,500
[Taichi: I can do it.]

860
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,170
-I think I can do it.
-Really?

861
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,340
Seems like you might need tissues, though.

862
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,690
[Taichi doesn't know how to give up]

863
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:07,380
Then...

864
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,820
[Success]

865
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,110
[Proud]

866
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,170
Should I ask the staff for the tissue?

867
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,180
[Taichi showcased his efforts
on the first date]

868
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,780
[Nom]

869
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,180
[Slurp]

870
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:29,460
[Cho Yun Jae: What kind of person
do you like?]

871
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,180
[Taichi: Rather than there being
conditions,]

872
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,980
[Taichi: someone who attracts me?]

873
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,340
[Taichi: I just choose people I like.]

874
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:43,300
[Taichi: I like people who are fun to be around.]
[Cho Yun Jae: People who are fun to be around.]

875
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,900
[Taichi: I had the choice
to choose my date, right?]

876
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,180
[Curious]

877
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,180
[Taichi: Well, just now...]

878
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,900
[Taichi: You described being a freelancer
as being unemployed—]

879
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,020
[Taichi: I found that funny.]

880
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,900
[Embarrassed]

881
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,660
[Pfft]
[Taichi: So that made me curious.]

882
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,140
[Hehe]

883
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:06,220
[Cho Yun Jae: I'm just
waiting for something.]

884
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,820
[Taichi: Same here.]

885
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,460
[Taichi: I haven't done
many things either.]

886
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:11,430
[Embarrassed]

887
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:12,980
Well...

888
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,140
[Taichi: It's important to be around
someone who's fun.]

889
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,660
[Cho Yun Jae: Yes, it's important.]

890
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,740
[Taichi: The timing was perfect.]

891
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,580
[Taichi: After you said "freelancer,"]

892
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,220
[Taichi: someone asked,
"What kind of freelancer,"]

893
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,780
[Taichi: and your response
"someone unemployed" was (hilarious).]

894
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:30,100
[Taichi: That left an impression;
for when I was choosing.]

895
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:30,940
[Taichi: So I wanted to talk to you.]

896
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,460
[Taichi: I told him that I really liked
his word choice of "freelancer,"]

897
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,460
[Taichi: and that I was curious,]

898
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,980
[Taichi: he said, "I'm just
waiting for something,"]

899
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,980
[Taichi: so I thought (the conversation)
was really interesting.]

900
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,900
[Cho Yun Jae: Did you choose me because I was funny?]
[Taichi: Rather than saying that,]

901
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,620
[Taichi: it's more like I like people
who speak more and interestingly.]

902
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:49,300
[Taichi: So I thought I wanted to talk to you.]
[Cho Yun Jae: I see.]

903
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:49,950
[The conversation continues]

904
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,700
Well...

905
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,660
[Taichi: What kind of person do you like?]
[Cho Yun Jae: Me?]

906
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,740
[Cho Yun Jae: Firstly, they have to be
taller than me.]

907
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,580
[Cho Yun Jae: I like people
who like me.]

908
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,220
[Taichi: Oh.]
[Cho Yun Jae: You're tall, right?]

909
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,420
[Taichi: How tall do you think I am?]

910
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,420
[Thinking]

911
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,780
[Cho Yun Jae: 183?]

912
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,620
[Surprised]

913
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,740
[Cho Yun Jae: Did I guess it right?]

914
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,500
[Taichi: (Precisely) 183cm!]

915
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:17,260
[Information gathering complete]
[Cho Yun Jae: 21 years old, Taichi, 183cm.]

916
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,860
[Cho Yun Jae: You like pork belly.]
[Taichi: That's right. I like beef intestines too.]

917
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,260
[Cho Yun Jae: Beef intestines?]

918
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,660
[Cho Yun Jae: He's kinda goofy.]

919
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,060
[Cho Yun Jae: He's kinda cute.]

920
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:37,020
[Taichi: What kind of date do you want to go on in this show?]
[Cho Yun Jae: A date I want to go on?]

921
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,820
[Cho Yun Jae: I don't think
you'll like it.]

922
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:42,020
[Cho Yun Jae: I want to go bungee jumping.]
[Taichi: I want to do that too.]

923
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,460
[Cho Yun Jae: Really?]
[Taichi: I really want to do bungee jumping.]

924
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,460
[Cho Yun Jae: You haven't done it before, have you?]
[Taichi: No. Have you ever done it before?]

925
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,460
[Cho Yun Jae: No, I haven't.]
[Taichi: You just want to try it.]

926
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,700
[Cho Yun Jae: Yes, I want to try.]

927
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,380
I want to go bungee jumping together.

928
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,360
[The two accidentally found
something in common]

929
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,630
I thought you would dislike that.

930
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,580
[Taichi: I like moving around.]
[Cho Yun Jae: Me too.]

931
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:00,660
[Taichi: I like dates where I can go around.]
[Cho Yun Jae: Me too.]

932
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,580
[Cho Yun Jae: I'd like things
like bungee jumping.]

933
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,690
It must be fun.

934
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,860
[Cho Yun Jae: It's unexpected.]

935
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:12,540
[Cho Yun Jae: I thought he was
the quiet type, but he's quite lively.]

936
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,620
[Taichi: Do you have any hobbies?]
[Cho Yun Jae: Hobbies?]

937
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:21,140
[Cho Yun Jae: I like watching movies
and performances.]

938
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,660
[Cho Yun Jae: I like walking too.]

939
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,980
[Nod]

940
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,580
[Cho Yun Jae: I like sunlight.]
[Taichi: Really?]

941
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,100
[Taichi: I went to watch "Zootopia 2" 3 days ago.]
[Cho Yun Jae: I heard it topped the box office.]

942
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,980
[Taichi: It was fun.]

943
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,260
[Observe]

944
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,790
[Cho Yun Jae: But you look like a character in Zootopia.]
[Taichi: Me? Who?]

945
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:38,850
-Me? Who?
-Yeah.

946
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,260
[Cho Yun Jae: Judy?]
[Taichi: The rabbit?]

947
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,420
[Cho Yun Jae: The rabbit!]
[Taichi: Do I look like her?]

948
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,220
[Cho Yun Jae: Is the rabbit Judy?]
[Taichi: That's right.]

949
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,080
[Cho Yun Jae: What's the guy's name, then?]
[Taichi: Nick?]

950
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,460
-Nick.
-Nick.

951
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:50,490
[Cho Yun Jae: You look like Nick.
The orange one.]

952
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:53,100
-You look like Nick. The orange one.
-Really?

953
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,580
[Taichi: The fox?]
[Cho Yun Jae: Yes!]

954
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,980
[Taichi: I've never heard that I look like a fox.]
[Cho Yun Jae: Really?]

955
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,820
[Panic Cho Yun Jae: You look like him.]

956
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,100
[Cho Yun Jae: So it's Nick and Judy.]

957
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,740
[Taichi: He looks really young,
so when I found out his age,]

958
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,420
[Taichi: I was surprised. Like, really?]

959
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,700
[Taichi: After talking, I realize
he has a mature side to him.]

960
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,740
[Taichi: He was guiding me,
who's younger than him.]

961
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,900
[Taichi: I thought that was great.]

962
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,900
[Cho Yun Jae: It was really comfortable.]

963
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,900
[Cho Yun Jae: He asked me
a lot of questions.]

964
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,980
[Cho Yun Jae: With that, I got curious
about him too,]

965
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,340
[Cho Yun Jae: so I asked him questions,]

966
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,460
[Cho Yun Jae: and we had
a long conversation.]

967
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,780
[Cho Yun Jae: I wasn't
