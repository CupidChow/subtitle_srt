00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,900
[Heading to
the unfamiliar Men's House]

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,700
[Confident strides]

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,420
3, 2, 2, 2...

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,220
[Meanwhile, they are discussing
room allocation in the Men's House]

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,220
There are double rooms
on the first and second floors.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,660
[Eum Hyeok Jin: 3 double rooms]

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,760
[Eum Hyeok Jin: and 1 triple room.]

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,540
[He walks confidently without hesitation.]

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,150
[Oh?!]

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,950
What's wrong?

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,370
What's wrong?

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,000
What is it?

13
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,820
Wow.

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,600
What is it?

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,740
[A new guy appears when no one expected]

16
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,740
[All eyes are on the new guy]

17
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,140
-He came.
-Is someone joining us?

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,700
[Surprised]

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,180
[Taichi: When we were talking together,]

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,020
[Taichi: I think I was
the first to notice him.]

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,900
[Taichi: I suddenly
saw someone walking over.]

22
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,220
[Eum Hyeok Jin: I was confused.]

23
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,660
[Eum Hyeok Jin: Why is he here?]

24
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,220
[Kim Han Gyeol: I thought,
"Is the Catfish joining us so soon?"]

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,740
[Cho Yun Jae: I thought it was possible
that a new guy might show up,]

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,780
[Cho Yun Jae: but I was surprised
when he showed up so soon.]

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,259
[All in shock by the new guy's arrival]

28
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:42,940
-Hello.
-Hello.

29
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,500
[Kim Sun Wook: Hello.]

30
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,900
[Reading the room]

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,340
[Nervous]

32
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,740
[Reading the room]

33
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,259
[Staring]

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,220
Hello.

35
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,740
[They welcome him with bright greetings.]

36
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,620
[The atmosphere suddenly changes]

37
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,180
[I've been called handsome a lot,]

38
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,780
[and called cute a lot too.]

39
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,420
[I've been in countless relationships.]

40
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,420
[More than my fingers can count.]

41
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,260
[Rather than a partner like a friend,]

42
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,579
[I'm looking for someone
who makes my heart flutter.]

43
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,220
[Lee Hyeong Jun]

44
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,740
[Hyung~]
[T/N: A term to address older males,]

45
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,380
[Hyung~]
[T/N: indicative of familiarity]

46
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,980
[Taichi: Hyung, how've you been?]

47
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,000
[Lee Hyeong Jun: Long time no see.]

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,100
Hyung!

49
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,650
Hello.

50
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,750
[Kim Su Min: I'm so surprised.]

51
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,340
Really.

52
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,180
[Lee Hyeong Jun:
Have you just been sitting here?]

53
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,940
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
We looked around the house!]

54
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,620
[What's going on?]

55
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,660
[They're chatting like they're friends]

56
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,580
[Cho Yun Jae: It seemed like
some of them knew each other.]

57
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,420
[Cho Yun Jae: In that case,
who are the newcomers]

58
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,980
[Cho Yun Jae: and who are not?
I got even more confused.]

59
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,660
[Kim Han Gyeol: I was surprised as
it seemed like many of them knew him.]

60
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,140
[More questions arise about
the new guy's identity...]

61
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,140
[First Meeting Rules:
1. "His Man Season 4" is starting again.
2. There are returning participants and new faces.

[Rules to abide by in the first meeting]

64
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,220
[Men with untold secrets and stories]

65
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,500
[Exclusive romance between men
begins again]

66
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,140
[Q: Why did you decide
to join "His Man 4" again?]

67
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,500
[Kim Sun Wook: A lot of complicated
and difficult things happened.]

68
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,740
[Park Jae Ha: There was a huge problem...
with one of the participants.]

69
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,700
[Lee Hyeok Jin: So, we had no choice
but to reshoot everything again.]

70
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,020
["It felt like it was all in vain."]

71
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,020
[Kim Su Min: In that week, I experienced
a whirlwind of emotions and thoughts,]

72
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,459
[Kim Su Min: overwhelming and conflicting
emotions and thoughts.]

73
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,740
[Kim Su Min: I can say
I'd been through a lot.]

74
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,060
[Kim Su Min: I feel like
the way my emotions took over, and...]

75
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,340
[Kim Su Min: and everything I went through
sort of went poof.]

76
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,820
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
All my feelings were sincere.]

77
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,220
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
I never imagined I'd fall so hard,]

78
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,780
[Eum Hyeok Jin: only having eyes
for one person and agonizing over him.]

79
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,460
[Eum Hyeok Jin: It's the first time
I've felt such constant mood shifts]

80
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,100
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
in such a short span of time.]

81
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,820
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
I was focused on just one person.]

82
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,659
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
So it was very disappointing.]

83
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,340
[Kim Sun Wook: Honestly,
I considered for a long time.]

84
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,940
[Kim Sun Wook: The risk of reshooting it]

85
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,500
[Kim Sun Wook: weighs on
the returning participants too.]

86
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,940
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Of course I was worried.]

87
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,540
[Will I feel smitten?
Will my heart flutter?]

88
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,540
[Kim Su Min:
I'd been with them for a week.]

89
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,260
[Kim Sun Wook:
Will those feelings come back again?]

90
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,140
[Kim Su Min: But seeing them here again,]

91
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,340
[Kim Su Min: it really
felt like the first day.]

92
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,740
[Kim Su Min: Like my actual first day.]

93
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,660
[Kim Sun Wook: All of us are determined.]

94
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,020
[Kim Sun Wook: We also agree it takes
more than a week to know someone.]

95
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,740
[Lee Hyeok Jin: When I return to
Men's House, my feelings might change.]

96
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,100
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I'll also get to
spend more time with them]

97
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,860
[Lee Hyeok Jin:
and get to know them better.]

98
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,140
[Taichi: I thought this was
a good opportunity,]

99
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,020
[Taichi: and I really want to find love.]

100
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,260
[Lee Hyun Jun: I'm really curious
as to who will join the show,]

101
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,100
[Lee Hyun Jun: and if
there are returning participants,]

102
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,020
[Lee Hyun Jun:
what kind of mindset they'll have.]

103
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,060
[Kim Sun Wook: Actually, he is
partly the reason I came back.]

104
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,340
[Kim Sun Wook: I didn't get a chance to
connect with him. I'm curious about him.]

105
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,860
[Kim Sun Wook: This time, I'll get to
present myself better and make an impression.]

106
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,060
[Kim Sun Wook: It's a good opportunity.]

107
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,980
[Taichi: I have many regrets
about the last shoot.]

108
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,060
[Taichi: I couldn't
express my feelings well at first.]

109
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,540
[Taichi: I was very passive.]

110
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,580
[Taichi: So this time, I want to
show a new me, the original me.]

111
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,620
[Taichi: That's what I want.]

112
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,580
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I think it's a chance.
I don't think I have anything to lose.]

113
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,300
[Lee Hyeok Jin:
Because there was someone I liked.]

114
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,340
[Lee Hyeok Jin: There was
someone I was eagerly pursuing.]

115
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,500
[Kim Su Min: Right now,
it feels like a chance.]

116
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,659
[Kim Su Min: Because I'm
courageously taking on a challenge.]

117
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,820
[Kim Su Min: With time, it might
turn out not to be worthwhile,]

118
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,540
[Kim Su Min: or I might be
glad I took on the challenge.]

119
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,140
[Kim Su Min:
I'll have to wait and find out.]

120
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,180
[Eum Hyeok Jin: I rejoined the show]

121
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,220
[Eum Hyeok Jin: because I still
have some feelings for that same person.]

122
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,100
[Eum Hyeok Jin: I also have
hope and expectations]

123
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,700
[Eum Hyeok Jin: for the new faces,
so I thought it would be worthwhile.]

124
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,560
[Q: Do you feel pressured
as a new participant?]

125
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,550
Pressure...

126
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,470
I don't feel pressured.

127
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,000
[Cho Yun Jae: There will be more
opportunities to get closer with them.]

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,160
[Cho Yun Jae:
So I didn't feel much pressure.]

129
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,840
[Kim Han Gyeol: When I was informed
that there'd be a mix of both]

130
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,360
[Kim Han Gyeol: returning participants
and new faces like me,]

131
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,640
[Kim Han Gyeol: I thought it might
even be to my advantage.]

132
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,960
[Kim Han Gyeol: The returning participants
are familiar with each other,]

133
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,480
[Kim Han Gyeol: so there's probably
less novelty and fascination.]

134
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,000
[Kim Han Gyeol:
Making use of the fact that]

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,720
[Kim Han Gyeol: I'm a new face, I could
gain more attention in the initial stages.]

136
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,760
[Lee Hyeong Jun:
Everyone's gotten more handsome.]

137
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,520
[Kim Sun Wook:
You've gotten more handsome the most.]

138
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,659
[Shy]

139
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:53,170
What is this? All of a sudden?

140
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,680
[But guys... I'm so glad
to see everyone again.]

141
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:58,900
[Finally able to speak their mind]

142
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,830
-It's been a long time.
-Yeah.

143
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,560
[Kim Han Gyeol: I still find it surreal.]

144
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,200
[Cho Yun Jae: We should get close ASAP.
Do we have to drink?]

145
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,190
[Lee Hyeong Jun: Are you a good drinker?]
[Cho Yun Jae: No.]

146
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,780
[Park Jae Ha: I think
alcohol is very necessary now.]

147
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,720
I can drink about one bottle?

148
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,200
[Kim Sun Wook:
Jae Ha, do you need alcohol?]

149
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,300
[Park Jae Ha: Yes, I really need it now.]

150
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,100
[Frozen]

151
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,800
[Sudden wave of silence
in the Men's House]

152
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,799
[Jae Ha...]

153
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,520
[and Hyeong Jun]

154
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,520
[Unspoken tension between the two]

155
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,960
[Kim Han Gyeol: It got
really awkward for everyone.]

156
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,560
[Kim Han Gyeol: I wasn't confident
I could ease the tension]

157
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,000
[Kim Han Gyeol: among the nine of us,
so I just stayed quiet.]

158
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,680
[Kim Sun Wook: After seeing Hyeong Jun...
I became very worried.]

159
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,040
[Kim Su Min: I looked at Jae Ha,
and then at Hyeong Jun, and then at Jae Ha again.]

160
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,200
[Kim Su Min: Jae Ha
didn't look very happy.]

161
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,560
[Kim Su Min: Hyeong Jun
didn't appear all jolly either.]

162
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,280
[Kim Su Min: The mood was heavy.
A mix of emotions on their faces.]

163
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,880
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
It was kind of obvious]

164
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,520
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
that things ended for them.]

165
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,900
[Eum Hyeok Jin: I'm curious
why and how they ended things.]

166
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,440
[What happened between these two men?]

167
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,040
[His Man Season 4: The one who was
most conflicted about returning]

168
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,440
[Lee Hyeong Jun: I matched with someone as
a couple by the end of the previous shoot.]

169
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,600
[Lee Hyeong Jun:
I thought it didn't make sense]

170
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,420
[Lee Hyeong Jun:
for a couple to reshoot the show,]

171
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,620
[Lee Hyeong Jun: and was sure
I wouldn't participate in the reshoot.]

172
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,520
[Lee Hyeong Jun: So I told
that guy who matched with me]

173
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,680
[that I can't participate in it.]

174
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:24,220
[Lee Hyeong Jun: But he told me that...]

175
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,560
[Lee Hyeong Jun: Even if I don't join it,
he's really sorry but...]

176
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,520
[Lee Hyeong Jun:
he must participate in the reshoot.]

177
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,720
Sorry.

178
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,720
[Park Jae Ha: Hyeong Jun asked me]

179
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,440
[Park Jae Ha: what I would do
if he didn't want to do the reshoot.]

180
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,000
[Park Jae Ha: In that situation,
even without Hyeong Jun,]

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,600
[Park Jae Ha: I honestly
still wanted to do it.]

182
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,600
[Park Jae Ha: It's a dating show,
but while finding love,]

183
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,200
[Park Jae Ha: you also get to come out.]

184
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,840
[Park Jae Ha: To me,
finding love is important,]

185
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:28,440
[Park Jae Ha: but the fact that I get
to come out is really important too.]

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,920
[Park Jae Ha: I don't want to lie anymore,
especially to family...]

187
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,960
[Park Jae Ha: You might think,
"Then just come out to your family!"]

188
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,200
[Park Jae Ha: You're right.]

189
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,120
[Park Jae Ha: But I don't dare to.]

190
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,280
[Park Jae Ha: So I want to use this show
to get my message across.]

191
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,240
[Park Jae Ha:
And I think this is the best way]

192
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,960
[Park Jae Ha:
for me to come out confidently.]

193
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,300
[Park Jae Ha:
Relationships aside, I've been enduring]

194
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,640
[Park Jae Ha:
hiding my sexual orientation for 30 years.]

195
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,800
[Park Jae Ha: If I give up this chance,
I might regret it.]

196
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,480
[Lee Hyeong Jun:
He said he liked me a lot,]

197
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,520
[Lee Hyeong Jun: but his desire
to be on this show is greater.]

198
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:25,260
[Lee Hyeong Jun: After we talked,
we decided to break up.]

199
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,920
[Lee Hyeong Jun:
Although I understand how he feels,]

200
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:36,320
[Lee Hyeong Jun: when confronted with it,
I was still heartbroken.]

201
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,200
[Lee Hyeong Jun:
I know many people will criticize us]

202
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,520
[Lee Hyeong Jun: for returning to the show
after becoming a couple,]

203
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
[Lee Hyeong Jun: but coming here]

204
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,880
[Lee Hyeong Jun: would also help me
work out my frustration and move on.]

205
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,080
[Lee Hyeong Jun:
I also didn't want any regrets.]

206
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,760
[Lee Hyeong Jun:
So after careful consideration,]

207
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,440
[Lee Hyeong Jun:
I decided to be on the show again.]

208
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,640
[Park Jae Ha: First of all,
I was glad to see Hyeong Jun again.]

209
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,040
[Park Jae Ha: No matter how it turns out,]

210
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,040
[Park Jae Ha: I thought it could be
a chance to resolve my regret.]

211
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,400
[Park Jae Ha: So I kept
looking in Hyeong Jun's direction,]

212
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,320
[Park Jae Ha: but he
kept avoiding my gaze.]

213
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,000
[Park Jae Ha: I felt that.]

214
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,640
[Lee Hyeong Jun: I kept avoiding his gaze.
I couldn't look at him.]

215
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,360
[Lee Hyeong Jun: I don't think
I have anything to say (to Jae Ha).]

216
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,240
[Two men with unaligned hearts;
how will their relationship pan out?]

217
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,090
[Now, please decide on your roommates]

218
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,220
-Roommates?
-Decide on roommates...

219
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,300
Is it entirely up to us?

220
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,420
[Deep in thought]

221
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,560
[Kim Su Min: My first choice is
the 2nd-floor double room (in Block A).]

222
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,280
[Cho Yun Jae: The first thing I thought
was that I must get a double room.]

223
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,240
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I want
a double room in Block A.]

224
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,920
[Lee Hyeok Jin: It's the most spacious
and I liked it. It looked nice.]

225
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,240
[Taichi: The 2nd-floor room in Block A
or (the triple room in) Block C.]

226
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,520
[♡ Roommates ♡
Block A: 1F double room
Block A: 2F double room
Block B: triple room
Block C: triple room]

227
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,600
Ah...

228
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,360
[How should we decide?]
[Yeah, how?]

229
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,260
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
Lots of people want Block A.]

230
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,860
Yeah.

231
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,370
Who wants a double room?

232
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,760
[Taichi: Rock, paper, scissors?]

233
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,080
Again?

234
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,040
[Kim Su Min:
No more rock, paper, scissors.]

235
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,080
[Kim Sun Wook: How can we make it fun?]
[Eum Hyeok Jin: Are there games?]

236
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,400
[Kim Sun Wook: How can we make it fun?]
[Eum Hyeok Jin: Board games?]

237
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,920
There are board games there.

238
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,060
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Or we could draw lots.]

239
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,660
Draw lots?

240
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,380
-That sounds good too.
-Then we...

241
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,020
[Oh-ho!]

242
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,640
[Kim Su Min: Since the returning participants
know each other,]

243
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,360
[Kim Su Min: how about (the two new faces)
Han Gyeol and Yun Jae decide?]

244
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,040
[Park Jae Ha: You two can choose your roommates
and go right to your rooms!]

245
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
[Kim Su Min:
Or allocate all the rooms?]

246
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,120
Allocate the rooms?

247
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,940
Every room.

248
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,700
-Let them discuss and allocate everything.
-Wow, so exciting.

249
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,080
-No, wait.
-This is fun.

250
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,440
[Kim Han Gyeol: I was so happy.]

251
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,680
[Kim Han Gyeol: Honestly, I was only
thinking of who I wanted to room with]

252
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,680
[Kim Han Gyeol:
since I saw the blackboard.]

253
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,460
[Feeling pressured]

254
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,160
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
Or you two can write it in secret,]

255
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,620
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
and show us when you're done.]

256
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,910
[Sounds good.]

257
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,860
Let's do it together. So exciting.

258
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,910
-Really?
-I'm so excited.

259
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,130
But...

260
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,240
Wait.

261
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,760
[Cho Yun Jae:
The two who want a double room.]

262
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,440
[Cho Yun Jae: The 2 "Hyeok Jins,"
Eum Hyeok Jin and Lee Hyeok Jin?]

263
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,330
The 2 "Hyeok Jins"?

264
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,320
Because they both prefer it
and brought a lot of clothes.

265
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,560
[New faces, Yun Jae & Han Gyeol, jump right in]

266
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,800
[Kim Han Gyeol: I want this double room.]

267
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,360
[Cho Yun Jae: You do?]
[Kim Han Gyeol: Yes.]

268
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,380
[Cho Yun Jae: This is tough...]
[Kim Han Gyeol: I want this room.]

269
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,780
[Kim Han Gyeol: Let's pick our rooms first.]
[Cho Yun Jae: OK, OK.]

270
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,180
[Kim Han Gyeol: Where do you want?]
[Cho Yun Jae: The 1st-floor room.]

271
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,270
Here?

272
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,840
[Taichi: I haven't got a chance to
talk to Han Gyeol during the day.]

273
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,280
[Taichi: So I really want
to room with Han Gyeol.]

274
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,000
[Taichi: I'm really nervous.]

275
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,080
[Lee Hyun Jun:
I don't really mind however.]

276
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,240
[Lee Hyun Jun:
I just hope I get a double room.]

277
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,440
[Kim Sun Wook: Before I came here,
I already knew]

278
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,400
[Kim Sun Wook: I wanted a double room.]

279
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,680
[Kim Sun Wook: I think it'd be fun
to room with Hyun Jun.]

280
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,640
[Kim Sun Wook:
I thought about the pros and cons.]

281
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,280
[Kim Sun Wook: Should I room with
who I like? Is it really the best idea?]

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,520
[Kim Su Min: (Before I came here,)
I thought about rooming with Sun Wook.]

283
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,480
[Kim Su Min: But right now,
I want to room with Yun Jae.]

284
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,520
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I want to room with
the one whom I had my first date with,]

285
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,480
[Lee Hyeok Jin: and whom
I'm curious about, Han Gyeol.]

286
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,120
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Or the one I want
to get closer with, Hyun Jun.]

287
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,200
[Lee Hyeok Jin:
They were the two that came to mind.]

288
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,800
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
I don't want to room with]

289
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,160
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
the guy I'm interested in.]

290
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,280
[Eum Hyeok Jin: If I were to decide,]

291
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,599
[Eum Hyeok Jin: I'd have Han Gyeol stay
in a different room in the same block.]

292
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,400
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
I'll still get to see him often,]

293
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,560
[Eum Hyeok Jin:
and we'll be sleeping separately.]

294
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,560
[Eum Hyeok Jin: So it'd be nice if
he picks me as a roommate,]

295
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,520
[Eum Hyeok Jin: but I'd prefer to be
in the same block but different rooms.]

296
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,800
[Lee Hyeong Jun: I want to
room with Sun Wook.]

297
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,920
[Lee Hyeong Jun: I think it'd be awkward]

298
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,839
[Lee Hyeong Jun: to room with Jae Ha.]

299
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,920
[Park Jae Ha: I think it'd be nice
to room with Hyeong Jun.]

300
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,620
[Cho Yun Jae: Does anybody want to
make a case for your preference?]

301
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,270
[Cho Yun Jae:
Make some kind of an appeal.]

302
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,480
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Which rooms are left?]

303
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,460
[It's a secret!]

304
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,760
-Can't say.
-It's a secret.

305
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,800
[Kim Su Min: Are you
in a double or triple room?]

306
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,420
[Cho Yun Jae: The two of us?]

307
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:43,890
Yes.

308
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,560
[Cho Yun Jae:
We both chose double rooms first.]

309
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:47,880
[Su Min is lost in thought]

310
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,470
-You two chose the same room?
-1st or 2nd floor?

311
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,710
Secret. That's a secret.

312
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,410
No, I think they chose different rooms.

313
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,840
Why am I giving this so much thought!

314
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,760
[Kim Su Min: I want a double room!]

315
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,520
[Su Min's appeal surprises everyone]

316
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,780
[Reading the room]

317
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,260
[Panics]

[Taichi: Yes, totally.]

And I love how spacious it is.]

I also like that the bed is high.]

so please drop the honorifics with me.]

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,360
[Taichi: It was so new to me,]

488
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,200
[Taichi: being alone
with someone I just met.]

489
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,720
[Taichi: It was interesting
and amazing. I loved it.]

490

[Kim Han Gyeol: I was in a great mood.]

491
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,640
[Kim Han Gyeol:
I went on a date on the first day,]

492
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,760
[Kim Han Gyeol: and now share a room
with the person I'm most interested in.]

and off to a good start.]

the love weather map silently.]

sleep around 9 or 10 PM?]

But mostly, yes.]

you sleep really early.]

I chose him as my roommate.]

[Cho Yun Jae:
But he might not want this.]

530
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,360
[Cho Yun Jae:
Maybe I was being too selfish.]

531
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,360
[Cho Yun Jae:
So I started getting a bit worried.]

532
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,000
[Cho Yun Jae: But I also thought
that maybe he didn't say anything]

533
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,360

being considerate of me.]

he caught my eye the most.]

Since I had a lot of regrets last time.]

and true to my feelings.]

As best I can.]

[Kim Su Min: I wanted a double room.]

613
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,560
With whom?

614
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,560
[Kim Su Min: Rather than hanging out
in a large group, I'm more at ease]

615
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,200
[Kim Su Min: when there are fewer people.]

616
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:49,520
[Kim Su Min: Because I lose courage
when everyone is around.]

617

[Kim Su Min: When I
appealed for a double room,]

618
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,280
[Kim Su Min: I thought
it'd have some weight, but no...]

619
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,840
[Kim Su Min: A conversation in a group of 3
is different from a 1-on-1.]

620
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,720
[Kim Su Min: Even just asking to chat
is tough for me.]

621
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,680
[Park Jae Ha: Why?]

622
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,400
[Park Jae Ha: Because of your personality?]

623
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,520
[Kim Su Min: Yeah.]

624
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,320
[Park Jae Ha: It happens.]

625
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,480
[Kim Su Min: So I
thought about it for a long time]

626
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,440
[Kim Su Min: before appealing for a double room.
I thought it was the best choice.]

00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,540
[Park Jae Ha: You were too late.]

628
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:25,760
Yeah.

629
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,280
[Park Jae Ha: Didn't you see how
(Yun Jae and Han Gyeol) wrote the names?]

630
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,800
[Park Jae Ha: Zero hesitation.]

631
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,920
[Park Jae Ha: I bet they were already done
when you appealed for a double room.]

632
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,880
[Park Jae Ha: Who did you want
to share a double room with?]

633
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,920
[Kim Su Min: I don't know yet.]

634
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,140
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Secure the double room first?]
[Kim Su Min: Yeah.]

635
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,300
[Park Jae Ha: Since you haven't talked in depth.]
[Kim Su Min: Yeah.]

636
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,480
[Park Jae Ha: But 3 people
isn't that large a group,]

637
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,360
[Park Jae Ha: is it?]

638
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,640
[Kim Su Min: We only lived together
for a week the last shoot too.]

639
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,080
[Kim Su Min: I didn't get much from it.]

640
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,400
[Kim Su Min: I don't think I know much about
the participants from the previous shoot too.]

641
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,640
[Park Jae Ha: Of course not.]

642
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:13,120
[Kim Su Min: But after experiencing
all the feelings in that week,]

643
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:20,960
[Kim Su Min: after the week ended, I...
Though we didn't interact a lot in private,]

644
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
[Kim Su Min: I thought the feelings
had cooled down.]

645
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,080
[Kim Su Min: But seeing everyone today,]

646
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,040
[Kim Su Min: I feel different again.]

647
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,120
[Kim Su Min: I want to
follow my heart this time.]

648
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,840
[Kim Su Min: In this week,
I'll say everything I want.]

649
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,239
[Kim Su Min:
I don't want to regret after.]

650
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,520
[Lee Hyeong Jun: Oh! I got a text.]

651
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,560
[Park Jae Ha: What will it be?]

652
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,199
[Time for your Phone Room calls.]

653
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,960
[Within 30 seconds, convey your feelings
to the man you are drawn to today.]

654
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,200
[On the nervous and exciting first day,
who gravitates towards whom?]

655
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,760
[Eum Hyeok Jin: Phone Room calls?]
[Lee Hyeong Jun: Yeah.]

656
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,880
[Lee Hyeong Jun: But I've barely
gotten acquainted with everyone!]

657
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,380
[At a loss]

658
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:14,200
[Lee Hyeong Jun: The call... I was flustered as
I thought it was a bit soon to make a call.]

659
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,260
["Who should I call?"]

660
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,030
It's a tough decision.

661
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,900
[Sun Wook hasn't seen the text yet.]

662
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,280
It's cold outside.
We've to put on our coats.

663
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,560
[Eum Hyeok Jin: A text?]
[Lee Hyeong Jun: Time for Phone Room calls.]

664
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,620
[Already?]

665
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,140
I know.

666
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,160
[Lee Hyeong Jun: Have you decided?]
[Kim Sun Wook: Wait.]

667
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,720
[Eum Hyeok Jin: I haven't decided.]
[Kim Sun Wook: Wait, who are there... Wait.]

668
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,960
[Panic+confused:
not mentally prepared for calls]

669
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
[Eum Hyeok Jin: Gosh, what should I do?]

670
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,240
[Eum Hyeok Jin: To be honest,]

671
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,280
[Eum Hyeok Jin: don't you think
the new faces will get the most calls?]

672
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,720
[Kim Sun Wook: I don't think so.]
[Lee Hyeong Jun: Not necessarily.]

673
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,120
No?

674
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,360
[Lee Hyeong Jun: I don't think so either.]

675
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,880
[Lee Hyeok Jin:
But do you know who to call?]

676
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,780
[Park Jae Ha: What if I cry on the phone?]

677
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,840
[Lee Hyeok Jin: You don't need to
ask who he'd call.]

678
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,600
[Park Jae Ha: Just now,
when (Hyeong Jun) first entered,]

679
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,040
[Park Jae Ha: I almost teared up.]

680
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,840
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Aw.]
[Kim Su Min: But don't forget]

681
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,720
[Kim Su Min: to consider
if he still feels the same.]

682
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,560
[Park Jae Ha: If he doesn't feel the same,]
[Kim Su Min: Or are you confident?]

683
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
[Park Jae Ha: I'll just win him over again.
No problem.]

684
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,680
[Park Jae Ha: Besides, back then...]

685
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,880
[Park Jae Ha: he wasn't into me
at the start anyway.]

686
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,320
[Kim Su Min: Wow, so cool.]
[(Convinced)]

687
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,360
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Then I'll seduce Jae Ha.]
[(Joking)]

688
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,720
[Park Jae Ha: I have high standards.]

689
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,640
[Kim Su Min: Hyeok Jin's pretty too!]

690
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,880
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Me? I'm a catch too.]
[Park Jae Ha: Not only his looks,]

691
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,280
[Park Jae Ha: I have
high standards for all aspects.]

692
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
[Kim Su Min: Hyeok Jin is pretty!]

693
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,560
[Lee Hyeok Jin: I think I'm quite a catch.]

694
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,480
[Park Jae Ha: Yes, you're pretty and cute.]

695
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,840
[Park Jae Ha: Hyeok Jin's cute.]
[(Cheering him up)]

696
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,840
[Kim Su Min: What about me?]

697
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,640
[Kim Su Min: Why is
no one saying anything?]

698
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,440
[Lee Hyeok Jin: You're pretty too!]

699
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,060
[Park Jae Ha: But he really
got more handsome.]

700
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,640
[Park Jae Ha: You sense it too, right?]
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Yes.]

701
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,720
[Lee Hyeok Jin: You've become handsome!]
[Kim Su Min: Thanks, but what's the use?]

702
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,360
[Park Jae Ha: This attitude of yours
is the problem!]

703
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,240
[Park Jae Ha: Don't be so pessimistic.]

704
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,400
[Park Jae Ha: That's the problem.]

705
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,840
[Park Jae Ha: Why?
There's nothing wrong with you!]

706
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,280
[Kim Su Min:
Because my success rate is low.]

707
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,600
[Park Jae Ha: But success rate...]

708
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,040
[Park Jae Ha: Your low success rate is]

709
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,400
[Park Jae Ha: because
you're too passive, isn't it?]

710
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,440
[Kim Su Min: The lack of confidence
is another thing, I guess...]

711
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,800
[Kim Su Min: I don't think
I'll be chosen to begin with.]

712
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,080
[Kim Su Min: Like with the room allocation,
it was about first impressions.]

713
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,360
[Kim Su Min: Although it was
decided by the newcomers,]

714
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,240
[Kim Su Min: they need
to be interested in me]

715
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,000
[Kim Su Min: to want me
as their roommate.]

716
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,360
[Kim Su Min: I think my lack of confidence
during the previous shoot]

717
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,720
[Kim Su Min: is probably
why I didn't get any calls.]

718
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,160
[Kim Su Min: I had no hope
and no expectations at all.]

719
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,760
[Kim Su Min: I just kept to myself.]

720
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,640
[Lee Hyun Jun: So we're
supposed to play solo now.]

721
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,990
[Lee Hyun Jun: It'd be less stressful
to be alone, won't it?]

722
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,280
[Kim Han Gyeol: Yes, let's spread out then.]
[Cho Yun Jae: Oh, really?]

723
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,520
-Bye. See you later.
-Bye.

724
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,880
[Hyun Jun and Yun Jae return to their room.]

725
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,560
[Taichi: Have you decided who to call?]

726
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,040
[Kim Han Gyeol: Yeah, what about you?]

727
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,280
[Taichi: Me too.]

728
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,760
[Kim Han Gyeol:
But I'm considering between two people.]

729
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,440
[Taichi: Between two?]
[Kim Han Gyeol: Yeah]

730
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,900
[Conflicted]

731
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,580
[Kim Han Gyeol: When it's time for the calls,
I can only stare at my phone.]

732
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,960
[Taichi: Yeah.]

733
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,400
[Taichi: You think you'll get a lot of calls?]
[Kim Han Gyeol: Who? You?]

734
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
[Taichi: No, you.]
[Kim Han Gyeol: Me? No.]

735
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,040
[Kim Han Gyeol: I was so shy today
that I didn't get to make an impression.]

736
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,420
[Kim Han Gyeol: Except when
you and I chatted, and with the 1st-floor guys.]

737
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,800
[Taichi: I see.]

738
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,500
[Kim Han Gyeol: Actually, I've
already decided who to call,]

739
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,800
[Kim Han Gyeol: so I wasn't nervous.]

740
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,680
[Kim Han Gyeol: To be honest,
I didn't think anyone else would call me,]

741
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,640
[Kim Han Gyeol: so I wasn't worried.
No one would call me anyway.]

742
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,960
[Kim Han Gyeol: I only
thought about who to call.]

743
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,360
[Meanwhile, on the first floor of Block A,]

744
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,960
in the extreme introverts room
of Hyun Jun and Yun Jae...]

745
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,640
[Flooded with silence again]

746
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,700
[Sneaks a peek]

747
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,160
[Lee Hyun Jun: I'll go to the living room]

748
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,080
[Lee Hyun Jun: so you can relax.]
[Cho Yun Jae: OK, see you later.]

749
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,280
[The two are still awkward]

750
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,640
[Hyun Jun comes to the living room alone.]

751
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,400
[Cho Yun Jae: I wanted to tell him
I was fine with him around...]

752
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,200
[Cho Yun Jae: He's really considerate,
and I'm grateful and even a bit touched,]

753
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,880
[Cho Yun Jae: but I really wanted to
tell him he could stay in the room,]

754
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,800
[Cho Yun Jae: but he must
have his reasons for doing so,]

755
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,160
[Cho Yun Jae: so I thought
I should go along with him.]

756
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,160
[Cho Yun Jae,
please head to the Phone Room.]

757
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,840
[Within 30 seconds, convey your feelings
to the man you are drawn to today.]

758
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,580
[Looks up]

759
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,520
[First person to make a call: Cho Yun Jae]

760
00:39:59,200 --> 00:39:59,870
[Who will Yun Jae convey his feelings to?]

761
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:00,810
Where is it?

762
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,240
[The roommate he chose, Hyun Jun?]

763
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:19,160
[His first date, Taichi?]

764
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:37,640
[Yun Jae nervously goes down step by step]

765
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,440
[Finally at the Phone Room]

766
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,920
[Cho Yun Jae:
Actually, I knew who I'd call,]

767
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,480
[Cho Yun Jae:
as my feelings haven't changed.]

768
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,960
[Cho Yun Jae:
That was when I was most nervous.]

769
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,440
[Yun Jae makes his call without hesitation]

770
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,440
[Hello? Hello?]
[Cho Yun Jae: Hello?]

771
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,320
[Cho Yun Jae: I met you
for the first time today.]

772
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,600
[Cho Yun Jae:
It was really nice to meet you.]

773
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,000
[Lee Hyun Jun: Really?]

774
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,150
[Yun Jae called his roommate, Lee Hyun Jun]

775
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,710
[Lee Hyun Jun: Thank you.]

776
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,560
[Cho Yun Jae: No... See you later.]

777
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,760
[Lee Hyun Jun: OK, see you later.]

778
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,300
[Dazed]

779
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:57,680
[So short, yet so long;
the 30-second call is over]

780
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,160
[Cho Yun Jae: I was more nervous
than when talking face to face.]

781
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,680
[Cho Yun Jae:
Because it's only 30 seconds,]

782
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,560
[Cho Yun Jae:
I thought about what to say beforehand.]

783
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,000
[Cho Yun Jae: But after making the call,]

784
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,180
[Cho Yun Jae:
I couldn't remember what to say.]

785
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,600
[Cho Yun Jae:
So I just said...]

786
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:22,350
["Nice to meet you"
and "See you in the room later."]

787
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,040
[(Shy)]

788
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,740
[Gets up]

789
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,940
[Stops]

790
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,640
[Yun Jae is back in his room]

791
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,880
[Yun Jae and Hyun Jun's eyes meet]
[Hehe]

792
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,640
[Lee Hyun Jun: I was happy to get a call,]

793
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,000
[Lee Hyun Jun: and it's from someone
who said he was interested in me,]

794
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,400
[Lee Hyun Jun:
so I'm also curious about him.]

795
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,480
[Kim Han Gyeol:
Have you decided who (to call)?]

796
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,800
[Taichi: Yeah!]

797
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,960
[Taichi: Have you decided?]
[Kim Han Gyeol: Yeah.]

798
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,500
[Taichi,
please head to the Phone Room.]

799
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,990
[Within 30 seconds, convey your feelings
to the man you are drawn to today.]

958
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:21,490
[Taichi: You don't know?]

959
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:24,110
[Kim Han Gyeol:
I can't tell from his voice.]

960
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,810
[Taichi: Didn't he say his name?]
[Kim Han Gyeol: I think I can guess who.]

961
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,150
[Kim Han Gyeol: Or maybe not.]

962
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,220
[Kim Han Gyeol: The person who called]

963
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:38,650
[Kim Han Gyeol: had a very
deep, low, and charismatic voice.]

964
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,740
[Kim Han Gyeol:
I was so surprised and panicked,]

965
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,730
[Kim Han Gyeol: just stumbling over my words
and then hanging up.]

966
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:45,160
[Kim Han Gyeol:
I didn't even ask his name.]

967
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:49,210
[Kim Han Gyeol: So until now,
I still don't know who he is.]

968
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:53,380
[Taichi getting mixed feelings
while observing Han Gyeol]

969
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,320
[Taichi: Although I expected it,]

970
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,090
[Taichi: he got more calls than I thought.
It's a bit confusing.]

971
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:01,540
[Taichi: Because I'll have
more competitors to fend off.]

972
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:05,710
[Taichi: And there's even elimination.
It got more complicated.]

973
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:09,060
[Taichi: I tried to act like I was unfazed
as I watched him take the calls.]

974
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,820
[Taichi: I tried to convince myself
it isn't a big deal.]

975
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,440
[Taichi: I had to think so.]

976
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,880
[Taichi: Because now we are together,]

977
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,390
[Taichi: and he chose me.]

978
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:18,880
[Taichi: Rather than the desire to win,
I've already won.]

979
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,720
[Taichi: So I told myself to relax.]

980
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,020
[Park Jae Ha: Oh, no.]

981
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:29,530
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Why? What's wrong?]

982
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:31,700
[My heart is suddenly pounding.]

983
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,460
[Kim Su Min: I might not
practice what I preach in the future,]

984
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,860
[Kim Su Min: but I think
it's best not to think too much.]

985
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,860
[Park Jae Ha: That's right.]

986
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,570
[Kim Su Min: Just follow my heart.
That's the only true choice.]

987
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:41,780
[Park Jae Ha: In this place and setting,]

988
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,690
[Park Jae Ha: distractions, relationships,]

989
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:44,580
[Park Jae Ha: and everything else]

990
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,440
[Park Jae Ha: must all be put aside.]

991
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,910
[Park Jae Ha:
Just focus on your emotions...]

992
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,730
[Park Jae Ha: What is it?]
[Lee Hyeok Jin: It's your text!]

993
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:52,420
Oh, to make your call.

994
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,160
[Kim Su Min,
please head to the Phone Room.]

995
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:54,340
Because you can only follow your heart here.

996
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:57,060
[Within 30 seconds, convey your feelings
to the man you are drawn to today.]

997
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,130
[Park Jae Ha: You can do it!]
[Kim Su Min: Time flies, huh?]

998
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,230
[Lee Hyeok Jin: Go get it!]

999
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:14,210
[Now, he has to confront his feelings]

1000
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,300
[So nervous that he doesn't feel the cold,
removing his scarf]

1001
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:38,970
["The man I am most drawn to today."]

1002
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,780
[Kim Su Min:
I've been mulling over which guy]

1003
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,510
[Kim Su Min:
I am most drawn to today is.]

1004
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,610
[Kim Su Min: I'll just follow my heart.]

1005
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:50,230
[Kim Su Min:
I tried my best to not think]

1006
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:52,340
[Kim Su Min:
and call the person in my heart now.]

1007
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:57,290
[Kim Su Min: I've thought endlessly
about what I should say.]

1008
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:02,520
[Who is the man he is most drawn to today?]

1009
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:10,150
[Who walked into Su Min's heart?]

1010
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,510
[Nervous]

1011
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:15,730
[Su Min presses the Dial button]

1012
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,420
[Anxious]

1013
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,790
[Hello?]
[Kim Su Min: Hello?]

1014
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,880
[Sorry?]
[Kim Su Min: Hello.]

1015
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,270
[Hello?]

1016
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,900
[Kim Su Min: Shall we
go for a drive together this time?]

1017
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:33,530
[The man he wants to go for a drive with...]

1018
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:34,300
[Sun Wook]

1019
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,460
I'd love that.

1020
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,050
[Sounds good!]

1021
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,730
["You're so pretty today."]

1022
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,610
[Thank you.]

1023
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:53,060
[Kim Su Min: The snow is
supposed to melt on the weekend.]

1024
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,950
[Kim Su Min: Let's go for a drive.]

1025
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,600
[Kim Su Min: Sure! Good job today.]

1026
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,710
Oh? Oh.

1027
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,410
[Lee Hyeong Jun: Who was it?]

1028
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,540
I don't know.

1029
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:20,830
[Short but brave 30 seconds
have come to an end]

1030
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,000
[Kim Su Min:
Sun Wook was one of the participants]

1031
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,160
[Kim Su Min: from the previous shoot
that I hoped would return.]

1032
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,470
[Kim Su Min: After the previous shoot,]

1033
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:32,560
[Kim Su Min:
I found it hard to approach Sun Wook.]

1034
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,820
[Kim Su Min: We became a little distant.]

1035
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:41,540
[Kim Su Min:
Can't we get along like friends?]

1036
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:45,150
[Kim Su Min:
There is no reason we'd become distant.]

1037
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:50,250
[Kim Su Min: When I came here,
I just wanted to see him one more time.]

1038
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:57,270
[Kim Su Min: I'm still dealing with
the aftereffects of that week.]

1039
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:59,210
[Kim Su Min:
It made me do a lot of thinking.]

1040
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,260
[Kim Su Min: I have a lot of regrets too.]

1041
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:05,200
[Park Jae Ha: How was it?]

1042
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,790
[Park Jae Ha: How do you feel,
doing it again after so long?]

1043
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,750
[It was no biggie!]

[Park Jae Ha: But now...]

1047
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,250
[Park Jae Ha: You look relieved.]

1048

I was looking forward to it.]

1053
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,760

still in separate spots]

In any case, we have to share a room.]

If I called him and he didn't call me,]

1063
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:17,560
[Cho Yun Jae:
it'd probably be really awkward.]

1064
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,760

Yun Jae?]

expressed interest in him, Sun Wook?]
