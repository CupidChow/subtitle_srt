00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,300

2
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:18,487
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:23,073
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:26,853
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:32,225
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:36,731
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:40,380
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:47,439
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:55,870
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:01,545
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:04,099
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,312
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,312 --> 00:01:09,565
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:14,791
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,779
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:20,131
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:27,026
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:31,433

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,493

20
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,770
Here. Take a look at our News Club.

21
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,270
Thank you.

22
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:17,680
Hey, there!

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,963
This is the boys' dormitory. Girls are not allowed.

24
00:02:20,963 --> 00:02:23,211
I know, Auntie. I'm a freshman. I'm looking for someone.

25
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:24,860
- It's still a "no". It's against rules. 
 - I just need two minutes!

26
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,550
- How could you do that? 
 - Just two minutes!

27
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,110
No.

28
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,559
I'll call security if you won't leave.

29
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,270
Zhou Siyue!

30
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,600
Zhou Siyue, I'm here for you!

31
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,820
Zhou Siyue! Come out! I'm going in if you don't come out!

32
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,290
 Zhou Siyue!

33
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,470
 Zhou Siyue! I'm here for you!

34
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,500
Zhou Siyue!

35
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,800
Ding Xian!

36
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,740
Zhou Siyue, it's so nice to see you.

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,040
You never picked up my call or returned my message.

38
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,000
I thought you wouldn't come out to see me.

39
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,400
I just have something to say.

40
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,760
Tell me.

41
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,450
I like you.

42
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,670
Have you ever felt the same?

43
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,520
Ding Xian,

44
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,130
I have no plans for romantic relationships now.

45
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,430
It's getting late. You should go back.

46
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,820
Focus on your studying and don't come looking for me again.

47
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,470
We said that we would get into Huaqing together.

48
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,760
Now I have done it.

49
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,480
I just want to know if you ever had feelings for me.

50
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,170
Is the answer...

51
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,990
really important?

52
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,990
Ding Xian,

53
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,770
we all have our own lives.

54
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,681
So what?

55
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,750
Zhou Siyue!

56
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,750
Do you know my secret?

57
00:06:38,476 --> 00:06:40,856
It's getting late. I'm going to leave now.

58
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,759
Activate.

59
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,030

60
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,270

61
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:05,090

62
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:09,720

63
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,720
 It was August 2009.

64
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,280
 Summer in the south is scorching hot.

65
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,490
 We left the small town of Keshan and moved to Shenhai.

66
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,060
 Everything we passed by was so strange.

67
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,460
 It was a whole new beginning.

68
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,220
 I hoped the city of Shenhai can treat me nicely.

69
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:41,340
 I hoped I could maintain my performance at school this semester and make some new friends.

70
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,080
 And I hoped everything could go well.

71
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,110
- Sir, take it easy. 
 - Be careful with the cabinet.

72
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,080
Come on, over here.

73
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,540
Xian, here are your books. Put them away.

74
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:09,226
Siyue! Siyue!

75
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:11,340
Your keys!

76
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:14,848
Can you be lazier?

77
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,515
- Brother, what's going on? 
 - I twisted my ankle.

78
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:19,660
What are you staring at?

79
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,640
Go move the things. Stop wasting time.

80
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,540
Ding Juncong.

81
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,300
- This place is huge. 
 - Don't waste any time.

82
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,010
We have to go out later.

83
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,710
Refrigerator... Yes, put it against the wall.

84
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,500
Put the other things in the second bedroom.

85
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,164
Juncong. Xian. You two are sharing one bedroom.

86
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:56,020
- No way! 
 - No way!

87
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,810
I'm old enough now. I'm not sharing a room with him.

88
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,320
How about I go stay at school?

89
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,220
Why would you do that?

90
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,690
With such a good apartment, you want to waste money on that?

91
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,210
Do you think we have cash just lying around?

92
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,811
All right.

93
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:10,230
We have another small room.

94
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,700
I could give up my study room and make it their bedroom.

95
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,810
How's that, Wanxian?

96
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,510
- Fine. You two pick your rooms. 
 - Great!

97
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,571
- Take it easy. 
 - I'm taking this room.

98
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:21,865
I want this room, too.

99
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,350
Ding Juncong, why did you push me?

100
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,810
Mom! Mom! Mom!

101
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,800
What are you doing?

102
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,240
What are you doing? You...

103
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,341
Apologize!

104
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,550
I'm not going to!

105
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,260
That's fine, but you have to let me have this room.

106
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,370
No way!

107
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,810
What does a little kid like you need such a big room for?

108
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,590
I don't care. I want that room! That is the room I want!

109
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,830
Xian, you are the elder one, can you let your brother choose first?

110
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,550
- Mom! 
 - Wanxian, where is my medicine kit?

111
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,200
I don't know, look for it yourself.

112
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,892
You...

113
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:52,092
Why is the medicine kit missing?

114
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,660
- Xianxian, are you all right? 
 - Yes.

115
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,080
Then hurry up.

116
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,610
The Zhous are waiting for us.

117
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,653
I don't want to go.

118
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:08,893
Stop nagging and hurry up.

119
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,750
Coming!

120
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,970
- Zhou! 
 - Wencheng!

121
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,540
You are finally here.

122
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,824
Come on, get in.

123
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:25,961
Say hello to Uncle Zhou.

124
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:27,590
- No need to change into slippers. 
 - Hello, Uncle.

125
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,050
- It's okay. 
 - We should change. Look at the floor.

126
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,130
This is...

127
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,980
Sorry to bother you about the school.

128
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,780
It's just a little thank-you gift.

129
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,280
You are being a stranger right now.

130
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,970
I'll leave it here.

131
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,200
It's okay, come in. This is...

132
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,520
Jinyun.

133
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,220
Wencheng is here.

134
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,650
- Hello! 
 - That's a lot of work you've done.

135
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,340
- Nice to see you. 
 - Nice to see you.

136
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,440
Ding. Wanxian. Welcome.

137
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,740
This is Auntie Li who I brought up all the time.

138
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,570
 Sorry, Auntie Li.

139
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,740
 The truth is my mom never mentioned you.

140
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,230
I always wanted to bring Xian here to see you.

141
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,429
Am I right?

142
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:03,960
 One of the signatures of teenagers.

143
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,130
 Lying without feeling guilty at all.

144
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,010
Auntie Li, hello.

145
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,880
I heard a lot about you from my mom.

146
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,000
- You are a nice kid. 
 - Wencheng, sit.

147
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,900
Yes. Don't just stand here. Let's sit and eat.

148
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay. Change your shoes.

149
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:18,170
Your dad and Uncle Zhou have been friends since childhood.

150
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,690
Uncle Zhou got this job in Shenhai for your dad.

151
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,240
You two, behave here.

152
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,810
Before you guys arrived, I was telling Yun

153
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,570
- that we haven't met for some time. 
 - Sit.

154
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,350
We are drinking tonight.

155
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,610
Yeah, we have to drink.

156
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,560
- Hurry up. 
 - You have no objection, do you?

157
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,370
- Not at all. 
 - Why don't you also have some?

158
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,970
Sure. Thank you.

159
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,110
They are Siyue's schoolmates.

160
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,740
They are here to play games together.

161
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,160
- Hello, Uncle and Auntie. 
 - Hello.

162
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,050
Where is Siyue?

163
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,146
He's asleep.

164
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:46,470
Ask him to come out.

165
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,648
Master Zhou, wake up.

166
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:49,640
Your mom is asking you to join us at the dining table.

167
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,760
 Coming.

168
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,490
Going to school nowadays is rough.

169
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,960
What a crowd!

170
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,361
Siyue! Come and say "hi" to Uncle Ding and Auntie Ye.

171
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,880
Uncle Ding. Auntie Ye.

172
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,200
You are all grown up.

173
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,510
- I'm sorry about that. 
 - There's no need to be shy. Come.

174
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,570
We haven't met for years.

175
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,790
Let's cheer for this reunion.

176
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,250
Right. Welcome.

177
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,760
- Thank you. 
 - Sorry for the trouble.

178
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,120
It's not easy to prepare for this.

179
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,250
Have some food.

180
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,440
Xianxian, you should remember.

181
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,640
This is Siyue. You met when you were younger.

182
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,570
Siyue looks so handsome now.

183
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,740
He's all grown up.

184
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,150
I held you in my arms when you were little.

185
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,453
How time flies.

186
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:33,370
You don't say!

187
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,530
He's already in high school now.

188
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,130
Right, Xianxian.

189
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,880
I heard that you performed well on the high school entrance exam.

190
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,006
I got 695.

191
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:46,306
That's impressive.

192
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,220
That's not my best.

193
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,540
Our Xianxian would study until 2:00 a.m. before exams.

194
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,610
She can't be persuaded.

195
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,710
She just loves school so much.

196
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,050
Siyue, what was your score?

197
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,760
Me?

198
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,576
680.

199
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,132
Just past the line.

200
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:12,710
Siyue is talented.

201
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,150
He passed the line easily.

202
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,030
We were playing games before the exam.

203
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,740
You are also Siyue's classmate, right?

204
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,740
What was your score?

205
00:14:23,987 --> 00:14:25,300
Auntie,

206
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,690
the score only needs to meet the line.

207
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,340
That's what I've been saying to Xianxian.

208
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,520
The score only needs to meet the line.

209
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,760
But Xianxian just loves to study. She's a tough person.

210
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,740
Enough. Stop talking and eat your food.

211
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,690
Xian is clearly a nice kid.

212
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,570
She will achieve something in the future.

213
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,460
- You did a good job bringing her up, Ding. 
 - That's not true. You are flattering me.

214
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,860
- I should learn from you. 
 - Learn from me?

215
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,340
We should learn from each other.

216
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,950
Yeah. Xian never makes me worry when it comes to studying.

217
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,540
Siyue!

218
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,409
You should discuss school-related questions together.

219
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:00,379
Xianxian knows everything.

220
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,766
Sure, Auntie.

221
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:05,110
- I will. 
 - This is great.

222
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,550
You two should communicate more.

223
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,270
Your grandfathers arranged your marriage when you were little.

224
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,600
Why bring that up?

225
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,220
That's where we were at.

226
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,253
That's true.

227
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,680
But it's too early for them to think about that.

228
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,110
They are just high schoolers.

229
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,200
Yes. That's right.

230
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,450
Studying should be your focus now.

231
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,976
Come on.

232
00:15:30,976 --> 00:15:32,866
How do we cancel the marriage?

233
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,496
Nonsense. Auntie Ye was just kidding. Did you take it seriously?

234
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:38,996
That's right.

235
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,232
I'm kidding with Auntie, too.

236
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,200
- Come on. 
 - He's a funny kid.

237
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,573
 Like I would like you.

238
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,379
Uncle Ding. Auntie Ye. Please make yourselves at home.

239
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:52,960
I'm finished.

240
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,150
That's all you need?

241
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,120
I had too much in the morning. Don't mind me.

242
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,280
I... I'm finished, too.

243
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,635
Me, too.

244
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:00,900
Come on, ignore them.

245
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,760
- Here. 
 - Sorry about that.

246
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,930
Boys at their age are a little rebellious.

247
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,640
- That's right. 
 - Our kids are the same.

248
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,400
Yeah. That's how all of them are.

249
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,050
Sister, I need to use the bathroom.

250
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,340
Okay. I'll take you.

251
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,742
 I got 695.

252
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:24,270
 Xianxian is such a sensitive kid.

253
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,300
 I never have to worry about her.

254
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,640
Xianxian knows everything.

255
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,310
Her mom was trying to be Siyue's in-law.

256
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,250
 Who would arrange marriage nowadays?

257
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,700
 Yeah, that must be a joke.

258
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,540
Did you guys see the bump on her head?

259
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,250
Doesn't it look like a horn?

260
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,570
She was trying to cover it like we wouldn't notice.

261
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,810
She's like Shrek.

262
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,750
The green monster.

263
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,810
And what was his wife's name?

264
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,933
Fiona!

265
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:50,440
- Fiona! 
 - Yeah.

266
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,289
Princess Fiona.

267
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:54,340
Princess Fiona.

268
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,030
Princess Fiona.

269
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,072
How do you feel?

270
00:16:57,072 --> 00:17:00,413
What does it feel like to have a fiancée?

271
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:02,130
Can you stop talking?

272
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,260
Try to kick me again!

273
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,580
 Sister, they run out of toilet paper.

274
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,737
Did... Did she hear all of that?

275
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,546
Now what?

276
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,646
Go open the door.

277
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:35,113
You should deal with your own mess. Go!

278
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,540
Little... Little Monster...

279
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,880
Beauty, what is it?

280
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,283
The toilet paper has run out.

281
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:49,974
Do you have any here?

282
00:17:49,974 --> 00:17:51,710
Yes.

283
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,010
We need toilet paper!

284
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,110
 We should stop drinking.

285
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,320
 No. You need to stop, Zhou!

286
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,940
Hey.

287
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,712
Did you hear what we were talking about?

288
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:15,580
 You can drink more now.

289
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,860
Would it make you happy if I cancel our marriage?

290
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,730
Yeah.

291
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,200
Then I'm not doing that.

292
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:30,190
 The second signature of teenagers.

293
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,550
 They never give you what you want.

294
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,340
Here comes the paper.

295
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,010
Silly boy!

296
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,540
Think about the way you acted.

297
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,950
You just don't know how to bring your best.

298
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,820
That was such a good chance.

299
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,296
You didn't even talk to Zhou Siyue longer.

300
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:49,560
I don't know what to say.

301
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,390
There's nothing to say.

302
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,930
You and your dad are so alike. You have no social skills.

303
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,680
You will have a hard time when you leave school.

304
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,433
Look at Zhou Siyue.

305
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:01,983
He's clearly a popular kid.

306
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,130
You have ruined my social life.

307
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,180
How could you say that?

308
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,223
- What are you looking for? 
 - Where is my hat?

309
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:10,880
It's not here. Stop making a mess.

310
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
I can't put things in place if you make a mess here.

311
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,441
Go away!

312
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:15,210
Do you know any drugstores nearby?

313
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,029
How could I know that?

314
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:19,949
I'll find your medicine when I'm done here.

315
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:22,966
Xian, why don't I go with you?

316
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:25,349
It's okay, Dad. I can go by myself.

317
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,560
I'm going to the drugstore now.

318
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,360
Yes!

319
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,633
Junk!

320
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:32,533
Boring.

321
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,430
What are you doing this afternoon?

322
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,130
Basketball?

323
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,807
Dude, can't you see that my ankle is severely injured?

324
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:40,467
Be a little considerate, will you?

325
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,126
It hurts!

326
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:43,800
You still know what pain feels like.

327
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,070
You were pretty happy when you were talking about someone else.

328
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,770
I'm not kidding. It really hurts.

329
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:53,000
Besides, why does the pain keep increasing?

330
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,610
How about this?

331
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,130
You two take me to get it checked.

332
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,801
I know a place.

333
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,720
What place?

334
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:09,630
Don't make me feel the pain with you.

335
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,090
Young fellow, you call this pain?

336
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,350
Sir, can you be gentle a little?

337
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,400
I'm almost done.

338
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,510
I can't stand it anymore.

339
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:29,227

340
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,420
Young lady, you are a student at Shenhai High School, right?

341
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,375
The school is starting soon.

342
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,500
I know what you are looking for.

343
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,659
This.

344
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,049
It's good for your memory.

345
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,680
And these.

346
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,830
Bring them back

347
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,173
- and ask your parents to make soup. 
 - That's not what I'm looking for.

348
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:56,754
So, what are you...

349
00:20:56,754 --> 00:20:59,320
I... This...

350
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,730
My goodness!

351
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,860
How... How did you get that?

352
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,790
I bumped into a ghost.

353
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,792
I don't care what you bumped into. I recommend this to you.

354
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:16,123
I promise that after using it, you will feel brand new tomorrow.

355
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:17,280
Like you never bumped into anything.

356
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,825
Here.

357
00:21:18,825 --> 00:21:20,253
Have a try.

358
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:21,400
Don't give up.

359
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,880
- I'll go check out. 
 - Hold on.

360
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,840
Siyue, I'm coming with you.

361
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,400
Owner, check, please.

362
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,880
Just a second.

363
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,093
What a small world!

364
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:35,303
Small world, my ass.

365
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,300
Why does your bump keep getting bigger?

366
00:21:40,106 --> 00:21:41,830
I don't have time for this.

367
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,870
Owner, I don't want it anymore.

368
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,680
Young lady, you haven't paid yet.

369
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,570
I didn't use it.

370
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,200
It has been opened. How am I supposed to sell it now?

371
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,860
How much is that?

372
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:03,510
The price is 100. But since you are all students, I'll give you a 20% discount.

373
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,730
Make it 80.

374
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,310
80?

375
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,980
It would only cost 10 to 20 where I came from.

376
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,163
This is the featured product of our store.

377
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:14,923
The cost is high.

378
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,130
So, can I buy half a bottle?

379
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,830
Half a bottle?

380
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,130
Young lady, you must be joking.

381
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,850
Owner, here. I'm taking that.

382
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,410
You are paying for the foot massage inside, right?

383
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,420
Is it enough?

384
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,880
This is...

385
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,070
- For the medicine. 
 - Thank you.

386
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,780
I'll pack it up for you.

387
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,370
Thank you.

388
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,450
I will pay you back with my allowance next week.

389
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,860
How about this? You take me to dinner now and we are even.

390
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,450
Sure. What are you thinking about?

391
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,550
A feast, of course.

392
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,323
Let's go.

393
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:05,949
Young lady, here's your medicine.

394
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:07,250
Thank you.

395
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,170
It's okay. Take care.

396
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:16,090

397
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,800
Owner! Hello!

398
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,300
I want a share of fish balls.

399
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,600
All right.

400
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,950
Owner! And a marinated egg!

401
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,460
In a minute.

402
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,060
Sit.

403
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,720
This is the feast you were talking about?

404
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,846
This restaurant has been running for over a decade. The food here is delicious.

405
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,590
Don't overthink what happened today.

406
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,160
That's just how they are.

407
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,620
They say mean things, but they have no bad intentions.

408
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,250
Okay.

409
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,400
Here.

410
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Thank you.

411
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,070
Dig in!

412
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:01,873
Go ahead. It's not poisonous.

413
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,301
It's actually quite delicious.

414
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:11,560
You should have some, too.

415
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,440
I'm not hungry. You go ahead.

416
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,826
There are a lot of delicious foods in Shenhai.

417
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:24,623
You could have a try at all of them if you can.

418
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,070
Owner! Another marinated egg!

419
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,943
All right!

420
00:24:30,943 --> 00:24:33,983
I'm okay. One is enough for me.

421
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,670
It's for your head, not for you to eat.

422
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,183
Look at your bump.

423
00:24:40,183 --> 00:24:42,933
It's almost as big as a horn.

424
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:48,683
Horn? What horn?

425
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,930
Here. A marinated egg.

426
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,859
- Check, please. 
 - All right.

427
00:25:08,877 --> 00:25:10,777
You are back.

428
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,850
Why did you buy this again?

429
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,120
I bought a bag just a few days ago.

430
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,010
The clerk in the supermarket recommended this.

431
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,660
I think the quality is pretty good.

432
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:26,140
And more importantly, it comes with an apron.

433
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:31,560
Oh, right. School is starting the day after tomorrow.

434
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,620
Have you got all your stuff?

435
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,950
School is starting tomorrow.

436
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,340
Tomorrow?

437
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,610
It's my fault.

438
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,063
I have been so busy that I forgot that.

439
00:25:41,063 --> 00:25:43,910
It's okay. It doesn't make any difference.

440
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,640
School is starting soon. Don't catch a cold.

441
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,560
The temperature difference is huge between seasons. I'll get you a coat.

442
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,193
It's okay.

443
00:25:52,193 --> 00:25:53,513
I'm fine.

444
00:25:53,513 --> 00:25:57,603
It's probably because someone was saying mean things about me.

445
00:25:57,603 --> 00:25:58,870
 Marinated egg!

446
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,870
 Stupid marinated egg!

447
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:22,020
 I'm going to become a member of Shenhai High School tomorrow.

448
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:29,960
 But I hope that I won't bump into that jinxed guy tomorrow.

449
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,336

450
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,960
It's really gone.

451
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,910
Ding Xian, hurry up or your dad will leave without you.

452
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,300
Dad, you should leave now.

453
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,070
I'll get to school myself.

454
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,115
I'm late.

455
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,840
Okay. You can go by yourself. Hurry up.

456
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,199
Ding Wencheng, be smart on your first day at work.

457
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:03,626
All right. I'm leaving now.

458
00:27:03,626 --> 00:27:05,626
Take care!

459
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,350
Mom, have you seen my school tag?

460
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,783
No. Where did you leave it?

461
00:27:12,783 --> 00:27:13,990
I...

462
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,290
What's with that smile? Did you take it?

463
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,810
No. I never touched it.

464
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,420
It must be you.

465
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,610
Ding Juncong, did you take it?

466
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,980
Give it back to your sister. Look how worried she is.

467
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,820
I didn't.

468
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,560
Ding Xian, have you found it?

469
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,521
No.

470
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,130
Where did you put it? You are always so careless.

471
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,450
I left it on the table.

472
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,639
You are late.

473
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:36,439
Come on, Ding Xian. You need to go.

474
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:39,010
I'm leaving now.

475
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,130
How could a girl sit on the floor?

476
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,610
Mom, I'm leaving.

477
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:48,670
Take care. Be safe.

478
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,390
Hello?

479
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:08,520
Jiang Chen, you had my bike for the whole summer vacation.

480
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,900
Bring it back to me at lunch break today.

481
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,450
I'm almost late for school.

482
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,140
Isn't school this way?

483
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,390
Hold on! Hold on!

484
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,540
 Teachers. Students.

485
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:49,110
 At this wonderful time of the year when flowers swing in the breeze,

486
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,230
 we have received a new batch of students.

487
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,660
 And I would like to welcome them to join us.

488
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,290
 In the NCEE that just ended,

489
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,650
 Shenhai High School has achieved...

490
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,382
Hello, why are you late on your first day?

491
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:08,800
I got lost.

492
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,580
Lost?

493
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,520
Why didn't you lose yourself?

494
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,360
Stand in the back.

495
00:29:15,976 --> 00:29:17,976
Now.

496
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,010
 Here, I would like to congratulate all of you.

497
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,940
 I know a lot of you came from Shenhai Junior High,

498
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,900
 which means you are familiar with this place.

499
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,460
 Nevertheless, high school is a new beginning.

500
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,000
You are pretty early.

501
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,490
Bummer.

502
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:51,350
 Create an excellent educational vibe together with our teachers.

503
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,380
 I've known you for years.

504
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,580
 What's wrong with using your mirror a little bit?

505
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,980
 No.

506
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,860
 Stingy!

507
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,480
 You are the stingy one!

508
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,460
 Then let me use it.

509
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,140
 I don't want to.

510
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,480
 Fine.

511
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,080
 Years of friendship

512
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,684
 just crumbled in an instant.

513
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:15,360
- Kong Shadi! 
 - What do you want, Song Ziqi!

514
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,630
Why can't I get rid of you?

515
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,270
Like I want to be sitting by your side.

516
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,420
Big shot. You are late on your first day.

517
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,580
So what?

518
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,320
It's not like I'm the only one.

519
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,200
Why are you looking at me? Is there another seat open?

520
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,480
Where is your school tag?

521
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,676
This is bad. You two are finished.

522
00:30:47,676 --> 00:30:51,060
Both of you will become the main targets of Aunt Liu.

523
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,700
Aunt Liu?

524
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,823
- Who's that? 
 - Don't you know that?

525
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:57,800
The one who kept nagging during the new semester ceremony.

526
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,806
He's like my aunt.

527
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:01,540
There's nothing he won't meddle with.

528
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,440
From school performance to the length of students' hair.

529
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,240
He will control every aspect he can control.

530
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,080
The two of you must have had some experience already.

531
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,790

532
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,304
Hello, students.

533
00:31:35,304 --> 00:31:37,660
I'm your new teacher in Politics.

534
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,830
My name's Ding Wencheng.

535
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,600
Mr. Ding, can we start the lecture right away?

536
00:31:49,113 --> 00:31:51,013
Yeah, sure.

537
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,690
Please look at the papers from the last NCEE.

538
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,220
Let's look at the first question.

539
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:05,839
Stand up!

540
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,850
Hello, teacher.

541
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,750
Sit down.

542
00:32:13,963 --> 00:32:16,970
Deng Wanwan, before the class leaders are elected,

543
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,580
you should be the acting class monitor for now.

544
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,560
Okay.

545
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,260
Let me just say a few things...

546
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,620
Look how proud she is.

547
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,880
Look how she's showing off? After Yang Chunzi asked for a leave, she's all snooty.

548
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,820
This is a competition with countless contestants and few winners.

549
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,953
And it starts right now.

550
00:32:30,953 --> 00:32:33,850
There's no turning back.

551
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,923
Since you are in this school,

552
00:32:36,923 --> 00:32:39,030
you are a part of Shenhai High School.

553
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:43,150
You should bring glory to the tag you are wearing.

554
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,070
You need to be prepared for the courses that are coming.

555
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:50,430
Is it necessary to keep notes of demotivational quotes like that?

556
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,930
You have a lot of subjects which are all hard.

557
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,210
Didn't someone teach you not to peek at someone else's stuff?

558
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,850
Besides, I have a name.

559
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,920
Okay.

560
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,980
Got it.

561
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,740
Listen. Don't try to hit on me again.

562
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,750
I'm hitting on you?

563
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,810
You keep talking to me.

564
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,930
No need to try to be close.

565
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,970
The seats will be rearranged soon.

566
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,480
We are just temporary deskmates.

567
00:33:28,313 --> 00:33:32,413
Fine, temporary deskmate.

568
00:33:32,413 --> 00:33:36,360
About the seats, we can wait.

569
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,394
The mock exam is in a month.

570
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:45,650
You have one month to review all the knowledge that you learned before.

571
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:50,170
And we will rearrange seats a month later according to your performance in the exam.

572
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:57,210
Besides, starting today, if I catch anyone without their school tag,

573
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,020
he or she can go home right away.

574
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,140
I'm not going to call any names here. You know who you are.

575
00:34:14,246 --> 00:34:16,146
Uncle Ding.

576
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,770
Bocong.

577
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,092
I'm surprised that you are our teacher.

578
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:24,123
Where are you sitting?

579
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:25,760
Over there.

580
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,560
My eyes sometimes fail me. I didn't even see you.

581
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,930
All the seniors have a lot of books on the table.

582
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,980
It's natural that you didn't see me.

583
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,111
You are all grown up.

584
00:34:34,111 --> 00:34:38,168
I feel like you were just dragging Xian across the street yesterday.

585
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:41,449
Oh, Uncle Ding. Xian is here, too. Right?

586
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:43,156
She's in Class Three, Grade One.

587
00:34:43,156 --> 00:34:47,703
You were always Xian's model regarding studying, and that's why she tried so hard to get here.

588
00:34:47,703 --> 00:34:50,935
Really? Class Three, Grade One is an honors class. Right?

589
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:53,317
She's so much better than I was.

590
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:55,962
Uncle Ding, I'm relieved that you are here, too.

591
00:34:55,962 --> 00:34:58,940
Xian and you can look after each other.

592
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:04,080
Yeah. I can have lunch with her.

593
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,460
I have to go now.

594
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,850
They asked me to have a meeting.

595
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,850
Don't let me keep you.

596
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,280
Uncle Ding!

597
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,500
Uncle Ding.

598
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,400
- Okay. Thank you. 
 - Take care.

599
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,700

600
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,050
Siyue, let's go for lunch.

601
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,900
Come on, temporary deskmate.

602
00:35:53,057 --> 00:35:55,143
Are you two going or not? I'm starving.

603
00:35:55,143 --> 00:35:58,020
- Let's go. 
 - Just a second.

604
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,670
I have something to discuss with you.

605
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,330
Teacher's Day is close.

606
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,803
What kind of gift should we prepare for our teachers?

607
00:36:04,803 --> 00:36:07,280
Right, Siyue. Mr. Liu asked you to go and see him.

608
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,230
I think it's about the Academic Olympiad group.

609
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,940
Okay. Wait for me.

610
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,640
Sure.

611
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,660
What is taking Zhou Siyue so long?

612
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,840
There will be nothing left at the cafeteria, if he takes any longer.

613
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,989
Where is he?

614
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:25,789
I don't know.

615
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,700
Ding Xian, let's go for lunch together.

616
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,700
I heard that the cafeteria in this high school is fancy.

617
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,670
Unlike junior high.

618
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,330
Right. Let's not wait for him.

619
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,360
Let's go. Time for lunch.

620
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,610
 Having lunch with my father at school is so embarrassing.

621
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,610
You guys go ahead.

622
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,470
Why is she running now?

623
00:36:50,268 --> 00:36:51,290
It's all your fault.

624
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,270
You kept messing with her. That's why she won't have lunch with us.

625
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,510
How is this my problem?

626
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,660
Ask Master Zhou here about what he did to her.

627
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,800
I have nothing to do with this.

628
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,392
Explain to me, then. Why did she start running once she saw you?

629
00:37:04,392 --> 00:37:08,080
Those are her legs. Ask her that question.

630
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,420
This is not right.

631
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,430
Don't you both have something like a... child betrothal?

632
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,180
What?

633
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,530
Don't you know this?

634
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,430
Let me tell you. It was a dark and windy night. There was no light at all.

635
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,230
- Our Master Zhou... 
 - You just don't know when to stop!

636
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,590
I'll stop! I'll stop! I was just joking. I will stop.

637
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,170
Later.

638
00:37:35,202 --> 00:37:37,420
Xianxian.

639
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,160
Bocong!

640
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,000
Why didn't you come to me since you are here?

641
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,980
I didn't want to disturb you.

642
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,480
High school is scary to even think about.

643
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,306
That's exaggerating. How about you? How do you feel?

644
00:37:55,096 --> 00:37:58,623
I was telling you the truth, right? Shenhai High School is no joke.

645
00:37:58,623 --> 00:38:02,360
Students from Shenhai High School are different from those from other high schools.

646
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,190
I don't think they are so different.

647
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,400
You don't need to think too much.

648
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,600
Make some friends.

649
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,650
That's what makes your life here meaningful.

650
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,320
I'll try.

651
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,190
Here. Try this.

652
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,660
Shenhai High School's famous dish: braised pork.

653
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,760
A benefit for seniors.

654
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,780
Look!

655
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,500
Little Monster knows that guy.

656
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,600
It's delicious.

657
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,900
Who's that?

658
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,280
I've heard of him before.

659
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,750
He's Su Bocong.

660
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,360
He's from a liberal arts class.

661
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,460
He's gentle and nice to people and has insanely good academic performance.

662
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,007
Unlike you guys.

663
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:48,547
Are you saying that because he's nice-looking?

664
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,010
I also heard he came from Keshan.

665
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:54,850
No wonder he knows Little Monster.

666
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,260
Just eat your food, all right?

667
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:00,460
Listen to me. I heard that this guy is amazing.

668
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,650
He has great academic performance, and he tries so hard.

669
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,050
He has always been in the top ten for the last three years.

670
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,950
Hard-core.

671
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:18,593
That's nice.

672
00:39:18,593 --> 00:39:21,600
Siyue, have you figured out the gift?

673
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,796
- What? 
 - The Teacher's Day gift.

674
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:24,946
I said that this morning.

675
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,053
I'm in.

676
00:39:27,053 --> 00:39:29,080
Why are you trying to meddle here?

677
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,480
Is she asking you?

678
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:35,436
I'll think about it.

679
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,126
Ding Xian, your book is so new.

680
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:43,006
Didn't you go to cram school during the holiday?

681
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:43,880
No.

682
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,420
You are really taking it easy.

683
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,260
A lot of our classmates have finished learning the courses of the first year.

684
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,100
So what? I already forgot them all.

685
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,370
And I didn't even have any fun during the holiday.

686
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,460
I thought things would be easier now that I'm in high school.

687
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,500
But we didn't even have any books during the holidays.

688
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,550
You could have borrowed some from the seniors.

689
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:08,060
I almost forgot. You aren't from here, right?

690
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,460
You seem to be the first to come from Keshan.

691
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,600
It's only natural that you couldn't borrow any books.

692
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,870

693
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,370
Stand up!

694
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,733
Hello, Teacher.

695
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:25,333
Sit down.

696
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,500
For this class, we will talk about functions.

697
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,443
Functions are actually easy.

698
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:33,203
They are not as complex as you think.

699
00:40:33,203 --> 00:40:38,380
Let's check this question from the last NCEE.

700
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,900
This exam question like this is basically a question about point distribution.

701
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,020
Get the f(x).

702
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:50,303
How should we solve this equation?

703
00:40:50,303 --> 00:40:53,552
 The method of undetermined coefficients.

704
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:55,810
How? Louder!

705
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:00,120
 The method of undetermined coefficients.

706
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,600
We've already learned this.

707
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,480
How come some of you still don't know the answer?

708
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,700
The girl in the back!

709
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:13,880
Stop looking.

710
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,723
Stop looking, I'm talking to you.

711
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:18,523
Stand up.

712
00:41:19,953 --> 00:41:22,343
How do we solve this question?

713
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,320
I don't know.

714
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,120
What?

715
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,020
I don't know.

716
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,539
Zhou Siyue! Answer the question.

717
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,220
 It's all because you were reading books unrelated to the course.

718
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,940
 This is what you get.

719
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,460
According to the method of undetermined coefficients,

720
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,610
f(x) equals ax squared plus bx plus c.

721
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,260
Use that formula with the one given,

722
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:54,230
and we will know a=1/2 and b=-2.

723
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:59,260
And we already knew that f(0)=2, so c=2.

724
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,700
Very good.

725
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,900
Sit down, Zhou Siyue.

726
00:42:04,266 --> 00:42:06,166
You, too.

727
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,800
Have you all got it?

728
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,457
 Yes.

729
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,420

730
00:42:41,873 --> 00:42:43,973
Are you interested?

731
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,920
Not at all. Don't flatter yourself.

732
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:58,400
I'm talking about the book, not about me.

733
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,739
I'm not trying to hit on you this time, right? Temporary deskmate.

734
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,870
You are so boring.

735
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,260
You've taken so many notes, can you review them all?

736
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,160
None of your business.

737
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,260
Out of this paragraph, the only thing that matters is this formula.

738
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,033
You just need to remember that.

739
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:31,740
If you keep noting down everything, you will soon be out of this honors class.

740
00:43:34,832 --> 00:43:37,220
 You just merely passed the line.

741
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,950
You ranked 45 while I ranked 38. What gives you the right to judge me?

742
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:56,020

743
00:43:59,026 --> 00:44:04,216
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

744
00:44:04,216 --> 00:44:08,076
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

745
00:44:09,373 --> 00:44:13,759
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

746
00:44:13,759 --> 00:44:18,916
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

747
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:24,766
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

748
00:44:24,766 --> 00:44:29,404
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

749
00:44:29,404 --> 00:44:35,139
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

750
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:39,516
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

751
00:44:39,516 --> 00:44:42,386
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

752
00:44:42,386 --> 00:44:45,079
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

753
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:49,976
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

754
00:44:49,976 --> 00:44:52,949
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

755
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:55,426
♫  After a long journey  ♫

756
00:44:55,426 --> 00:45:00,316
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

757
00:45:21,142 --> 00:45:24,182
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

758
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:26,856
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

759
00:45:26,856 --> 00:45:31,899
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

760
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:34,676
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

761
00:45:34,676 --> 00:45:37,129
♫  After a long journey  ♫

762
00:45:37,129 --> 00:45:42,232
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
