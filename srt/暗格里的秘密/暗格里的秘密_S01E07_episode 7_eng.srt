1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:09,940

2
00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:18,690
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,514 --> 00:00:22,976
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:26,856
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:32,428
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:36,734
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:40,383
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:47,442
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:55,838
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,838 --> 00:01:01,568
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:04,302
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,302 --> 00:01:06,315
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:09,668
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,668 --> 00:01:16,094
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:17,882
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,882 --> 00:01:20,434
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,434 --> 00:01:28,088
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,958

19
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,134

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,101
Siyue, care to join me in a game of pool this Sunday?

21
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:50,211
Are you hanging out? I want to go, too.

22
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,710
I'll think about it.

23
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,008
The competition is happening soon.

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,001
Xianxian, why don't you come with us?

25
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:58,300
You guys have fun. I don't know how to play.

26
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,122
Me neither.

27
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:03,821
Anyway, when the time comes, when you see the ball, you poke it.

28
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:05,761
You... I'm not going with you.

29
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:06,791
Oh, my god!

30
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,921
Like I would want to go with you!

31
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:18,384
Join us. I'll show you how.

32
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:21,931
Yes!

33
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:25,531
Should we ask Jiang Chen to come as well?

34
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:29,471
Don't. None of us is going to have fun if he's there.

35
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:33,021
Just tell me if you can't see clearly.

36
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:49,327
I'll copy the notes for you.

37
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:52,171
What about your competition paper?

38
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,311
I can work on it later.

39
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:06,200
- Come and have dinner. 
 - Coming.

40
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,431
Come on, time for dinner.

41
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,060
Here you are.

42
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:23,349
Mom, can I discuss something with you?

43
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,381
I want a pair of glasses with a higher prescription.

44
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:29,653
Is your myopia getting worse?

45
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:30,670
A little.

46
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,561
Xianxian, you were pseudo-myopic before.

47
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:38,561
The glasses are to correct that. Why is your myopia getting worse?

48
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:41,876
I don't know. Sometimes things can get blurred.

49
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:44,457
Which row are you sitting in right now?

50
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:50,571
The fifth. Talk to your teacher and move to the row in front.

51
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:54,615
Try not to wear your glasses.

52
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:59,511
If the prescription keeps increasing, you may have to wear them forever.

53
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:03,707
If you feel awkward talking to your teacher, I can do it.

54
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:07,597
Never mind. I can hold on for longer.

55
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:15,081
Your dad said that you were about to choose between liberal arts and science.

56
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:18,171
You could take the chance to switch seats

57
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:20,901
after you are transferred to a liberal arts class.

58
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:24,571
But I might choose science.

59
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:32,831
Why would a girl choose science?

60
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:35,831
Why can't a girl choose science?

61
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:38,041
That's not what I mean.

62
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,241
I'm saying that girls will have a hard time with science subjects.

63
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,041
You may feel you are doing well in both now.

64
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,351
Things will get harder in your second and third year of high school.

65
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:50,738
- But... 
 - Stop fighting this.

66
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:53,791
I'll make that decision for you. Liberal arts it is.

67
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:58,591
Why? This is my business.

68
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,348
Don't I get to choose by myself?

69
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:04,468
You are too young to make that choice.

70
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:07,761
Liberal arts is the safe choice for you.

71
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:12,291
Your dad can tutor you so that you will get into a good university.

72
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,500
We are doing this for your sake.

73
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,427
Would we hurt you or what?

74
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:18,191
And you are fighting with me.

75
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:21,347
Enough. Let's all calm down.

76
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:23,201
This is a really important choice.

77
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:26,321
Let's sit down and talk about it.

78
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:28,221
Xianxian,

79
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:31,191
be patient when talking to your mother.

80
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:38,551
I'm done.

81
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:47,941
That's not the way to bring up a child.

82
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:49,390
And you are good at this?

83
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,441
And you are?

84
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,990
 You are so good at this that she's refusing to have dinner now.

85
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,704
 Xianxian, go online.

86
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:10,904
 I've applied to be your contact. Accept my request.

87
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:19,918

88
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,153
 Wow. Welcome, Little Monster.

89
00:06:29,804 --> 00:06:31,404

90
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:40,921
 Put down the cell phone and focus on your homework.

91
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:46,961
Xianxian,

92
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:54,041
didn't you tell your mom the other day that you want a cell phone?

93
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:58,090
Your mom and I talked about it and bought you one.

94
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,387
What?

95
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:07,527
Sorry, Dad.

96
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,610
I kept you in the dark.

97
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,761
About what?

98
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,566
Zhou Siyue lent me this.

99
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,521
I saw it this morning.

100
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:32,522
How about this?

101
00:07:32,522 --> 00:07:36,461
Return that one to Zhou Siyue when you have the chance.

102
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:44,311
Xianxian, we bought you this cell phone,

103
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:47,101
but there are some conditions.

104
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,771
First, you mustn't bring it to school.

105
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,891
It will affect your studies.

106
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:55,880
Second,

107
00:07:56,511 --> 00:08:01,827
I hope you can consider what your mom just said.

108
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:05,087
She's not wrong.

109
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:10,848
Dad, do you also think

110
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:13,775
that I should choose liberal arts?

111
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:18,533
Your mom and I are on the same page.

112
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:20,921
We think that you are a girl.

113
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:22,731
Choosing science will make your life harder.

114
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:25,087
We don't want to see you having a hard time.

115
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,981
What about you, Dad?

116
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:29,301
Why did you choose politics?

117
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,901
I...

118
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:35,361
I wasn't doing well in science back then.

119
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:38,821
Doesn't that mean it is wrong to assume

120
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:43,142
that girls should choose liberal arts and boys should choose science?

121
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:51,667
Besides, I'm not mad at you for not letting me choose science.

122
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,991
I'm mad because you won't let me make my own choices.

123
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:05,374
Xianxian, grown-ups might be unreasonable,

124
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:07,764
but that's because we are worried that you might make mistakes

125
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:10,764
that have consequences that you can't bear.

126
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:16,741
And if you thought it through,

127
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:20,671
I will respect your choice.

128
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:30,641
Thanks, Dad.

129
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:35,251
Oh, another thing. Stop being so stubborn with your mom.

130
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:38,101
Don't be fooled by her words. You know how she is.

131
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:43,741
Besides, I think she might be going through menopause recently.

132
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,547
I understand. I will stop being mad at her.

133
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,310
Good girl. Get back to learning.

134
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,021
Hello, Senior Brother.

135
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:18,301
I'd like to ask if you can find me some exercises and materials

136
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,891
of second-year science class.

137
00:10:23,261 --> 00:10:25,991
This is the topic of the essay in the NCEE this year.

138
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:27,601
I'll give you two periods to finish it.

139
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:29,401
No break until you do.

140
00:10:57,351 --> 00:10:59,950
Are those second-year science exercises?

141
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,590
Yes.

142
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,567
They're not that hard.

143
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,451
I agree.

144
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:09,850
I can do a lot of them right now.

145
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,120
If I choose science,

146
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,054
I might do better than you

147
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:17,011
if I put in some effort.

148
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,921
- Teacher. 
 - Where is your essay book?

149
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,181
I've finished it.

150
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:38,871
Come to my office before study hall at noon.

151
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:51,891
You did well on the essay.

152
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:54,923
The style is good.

153
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:59,500
You are choosing science?

154
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:04,660
Mr. Liu, what's up with the girls in your class?

155
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,808
Kong Shadi was talking about choosing science yesterday.

156
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:10,302
And now, here's another one.

157
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:13,869
Have you turned in your form of intent?

158
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:15,041
Not yet.

159
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,941
Think about it.

160
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:19,285
- Excuse me. 
 - Come in.

161
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:23,161
Mr. Liu, I want to participate in the math competition, too.

162
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:24,821
The placement test is close.

163
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:27,281
- Do you have enough energy for that? 
 - Literature is important.

164
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:31,301
Actually, He Xingwen, competitions are not the only way.

165
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:34,691
You are quite balanced in all the subjects.

166
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:37,130
You could get into a good university by participating in NCEE.

167
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:42,851
If Zhou Siyue can do it, why can't I since I have better performance?

168
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:44,807
How about this?

169
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,111
I have a set of exercise papers here.

170
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:49,261
Go back, finish them, and turn them in tomorrow.

171
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:52,621
Ding Xian, are you listening to me?

172
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:55,511
I am, Teacher. I will think about it.

173
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:57,154
All right.

174
00:12:57,154 --> 00:13:02,064
Don't do other things in literature classes.

175
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,967
Did the literature teacher give you a hard time?

176
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,361
Not really.

177
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:28,623
Zhou Siyue,

178
00:13:29,331 --> 00:13:34,127
do you think it's better for girls to choose liberal arts?

179
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:38,471
What does gender have to do with this?

180
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:40,570
I don't know.

181
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,701
But my parents and the literature teacher all said

182
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:45,960
that girls should choose liberal arts.

183
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,518
They won't let me choose science.

184
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:56,459
So, do you think you are better at liberal arts or science?

185
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:01,227
Actually, it doesn't matter which one it is

186
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:03,329
and don't mind what others say,

187
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:07,771
just choose what you are good at or like.

188
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:14,640
I got your back either way.

189
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:16,898
Really?

190
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:22,921
Would you still support me if I choose liberal arts?

191
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:24,945
Sure.

192
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:32,521
Never mind. I'll take a nap first.

193
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:48,961
Deng Wanwan, what was that about?

194
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:51,811
He Xingwen, are you the only one who needs to study? Don't I need to do that?

195
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:55,600
Aren't you ashamed that as a guy, you left all the cleaning duties outside to me.

196
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,239
You can do the cleaning if you want. And I can make my own choices.

197
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:01,261
I'm participating in the math competition.

198
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,787
I'm busy.

199
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:04,950
- Don't be mad. 
 - He Xingwen, you are a guy.

200
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,077
Can't you take care of Wanwan a little?

201
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:09,521
Zhou Siyue is also participating in the competition.

202
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:11,151
Why isn't he having so many problems?

203
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:13,917
No wonder Mr. Liu likes him but not you.

204
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:18,237
Everyone knows you like Zhou Siyue.

205
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:19,651
What are you talking about?

206
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:20,921
I'm not.

207
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:22,651
Mr. Liu thinks of him as his own son.

208
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:24,651
He's prepared to give him the recommendation quota.

209
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,961
I don't have the nerve to mess with a Huaqing candidate.

210
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:40,697
He Xingwen, I used to think you could get into Huaqing.

211
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:45,891
Now I think you are lucky to get into a basic public university.

212
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:50,331
Just focus on your own things. Why cynically talk about others?

213
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:56,112
If one of my friends can be recommended, I would be happy for him.

214
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:59,921
You are saying the grapes are sour because you can't have any.

215
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:02,961
You shouldn't be so narrow-minded.

216
00:17:13,651 --> 00:17:18,276
Not bad. The little rabbit is biting now.

217
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:23,439
Aren't you a good teacher?

218
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:26,322
Are you stupid or not?

219
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,580
Zhou Siyue.

220
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:40,375
I'm not stupid.

221
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:59,081
I know.

222
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:14,651
12 to 12.

223
00:18:17,141 --> 00:18:19,891
You really terrified me when you were firing at He Xingwen.

224
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,611
How did you become so brave?

225
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:23,851
I didn't think too much.

226
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:26,681
I just think that He Xingwen is outrageous.

227
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:30,181
Now you are standing up for Zhou Siyue?

228
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:32,667
13 to 12.

229
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:38,878
Do you remember when I was called up by Mr. Liu?

230
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:42,551
He was the first one who defended me when I arrived in the city.

231
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:46,427
That's why I'm defending him now.

232
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:54,587
Oh, Shadi. Go to a hair salon with me after the exam.

233
00:18:54,587 --> 00:18:56,421
What?

234
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:59,543
I want to get bangs.

235
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:07,811
 I want to look pretty.

236
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:15,281
You had a sudden realization!

237
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:18,521
Listen! I know a really good hairdresser.

238
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:20,191
Not everyone can get an appointment.

239
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,161
I will take you there after the exam.

240
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:26,654
Ding Xian.

241
00:19:26,654 --> 00:19:28,664
Xian, are you all right?

242
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:30,731
Ding Xian, I didn't mean to do it.

243
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:32,331
Are you all right?

244
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:33,591
Is she okay?

245
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:35,591
What happened?

246
00:19:36,371 --> 00:19:37,621
Let me see.

247
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:39,521
It hurts. Don't touch it.

248
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:41,001
Sorry.

249
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:43,651
Why don't I take you to the infirmary?

250
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:47,351
You guys go back to class. I'll bring her there.

251
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,141
Okay. Go back!

252
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:53,041
Time for class.

253
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,531
I've checked for you.

254
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:57,471
But I would suggest getting it checked up at a hospital.

255
00:19:57,471 --> 00:20:00,331
It would be really bad if your retina is injured.

256
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:05,094
Let's go. I'm taking you to a hospital.

257
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:10,901
I think it's fine. We have a class later.

258
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:15,391
Okay. You can stay blind here.

259
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,100
I'm going. Should we ask for leave first?

260
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,901
Is it done?

261
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:46,011
Go back to your nap.

262
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:49,550
The test result won't be out for another half hour.

263
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:54,621
You only injured your eye.

264
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:57,181
Why are you talking so gently?

265
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:07,591
Zhou Siyue, you don't have to copy the notes for me anymore.

266
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:13,241
I'm worried that this will slow down your preparation for the competition.

267
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:18,781
After the exam, I'll ask my mom to get a pair of glasses with a higher presecription for me.

268
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:22,881
Don't get distracted because of me.

269
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:29,521
Okay.

270
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:38,911
Zhou Siyue.

271
00:21:41,353 --> 00:21:43,463
Thank you.

272
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:47,081
What are you thanking me for?

273
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:50,331
That's not what I'm talking about.

274
00:21:50,331 --> 00:21:52,922
I'm talking about...

275
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:58,771
when everyone is against my choice,

276
00:21:58,771 --> 00:22:04,034
you are the only one who told me to choose what I like.

277
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:08,010
So, thank you.

278
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,293
Just think it through yourself.

279
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,887
Ding Xian, come on!

280
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:51,811
I'm late.

281
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:52,851
I'm going to leave now.

282
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:53,971
Just a second.

283
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:56,661
When are you turning in the form of intent?

284
00:22:58,281 --> 00:23:00,060
In a few days.

285
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,540
Finish filling it out soon and deliver it.

286
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,385
Okay. Got it, Mom.

287
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:07,645
- I'm leaving now. 
 - All right, be careful.

288
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:19,384
Zhou Siyue, do you have brain damage?

289
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:22,951
Excuse me.

290
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,161
Ding Xian, what is it?

291
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,781
Mr. Liu, should I come back later?

292
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:31,801
It's okay. Come in.

293
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:39,811
Mr. Liu, this is my form of intent.

294
00:23:40,624 --> 00:23:42,400
Just leave it there.

295
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:49,731
Do you have anything else to do?

296
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:51,216
No.

297
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:52,791
Go back to the classroom, then.

298
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:53,691
Okay.

299
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:20,301
You chose science?

300
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,267
Are you sure you have thought it through?

301
00:24:26,921 --> 00:24:28,421
I have.

302
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:32,691
I'm going to prove to everyone that even if I chose science,

303
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:34,941
I would still do a good job.

304
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:45,401
Why was Mr. Liu so mean to you?

305
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,951
What's wrong?

306
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,211
It's just that I've been making mistakes when doing exercises.

307
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:54,520
That's why he's annoyed.

308
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,161
But he shouldn't have been so mean.

309
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:58,921
You are tired enough already.

310
00:24:58,921 --> 00:25:02,801
How should you deal with the stress if he keeps pressuring you?

311
00:25:03,821 --> 00:25:05,401
Don't worry.

312
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:06,801
I've got it.

313
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:11,171
Zhou Siyue.

314
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:16,638
Whatever you do, I got your back, too.

315
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:21,031
I know.

316
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,951
Oh, right!

317
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:26,791
My dad bought me a new cell phone.

318
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,196
So, you should take this back.

319
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:29,696
Thanks.

320
00:25:33,436 --> 00:25:36,256

321
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:46,231
More reading and less cell phone playing.

322
00:25:49,451 --> 00:25:51,121
You too.

323
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,400

324
00:26:04,451 --> 00:26:07,611
Two girls were peeking at you in the examination room.

325
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:09,101
Did you notice that?

326
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,901
Really?

327
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:13,761
It seems that you've done well.

328
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:15,241
You even have the time to look at someone else.

329
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,371
It's not bad.

330
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:19,371
I'm pretty sure about Chinese, English, and comprehensive literature.

331
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,691
And I think I've done well in math.

332
00:26:21,691 --> 00:26:24,281
As for science, I did finish writing it.

333
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:25,721
You are still talking about the exam.

334
00:26:25,721 --> 00:26:28,061
Did you forget what we weresupposed to do after the exam?

335
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:29,521
I didn't.

336
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,011
Let's meet up at the pool club after dinner.

337
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:34,161
Come on.

338
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:35,861
Did you forget what you promised me?

339
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:36,811
Of course not.

340
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:39,301
- Let's meet up at your place after dinner. 
 - Okay.

341
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:45,440
Shadi.

342
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,230
How do I look?

343
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,401
It's a nice outfit. This one is it.

344
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,211
 Ding Xian!

345
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:55,911
- I prepared some fruit for you. 
 - Mom.

346
00:26:55,911 --> 00:26:58,371
I'm changing clothes. Just a second.

347
00:26:58,371 --> 00:27:00,771
What are you doing? You won't even let me in.

348
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:02,836
Here.

349
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:04,413
All right.

350
00:27:04,413 --> 00:27:05,983
I'm going to pick up your brother.

351
00:27:05,983 --> 00:27:07,313
You two stay at home and keep an eye on things.

352
00:27:07,313 --> 00:27:08,983
All right. Don't worry.

353
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:16,283
Take me to the hairdresser when my mom is out.

354
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:17,433
Or we won't get back in time.

355
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:21,063
Don't worry. We have sufficient time.

356
00:27:30,403 --> 00:27:34,963
Don't tell me the hairdresser you mentioned is actually yourself.

357
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:37,519
You...

358
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:38,613
Are you sure?

359
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:39,663
Please.

360
00:27:39,663 --> 00:27:42,763
I've been cutting bangs for 15 years now.

361
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:45,293
No hairdresser is more reliable than I am, all right?

362
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:46,943
Oblique bangs, neat bangs,

363
00:27:46,943 --> 00:27:48,573
European style, Korean style, and Japanese style.

364
00:27:48,573 --> 00:27:51,803
I can cut all the bangs that you can think of.

365
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,403
Pick one.

366
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:57,593
Maybe not this time.

367
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,263
No.

368
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:00,913
Pick one.

369
00:28:09,483 --> 00:28:11,813
- This one. 
 - That one doesn't look good.

370
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:13,263
It's not fashionable at all.

371
00:28:13,263 --> 00:28:14,763
How about this one? That's a nice one.

372
00:28:14,763 --> 00:28:17,523
Look how fashionable it is. We are going with this one.

373
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:24,949
Don't move.

374
00:28:25,808 --> 00:28:27,418
Should we use it like that?

375
00:28:27,418 --> 00:28:29,928
Trust me.

376
00:28:29,928 --> 00:28:33,548
You will be the focus of the crowd tonight.

377
00:28:34,158 --> 00:28:35,688
Shadi.

378
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:37,018
I'm a little afraid.

379
00:28:37,018 --> 00:28:38,978
Don't be.

380
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:41,948
You have a small face structure. I'll just cover your face a little.

381
00:28:41,948 --> 00:28:44,360
And according to my experience,

382
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,058
this length of the bangs is of perfect ratio. Okay?

383
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:49,920
- Just a second. 
 - I'm cutting now.

384
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,620
Take it slow.

385
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:09,498
All right, it's done.

386
00:29:10,288 --> 00:29:11,988
How do I look?

387
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:14,961
I think

388
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:18,677
I forgot to count the radian of your forehead in.

389
00:29:18,677 --> 00:29:20,871
What do you mean?

390
00:29:28,888 --> 00:29:30,908
Shadi!

391
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:35,967
I think I can find a hoe and go work in the fields.

392
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,238
You are exaggerating.

393
00:29:38,238 --> 00:29:40,888
It's not bad once you get used to it.

394
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:47,278
It's just that I'm not quite used to it at first sight.

395
00:29:48,568 --> 00:29:54,238
So, do you have any solutions to make it look good at first sight?

396
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:01,498
Let's break up.

397
00:30:04,728 --> 00:30:07,658
Slow down. I can't see the road.

398
00:30:07,658 --> 00:30:09,618
Your hat completely blocked your eyesight.

399
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:11,138
Naturally, you would slow down when you can't see the road.

400
00:30:11,138 --> 00:30:13,088
You did this to me.

401
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:20,180
Take care.

402
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,703
I'm so thirsty. I'll go get a drink.

403
00:30:22,703 --> 00:30:24,810
- Hurry up. 
 - All right.

404
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:27,968
 Excuse me, a bottle of water.

405
00:30:27,968 --> 00:30:29,314
Is there no one there?

406
00:30:29,314 --> 00:30:30,568
 No.

407
00:30:30,568 --> 00:30:31,868
Coming!

408
00:30:42,568 --> 00:30:44,368
Sir!

409
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:49,358
Young lady, you are quite bold.

410
00:30:50,498 --> 00:30:51,718
What are you trying to do?

411
00:30:51,718 --> 00:30:52,788
Come here. Come.

412
00:30:52,788 --> 00:30:54,148
What is it?

413
00:30:54,148 --> 00:30:55,908
Is there a problem?

414
00:30:58,928 --> 00:31:01,408
No. It's a misunderstanding.

415
00:31:04,658 --> 00:31:06,531
I'm here. Let's go.

416
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:09,980
- Are you all right? 
 - Yeah.

417
00:31:12,168 --> 00:31:13,618
Let's go.

418
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:14,738
Sir, give us a table.

419
00:31:14,738 --> 00:31:15,928
Okay. Just a second.

420
00:31:17,257 --> 00:31:18,878
Did you smell anything?

421
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:21,378
Like what?

422
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:23,438
The smell of hair gel from Zhou Siyue.

423
00:31:24,118 --> 00:31:25,114
Just a second.

424
00:31:25,114 --> 00:31:27,538
This guy is using hair gel now.

425
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:29,438
What does that mean?

426
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,618
Come on. Let's begin now.

427
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:38,825
 I'll go put the drinks down.

428
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:42,288
What are you smirking about?

429
00:31:42,288 --> 00:31:44,338
Nothing. It's nothing.

430
00:31:45,258 --> 00:31:47,668
Why are you wearing a hat in the room?

431
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,488
Stop looking.

432
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:56,478
What is it?

433
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,158
It's quite cute.

434
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:02,845
Really?

435
00:32:04,328 --> 00:32:05,778
Stop wearing a hat.

436
00:32:05,778 --> 00:32:08,218
You will lose more hair if your scalp can't breathe.

437
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:11,788
Here. There is no room for two kings in one Shenhai High School.

438
00:32:11,788 --> 00:32:13,768
Why do we need so many famous people?

439
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:15,244
Watch me.

440
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:17,778
What kind of famous person are you?

441
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:20,418
Zhou Siyue might be pretty good, but you can stop bragging.

442
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:22,118
Let me try that.

443
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:27,151
Let me.

444
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:32,413
It doesn't look so hard.

445
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,157
Have a try. Here.

446
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:38,777
I don't know how to do that.

447
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:41,708
Let me show you.

448
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:43,368
I would suggest that you give up right away.

449
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,115
Have you heard of a mathematical method called "half-ball hit"?

450
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:49,068
It would take me forever to teach you. Let go.

451
00:32:52,568 --> 00:32:57,638
The right hitting point should be aligned with the center of a hole

452
00:32:57,638 --> 00:32:59,618
and the ball you are targeting.

453
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:02,308
Point to that spot

454
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:04,808
and you will most likely get the ball in the hole.

455
00:33:09,268 --> 00:33:10,668
Have a try.

456
00:33:18,688 --> 00:33:20,568
You are not putting your hands right.

457
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:23,858
Do it like I'm doing.

458
00:33:52,858 --> 00:33:54,598
What's with the smile?

459
00:33:57,738 --> 00:33:59,318
Your bowl cut.

460
00:34:00,388 --> 00:34:01,888
It cracked open.

461
00:34:04,028 --> 00:34:05,628
Zhou Siyue!

462
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:07,738
I've learned how to do it.

463
00:34:07,738 --> 00:34:09,038
Let me.

464
00:34:21,138 --> 00:34:23,828
That's just luck. Newbies' luck.

465
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:31,758
Impressive.

466
00:34:32,378 --> 00:34:33,598
Ding Xian,

467
00:34:33,598 --> 00:34:37,218
have you been practicing in secret?

468
00:34:37,218 --> 00:34:39,928
No. I just learned it.

469
00:34:39,928 --> 00:34:43,008
Siyue, did you notice that this girl is not good at studying,

470
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:44,618
but she's good at all the things like this?

471
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:46,188
It's just like when we were in the game room.

472
00:34:46,188 --> 00:34:47,378
It's so strange.

473
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:48,768
She's talented.

474
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:50,858
And she has a good teacher.

475
00:34:51,938 --> 00:34:52,978
Let me try.

476
00:34:52,978 --> 00:34:55,018
You are always protecting her. I can't say anything.

477
00:35:18,078 --> 00:35:21,328
- Hello. Are you Ding Xian's mom? 
 - Yes. That's right.

478
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,858
Hi. I'm Liu Jiang, Ding Xian's class adviser.

479
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:25,898
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Nice to meet you, Mr. Liu.

480
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:28,058
- Come in, please. 
 - Okay.

481
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:30,458
- Sorry for intruding. Shoe changing? 
 - No, it's okay.

482
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:31,938
Please. Come in and have a seat.

483
00:35:31,938 --> 00:35:33,328
- All right. 
 - I'm going to get some water for you.

484
00:35:33,328 --> 00:35:34,658
It's okay. I won't stay long.

485
00:35:34,658 --> 00:35:36,418
It's okay. Sit.

486
00:35:42,328 --> 00:35:45,808
Now I know that you two are cooperating to bully me today.

487
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:49,468
Blame it on your lack of skills.

488
00:35:49,488 --> 00:35:52,288
You are good. Your cue never touched the balls.

489
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:54,848
That's because I had a bad teacher.

490
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:56,808
Give me my wallet.

491
00:35:56,808 --> 00:35:59,248
I'm going to pay the bill.

492
00:36:00,048 --> 00:36:02,648
It's in my overcoat.

493
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:17,898
Did Ding Xian do something at school?

494
00:36:17,898 --> 00:36:19,858
Or did she not do well in the exam?

495
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:22,518
That's not it. Ding Xian's mom, calm down.

496
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:26,008
I'm here today for a school task.

497
00:36:26,008 --> 00:36:28,528
I'm just here for a short home visit.

498
00:36:29,618 --> 00:36:32,218
The vacation sessions are just over.

499
00:36:32,218 --> 00:36:34,418
The kids are about to start their second year.

500
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:36,388
You know about liberal arts and science, right?

501
00:36:36,388 --> 00:36:39,088
I know. I told her to choose liberal arts.

502
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:40,378
- Liberal arts? 
 - Yes.

503
00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:43,698
But Ding Xian chose science.

504
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:46,728
That's not right.

505
00:36:46,728 --> 00:36:48,768
I told her to choose liberal arts.

506
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,938
Well...

507
00:36:49,938 --> 00:36:51,338
Look.

508
00:36:52,394 --> 00:36:55,224
Ding Xian wrote it in the form of intent.

509
00:36:55,224 --> 00:36:56,638
She chose science.

510
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,618
That girl. She didn't tell me.

511
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,578
I'll change it for her. Please let me use the pen.

512
00:37:04,148 --> 00:37:05,808
Ding Xian's mom. Just a second.

513
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:10,438
I think we should ask Ding Xian's idea about this.

514
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:14,698
What if we make this decision for her and she detests it?

515
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:16,184
Am I right?

516
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:17,328
Well.

517
00:37:17,328 --> 00:37:22,458
I have some thoughts about her choosing science.

518
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,948
- Let me explain, and you can see if I'm right. 
 - Okay.

519
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:29,498
I think that the science classes all have better performance.

520
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:32,568
All the students in science classes are the best ones among the elites.

521
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:34,908
When those students get together,

522
00:37:34,908 --> 00:37:37,358
Ding Xian's advantage would be less outstanding.

523
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:38,858
No. Mr. Liu, look.

524
00:37:38,858 --> 00:37:44,038
You see, Ding Xian has always been one of the best in junior high.

525
00:37:44,038 --> 00:37:47,728
I've never had any worries about her academic performance.

526
00:37:47,728 --> 00:37:49,898
She's not getting worse, right?

527
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:53,758
And my kid is quite resilient.

528
00:37:53,758 --> 00:37:57,048
She never complained that she can't keep up.

529
00:37:57,048 --> 00:38:00,418
As her teacher, you should encourage her.

530
00:38:00,418 --> 00:38:02,538
How could you say that?

531
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:05,118
No. Ding Xian's mom, don't get agitated just yet.

532
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:06,838
That's not what I meant.

533
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:08,248
Mr. Liu, I'm really sorry.

534
00:38:08,248 --> 00:38:09,378
I have other plans today.

535
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:12,868
How about we call it a day?

536
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:15,698
Okay. Don't let me keep you for longer.

537
00:38:15,698 --> 00:38:18,118
All right. Thank you for making the trip.

538
00:38:19,248 --> 00:38:21,968
Ding Xian's mom, I think you misunderstood me.

539
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:23,078
Here. Take care, Mr. Liu.

540
00:38:23,078 --> 00:38:25,388
- I just... 
 - Thanks a lot. Thank you.

541
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:27,238
I just want to say that...

542
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,728
See you, Mr. Liu.

543
00:38:28,728 --> 00:38:30,328
Take care.

544
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:35,288
Here's your change.

545
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:36,838
- All right. Thank you. 
 - You are welcome.

546
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:37,978
Let's go sing karaoke.

547
00:38:37,978 --> 00:38:39,618
I'll do whatever you want.

548
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:42,658
Maybe another day. My parents are coming back.

549
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:44,728
How boring would it be if you are not there?

550
00:38:44,728 --> 00:38:45,808
Come with us.

551
00:38:45,808 --> 00:38:47,768
Shadi, I'll come with you next time.

552
00:38:47,768 --> 00:38:49,138
You guys should go.

553
00:38:49,138 --> 00:38:50,258
I'll walk her home.

554
00:38:50,258 --> 00:38:52,348
- All right. Let's go. 
 - See you.

555
00:38:52,348 --> 00:38:54,148
Let's go.

556
00:38:54,938 --> 00:38:57,728
It's cold outside. Put on your clothes.

557
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,788
The bangs you got look good.

558
00:39:09,628 --> 00:39:11,108
Don't try to fool me.

559
00:39:11,108 --> 00:39:12,778
I know how I look.

560
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:17,938
Oh, right!

561
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,728
When is your competition?

562
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:22,158
In October.

563
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:27,148
So, I will be joining a closed training after school starts.

564
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:33,488
You will be on your own for a while.

565
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:35,988
Be careful.

566
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,290
Okay.

567
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,991
Don't worry about me. I can do it.

568
00:39:41,628 --> 00:39:43,078
That's some big words.

569
00:39:44,388 --> 00:39:47,628
Since I chose science, I will work twice as hard.

570
00:39:47,628 --> 00:39:50,504
Even if you are not here, I will still do well in exams.

571
00:39:52,588 --> 00:39:54,608
I will prove it to you.

572
00:39:55,528 --> 00:39:56,658
All right!

573
00:39:56,658 --> 00:39:59,378
I'm looking forward to your monthly exam results.

574
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,088
What are you looking at?

575
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,088
I'm back.

576
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:32,988
Xianxian, you are back.

577
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,878
Mom.

578
00:40:53,488 --> 00:40:54,988
You cut your hair!

579
00:40:57,138 --> 00:40:58,528
It's ugly.

580
00:40:58,528 --> 00:40:59,808
Stop the nonsense.

581
00:40:59,808 --> 00:41:01,758
It's late. Go to bed.

582
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:03,658
I'm not sleeping.

583
00:41:14,528 --> 00:41:16,488
Who said that you can cut your hair?

584
00:41:17,528 --> 00:41:18,928
Mom,

585
00:41:19,528 --> 00:41:23,541
don't I even get to cut my own hair?

586
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:24,768
She's right.

587
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:26,768
She's not little anymore.

588
00:41:26,768 --> 00:41:28,378
She has her own ideas.

589
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:30,988
We should respect her choice.

590
00:41:38,658 --> 00:41:41,618
I've been working so hard to take care of everything for you.

591
00:41:41,618 --> 00:41:43,218
And look what I got.

592
00:41:44,978 --> 00:41:47,908
One of you ignored my decision and chose science,

593
00:41:47,908 --> 00:41:50,645
and the other one knew about it and didn't tell me.

594
00:41:50,645 --> 00:41:53,271
My words are nothing in this family, right?

595
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:55,588
I should have been doing all those things

596
00:41:55,588 --> 00:41:57,748
without saying anything. Right?

597
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,680
Things are clear to me now.

598
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,366
Our daughter is not little anymore. She gets to make her own choices.

599
00:42:08,366 --> 00:42:10,306
There's nothing I can do about that.

600
00:42:11,305 --> 00:42:14,055
But there's still something I can do about you.

601
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,908
I don't care.

602
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:21,658
I don't care what you have to do, transfer her to a liberal arts class!

603
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:37,710

604
00:42:40,051 --> 00:42:44,241
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

605
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:48,901
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

606
00:42:50,598 --> 00:42:54,784
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

607
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:59,041
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

608
00:43:00,029 --> 00:43:05,891
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

609
00:43:05,891 --> 00:43:09,629
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

610
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:16,264
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

611
00:43:16,264 --> 00:43:20,238
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

612
00:43:20,238 --> 00:43:23,411
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

613
00:43:23,411 --> 00:43:26,104
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

614
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:30,401
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

615
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:33,974
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

616
00:43:33,974 --> 00:43:36,451
♫  After a long journey  ♫

617
00:43:36,451 --> 00:43:41,041
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

618
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:05,207
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

619
00:44:05,207 --> 00:44:07,881
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

620
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:11,924
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

621
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:15,701
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

622
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:18,241
♫  After a long journey  ♫

623
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:22,644
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
