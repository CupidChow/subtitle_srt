â™«  For whom will the summer slow down  â™«

â™«  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  â™«

4
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:26,959
â™«  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  â™«

â™«  For whom will the movie change its story  â™«

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,853
â™«  A sudden storm, blurred vision  â™«

7

â™«  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  â™«

â™«  All comes down to a simple thank you  â™«

18
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:31,443
   

19
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:34,216
   

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,206
President, is Xing Lufei here yet? They are asking for costumes again.

21
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:40,006
Hold on.

22
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:41,420
I'll call her.

23
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,890
Okay.

24
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,201
What's the hurry? Here I am.

25
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:46,901
Great.

26
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,640
Are the costumes ready?

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,940
Almost ready. We only need two more.

28
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,400
Take a look at the chart.

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,600
See how far you are behind the schedule.

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,481
Lufei, where did you get the chocolate?

31
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:08,700
Zhou Siyue gave it to me.

32
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,160
Song Ziqi,

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,641
didn't you say you'd rather die than eat the food I bring?

34
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,700
Zhou Siyue.

35
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,681
Why did you give the chocolate to her?

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,321
Xing Lufei took it herself.

37
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,221
No more excuses.

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,460
Just tell me if you don't like me.

39
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,561
Why did you do this to me?

40
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,640
Let me ask you.

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,920
You don't think I should join the scientific research group, do you?

42
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,821
I don't.

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,052
You don't care at all.

44
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:04,053
You know that I chose the Computer Science Department.

45
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:07,421
and joined the scientific research group for you,

46
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,881
so we can be together all the time.

47
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:15,521
I tried so hard to get close to you, and I don't care at all if this field fits me or if I'm good at it.

48
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,760
But as it turns out,

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,861
you don't even care to do anything to respond to my confession.

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,320
Because all I care about is if it's the right choice for you.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,980
Ding Xian,

52
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,781
I told you the day when you came to the group for an interview

53
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:39,700
that I hoped you could think about yourself before making a choice,

54
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,406
instead of thinking about me first.

55
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:43,566
Think about what?

56
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,940
I don't understand. I really don't.

57
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,901
You keep saying this is about my choice. Then what's yours?

58
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,661
Do you not have any feelings for me?

59
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,147
Do the three years mean nothing to you?

60
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,200
I get it.

61
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,760
I won't bother you anymore.

62
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,260
Ding Xian!

63
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,280
Hey.

64
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:38,740
Aren't you going to explain?

65
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,141
Maybe she'll finally start...

66
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,940
to think about herself more after leaving me.

67
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,621
You are only hurting yourself.

68
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:03,560
   

69
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,641
Please cancel my meeting with the client at 8:00 p.m.

70
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:13,950
Something's up.

71
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,240
That's it.

72
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:36,600
Xianxian, what a coincidence.

73
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,540
Senior Brother?

74
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,240
What are you doing here?

75
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,041
I came here to meet with a client. Where are you going? I can give you a ride.

76
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,761
What are you doing outside this late?

77
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,981
I feel bored.

78
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:57,201
I wanted to take a bus, but I didn't know where to go.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,540
Senior Brother, why are you wearing a suit?

80
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,540
I hardly recognized you.

81
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,841
I'm with a startup company now.

82
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:12,581
But I still have meetings with my clients every now and then.

83
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,940
So, it's safer to dress formally.

84
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,420
Since you are that busy,

85
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,409
you probably don't have time for dating. Right?

86
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,941
What's wrong?

87
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:29,195
Nothing. Red light.

88
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,961
I don't have a girlfriend.

89
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,441
So there's no need to worry about whether I have time for dating or not.

90
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,940
Xianxian,

91
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,520
the art exhibition you like has opened.

92
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,861
Would you like to go?

93
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:55,221
Now?

94
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,610
Yes.

95
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,421
You are so fascinated.

96
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,601
Feels like I can only relax myself

97
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:44,420
when I appreciate art.

98
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,420
I remember you were quite good at drawing.

99
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,341
Do you still draw?

100
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:51,201
Yes.

101
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:54,381
I joined the Anime &amp; Comics Club in school.

102
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:57,001
I'll draw when there are activities.

103
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,660
I think you should stick to drawing. Don't waste your talent.

104
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,000
But...

105
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,601
I'm feeling lost.

106
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,001
Did something happen today?

107
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:19,180
You look upset.

108
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,700
It's okay.

109
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,790
You don't have to talk about it if you don't feel like it.

110
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:30,801
Everybody has their time of confusion.

111
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,900
Either feeling lost or making changes in life,

112
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,870
you can always find a path that suits you the best.

113
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,746
But most importantly, never forget why you started.

114
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,941
Besides,

115
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,120
you don't need to follow in anyone's footsteps.

116
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,000
   

117
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,641
Where's Ding Xian?

118
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,201
She asked for a day off. She said she was not feeling well.

119
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,941
Why does Ding Xian ask for leave so often lately?

120
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,941
At this rate, Professor Ye may make her quit.

121
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:31,160
You talk too much.

122
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,621
Hello? Dad.

123
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:04,520
 Hello? Xianxian. 

124
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,880
 How have you been doing? 

125
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,641
 You haven't called home for a long time. 

126
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,181
I've been caught up with studying.

127
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:15,900
What's wrong with your voice? Do you have a cold?

128
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,270
What? She got a cold?

129
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,446
Let her drink more water.

130
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:22,880
 Is she wearing less? Trying to show off how pretty she is? 

131
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:25,900
 Let her go to see a doctor if it's serious. 

132
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,380
 Did you hear what your mom said? 

133
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,161
I didn't.

134
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:33,881
I'm all fine. Don't worry.

135
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:35,974
Is there anything wrong?

136
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:38,661
Tell me if something happened.

137
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:40,240
You wouldn't understand anyway.

138
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,933
Xianxian, listen to me.

139
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,320
 The season is changing. You need to stay warm. 

140
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,861
 Make sure to put more layers on. 

141
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:50,600
 When you come back, I'll cook you something nice. 

142
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,540
Mom, I'm doing very well.

143
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,141
Don't worry about me.

144
00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:58,761
I'm a little busy here.

145
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:00,661
I've got to go.

146
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:13,961
 Either Arts or Science, don't mind what others say, 

147
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:17,080
 just go ahead and choose the subject that you like and are good at. 

148
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,261
 No matter what, I'll have your back. 

149
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,521
 Then what if I tell you he's the one who told Professor Ye 

150
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:24,100
 that you aren't suitable for scientific research? 

151
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,481
 I hope you can think about yourself 

152
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:28,361
 before making a choice, 

153
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:30,520
 instead of thinking about me first. 

154
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,321
 You keep saying this is about my choice. Then what's yours? 

155
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:38,481
 Do you not have any feelings for me? 

156
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:39,081
Did I wake you up?

157
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,360
Sorry, Senior Brother. I fell asleep.

158
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,640
It's okay. You look tired. You can sleep a little longer.

159
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,861
I don't have much to do today.

160
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:52,544
No, thanks. Please go back to work.

161
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:55,140
I'll go back to school.

162
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:57,493
Thank you.

163
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:59,093
Okay.

164
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:13,580
 I won't let you get hurt anymore. 

165
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,910
   

166
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:29,221
You got up so early today.

167
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:30,781
Yep.

168
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:33,680
You looked upset before.

169
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,761
I thought something happened to you.

170
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,240
Nothing happened.

171
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,694
Sorry I made you worry.

172
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,087
Never mind.

173
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:47,540
It's the weekend. Shall we go and have hotpot today?

174
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,140
No.

175
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:52,687
I'm going to do my own business now.

176
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,993
Hey!

177
00:13:57,993 --> 00:14:01,367
You are still sleeping? I've bought you breakfast.

178
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:04,187
Be quiet. I've got a headache.

179
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,786
I want to sleep more.

180
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,900
 The second set of Radio Exercises for high school students. 

181
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,380
 A new era is calling. 

182
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:29,260
What's wrong with you? I've got a headache. Let me sleep a little more.

183
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:31,373
Don't you need to help me clean up when you live here?

184
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:33,213
Clean up what?

185
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,320
We are both failures in love. Just let me sleep more.

186
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,100
Don't call me a failure.

187
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,941
You've become a drunkard now.

188
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,961
- Hello? 
  - Zhou Siyue, it's me. 

189
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:51,140
Kong Shadi?

190
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,290
What's up?

191
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,700
Tell me. Is Song Ziqi with you?

192
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:02,481
No, he's not.

193
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:03,773
 I don't believe you. 

194
00:15:03,773 --> 00:15:05,081
 I want you to tell me in person. 

195
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:08,240
 I'm at the gate of your school right now. Come out. 

196
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,080
- But... 
  - You must come out. 

197
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,900
Listen!  If you don't, I'll wait for you here until you do.

198
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,100
Hanging up.

199
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,140
Why did you come to...

200
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,240
What should I do?

201
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:31,420
President, this is my portfolio for the competition of the press.

202
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,220
But the deadline has passed.

203
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,760
Then...

204
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,469
do you have the contact information of the Chief Editor?

205
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:56,910
Excuse me.

206
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:01,100
I'm here to see Ms. Sun Yuanxiang, the Chief Editor.

207
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,921
Do you have an appointment?

208
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,120
No.

209
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,887
Then let me make a phone call.

210
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:08,646
Okay. Thanks.

211
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,740
Shadi.

212
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,081
Where is Song Ziqi?

213
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:38,381
I really have no idea.

214
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:40,420
How's that possible?

215
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,580
You are his best friend, aren't you?

216
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:48,041
If you came just to ask me this,

217
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:50,373
then I'm leaving.

218
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:53,220
We've known each other for more than 10 years now.

219
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,243
Are you that repulsed by me?

220
00:16:57,261 --> 00:16:59,980
Shadi, don't get me wrong.

221
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,680
Zhou Siyue,

222
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,021
I'm asking you seriously.

223
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:07,300
Was Song Ziqi expelled by the school?

224
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,761
I know it already.

225
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,480
I've gone to his school.

226
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:14,941
He just got a disciplinary punishment and a one-year suspension.

227
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,560
So, you do know everything.

228
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,840
I've always seen you as my close friend.

229
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,121
How could you do this to me?

230
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:35,501
Shadi,

231
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:39,240
you've always followed Song Ziqi everywhere.

232
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,841
Ever since kindergarten,

233
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:44,421
you've been doing everything that he does.

234
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:46,300
But have you ever thought

235
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,340
that you should control your own life.

236
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,780
Why do you have to take him as your goal and benchmark?

237
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,041
You men are all the same, claiming it's for our own good,

238
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,230
yet acting so pretentious and condescending.

239
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,460
Why do you get to decide everything?

240
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,481
You have no idea how much Song Ziqi means to me.

241
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,141
He broke up with me all of a sudden.

242
00:18:09,141 --> 00:18:11,720
Has he ever thought about my feelings?

243
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,780
Zhou Siyue, you don't understand.

244
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:20,200
I can't let Song Ziqi disappear from my life.

245
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:24,661
Have you ever thought about what will happen to you

246
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:29,641
if Ding Xian disappears from your life one day?

247
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:40,741
 - Wait a moment. 
 - Okay. 

248
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:42,361
Go ahead.

249
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:43,761
Thanks.

250
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,621
Have a seat.

251
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:53,621
Ms. Sun, nice to meet you.

252
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:56,781
I'm Ding Xian from the Anime &amp; Comics Club of Huaqing University.

253
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:58,021
I remember you.

254
00:18:58,021 --> 00:18:59,821
How can I help you?

255
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,320
I'd like you to take a look at my drawings.

256
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,540
So, what do you want me to do?

257
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:19,640
I want to participate in your drawing competition.

258
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,980
But the deadline has passed.

259
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:25,094
I know.

260
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:27,220
That's why I'm here to ask

261
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,980
if there's another way to take part in it.

262
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,761
I'll tell you what...

263
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:34,141
You may leave your portfolio here.

264
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,460
If I don't get back to you by tomorrow,

265
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,440
I'm afraid you'll miss it this time.

266
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,141
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Sun.

267
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,580
I'll wait for your call.

268
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,080
Thanks.

269
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:57,980
- Xianxian! 
 - Shadi!

270
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,141
What brings you here?

271
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:03,601
I've been busy at school.

272
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,941
Could you stay here with me tonight?

273
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:09,360
But there'll be a roll-call at 11:00 p.m. in my dorm.

274
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,060
I have to go back.

275
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,114
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

276
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:18,300
Don't you want a besties' night with me?

277
00:20:19,781 --> 00:20:22,521
Fine. You win.

278
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:29,621
I went to the hospital and checked on Zhou a few days ago.

279
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:33,461
So, just focus on your research.

280
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:37,980
I can help you financially.

281
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,721
It's okay. I can support myself.

282
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,901
Don't wear yourself out.

283
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:44,800
Here's a heads-up for you.

284
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,841
The selection of exchange students has begun.

285
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,501
When you finish this project,

286
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:51,901
I'm sure you'll be in.

287
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,861
Okay.

288
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,361
One more thing.

289
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,161
Ding Xian came to me a few days ago

290
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:02,961
and told me she's found something she's more interested in.

291
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:06,520
She wanted to leave the scientific research group. I agreed.

292
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,440
Good to know.

293
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,901
I had no idea

294
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:18,246
so many things happened between you and Zhou Siyue.

295
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,100
So, what's the name of that senior girl?

296
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,779
Which department is she from? Do you want me to talk to her?

297
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:26,460
You missed my point.

298
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,741
What's happened has happened.

299
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:31,121
I don't want to think of him anymore.

300
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:34,141
You know what?

301
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:35,940
I've always thought

302
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,280
that you'd be the one who'd end up with Zhou Siyue.

303
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:43,421
And now?

304
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,261
I'm not sure anymore.

305
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:48,980
I think ever since we grew up,

306
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,711
relationship have become much more complicated.

307
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,000
What shall we have for lunch?

308
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,660
What's on your mind?

309
00:22:06,381 --> 00:22:08,207
Actually, I've been thinking about...

310
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:09,741
What?

311
00:22:09,741 --> 00:22:11,441
Mr. Charming!

312
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,700
What's so interesting about your phone?

313
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,641
You didn't even look at him.

314
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:41,461
I'm waiting for a call from the press.

315
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,441
Then you and Zhou Siyue...

316
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:45,501
Don't mention him.

317
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,640
You broke up with him?

318
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,940
Yes. I have a Zen mind now.

319
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,741
I only want to focus on my hobbies.

320
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:54,781
You'd better.

321
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,980
Ding Xian!

322
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,621
There you are.

323
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:01,421
President, what's up?

324
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,821
Ms. Sun of Dream Journey Comics Press called to look for you.

325
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,261
I can participate in the competition?

326
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,921
No. She wants to sign you directly.

327
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,680
Sign me?

328
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,661
Really?

329
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:14,661
Yes.

330
00:23:16,277 --> 00:23:17,980
I told you.

331
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,880
Then, why didn't she call me herself?

332
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,400
She said you left in a hurry, and you didn't leave her your phone number.

333
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,340
How could she contact you?

334
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,740
Oh, right.

335
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:40,141
Isn't this the popular novel The Shadow

336
00:23:40,141 --> 00:23:41,940
published on the Lijiang Literary website?

337
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,700
You want me to adapt it into a comic?

338
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,940
What do you think?

339
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,440
Do you have confidence?

340
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:52,420
We've drafted a contract.

341
00:23:53,146 --> 00:23:54,967
Please have a look.

342
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:58,580
If there's no problem with the payment,

343
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,880
we can proceed to the next step.

344
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:11,220
May I take this contract back and read it through?

345
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,320
Of course.

346
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,679
But...

347
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:17,861
we do have quite a few candidates for this project.

348
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:21,160
I'm worried that someone may beat you to it.

349
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:26,080
Ms. Sun, since you trust me this much,

350
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,040
I should also trust you.

351
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,460
Mr. Su, this is the sponsoring proposal

352
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,901
of the Anime &amp; Comics Club of Huaqing University you asked.

353
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:51,461
The contact information is on the last page.

354
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:53,301
Okay. Thank you.

355
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:09,261
Hello? Is that Xing Lufei?

356
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:11,161
 Yes, it's me. 

357
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,080
I'm not sure if you still remember me.

358
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,480
I'm Su Bocong of Red Horse Technology.

359
00:25:16,053 --> 00:25:19,881
I wonder if you have time for a meal today.

360
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:24,340
By the way, a few high school classmates of mine also study in Huaqing.

361
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,160
We are talking about a get-together.

362
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,121
You may know them, too.

363
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,921
You've been silent since you came back. It's not like you, Master Zhou.

364
00:25:36,986 --> 00:25:40,720
Did I overreact that day?

365
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:43,361
Which day?

366
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,041
Don't play dumb.

367
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,341
Not only did you overreact, you also acted like a jerk.

368
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,561
But I only wanted her to do the things that she was interested in...

369
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,300
instead of sacrificing herself for me.

370
00:26:07,421 --> 00:26:09,060
Do you regret it now?

371
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,800
She might ignore you if you went to find her right now.

372
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,241
You deserve it. You brought it on yourself.

373
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:23,715
   

374
00:26:34,741 --> 00:26:38,140
I thought you didn't like dinner parties.

375
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,420
I have to be there for this one.

376
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:47,521
Brother Bocong, sorry to have kept you waiting.

377
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:48,721
Here you are.

378
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,580
Hi. I'm Ji Hang, President of the Anime &amp; Comics Club.

379
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,220
I'm Su Bocong. Nice to meet you.

380
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,261
Take a seat, please.

381
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:57,061
Xianxian, sit here.

382
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:04,481
Senior Brother,

383
00:27:04,481 --> 00:27:07,421
so, you are the sponsor of our club.

384
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:09,542
Ding Xian,

385
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:11,961
if we'd known you two were this close,

386
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:14,681
we should've sent you to talk to him about the sponsorship.

387
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:17,841
Where's Zhou Siyue?

388
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,441
He's on his way over.

389
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:29,640
Good timing. We've also just arrived. Sit down.

390
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:40,721
Zhou Siyue, long time no see.

391
00:27:41,421 --> 00:27:43,121
Likewise.

392
00:27:44,141 --> 00:27:46,220
Looks like we all know each other.

393
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,060
Then there's no need for an introduction.

394
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:50,580
Now, let's start to order.

395
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:53,341
See what you like to eat.

396
00:27:56,494 --> 00:27:59,401
Xianxian, order whatever you want.

397
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:01,340
Zhou Siyue, this is for you.

398
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,920
It's my fault that I took your chocolate last time.

399
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,780
I bought one exactly like that for you.

400
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:09,760
Don't be angry with me anymore.

401
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:21,921
Now, dig in.

402
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,441
Brother Bocong, you are young and talented.

403
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:29,173
You are only two years older than us, and you've already become our investor.

404
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,381
You guys are excellent.

405
00:28:32,141 --> 00:28:34,921
I just got lucky

406
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,100
and met someone who appreciates me.

407
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,841
You are too modest.

408
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:42,080
Xianxian,

409
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,421
this sour soup fish tastes similar to that in our hometown Keshan.

410
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:46,821
Have a taste.

411
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:49,820
Ding Xian doesn't like sour stuff.

412
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,841
You don't like it anymore?

413
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,020
Let me give it a try.

414
00:29:12,621 --> 00:29:14,021
How is it?

415
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:21,381
Well, Brother Bocong,

416
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:23,060
I'm curious about something.

417
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,520
What is it?

418
00:29:26,421 --> 00:29:31,980
What's your relationship with Sister Ding Xian?

419
00:29:35,655 --> 00:29:40,541
My parents are friends with his family. So, we've known each other since childhood.

420
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:45,712
You grew up together. So, you are like childhood sweethearts.

421
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,941
I mean Brother Bocong seems to like you a lot.

422
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:56,401
I do like her.

423
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,920
And I want to hire her after she graduates.

424
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:10,541
By the way, if you guys want to join us, it'll be my pleasure to have you.

425
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:14,320
Brother Bocong, you are so nice to Xianxian.

426
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,961
I'll go to the bathroom.

427
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,313
Excuse me for a sec. You guys enjoy it.

428
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:36,961
Zhou Siyue.

429
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,241
So, what do you want to talk about?

430
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,081
I like Ding Xian.

431
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,800
So what?

432
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:06,961
I've liked her since childhood.

433
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:10,521
You hurt Ding Xian badly, and I'll make it up for her.

434
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:13,501
I'm capable enough to give her a better life.

435
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,720
So, please stay away from her.

436
00:31:17,781 --> 00:31:20,661
What happened between her and me

437
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:23,181
is none of your business.

438
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:29,060
Put my relationship with Xianxian aside,

439
00:31:30,241 --> 00:31:33,921
Xianxian's parents asked me to take good care of her.

440
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:38,100
So, her business is also mine.

441
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,940
What do you mean by your relationship with her?

442
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,740
I'd like to know what kind of...

443
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,250
relationship you were talking about.

444
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,981
Then, what's your relationship with her?

445
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,721
No matter what relationship I have with her now,

446
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,480
Ding Xian will only be with me for the rest of her life.

447
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,700
Xianxia?

448
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:34,261
Ding Xian.

449
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:36,901
Ding Xian.

450
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,540
Zhou Siyue, what else do you want?

451
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,340
I was too harsh that day.

452
00:32:49,021 --> 00:32:50,621
I'm sorry.

453
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,680
Since when did you learn to apologize?

454
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,300
Actually, I've been thinking since that day.

455
00:33:02,194 --> 00:33:04,641
I can't imagine

456
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:08,252
what my life will be like without you in it.

457
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,207
Don't flatter yourself, Zhou Siyue.

458
00:33:10,981 --> 00:33:14,380
Who gave you the right to decide our relationship?

459
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,780
Who gave you the right to make a choice for me?

460
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:21,161
I told you that I wouldn't let my life revolve around you anymore.

461
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:23,060
You don't have to explain anything.

462
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,760
Ding Xian.

463
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,140
Please calm down.

464
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:32,221
- As a matter of fact... 
 - Calm down?

465
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:35,541
Do you really think I can't live without you, Zhou Siyue?

466
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:38,141
Or is it fun for you to play me like a fool?

467
00:33:39,215 --> 00:33:43,260
You just got used to having me around.

468
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:47,341
But I'm tired of it now.

469
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:50,821
It's time to end it.

470
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:57,940
â™«  It has been a long day, a long day, 
 I haven't found you  â™«

471
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,720
â™«  You got to stay in the light, all right  â™«

472
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,740
â™«  I'm going to be another side  â™«

473
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:13,480
â™«  It has been a long day, a long day, 
 I haven't heard from you  â™«

474
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,930
â™«  And I've been waiting too  â™«

475
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:24,581
Xianxian.

476
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:29,261
Get in. I'll drive you back.

477
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Xianxian.

478
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:45,981
I saw that you didn't like the dishes today.

479
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:48,661
Would you like me to take you to eat something else?

480
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:51,921
Thank you, Senior Brother,

481
00:34:52,661 --> 00:34:54,261
but I'm not hungry.

482
00:34:56,141 --> 00:35:00,400
You heard my conversation with Zhou Siyue, didn't you?

483
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,499
Just part of it.

484
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,221
But it's enough already for me.

485
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:14,641
It's over now.

486
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:18,421
I won't feel upset for him anymore.

487
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:23,260
Let me go back to Shenhai with you during the New Year's holiday.

488
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,920
You can take some time to relax.

489
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,581
I can't. I still need to go to Huai City for an anime expo.

490
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:53,821
Kong Shadi.

491
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:56,960
It's me.

492
00:36:01,721 --> 00:36:03,981
You know what?

493
00:36:03,981 --> 00:36:05,440
I just had a nightmare,

494
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,041
in which Kong Shadi and I were stuck in a rainforest.

495
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:13,181
We were on a tree, and under it were a bunch of crocodiles.

496
00:36:13,181 --> 00:36:14,701
She said to me,

497
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:19,619
"Song Ziqi, jump off and let the crocodiles eat you." And then "Bang," she pushed me off.

498
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,640
So horrible.

499
00:36:24,446 --> 00:36:25,701
Song Ziqi.

500
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:27,880
I have a question for you.

501
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,421
If one day Kong Shadi disappeared,

502
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,981
what would you do?

503
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,161
Why do you ask such a ridiculous question?

504
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:12,061
I've thought carefully about it.

505
00:37:12,701 --> 00:37:16,200
I think it's completely over between us.

506
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:19,900
I suggest you give up, too.

507
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:23,340
If Song Ziqi wanted to see you,

508
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,520
he would've come to find you already.

509
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,440
Please don't put your love curse on me. Okay?

510
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,941
I will find Song Ziqi no matter where he is.

511
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:36,421
 Even if it's over, I must find out why. 

512
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,173
Actually, why is not that important.

513
00:37:44,421 --> 00:37:49,941
You are just forcing yourself to believe that it's not important.

514
00:37:49,941 --> 00:37:53,920
Are you sure you can give up this easily?

515
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,740
 I can't. 

516
00:37:56,793 --> 00:38:00,129
I know it won't be easy for me to give up.

517
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:06,681
And my heart beats fast every time I see him.

518
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:10,301
But I have to tell myself...

519
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,720
to control my feelings as long as possible.

520
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,020
All right.

521
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:18,481
I'll have your back whatever decision you make.

522
00:38:18,481 --> 00:38:21,453
- Bye-bye. 
  - Bye-bye. 

523
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:41,481
 Zhou Siyue, how have I become the one 

524
00:38:41,481 --> 00:38:43,381
 who understands you the least? 

525
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,380
 Why can't you just be honest with me? 

526
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,740
 Zhou Siyue, it's been four years now. 

527
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,461
 You think I've never confirmed it myself? 

528
00:38:55,461 --> 00:38:59,961
 I've asked myself countless times if I really like you 

529
00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:03,421
 or just an illusion in puberty. 

530
00:39:04,293 --> 00:39:08,120
 If there's only one thing in this world I'm sure about, 

531
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,181
 it's my feelings for you. 

532
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,561
â™«  How many days and nights do I have to wait?  â™«

533
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:20,880
 You just got used to having me around. 

534
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,200
 But I'm tired of it now. 

535
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,660
 It's time to end it. 

536
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:31,630
â™«  It may take a lifetime to reach it  â™«

537
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:38,050
â™«  Your name has long been engraved in my heart  â™«

538
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:55,470
   

539
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,580
- Hello? Xian. 
  - Hello? Senior Brother. 

540
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,820
I saw the gift you gave me.

541
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,016
It's too valuable. I can't take it.

542
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:11,680
You must keep it.

543
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,621
I knew you wouldn't take it if I gave it to you in person,

544
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:15,801
so I asked someone to put it in your room.

545
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:19,181
If you really think it's too valuable to accept,

546
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:22,400
just use it to draw more and better works.

547
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,261
 Consider it an investment from me. 

548
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:27,861
Thank you.

549
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,221
 Then I'll start to save money. When your birthday... 

550
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,300
Excuse me, Xianxian.

551
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,820
I've got another line waiting. I have to go now.

552
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,221
Okay.

553
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:38,181
 All right. Bye. 

554
00:40:38,181 --> 00:40:39,400
Bye-bye.

555
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,441
Song Ziqi.

556
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,840
Hello?

557
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,221
- Where are you? 
  - Since Kong Shadi is here, 

558
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:49,680
 I'm worried that she'll stalk you and find me, 

559
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,221
 so I'm in hiding now. 

560
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:53,640
Good for you.

561
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,040
I'm hanging up.

562
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,100
Song Ziqi?

563
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:03,540
Miss, you've got the wrong person.

564
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,581
Who is Song Ziqi?

565
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:15,301
Song Ziqi.

566
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:24,981
Song Ziqi, stop!

567
00:43:24,981 --> 00:43:26,852
Wait for me.

568
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:39,740
Hello? Shadi.

569
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,901
 Hello? Ding Xian. 

570
00:43:40,901 --> 00:43:42,340
 Zhou Siyue is such a liar. 

571
00:43:43,661 --> 00:43:45,020
What did he do to you?

572
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,160
He told me he didn't know where Song Ziqi was.

573
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,220
Song Ziqi is right here.

574
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:51,641
 How do you know? 

575
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,020
I just saw him.

576
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,020
It really pissed me off.

577
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:58,008
 I'm going to your school to see you. Come out. 

578
00:43:58,008 --> 00:44:00,381
Okay, wait for me. I'll be there.

579
00:44:02,076 --> 00:44:04,340
Why are you dragging me here?

580
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,740
I'm going to stalk Siyue.

581
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,300
I bet he knows where Song Ziqi is.

582
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,340
I don't believe that I can't find that jerk Song Ziqi by following him.

583
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,701
Then you can do it alone. Why do you bring me here?

584
00:44:12,701 --> 00:44:14,141
Are you my bestie or not?

585
00:44:14,141 --> 00:44:15,821
I need your company.

586
00:44:19,981 --> 00:44:22,500
Wait!  How did she find you?

587
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,939
 How would I know that she'd go to the bookstore, bro? 

588
00:44:25,939 --> 00:44:27,339
Bookstore?

589
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,960
I didn't expect you'd go to a bookstore either.

590
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,661
You two are indeed a perfect match.

591
00:44:31,661 --> 00:44:33,381
 Stop joking with me. 

592
00:44:33,381 --> 00:44:35,453
 Tell me what I should do. 

593
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:36,740
Where are you right now?

594
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,240
I'm in the basement.

595
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,841
Please come back. I...

596
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:41,841
I'm afraid.

597
00:44:41,861 --> 00:44:43,861
Fine. Don't be afraid.

598
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:45,620
I'm on my way.

599
00:44:47,739 --> 00:44:49,040
"Don't be afraid"?

600
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,741
"On my way"?

601
00:44:52,621 --> 00:44:54,261
Come on. Hurry.

602
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:14,074
He's looking over here.

603
00:45:14,074 --> 00:45:15,274
It's okay.

604
00:45:16,094 --> 00:45:19,280
- Did he see us? 
 - I don't think so.

605
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,621
Take a look.

606
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:23,621
Let me see.

607
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:31,101
He's gone.

608
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,421
She wasn't stalking you, was she?

609
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:42,521
She was.

610
00:45:42,521 --> 00:45:44,481
Ding Xian was with her.

611
00:45:44,481 --> 00:45:46,781
Take it easy.

612
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,100
I just checked.

613
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,201
They won't come here.

614
00:45:52,013 --> 00:45:53,441
Is it here?

615
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:55,880
 Are you sure you got rid of them? 

616
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,100
 Are you really sure... 

617
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,740
I think I heard Song Ziqi's voice.

618
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,841
 This thing is not a joke. 

619
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:03,421
 If she shows up at the door, I'll be dead, I'm telling you. Seriously. 

620
00:46:03,421 --> 00:46:05,680
 Listen! I haven't slept well for days. 

621
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,741
 I have nightmares every night. 

622
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,640
It should be here.

623
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,340
 Zhou Siyue.
