1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,594
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,080
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,960
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,232
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:36,838
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:40,387
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,387 --> 00:00:47,446
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:55,242
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,470
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,206
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:06,319
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,572
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:15,098
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,886
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:20,238
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:27,532
 ♫ All comes down to a simple thank you ♫

18
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:31,418

19
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:34,266

20
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,190
Senior Brother,

21
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,910
I'm so tired.

22
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,380
I'm really tired.

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,800
I chose to repeat the third year myself.

24
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,380
I don't get to complain about it.

25
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:02,210
I can't stop no matter how hard or tired I am.

26
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm afraid, too.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,920
I don't know if starting over is the right choice.

28
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,420
Xianxian,

29
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,970
you are already quite excellent compared with your peers.

30
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,470
That's not enough.

31
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,050
I'm so far away from the life I want

32
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,780
and the person I want to follow.

33
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,530
You are talking about Zhou Siyue, right?

34
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,310
Zhou Siyue is really outstanding.

35
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,450
I used to think that we were about the same.

36
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,730
I thought if I worked hard, I would be able to follow him.

37
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,830
But he's too good.

38
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,040
I just realized that the gap between us is huge.

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,190
No matter how much I like him,

40
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,620
I can't stand the fact that I'm not good enough for him.

41
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,390
I'm worried that people will ask...

42
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,420
why Zhou Siyue would be with someone like me one day.

43
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,910
That won't happen.

44
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,560
At least I wouldn't ask that question.

45
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,740
If I were you, I wouldn't be affected by fear

46
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,660
if I want to do something.

47
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,800
Not seeking results...

48
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,270
is the best answer.

49
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,390
Drink some milk and rest.

50
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,000
Thanks, Mom.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,070
It's almost midnight. Don't stay up too late.

52
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,160
Mom.

53
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,940
Don't worry.

54
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,030
I will sleep early today.

55
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,280
 Zhou Siyue.

56
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,810
 I miss you so much.

57
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,390
 I'm so tired.

58
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,970
 I'm really tired.

59
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,290
 School is starting today, right?

60
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,860
 Congratulations on becoming a student of Huaqing officially.

61
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,030
 Sorry.

62
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,700
 I've made your life hard for so long.

63
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,420
 Thank you.

64
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,340
Hey, there.

65
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,460
Do you know the way to the Automation Department?

66
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,340
- No. 
 - Which department are you in?

67
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,820
- I'm also in the Automation Department. 
 - Really?

68
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,400
Hello, I'm Yuan Fang.

69
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,080
I'm Zhou Siyue.

70
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,780

71
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,480
Guys.

72
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,100
This is the first class after school has started.

73
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,460
I want you to read these eight characters and remember them by heart.

74
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,730
Remember our responsibilities and mission.

75
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,100
How could you make a mistake on such an easy question?

76
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,110
I made just that one mistake. You are asking too much from me.

77
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,950
You made a mistake, and you are the justified side.

78
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,196
Silly.

79
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:21,160
 What were you thinking?

80
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,980
 If I did all the right things,

81
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,960
 then I would be the one who scored 90.

82
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,277
 You are looking for excuses when you made mistakes.

83
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,290

84
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,100
- Professor Ye. Hello. 
 - Hello.

85
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,380
I'm Dong Zhengfei.

86
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,480
I have an idea about the selection for the scientific research group.

87
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,500
I would like to design a website about it.

88
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,420
Maybe you could check it out when you are free.

89
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,550
Kid, ambition is a good thing.

90
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,910
As for the rest, let's see in the election.

91
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,100
Go back now.

92
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,780
I understand, Professor Ye.

93
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,510
Siyue, I was looking for you.

94
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,200
Professor Ye.

95
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,580
You can skip the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class this semester.

96
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,060
I've seen your homework.

97
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,600
It has exceeded my expectation.

98
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,640
So during this time, I want you to concentrate on preparing for my laboratory assessment.

99
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,200
Okay. Got it.

100
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,390
How's your father doing?

101
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,860
He's still busy with the investigation.

102
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,650
But I believe that the truth will come out soon.

103
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,130
All right. Don't worry too much.

104
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,540
Focus on your education.

105
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,100
You have potential.

106
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,000
Thank you, Professor Ye.

107
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,830
 Zhou Siyue, have you been busy?

108
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:27,225
In the medical area, humanoid robots are used to transplant artificial limbs or organs.

109
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:30,900
With the humanoid robot technique, we are be able to produce powered artificial limbs

110
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,440
and help paralyzed patients to walk again.

111
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,650
We have such a handsome guy in our year.

112
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,060
He's in Class One. It is said that he was recommended by Shenhai. He's good.

113
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,500
That's why we need to further study and explore that aspect.

114
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,780
Just wait and see.

115
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,340
He will be mine.

116
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,660
Thank you, everyone.

117
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,220
- Here you go again. 
  - Great.

118
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,400
Thank you.

119
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,040
 Good.

120
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,253
Not bad.

121
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:01,993
A lot of people are cheering for you.

122
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,250
 Go see him if you want.

123
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,830
He doesn't even respond to my messages often.

124
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,800
He must be busy.

125
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,350
How busy can he be?

126
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,610
We are all university students.

127
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,065
Never mind.

128
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:27,220
It's not like I have that kind of time.

129
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,100
Don't you have some days off on National Day?

130
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,660
 I do, but...

131
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,880
Why are you hesitating?

132
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,832
 Didn't you always want to see what Huaqing was like?

133
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:40,050
 You could surprise Zhou Siyue in the meantime.

134
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,490
Surprise...

135
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,799

136
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,150
 Where is the Automation Department?

137
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,020
Hello.

138
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,420
- Hello. 
 - I'm Xing Lufei.

139
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,220
I'm from Computer Science Department, Class 5.

140
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,400
Can we get to know each other?

141
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,780
Here's the thing. I saw you at the election for the research group.

142
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,450
I think you are pretty amazing.

143
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,710
I have several questions for you related to the course.

144
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,860
I'm sorry.

145
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,200
I'm a little occupied today.

146
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,520
This is our lab.

147
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,300
This lab is one of the best

148
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,500
regarding both equipment and technology.

149
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,530
A lab like this is rare nationwide.

150
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,330
Hey, Siyue.

151
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,180
Look at this machine.

152
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,470
Sorry, Professor Ye.

153
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,870
I went to the wrong place.

154
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,710
The new members are all here today.

155
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,900
Siyue,

156
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,340
as a group leader of our department,

157
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,290
you will be contacting your seniors.

158
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,640
The others can take a tour now.

159
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,200
 All right. Thank you, Professor.

160
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,340
 Oh, Professor.

161
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,510
 I'm a member of the intern team now.

162
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,160
- Hello. 
 - The information about the progress of this lab

163
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,550
is on the computer.

164
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,130
These are related topics.

165
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,630
Have a look.

166
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,610
Are all the good students so rude?

167
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,100
Why are you still here?

168
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,410
I'm curious about the world of geniuses like you.

169
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,520
To be honest, you are really good.

170
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,520
I think freshmen are lucky enough to program or something.

171
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,281
I'm surprised that you are starting to learn how to build robots now.

172
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,610
What does this do?

173
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,660
Classmate, don't touch things in the lab.

174
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,810
Siyue, congratulations.

175
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,860
You've become the group leader of the freshmen.

176
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,410
The topic you picked in the election was good.

177
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,690
Thank you.

178
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,340
We should communicate more when we have the chance.

179
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,740
Great.

180
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,110
Look. This is the online forum of our school.

181
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,860
Yeah! How could something like that have happened?

182
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,230
Isn't that his son?

183
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,530
That's him.

184
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:00,310
A professor of the Art Department of Huaqing is suspected of academic fraud.

185
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,750
The son of a professor.

186
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,400
He got in by connections. What are these?

187
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,550
 Yeah!

188
00:14:07,443 --> 00:14:08,329
 That's him.

189
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:11,350
What's wrong? Are you all right?

190
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,110
 I hope not.

191
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,680
A dirty trick like controlling the host to send a message like that.

192
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,240
It seems that you are worried that I can't find out it's you.

193
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,900
This is a misunderstanding. You've made a mistake.

194
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,520
I just sent a test to the cell phone

195
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,770
that's controlling the host by the internet.

196
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,400
 It's him!

197
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,600
 He did that.

198
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,480
Zhou Siyue,

199
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,080
everyone knows that your father committed academic fraud.

200
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,030
Don't try to get him out of this by just talking.

201
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:55,200
I also hope you don't go astray like your father.

202
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,470
Are you done?

203
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Yes.

204
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,860
What can you do?

205
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,260
Sue me?

206
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,280
 Stop it!

207
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,680
 Let this go.

208
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,760
 Let's just talk things out.

209
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,650
 Yeah. Say what you want.

210
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,470
Are you okay?

211
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,410
I've twisted my ankle.

212
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:31,290
I'm injured because of you.

213
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,000
Can't you help me to the infirmary?

214
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:36,470
♫   That him, this him, I hear the rain go drip-drop   ♫

215
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,070
Let's go.

216
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,040
My ankle hurts a lot.

217
00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:48,022
♫  Hide in my room on a cloudy day  ♫

218
00:16:48,022 --> 00:16:55,922
♫  Slouch in the chair, messy hair, miss him  ♫

219
00:16:57,427 --> 00:17:01,224
♫  The dream he loves warms my heart  ♫

220
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:04,994
♫  Like clouds glide softly in the sky  ♫

221
00:17:04,994 --> 00:17:09,881
♫  All lovely things come together  ♫

222
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:12,469
♫  How I wish I could be a part of it  ♫

223
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,470
♫  The dream he loves sparkles like a star  ♫

224
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,420
 Zhou Siyue.

225
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,090
 I'm going to focus on my studies this year.

226
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,610
 Maybe we should stop contacting each other.

227
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:30,920
♫  He's the only one who stays in the dream  ♫

228
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,380
 Maybe the moment I decided to repeat the third year,

229
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,650
 my path had been separated from Zhou Siyue's.

230
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,780
 I've said goodbye to everyone,

231
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,900
 and have been walking on a road that gradually drifts away.

232
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,100
 I thought I could turn everything back,

233
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,790
 but I forgot...

234
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,160
 that maybe you have started a new life.

235
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,170
♫  Miss you on busy days  ♫

236
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,410

237
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:48,606

♫  Is it sunny or rainy in your place  ♫

238
00:18:52,408 --> 00:19:00,370
♫  The distance between us makes me miss you even more  ♫

239
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:07,770
♫  I'm doing well. No need to worry  ♫

240
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:12,407
♫  Where's the furthest happiness?  ♫

241
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:16,142
♫  How many days and nights do I have to wait?  ♫

242
00:19:16,142 --> 00:19:23,270
♫  Hands are held tight. Can you feel it?  ♫

243
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,016
♫  How close am I to the furthest happiness?  ♫

244
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:31,236
♫  It may take a lifetime to reach it  ♫

245
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:37,459
♫  Your name has long been engraved in my heart  ♫

246
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,350
 The day of December 21st, 2012 is coming.

247
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,750
 That's the end of the world estimated by the Mayans.

248
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,580
 If we all cease to exist in this world one day,

249
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,010
 who would you prefer to have by your side?

250
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:05,230
 What do you think the end of the world in 2012 would be like?

251
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,890
 I think it would be like in the movie.

252
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:14,190
 Earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and so on.

253
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,280
 It's December 21st now.

254
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,610
 Who is by your side?

255
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,160
 If humanity is really facing destruction,

256
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,250
 then there should be fireworks all over the sky.

257
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,560
 To welcome death with the last bit of beauty.

258
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,886
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

259
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:01,880
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

260
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,382
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

261
00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:07,297
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

262
00:21:07,297 --> 00:21:12,623
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

263
00:21:13,682 --> 00:21:17,911
♫  The secret of the answer is an insoluble question   ♫

264
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:26,763
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

265
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:43,612
♫  For whom will the fall gives up on its journey  ♫

266
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:48,262
♫  The rustle of leaves cheers me up  ♫

267
00:21:48,262 --> 00:21:51,855
♫  I wonder what kinda scenery awaits us  ♫

268
00:21:51,855 --> 00:21:57,029
♫  For whom will the stage turn its lights off  ♫

269
00:21:58,461 --> 00:22:01,931
♫  The sparkling bubbles are crystal clear  ♫

270
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:05,564
♫  I wonder if perfection is only an illusion  ♫

271
00:22:05,564 --> 00:22:13,030
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks faded  ♫

272
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:16,600
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

273
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,280
 The fireworks of the end of the world are gone.

274
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,780
 But on the night before the disaster that was supposed to happen,

275
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,130
 it brought me new hope.

276
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,140
 If tomorrow is the end of the world,

277
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,970
 you will be the person...

278
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,510
 I want by my side.

279
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,260
 Zhou Siyue.

280
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,310
 Wait for me at Huaqing.

281
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:52,119
 ♫ All comes down to a simple thank you ♫

282
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:56,812

283
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,570

284
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,430
Zhou Siyue!

285
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,580
Sorry.

286
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm going to join Dong Zhengfei's research team.

287
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,780
All right. Break a leg.

288
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,180
Boss,

289
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,300
are you really letting her go?

290
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,320
Yeah.

291
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,420
Dong Zhengfei has been poaching talents from us for weeks now.

292
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,610
Don't you know this?

293
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,640
Our topic is the humanoid robot.

294
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,280
It is a risky topic.

295
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,310
If she thinks the topic is too hard for her to keep up with,

296
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,670
you can't make me cut off her backup plan. Right?

297
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,370
She has always been at the bottom.

298
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,800
No other team wanted her other than us.

299
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,040
Now that she has learned a lot,

300
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,690
she's ditching us in the middle of the course.

301
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,560
Where are we going to find someone to design the drive?

302
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,870
Don't worry. We will find someone.

303
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,430
With your popularity,

304
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,970
I don't think so.

305
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,570
You have no idea.

306
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,200
You were all by yourself at the beginning

307
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,760
and you weren't talking to people.

308
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,580
People don't know what's going on with you.

309
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,940
They thought you were too arrogant to talk to them.

310
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,060
I'm the only one who wants to stay.

311
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,370
Yeah.

312
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,800
I should thank you for sticking with me.

313
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,800
That's not necessary. We need to figure out how to recruit people.

314
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,110
Don't worry.

315
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,200
We can always spend some time doing it ourselves.

316
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,830
You are sleeping just five hours a day.

317
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,610
Are you trying to kill yourself?

318
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,330
If you know I'm tired,

319
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,450
why aren't you working right now?

320
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,540
Boss, here's the thing.

321
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,710
I've spent two whole days in this lab.

322
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,460
I'm expecting to have this afternoon off.

323
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,970
There are so many new girls out there.

324
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,250
I will regret it so much if I even miss one.

325
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,820
You are talking about girls every day.

326
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,317
Go.

327
00:25:22,317 --> 00:25:23,917
Thank you, Boss.

328
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,700
See you around.

329
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,390

330
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:02,090
 I don't have Zhou Siyue's new number. Did you find him?

331
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,800
Forget about Zhou Siyue,

332
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,320
I don't even know where I am.

333
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,960
Are they all that hopeless?

334
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,760
It hasn't been long,

335
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,880
and all of them are gone.

336
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,240
There's one over there.

337
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,850
I'll let you have her.

338
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,380
You are very kind.

339
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,040
Just a second.

340
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,610
Do you know what to say?

341
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,010
No.

342
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,740
Hey, there. Come here.

343
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,120
Buddy, thank you.

344
00:26:55,507 --> 00:26:58,300
You need to be enthusiastic.

345
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,210
Send the girl and her luggage to her dormitory so that no one will step in.

346
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,680
I have nothing but gratitude for you.

347
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,580
I understand. Go ahead.

348
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,690
Do your best!

349
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,520
Hey, there. Why are you all by yourself?

350
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,820
Are you lost?

351
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,590
You are going to the girls' dormitory. Right?

352
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,090
I'll take you there.

353
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,610
I'm not going to the girls' dormitory. I'm looking for the boys' dormitory.

354
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,830
Don't worry. I'm not a bad guy.

355
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,370
Look. Volunteer. I'm supposed to help you.

356
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,660
It's okay.

357
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,740
I'm fine.

358
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,083
- It's okay. 
 - I'm fine.

359
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:39,674
It's okay.

360
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:41,074
Leave it, you rogue!

361
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,359
You pretend to be a volunteer to trick the new girls every year.

362
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,000
- Wait, bro. You just... 
 - What are you talking about?

363
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,556
Who's your bro?

364
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:51,189
Don't pretend to be close to me.

365
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:54,580
Girl, there are a lot of frauds like him every year.

366
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,390
Let me tell you. If you ever see any... New girl!

367
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,910
You psycho! Psycho!

368
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,160
Stop following me.

369
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,960
 It's okay. Thank you.

370
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,760
Zhou Siyue has excellent character and grades.

371
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,230
He's handsome and he keeps a low profile.

372
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,290
If Dong Zhengfei gets the quota, I can't accept that.

373
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,160
I think he's fine.

374
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,110
Like father, like son.

375
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,710
I, for one, don't want to join his team.

376
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,390
Things are bound to happen sooner or later.

377
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,300
Hey, there!

378
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,920
This is the boys' dormitory. Girls are not allowed.

379
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,941
I know, Auntie. I'm a freshman. I'm looking for someone.

380
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:47,410
It's still a "no". It's against rules.

381
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,800
- I just need two minutes! 
 - How can you do this?

382
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,200
- Just two minutes! 
 - No.

383
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,270
I'll call security if you won't leave.

384
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,100
Zhou Siyue!

385
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,410
Zhou Siyue, I'm here for you!

386
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,640
There's a girl at the boys' dormitory

387
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,820
who traveled far to look for her boyfriend.

388
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,780
Really? That's romantic.

389
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,540
 Zhou Siyue!

390
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,760
♫  Can I spend the night?  ♫

391
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,498
 The secret that I buried in my heart

392
00:29:33,498 --> 00:29:36,020
 was carefully hidden in that dusty box.

393
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,130
♫  It's been a long day  ♫

394
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:42,010
 But boxes will be opened again sooner or later.

395
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,110
♫  I can feel you there  ♫

396
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,560
 I thought I had forgotten everything.

397
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,670
 Now I realized that I have never really let her go.

398
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,670
♫  I spend the long day since you're gone  ♫

399
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:01,190
♫  Would you hear me... Would you hear me now?  ♫

400
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:10,800
♫  I'm not the one who doesn't want to fall in love that way   ♫

401
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,590
Zhou Siyue!

402
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,210
 Wow!

403
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,670
Ding Xian.

404
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:20,901
♫  You got to stay in the light, all right  ♫

405
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:23,768
♫  I'm going to be another side  ♫

406
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:26,286
♫  It has been a long day  ♫

407
00:30:26,286 --> 00:30:30,146
♫  A long day, I haven't found you  ♫

408
00:30:32,608 --> 00:30:36,910
♫  You got to stay in the light, all right  ♫

409
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,715
♫  I'm going to be another side  ♫

410
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:42,301
♫  It has been a long day  ♫

411
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:46,306
♫  A long day, I haven't heard from you  ♫

412
00:30:46,306 --> 00:30:50,533
♫  And I've been waiting too  ♫

413
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,540
Zhou Siyue!

414
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,240
It's so nice to see you.

415
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,300
You never picked up my calls or returned my messages.

416
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,250
I thought you wouldn't come out to see me.

417
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,260
I changed my number and I didn't tell you.

418
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,790
I just have something to say.

419
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,020
Tell me.

420
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,270
I like you.

421
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,680
Have you ever felt the same?

422
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,630
Ding Xian,

423
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,270
I have no plans for romantic relationships now.

424
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,030
It's getting late. You should go back.

425
00:32:18,985 --> 00:32:20,820
Focus on your studies

426
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,260
and don't come looking for me again.

427
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,300
We said that we were going to get into Huaqing together.

428
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,740
I tried so hard to keep up with you.

429
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,480
Now I have done it.

430
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,360
I just want to know if you ever had feelings for me.

431
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,340
Is the answer...

432
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,230
really important?

433
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:03,293
Ding Xian.

434
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,160
We all have our own lives.

435
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,760
So what?

436
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,600
Zhou Siyue.

437
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,730
Do you know my secret?

438
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,970
It's getting late. I'm going to leave now.

439
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,350

440
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,190
Hello.

441
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:51,520
I'd like to ask if the patient in bed 2, room 318 has paid up.

442
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,180
Just a second.

443
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,000
Bed 2, room 318. Right?

444
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,260
Yes.

445
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,610
Not yet.

446
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,400
Are you a family member?

447
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,780
You need to hurry.

448
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,400
This is not something that can be delayed.

449
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
All right.

450
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,870
 Hello?

451
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,860
 Siyue, where are you?

452
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,400
 Your dad is sick.

453
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:56,089
 What?

454
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,990
 I can't even protect my family now.

455
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,090
 How am I supposed to protect her?

456
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,870
Hello, Dad.

457
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,080
Our Xianxian has become someone now.

458
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,020
You are a student of a century-old renowned school.

459
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,370
Did you tour the campus yet?

460
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:44,010
I was too busy for the whole morning. I didn't get to tour around yet.

461
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,720
Just a second. Your mom wants to talk to you.

462
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,520
Xianxian, are you in your dormitory yet?

463
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,630
 Not yet. I will be there soon.

464
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,570
It's already late. What has kept you?

465
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,600
 You are always moving slowly.

466
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,620
I should have gone with you.

467
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,840
All right, Mom. I'll call you tonight.

468
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,150
I'm hanging up now.

469
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,200
 Don't forget to take photos.

470
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,400
I know, Mom.

471
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,190
Don't worry.

472
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,630
I was too late today.

473
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,430
I should be there earlier next time.

474
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,650
How is my grandfather?

475
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,700
I heard that the winner of the Computer Science Department is a senior from our department.

476
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,200
Who was it?

477
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,870
It is you.

478
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,670
We were talking about if you are the one who would join us.

479
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,740
Not bad. You've become popular right after school started.

480
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,640
Here. Sit.

481
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,410
It's okay. You can take a seat.

482
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,590
Just sit down. I'm standing here to lose weight.

483
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,940
So, my name is Lou Feng.

484
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,630
I'm Ding Xian.

485
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,840
Hello.

486
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,090
This is Ban Jiayu.

487
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:01,830
And this is Xu Shasha.

488
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,120
Didn't he drag you away?

489
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,520
I heard that the guy you are pursuing

490
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,190
is in the Computer Science Department.

491
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,660
And he's one of the most handsome guys on campus.

492
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,760
How come I've never heard of him?

493
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,470
Your information needs to be updated.

494
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,020
Let me give you some basic knowledge.

495
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,710
There are two characters in our department.

496
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,020
One is Dong Zhengfei, and the other one is your Zhou Siyue.

497
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,200
Really?

498
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,560
I've heard of Dong Zhengfei before school started.

499
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,820
But I have no memory of Zhou Siyue.

500
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,760
Let me finish.

501
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,520
The two of them are alike in some ways.

502
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,800
But they have opposite personalities.

503
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,760
One is enthusiastic like fire, and the other is as cold as ice.

504
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,950
You were talking about the robot...

505
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,150
The Robot Design Competition.

506
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,760
Tomorrow is the award ceremony of the competition.

507
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,570
I think the winner would be either Dong Zhengfei or Zhou Siyue.

508
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,270
You are so noisy.

509
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,820
She's always like that.

510
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,300
It's okay. I'll go with you.

511
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,270
Activate.

512
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,730
"The end of the world."

513
00:40:54,300 --> 00:41:03,200

514
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,230

515
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,260

516
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,320
 This autumn is cool and sunny.

517
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,360
 Students are rolling in from the whole nation.

518
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,000
 School is starting again.

519
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,320
 A lot of university freshmen

520
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,280
 have come to the campuses with their dreams.

521
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,460
 Our reporter will be following the students...

522
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,560
It's okay.

523
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,521
I'm fine.

524
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:54,940
 Everyone knows that Huaqing is a renowned school with a long history.

525
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,870
 And it's the sacred hall of knowledge for a lot of students.

526
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,190
 Among all the majors, computer science and math...

527
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,190
Here.

528
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,937
Have an apple.

529
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,780
Is everything going well...

530
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,070
at school?

531
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,880
Everything is fine.

532
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,090
Just focus on getting better.

533
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,560
That's great.

534
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,670
You don't have to be so tired.

535
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,060
Your education should always come first.

536
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,430
Don't keep coming here all the time.

537
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,230
I'm pretty tough.

538
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,205
There you are, Siyue.

539
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,840
You've been gone for a while.

540
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,520
Have you lost directions again?

541
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:49,160
Can you stop jinxing me?

542
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:52,220
Did you find the payment office successfully?

543
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,700
Of course!

544
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,800
What kind of person do you think I am?

545
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,000
I can handle things like this.

546
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,940
Don't worry too much

547
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,220
and focus on your education.

548
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,260
Secure the quota to study abroad sooner.

549
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,421
Old Ye has told us.

550
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,815
Your chance is big.

551
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,300
That won't be settled anytime soon.

552
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,340
We can talk about that after Dad has healed.

553
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,900
I'm heading back to school now.

554
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,470
Call me if you need anything.

555
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,160
Are you coming here tonight?

556
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,840
I have been busy recently.

557
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,590
I'll come back this weekend.

558
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,000
You are busy with school

559
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,950
and you are working several part-time jobs.

560
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,430
Don't forget to eat.

561
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,930
Don't worry.

562
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,860
I'm leaving now.

563
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,500
Siyue.

564
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,060
Have your meals on time.

565
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,160
Go.

566
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,460
The team that has won the Robot Design Competition 2012,

567
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,320
please send a representative to claim your rewards.

568
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,890
Please welcome Li Minghao

569
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,400
and Liu Zhenghui.

570
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,870
The team that won first place is from the Automation Department.

571
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,600
Their representative is...

572
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,060
Dong Zhengfei.

573
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,700
And please welcome Professor Ye to give them their award.

574
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:53,090
He's just a representative.

575
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,160
It's a team reward.

576
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,050
But look how proud he is of himself

577
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:58,030
like he's claiming a personal reward.

578
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:03,020
You sound so cynical.

579
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,980
If you didn't refuse to do that,

580
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,900
he would have nothing to do with this.

581
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:10,410
Come on, the ceremony is almost over.

582
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,230
Now I would like to announce that the competition has ended successfully.

583
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:19,540
Please leave the room in order.

584
00:45:23,879 --> 00:45:25,280
Please hold on a second.

585
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,660
I don't add strangers as my contacts.

586
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,390
No, you misunderstood me.

587
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:32,760
I just want to ask, are you in the same class as Zhou Siyue?

588
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,450
I'm looking for him.

589
00:45:36,883 --> 00:45:38,980
It's you.

590
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,700
Are you still looking for him all over the place?

591
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,160
We are from the same class.

592
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,860
But... we are not close.

593
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,840
Being classmates doesn't mean we are friends.

594
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,780
You are talking to the wrong person.

595
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:05,230

596
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,470
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

597
00:46:13,718 --> 00:46:17,030
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

598
00:46:18,927 --> 00:46:23,113
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

599
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:27,370
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

600
00:46:28,358 --> 00:46:34,220
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

601
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,558
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

602
00:46:38,814 --> 00:46:44,393
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

603
00:46:44,393 --> 00:46:47,570
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

604
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:51,540
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

605
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,533
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

606
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:59,330
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

607
00:46:59,346 --> 00:47:02,303
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

608
00:47:02,303 --> 00:47:04,880
♫  After a long journey  ♫

609
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,170
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

610
00:47:30,596 --> 00:47:33,536
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

611
00:47:33,536 --> 00:47:36,210
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

612
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:40,253
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

613
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:44,130
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

614
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,670
♫  After a long journey  ♫

615
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:50,773
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
