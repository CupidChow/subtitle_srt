00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:10,460

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,471
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:23,057
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:26,937
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:32,109
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,815
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:40,464
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:47,523
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,523 --> 00:00:55,919
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,919 --> 00:01:01,458
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,083
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,396
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:09,649
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:15,175
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,863
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:20,215
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:27,501
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:31,355

19
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:34,322

20
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,320

21
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,540
Jealous... Jealous.

22
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,930
Good morning.

23
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,870
Xianxian.

24
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,576
Dad.

25
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,760
Your mom said that you want a cell phone.

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,043
How about this?

27
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:12,658
You can use mine and I can use the feature phone.

28
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,080
It's okay, Dad.

29
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,560
I just want a cell phone to contact my classmates.

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,147
It's nothing serious.

31
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:23,240
I'll ask them to call our landline.

32
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,939
Okay. So...

33
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:29,590
Maybe when the time is right, get your classmates to hang out at our apartment,

34
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,313
so that you can bond with them.

35
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:34,310
Okay.

36
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,900
You didn't write this, did you?

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,570
The handwriting is pretty neat.

38
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,700
Zhou Siyue wrote that.

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,511
I fell asleep during the English class and he helped me with my notes.

40
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:54,900
You fell asleep again during class!

41
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,750
Siyue is a nice kid.

42
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,260
He helped you to switch seats and made notes for you.

43
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,143
He does look after you.

44
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,660
Dad.

45
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,077
How do you know about the seats?

46
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,630
Did you ask him to do all that?

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,960
No wonder I saw you talking to him the other day.

48
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,110
And he has been looking after me.

49
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,320
No, Xianxian.

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,440
I just don't want you to be bullied.

51
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,263
That's why I told Siyue that...

52
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:34,630
Dad!

53
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,960
Please don't do that again. I don't need you to do all those things.

54
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,550
I can take care of my own business.

55
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,830
Stay out of it.

56
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:48,360
Besides, I don't want someone else to do things he doesn't like because of me.

57
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,060
How is he doing something he doesn't like?

58
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,506
Dad and Siyue...

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,220
Good morning.

60
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,930
Morning.

61
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,940
Why are you all alone? Where is your deskmate?

62
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,150
I don't know.

63
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,540
Did you fall out?

64
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,540
No.

65
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,902
We were never close.

66
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,707
I'm going and memorize the text at the teacher's office.

67
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,270
Hey, you...

68
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,970
Did you piss your deskmate off?

69
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,550
She stood me up this morning.

70
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,160
I was almost late.

71
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,920
How could I have pissed her off?

72
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,420
Huh?

73
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:14,120
To the other friend, I like wine.  The older, the better.

74
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,620
You did well.

75
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,330
Clearly, you spent some effort. Keep up the good work.

76
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,720
Thank you, Miss.

77
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,640
Your deskmate is Zhou Siyue, right?

78
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,500
You should practice with him more.

79
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,030
He has a standard accent.

80
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,550
Don't feel shy.

81
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,417
It's common for classmates to help each other.

82
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,760
I've troubled him enough already.

83
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,560
All right, go back.

84
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,506
I merely took a sip of your coke! You are so...

85
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,350
Sorry, I...

86
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,180
I didn't mean that. Sorry.

87
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,777
Just clean it up when you get back to the classroom.

88
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:55,477
Sorry.

89
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,690
What's there to look at?

90
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,160
Let's go. Come on.

91
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,740
Sorry.

92
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,010
It's okay. I don't need it.

93
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,710
Keep it on.

94
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,210
You are not trying to get back to the classroom like that, are you?

95
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,810
Thank you.

96
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,150
Why didn't you wait for me this morning?

97
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,270
I know it all.

98
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,440
My dad asked you to take care of me, didn't he?

99
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,400
That's what that was about?

100
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,350
Sorry for your trouble.

101
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,940
If you don't want to help me, you can stop.

102
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,923
What's with the smile?

103
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:11,260
Never mind.

104
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,180
I don't think you would remember.

105
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,750
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,715
Tell me!

107
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,880
I actually owe you a favor.

108
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,850
When I was five, I went back to my grandpa's place.

109
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,487
There was a flood, so I stayed at your place.

110
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,390
 Hey. I want to use the toilet.

111
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,524
 It's just outside. You can go by yourself.

112
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,470
 You wet the bed. Shame on you!

113
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,390
 You don't have a toilet.

114
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,110
 I can't hold it anymore. That's why...

115
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,110
 It's right outside.

116
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,310
 I don't know how to use it.

117
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,110
 How could you not know how to use a toilet at your age?

118
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,730
 I'm telling my mom.

119
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,270
 Don't tell your mom.

120
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,860
 I'll take you to fun places when you visit the city.

121
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,413
You had such an awkward moment.

122
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,213
I can't believe you...

123
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,310
If you can tell the others about this, you will be dead.

124
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,280
So, where are you taking me?

125
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,350
What?

126
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,510
You promised!

127
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,670
You are taking advantage of the situation.

128
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,150
Hey.

129
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,140
How could you do that?

130
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,010
1:00 p.m, Saturday.

131
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,930
Wait for me in front of your building.

132
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,120
Did you leave to be thief last night?

133
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,590
I couldn't sleep.

134
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,910
You look pretty energetic to me.

135
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,950
Help Ding Juncong with math later.

136
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,010
I have plans this afternoon.

137
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,330
What plan could you have on a weekend?

138
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,900
I need to do the blackboard newspaper at school.

139
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,510
The school inspection is next week.

140
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,120
I thought you lost the election.

141
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,960
I'm just helping out.

142
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,670
Try not to do that next time.

143
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,960
Your effort will be in vain. And it's taking your time for learning.

144
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,940
Okay.

145
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,535
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

146
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,595
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

147
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,645
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

148
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:25,230
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

149
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,530
Checkmate!

150
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,500
- Withdraw! 
 - Don't! Don't do that.

151
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,850
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

152
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,763
Li.

153
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:35,303
- Zhou, you are here. 
 - Playing chess, are you?

154
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:43,140
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

155
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,400
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

156
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,900
Checkmate!

157
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:53,040
- Are you sure? 
 - Checkmate!

158
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,610
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

159
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,930
No withdrawing.

160
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,220
I'm sorry about this.

161
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,650
I didn't see it clearly.

162
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,230
Come on, Uncle. That's the fifth time!

163
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,690
Just one step!

164
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,670
Just one!

165
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,640
There you are.

166
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,030
Uncle, I have to go now.

167
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,030
You guys play.

168
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,260
Are you afraid to lose?

169
00:11:15,443 --> 00:11:16,980
What's with you today?

170
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,213
Uncle, let me.

171
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:19,540
What are you doing?

172
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,940
It's all your fault. You took so long.

173
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,540
Little snail.

174
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,400
Girls are all like that.

175
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,720
What's that smell?

176
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,920
Hm?

177
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Nothing.

178
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,070
Fried chicken wings.

179
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,910
- Thank you, owner. 
 - All right.

180
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,280
Let me pay for this.

181
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,440
I'm not used to letting a girl pay.

182
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,340
Sounds like you hang out with girls quite often.

183
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,840
How is that possible?

184
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,221
Just eat your food.

185
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,399
Are there any fun places in Shenhai?

186
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,199
Fun places?

187
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,880
The Science Museum.

188
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,790
And the Seaward Theater is also nice.

189
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:15,300
I know a bridge nearby with a really nice night view.

190
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,550
It used to be a fishing village.

191
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,126
As the economy has developed, this place has been booming.

192
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,150
Sometimes I feel like you are invincible.

193
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,270
You know everything, and there's nothing you can't do.

194
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,902
Compared with you, I'm more than enough.

195
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,440
And you have lost yourself over a compliment.

196
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,013
Ding Xian.

197
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,790
Actually, when you are not so stubborn, you can be...

198
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,960
Can be what?

199
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,754
You can be quite normal.

200
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,220
You are the one who's not normal!

201
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:05,463
All right.

202
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,470
If you have any place you want to go, just tell me in advance.

203
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,937
I will take you there when I'm free.

204
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,600
Okay.

205
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,900
Xianxian.

206
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,233
Senior!

207
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,710
What are you doing here?

208
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,910
I'm doing some shopping.

209
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,280
Is this your deskmate?

210
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,280
You are pretty close.

211
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:32,663
It's okay.

212
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,150
I think I've heard of him.

213
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,694
He's Zhou Siyue, right?

214
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:39,640
Yes. Do you know him?

215
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,710
He's the man of the hour. I heard a lot about him.

216
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,550
Right. You heard the CDs I gave you last time, right?

217
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,350
Yes, after listening, the teacher praised me.

218
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,623
Thank you, Senior.

219
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:50,000
No need to be polite with me.

220
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,407
I'll get you several more and ask Uncle Ding to bring them back.

221
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:53,670
Great.

222
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,670
Okay.

223
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,320
Go back to your meal.

224
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,930
Okay, Senior! See you.

225
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,030
See you.

226
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,670
Why did you eat all my fish balls?

227
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,740
You were having a pleasant conversation.

228
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,350
How could you be in the mood to eat?

229
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,000
But I didn't ask you to finish them all.

230
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,850
There's only one left.

231
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,590
I'm full.

232
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:35,002
Let's go to a movie this afternoon.

233
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,550
My treat.

234
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,150
All right.

235
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,500
What do you have in mind?

236
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,640
This one.

237
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,260
A Hollywood blockbuster.

238
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,790
"2012?"

239
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,640
Yes.

240
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,880
Okay. Wait for me.

241
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,380
I'll go get the tickets.

242
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,710
Sorry.

243
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,986
What are you doing?

244
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,980
Thank you.

245
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,900
Thank you.

246
00:15:35,303 --> 00:15:36,590
What's this?

247
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,040
3D glasses.

248
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,870
Have you never seen these before?

249
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,790
I have.

250
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,861
Of course.

251
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,550
Let's go.

252
00:15:59,613 --> 00:16:00,613
 Sorry.

253
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,240
Sorry.

254
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:28,960
This row.

255
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,813
Siyue!

256
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:35,113
Ding Xian.

257
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,710
Are you a little sad?

258
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,400
Why would I be sad?

259
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,760
You should be sad.

260
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,900
Idiot!

261
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,317
I have returned the favor.

262
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,830
We are clear.

263
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,200
I won't need your help anymore.

264
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Really?

265
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,680
The final exam is coming.

266
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,632
I wonder if someone will have questions for me.

267
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,070
Don't worry, that won't be me.

268
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,964
Ding Xian!

269
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,517
The class adviser!

270
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:59,280
Ding Xian! Why are you running?

271
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,470
Ding Xian, stop running.

272
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:11,787
Hello?

273
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:13,590
 Hello, sir. Are you buying an apartment?

274
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,640
No.

275
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,350
 It doesn't hurt to hear about it.

276
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,780
 Buying an apartment with a loan is a great choice right now.

277
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,520
I'm not getting a loan, either.

278
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,180
 Sir, even if you don't want an apartment, you can check the loans.

279
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,400
Why would I get a loan if I'm not buying an apartment?

280
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,160
Is he gone?

281
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,650
I have a place to stay.

282
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,130
And I don't need...

283
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,180
No, I do need money.

284
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,920
About your interest, let me tell you.

285
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,350
What's your interest rate?

286
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:45,310
 You call that a low-interest rate?

287
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,800
 Listen!  You can't fool me.

288
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,800
 Do you know what I do for a living?

289
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,160
 I'm a teacher. I teach math. This is nothing...

290
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:00,912
 Keep talking.

291
00:19:01,823 --> 00:19:03,023
This is not right.

292
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,900
Just a second. Don't hang up. Just a second.

293
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,744
Hello?

294
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:15,650
 Let's do it this way. Tell me how did you get the interest?

295
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:22,080
So, what do you think

296
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,320
the end of the world in 2012 would be like?

297
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,560
I think it would be like in the movie.

298
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,430
Earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and so on.

299
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,400
I don't think so.

300
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,430
If humanity...

301
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,110
is really facing distinction,

302
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,760
then there should be fireworks all over the sky.

303
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,830
To welcome death with the last bit of beauty.

304
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,430
Can you think of something good?

305
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,822
For example, what are we doing in 2012?

306
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,890
I might be...

307
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,190
watching West Lake in Hangzhou.

308
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,830
Hangzhou, again!

309
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,950
How about you?

310
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,960
I would be in Huaqing, doing experiments.

311
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,840
You want to get into Huaqing.

312
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:22,366
That makes sense.

313
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:25,830
You have such a good performance, you will get in.

314
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,990
And what about you?

315
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,760
Don't you want to see some better scenery?

316
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
I...

317
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,720
I can't do that.

318
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,210
A bigger goal...

319
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:50,608
will make a worthier challenge.

320
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,870
Besides,

321
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,270
I haven't seen many people who work harder than you do.

322
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,730
Trust yourself. You can do it.

323
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,540
I'll tell you a saying.

324
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,750
"There is still glory on the other side."

325
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,580
Nice shot!

326
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,130
I'll be back soon. You guys play.

327
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,230
There you are.

328
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,453
Nice work, Song.

329
00:22:41,453 --> 00:22:43,453
I'm so tired.

330
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,430
Siyue, will you bring Little Monster to our New Year's Eve party?

331
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,900
Little Monster?

332
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,180
I thought you all find her annoying.

333
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,800
Why do you want to spend New Year's Eve with her?

334
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,780
We had some misunderstandings.

335
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,550
Later we found that she's a little stubborn, but she's quite a fun person.

336
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,430
How about you, Jiang Chen?

337
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,780
Do you want to join us for New Year's Eve?

338
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,213
You should have told me sooner.

339
00:23:05,213 --> 00:23:07,513
I have an appointment with someone else.

340
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:11,380
It seems that you made some new friends in high school and forgot all about your sworn brothers.

341
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,950
We invited him to play basketball, and look how he's dressed.

342
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,590
I'm quite busy. It's hard for me to visit you.

343
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,527
- Just great. 
 - Who are you trying to fool here?

344
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:20,960
- Come on, let's go. Let's play. 
 - Just go.

345
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,096
Forget about him. Come on.

346
00:23:23,096 --> 00:23:25,096
Have a good game!

347
00:23:25,096 --> 00:23:27,729
What did Little Monster write on your card?

348
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:28,830
What card?

349
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:32,780
The festival card she made. Shadi and I both got one. Didn't you get one?

350
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,283
I'm heading to school now, Mom.

351
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,593
Siyue, just a second.

352
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:46,880
Wanxian told me that she has been making Xianxian Chinese medicine to make her more energetic.

353
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,090
You work so hard.

354
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,970
Let me do the same for you.

355
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,640
I'll pass.

356
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,760
Wanxian said that the medicine is really bitter.

357
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,900
But it's effective.

358
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,100
I've seen Xianxian taking it every day.

359
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,060
Really?

360
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,910
Good morning.

361
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,420
Morning.

362
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,800
Did your mom make you Chinese medicine again?

363
00:24:20,673 --> 00:24:23,793
My mom said that it's winter.

364
00:24:23,793 --> 00:24:26,600
I need more energy.

365
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,580
You are so weak that you look sleepy during classes all the time.

366
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,310
You should get more energy.

367
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,940
I'm not weak!

368
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,070
Just drink it.

369
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,160
Is it really that bitter?

370
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,674
It's really bitter.

371
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,580
It's candy.

372
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,970
The bitterness is gone, right?

373
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,137
It's blueberry flavor.

374
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,451
I thought you don't like candy.

375
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,610
Let's get to the classroom.

376
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,250
Aren't you coming?

377
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:32,040
Song Ziqi needs to pick something up from me.

378
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,176
You should go.

379
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:48,830
Let's spend the holiday together tonight.

380
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,090
You know that I'm not interested in festivals.

381
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,250
Can you not be the exception every time?

382
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,110
You leave earlier every year.

383
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,140
Can't we spend New Year's Eve together once?

384
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,180
Students, it's time for morning class.

385
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,490
Turn to Page 6 of the English text book.

386
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,380
Read the text from yesterday together.

387
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,830
Where's my stuff?

388
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,414
I know it all.

389
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:34,480
Kong Shadi and Song Ziqi have received your holiday card.

390
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,160
It's almost New Year, and I haven't received mine as your deskmate.

391
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,370
I thought you didn't like festivals.

392
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:45,440
I did say that, but I didn't say I don't like gifts.

393
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,229
Everyone except me has got one.

394
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,538
Zhou Siyue! Ding Xian!

395
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:55,410
Stand outside the classroom.

396
00:27:24,762 --> 00:27:27,170
I never said that I didn't prepare one for you.

397
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,940
I drew this myself.

398
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,420
The original one was ruined by my brother, so I got you this one.

399
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,700
It arrived a little late.

400
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:40,949
Don't look at it now. Check it when you get home.

401
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,700
It's not bad.

402
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:03,420
You didn't go out with us the other day, and you are not learning at home.

403
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,480
With the time you spent on this card, you could have raised your math score by 20.

404
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,600
You should know when to take a win. Give it back if you don't want it.

405
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,902
Give it back!

406
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:14,350
You two!

407
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,400
Come to my office now.

408
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,539
Copying the text 10 times! That's cruel!

409
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,741
It's 15 times!

410
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:32,460
Aunt Liu saw you getting lectured. He added 5 times on top.

411
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,280
You two are so unlucky that you hit the tiger's belly.

412
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,640
He's going through menopause.

413
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,160
You should be thankful that he didn't put in an extra set of exercises at the end of this month.

414
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,510
Xianxian, are you free on New Year's Day?

415
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,310
Let's hang out.

416
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,520
I'll think about it.

417
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,560
I don't even know how I did on the math test last time.

418
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,880
You missed it the last time.

419
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,210
You have no idea how miserable I was.

420
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,190
It's not fun at all to hang out with the two of them.

421
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,680
How about this?

422
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,210
If I can do well on the math test this afternoon, I'll join you.

423
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,210
Really? It's a deal.

424
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,210
I hope you can do great on the math test this afternoon.

425
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,664
Here, take another bite.

426
00:29:14,664 --> 00:29:16,860
You need the energy to keep writing.

427
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,256
With her blessing, you will be ruined on the math test.

428
00:29:21,256 --> 00:29:22,760
Shut up!

429
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,940
What?

430
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,160
You said that we were not fun to hang out with.

431
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,130
Like we want to take you out. Am I right, Siyue?

432
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,950
This is not Shadi's fault.

433
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,890
You are quite boring.

434
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,870
That hurt my feelings deeply.

435
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,686
If you don't want your feelings to get hurt, why did you eat so much of my lunch?

436
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,420
Sorry, it's...

437
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:50,110
I didn't want you to be tired, so I wanted to share your burden.

438
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,160
That's sweet of you.

439
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,940
Since you are so sweet, why don't you help me out a little?

440
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,080
I'm a little hungry.

441
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:02,390
I mean, the handwriting will be different.

442
00:30:03,162 --> 00:30:05,177
You ate all the meat!

443
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:07,357
I'll do it.

444
00:30:09,665 --> 00:30:12,555
Don't say that my handwriting is ugly later.

445
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,610
Here, Deng Wanwan.

446
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,010
Send out the test papers.

447
00:30:29,449 --> 00:30:32,819
Xianxian, how did you do?

448
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,130

449
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:37,430
Don't even ask.

450
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,110
The answer is that I can't go out.

451
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,633
You are making progress.

452
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,633
Let me see.

453
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,790
You scored twice as she has.

454
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,640
Enough.

455
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,310
Stop chatting.

456
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,190
Look at your scores.

457
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,040
How can you be in the mood to chat right now?

458
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,600
Aren't you worried?

459
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,680
The holiday is coming and you have all lost your focus.

460
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:14,706
Being late, sleeping, and chatting during classes.

461
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,990
You just make me proud.

462
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,726
Some of you haven't learned much over the semester

463
00:31:21,726 --> 00:31:24,590
but got familiar with the others sitting around.

464
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,900
They just keep talking all the time.

465
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:34,130
We are rearranging the seats according to the final test result.

466
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,960
I'll see who you are going to chat with by then.

467
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,152
Get back to your seats!

468
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,680
No one leaves before I say the class is over.

469
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,820
Find your papers!

470
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,590
What are you sighing for?

471
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,330
Do I owe you anything or what?

472
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,081
Check the second to the last question on the test paper.

473
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,100
Question 17.

474
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,870
That's a question of 10 points.

475
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,290
We are switching seats next semester.

476
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:11,529
Where are you going to find a deskmate as nice as me?

477
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,010
Stop flattering yourself.

478
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:23,500
Are you really going to stay home studying during the holiday?

479
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,530
 He said that you were making progress.

480
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,760
This is nothing.

481
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,540
I only passed two people.

482
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,210
Ranks and scores are not the same.

483
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,710
No one can progress overnight.

484
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,540
You've been stressed all the time.

485
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,840
You should relax a little.

486
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,300
Besides, you said that passing one person is enough.

487
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,610
Have you changed your mind?

488
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,830
The final exam is right behind the holiday.

489
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,863
I hope the next semester...

490
00:33:01,943 --> 00:33:03,743
What?

491
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,010
I hope the next semester can be easier.

492
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,040
I have had a hard time keeping up already.

493
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,070
 From the first year to the third is just a blink of an eye.

494
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,760
Easier.

495
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,830
Okay.

496
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,160
But I have to tell you, this is just the first year.

497
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,700
It will only get harder.

498
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,840
Don't say that I never reminded you.

499
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,830
I'm going to say this again.

500
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,480
NCEE...

501
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,050
 is a competition with countless contestants and few winners.

502
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,310
Fine.

503
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,760
You remembered that.

504
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,995
But... don't just pretend that you are working hard.

505
00:33:42,995 --> 00:33:46,130
The result will reveal the truth.

506
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,400
Enough of that.

507
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,040
The New Year's Day holiday is just three days long.

508
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,520
Don't spend it on slacking off.

509
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,560
When you come back from the holiday, whoever makes the same mistakes

510
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,280
will copy the question 10 times.

511
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,560
Do you understand?

512
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,880
 Yes.

513
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,800
Go home.

514
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,370
 School is over!

515
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,000
Let's go.

516
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:12,917
Come on, let's go.

517
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,500

518
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,390
 We are rearranging the seats according to the final test result.

519
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,070
 I'll see who you are going to chat with by then.

520
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,320
 Work hard if you don't want another deskmate.

521
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,510
Look. Those two young people look good together.

522
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:11,610
Xianxian hasn't left her room for the whole day.

523
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,841
Is she all right?

524
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:14,530
I'll go check on her.

525
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,690
The others would want their children to spend more time learning.

526
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,130
And you keep visiting her room.

527
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,230
You will delay her process.

528
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,270
She needs rest.

529
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,953
And it's a festival.

530
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:26,150
Don't keep worrying for no reason.

531
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,080
She will come out if she's tired.

532
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,560
Forget about it.

533
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,150
Here. Have some fruit.

534
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,840
Mom, I want to go play with the fireworks.

535
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,150
No.

536
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,000
- I don't care! I want to go! 
 - Lower your voice!

537
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,020
- I want to go! I want to play with the fireworks. 
 - Stop yelling!

538
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,420
All right! All right! Fine!

539
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,070
Our child wants to go play. Just take him out.

540
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,470
People say that it's more festive outside.

541
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,280
We can go together.

542
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,230
Xianxian can take a walk with us.

543
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,700
Wait here. I'll go get your sister.

544
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,249
Great.

545
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:53,919
All you care about is playing.

546
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:57,119
Xianxian!

547
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,120
- All right. 
 - Take a picture!

548
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,360
It will be out soon.

549
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,860
Hurry up!

550
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,360
How do I look?

551
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,390
Nice.

552
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,870
Really?

553
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,670
Lower.

554
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,120
Like this.

555
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,470
Wait. Check the camera and see how I look!

556
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,230
Okay. I looked. You look nice.

557
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,800
- Really? 
 - Yes.

558
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,050
Are my legs in the picture?

559
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,390
Okay.

560
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,230
Come on, the fireworks will be gone.

561
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,430
Okay. I got it. Look.

562
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,390
What is that?

563
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,900
You asked me to squat down for the picture.

564
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,540
Where is my face?

565
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,030
What should we do?

566
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,453
The firework is almost out.

567
00:36:55,453 --> 00:36:56,973
Get me a new one.

568
00:36:56,973 --> 00:36:58,363
Okay. I'll go get you some.

569
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:00,950
They are all yours.

570
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,990
You should practice first.

571
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,460
All my money is gone again.

572
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,930
You spoiled her.

573
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,950
What can I do?

574
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,670
We grew up together.

575
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,610
Everyone will know if she makes a scene.

576
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,040
I have to make her happy.

577
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,220
Do you know Pavlov's dog?

578
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,730
That's me.

579
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,870
I don't know if there's a conditioned reflex,

580
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,030
but you do look like a dog.

581
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,910
I'll bite you!

582
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:36,020
Right, the New Year countdown is beginning.

583
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,980
Let's go watch the fireworks.

584
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,560
You are not in the mood?

585
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,560
What's wrong?

586
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,651
We don't have enough people.

587
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,370
I keep feeling something is missing.

588
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:52,870
You want to ask Little Monster to come out, don't you?

589
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,840
Master Zhou, I didn't notice this before.

590
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,040
You are worried that she will feel lonely staying home by herself, right?

591
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,343
How is that possible?

592
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,343
Then who do you want to see right now? Tell me.

593
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,660
I want Ding Xian here for your sake.

594
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,902
Why?

595
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:07,763
Think about it.

596
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:10,610
If she's here, Kong Shadi will be happy.

597
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:14,410
They can hang out together, and you will be relieved.

598
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,392
And the two of us...

599
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,320
Master Zhou, nice move!

600
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,484
That's right.

601
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:24,660
Song Ziqi, look!

602
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,238
I got two different ones.

603
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,600
They look nice.

604
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,470
The other kids will envy you.

605
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,507
Let's go.

606
00:38:31,507 --> 00:38:32,600
Come on!

607
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,390
Where are we going?

608
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,510
I'll find you someone who can take pictures. Let's go.

609
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,230
 Xianxian,

610
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,910
 we are taking Juncong to watch the fireworks.

611
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,670
 There are cut-up fruits in the kitchen.

612
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,800
 Take things easy.

613
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,520
 If you want to join us, call me and your mom.

614
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,430
 I want to watch the fireworks with the others.

615
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,470
 Little Monster!

616
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,949
 Ding Xian!

617
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,280
 Ding Xian!

618
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,840
 Little Monster!

619
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,140
Come out!

620
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,600
Hi!

621
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,190
What are you doing here?

622
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,600
The two of them say that

623
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,470
they don't want to watch if you are not there.

624
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,390
Don't blame that on me!

625
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,370
Come on! Get down here!

626
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,430
What do you say? It's almost midnight.

627
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,099
We will catch a cold if you don't come down.

628
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:52,599
I'm coming!

629
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,540
We won't get there in time.

630
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,270
We won't get to watch the fireworks today.

631
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:27,110
You would have been better off if you hadn't come to get me.

632
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,770
Hey.

633
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:31,290
It's okay. The streets are severely jammed.

634
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,230
We can find another place.

635
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,280
But at this point, I don't think we will get there in time.

636
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:41,040
You guys get off. I have an idea.

637
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:45,470
Here, sir. Keep the change.

638
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,670
I know a place.

639
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,340
We can get there in time.

640
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,613
Come on!

641
00:40:57,613 --> 00:40:59,113
Let's go.

642
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:03,880
♫  It's okay, because you are everything I can see  ♫

643
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:10,230
♫  It's okay, to be the reason that I let you leave  ♫

644
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,670
♫  It's okay, because you are everything I believe  ♫

645
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:24,730
♫  Can't let this moment end, because it's about a dream and me  ♫

646
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,300
Sorry.

647
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,660
It's okay.

648
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,326
It's fine. The city center is jammed anyway.

649
00:42:10,326 --> 00:42:12,696
And we did see it.

650
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,280
Hey. Look!

651
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,537
Oh, my god! Look! Fireworks!

652
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,800
Fireworks!

653
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,900
Impressive!

654
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,430
Happy New Year!

655
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,616
Happy New Year!

656
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:46,660
♫  It's okay, because you are everything I can see  ♫

657
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:51,190
♫  It's okay, to be the reason that I let you leave  ♫

658
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:59,427
Happy New Year!

659
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:05,460
♫  Can't let this moment end, because it's about a dream and me  ♫

660
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:22,560

661
00:43:24,676 --> 00:43:29,866
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

662
00:43:29,866 --> 00:43:33,826
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

663
00:43:35,123 --> 00:43:39,409
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

664
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:43,466
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

665
00:43:44,554 --> 00:43:50,416
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

666
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:54,054
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

667
00:43:55,010 --> 00:44:00,789
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

668
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:05,166
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

669
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:08,036
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

670
00:44:08,036 --> 00:44:10,729
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

671
00:44:10,729 --> 00:44:14,626
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

672
00:44:15,842 --> 00:44:18,499
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

673
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:20,976
♫  After a long journey  ♫

674
00:44:20,976 --> 00:44:25,766
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

675
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,732
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

676
00:44:49,732 --> 00:44:52,406
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

677
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:56,749
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

678
00:44:57,512 --> 00:45:00,326
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

679
00:45:00,326 --> 00:45:02,866
♫  After a long journey  ♫

680
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:07,569
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
