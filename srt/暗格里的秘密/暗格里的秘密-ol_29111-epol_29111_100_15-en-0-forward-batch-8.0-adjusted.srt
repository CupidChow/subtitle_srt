1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,600

2
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,594
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:31,080
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,960
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,232
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:44,838
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:48,387
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:55,446
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:55,446 --> 00:01:03,242
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,470
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,206
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,319
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,572
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:23,098
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,886
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,238
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:35,532
 ♫ All comes down to a simple thank you ♫

18
00:01:35,532 --> 00:01:39,418

19
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:42,266

20
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,190
Senior Brother,

21
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,910
I'm so tired.

22
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,380
I'm really tired.

23
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,800
I chose to repeat the third year myself.

24
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,380
I don't get to complain about it.

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:10,210
I can't stop no matter how hard or tired I am.

26
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm afraid, too.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,920
I don't know if starting over is the right choice.

28
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,420
Xianxian,

29
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,970
you are already quite excellent compared with your peers.

30
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,470
That's not enough.

31
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:35,050
I'm so far away from the life I want

32
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,780
and the person I want to follow.

33
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,530
You are talking about Zhou Siyue, right?

34
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,310
Zhou Siyue is really outstanding.

35
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,450
I used to think that we were about the same.

36
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,730
I thought if I worked hard, I would be able to follow him.

37
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,830
But he's too good.

38
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,040
I just realized that the gap between us is huge.

39
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,190
No matter how much I like him,

40
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,620
I can't stand the fact that I'm not good enough for him.

41
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,390
I'm worried that people will ask...

42
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,420
why Zhou Siyue would be with someone like me one day.

43
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,910
That won't happen.

44
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,560
At least I wouldn't ask that question.

45
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,740
If I were you, I wouldn't be affected by fear

46
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,660
if I want to do something.

47
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,800
Not seeking results...

48
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,270
is the best answer.

49
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,390
Drink some milk and rest.

50
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,000
Thanks, Mom.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,070
It's almost midnight. Don't stay up too late.

52
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,160
Mom.

53
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,940
Don't worry.

54
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,030
I will sleep early today.

55
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,280
 Zhou Siyue.

56
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,810
 I miss you so much.

57
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,390
 I'm so tired.

58
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,970
 I'm really tired.

59
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,290
 School is starting today, right?

60
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,860
 Congratulations on becoming a student of Huaqing officially.

61
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,030
 Sorry.

62
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,700
 I've made your life hard for so long.

63
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,420
 Thank you.

64
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,340
Hey, there.

65
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,460
Do you know the way to the Automation Department?

66
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,340
- No.
 - Which department are you in?

67
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,820
- I'm also in the Automation Department.
 - Really?

68
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,400
Hello, I'm Yuan Fang.

69
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm Zhou Siyue.

70
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,780

71
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,480
Guys.

72
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,100
This is the first class after school has started.

73
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,460
I want you to read these eight characters and remember them by heart.

74
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,730
Remember our responsibilities and mission.

75
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,100
How could you make a mistake on such an easy question?

76
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,110
I made just that one mistake. You are asking too much from me.

77
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,950
You made a mistake, and you are the justified side.

78
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,196
Silly.

79
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,160
 What were you thinking?

80
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,980
 If I did all the right things,

81
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,960
 then I would be the one who scored 90.

82
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,277
 You are looking for excuses when you made mistakes.

83
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,290

84
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,100
- Professor Ye. Hello.
 - Hello.

85
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,380
I'm Dong Zhengfei.

86
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,480
I have an idea about the selection for the scientific research group.

87
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,500
I would like to design a website about it.

88
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,420
Maybe you could check it out when you are free.

89
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,550
Kid, ambition is a good thing.

90
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,910
As for the rest, let's see in the election.

91
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,100
Go back now.

92
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,780
I understand, Professor Ye.

93
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,510
Siyue, I was looking for you.

94
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,200
Professor Ye.

95
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,580
You can skip the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class this semester.

96
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,060
I've seen your homework.

97
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,600
It has exceeded my expectation.

98
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,640
So during this time, I want you to concentrate on preparing for my laboratory assessment.

99
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,200
Okay. Got it.

100
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,390
How's your father doing?

101
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,860
He's still busy with the investigation.

102
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,650
But I believe that the truth will come out soon.

103
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,130
All right. Don't worry too much.

104
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,540
Focus on your education.

105
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,100
You have potential.

106
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,000
Thank you, Professor Ye.

107
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,830
 Zhou Siyue, have you been busy?

108
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:35,225
In the medical area, humanoid robots are used to transplant artificial limbs or organs.

109
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:38,900
With the humanoid robot technique, we are be able to produce powered artificial limbs

110
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,440
and help paralyzed patients to walk again.

111
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,650
We have such a handsome guy in our year.

112
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:52,060
He's in Class One. It is said that he was recommended by Shenhai. He's good.

113
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,500
That's why we need to further study and explore that aspect.

114
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,780
Just wait and see.

115
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,340
He will be mine.

116
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,660
Thank you, everyone.

117
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,220
- Here you go again.
  - Great.

118
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,400
Thank you.

119
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,040
 Good.

120
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,253
Not bad.

121
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:09,993
A lot of people are cheering for you.

122
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,250
 Go see him if you want.

123
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,830
He doesn't even respond to my messages often.

124
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,800
He must be busy.

125
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,350
How busy can he be?

126
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,610
We are all university students.

127
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,065
Never mind.

128
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,220
It's not like I have that kind of time.

129
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,100
Don't you have some days off on National Day?

130
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,660
 I do, but...

131
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,880
Why are you hesitating?

132
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,832
 Didn't you always want to see what Huaqing was like?

133
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:48,050
 You could surprise Zhou Siyue in the meantime.

134
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,490
Surprise...

135
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,799

136
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,150
 Where is the Automation Department?

137
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,020
Hello.

138
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,420
- Hello.
 - I'm Xing Lufei.

139
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,220
I'm from Computer Science Department, Class 5.

140
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,400
Can we get to know each other?

141
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,780
Here's the thing. I saw you at the election for the research group.

142
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,450
I think you are pretty amazing.

143
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,710
I have several questions for you related to the course.

144
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,860
I'm sorry.

145
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm a little occupied today.

146
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,520
This is our lab.

147
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,300
This lab is one of the best

148
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,500
regarding both equipment and technology.

149
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,530
A lab like this is rare nationwide.

150
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,330
Hey, Siyue.

151
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,180
Look at this machine.

152
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,470
Sorry, Professor Ye.

153
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,870
I went to the wrong place.

154
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,710
The new members are all here today.

155
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,900
Siyue,

156
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,340
as a group leader of our department,

157
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,290
you will be contacting your seniors.

158
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,640
The others can take a tour now.

159
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,200
 All right. Thank you, Professor.

160
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,340
 Oh, Professor.

161
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,510
 I'm a member of the intern team now.

162
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,160
- Hello.
 - The information about the progress of this lab

163
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,550
is on the computer.

164
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,130
These are related topics.

165
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,630
Have a look.

166
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,610
Are all the good students so rude?

167
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,100
Why are you still here?

168
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,410
I'm curious about the world of geniuses like you.

169
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,520
To be honest, you are really good.

170
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,520
I think freshmen are lucky enough to program or something.

171
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,281
I'm surprised that you are starting to learn how to build robots now.

172
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,610
What does this do?

173
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,660
Classmate, don't touch things in the lab.

174
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,810
Siyue, congratulations.

175
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,860
You've become the group leader of the freshmen.

176
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,410
The topic you picked in the election was good.

177
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,690
Thank you.

178
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,340
We should communicate more when we have the chance.

179
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,740
Great.

180
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,110
Look. This is the online forum of our school.

181
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,860
Yeah! How could something like that have happened?

182
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,230
Isn't that his son?

183
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,530
That's him.

184
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,310
A professor of the Art Department of Huaqing is suspected of academic fraud.

185
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,750
The son of a professor.

186
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,400
He got in by connections. What are these?

187
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,550
 Yeah!

188
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:16,329
 That's him.

189
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:19,350
What's wrong? Are you all right?

190
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,110
 I hope not.

191
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,680
A dirty trick like controlling the host to send a message like that.

192
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,240
It seems that you are worried that I can't find out it's you.

193
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:41,900
This is a misunderstanding. You've made a mistake.

194
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,520
I just sent a test to the cell phone

195
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,770
that's controlling the host by the internet.

196
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,400
 It's him!

197
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,600
 He did that.

198
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,480
Zhou Siyue,

199
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,080
everyone knows that your father committed academic fraud.

200
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,030
Don't try to get him out of this by just talking.

201
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,200
I also hope you don't go astray like your father.

202
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,470
Are you done?

203
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Yes.

204
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,860
What can you do?

205
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,260
Sue me?

206
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,280
 Stop it!

207
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,680
 Let this go.

208
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,760
 Let's just talk things out.

209
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,650
 Yeah. Say what you want.

210
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,470
Are you okay?

211
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,410
I've twisted my ankle.

212
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:39,290
I'm injured because of you.

213
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,000
Can't you help me to the infirmary?

214
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:44,470
♫   That him, this him, I hear the rain go drip-drop   ♫

215
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,070
Let's go.

216
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,040
My ankle hurts a lot.

217
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:56,022
♫  Hide in my room on a cloudy day  ♫

218
00:16:56,022 --> 00:17:03,922
♫  Slouch in the chair, messy hair, miss him  ♫

219
00:17:05,427 --> 00:17:09,224
♫  The dream he loves warms my heart  ♫

220
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:12,994
♫  Like clouds glide softly in the sky  ♫

221
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:17,881
♫  All lovely things come together  ♫

222
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:20,469
♫  How I wish I could be a part of it  ♫

223
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,470
♫  The dream he loves sparkles like a star  ♫

224
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,420
 Zhou Siyue.

225
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,090
 I'm going to focus on my studies this year.

226
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,610
 Maybe we should stop contacting each other.

227
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:38,920
♫  He's the only one who stays in the dream  ♫

228
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,380
 Maybe the moment I decided to repeat the third year,

229
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,650
 my path had been separated from Zhou Siyue's.

230
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,780
 I've said goodbye to everyone,

231
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,900
 and have been walking on a road that gradually drifts away.

232
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,100
 I thought I could turn everything back,

233
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,790
 but I forgot...

234
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,160
 that maybe you have started a new life.

235
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,170
♫  Miss you on busy days  ♫

236
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,410

237
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:56,606

238
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:08,370
♫  The distance between us makes me miss you even more  ♫

239
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:15,770
♫  I'm doing well. No need to worry  ♫

240
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:20,407
♫  Where's the furthest happiness?  ♫

241
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:24,142
♫  How many days and nights do I have to wait?  ♫

242
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:31,270
♫  Hands are held tight. Can you feel it?  ♫

243
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,016
♫  How close am I to the furthest happiness?  ♫

244
00:19:35,016 --> 00:19:39,236
♫  It may take a lifetime to reach it  ♫

245
00:19:39,236 --> 00:19:45,459
♫  Your name has long been engraved in my heart  ♫

246
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,350
 The day of December 21st, 2012 is coming.

247
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,750
 That's the end of the world estimated by the Mayans.

248
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,580
 If we all cease to exist in this world one day,

249
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,010
 who would you prefer to have by your side?

250
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:13,230
 What do you think the end of the world in 2012 would be like?

251
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,890
 I think it would be like in the movie.

252
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:22,190
 Earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and so on.

253
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,280
 It's December 21st now.

254
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,610
 Who is by your side?

255
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,160
 If humanity is really facing destruction,

256
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,250
 then there should be fireworks all over the sky.

257
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,560
 To welcome death with the last bit of beauty.

258
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:07,886
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

259
00:21:07,886 --> 00:21:09,880
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

260
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,382
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

261
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:15,297
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

262
00:21:15,297 --> 00:21:20,623
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

263
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:25,911
♫  The secret of the answer is an insoluble question   ♫

264
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:34,763
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

265
00:21:46,302 --> 00:21:51,612
♫  For whom will the fall gives up on its journey  ♫

266
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:56,262
♫  The rustle of leaves cheers me up  ♫

267
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:59,855
♫  I wonder what kinda scenery awaits us  ♫

268
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:05,029
♫  For whom will the stage turn its lights off  ♫

269
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:09,931
♫  The sparkling bubbles are crystal clear  ♫

270
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:13,564
♫  I wonder if perfection is only an illusion  ♫

271
00:22:13,564 --> 00:22:21,030
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks faded  ♫

272
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,600
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

273
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,280
 The fireworks of the end of the world are gone.

274
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,780
 But on the night before the disaster that was supposed to happen,

275
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,130
 it brought me new hope.

276
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,140
 If tomorrow is the end of the world,

277
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,970
 you will be the person...

278
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,510
 I want by my side.

279
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,260
 Zhou Siyue.

280
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,310
 Wait for me at Huaqing.

281
00:22:53,370 --> 00:23:00,119
 ♫ All comes down to a simple thank you ♫

282
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:04,812

283
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,570

284
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,430
Zhou Siyue!

285
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,580
Sorry.

286
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm going to join Dong Zhengfei's research team.

287
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,780
All right. Break a leg.

288
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,180
Boss,

289
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,300
are you really letting her go?

290
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,320
Yeah.

291
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,420
Dong Zhengfei has been poaching talents from us for weeks now.

292
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,610
Don't you know this?

293
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,640
Our topic is the humanoid robot.

294
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,280
It is a risky topic.

295
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,310
If she thinks the topic is too hard for her to keep up with,

296
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,670
you can't make me cut off her backup plan. Right?

297
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,370
She has always been at the bottom.

298
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,800
No other team wanted her other than us.

299
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,040
Now that she has learned a lot,

300
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,690
she's ditching us in the middle of the course.

301
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,560
Where are we going to find someone to design the drive?

302
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,870
Don't worry. We will find someone.

303
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,430
With your popularity,

304
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,970
I don't think so.

305
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,570
You have no idea.

306
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,200
You were all by yourself at the beginning

307
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,760
and you weren't talking to people.

308
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,580
People don't know what's going on with you.

309
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,940
They thought you were too arrogant to talk to them.

310
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,060
I'm the only one who wants to stay.

311
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,370
Yeah.

312
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,800
I should thank you for sticking with me.

313
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,800
That's not necessary. We need to figure out how to recruit people.

314
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,110
Don't worry.

315
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,200
We can always spend some time doing it ourselves.

316
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,830
You are sleeping just five hours a day.

317
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,610
Are you trying to kill yourself?

318
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,330
If you know I'm tired,

319
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,450
why aren't you working right now?

320
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,540
Boss, here's the thing.

321
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,710
I've spent two whole days in this lab.

322
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,460
I'm expecting to have this afternoon off.

323
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,970
There are so many new girls out there.

324
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,250
I will regret it so much if I even miss one.

325
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,820
You are talking about girls every day.

326
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,317
Go.

327
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:31,917
Thank you, Boss.

328
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,700
See you around.

329
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,390

330
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:10,090
 I don't have Zhou Siyue's new number. Did you find him?

331
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,800
Forget about Zhou Siyue,

332
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,320
I don't even know where I am.

333
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,960
Are they all that hopeless?

334
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,760
It hasn't been long,

335
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,880
and all of them are gone.

336
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,240
There's one over there.

337
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,850
I'll let you have her.

338
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,380
You are very kind.

339
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,040
Just a second.

340
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,610
Do you know what to say?

341
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,010
No.

342
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,740
Hey, there. Come here.

343
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,120
Buddy, thank you.

344
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:06,300
You need to be enthusiastic.

345
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,210
Send the girl and her luggage to her dormitory so that no one will step in.

346
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,680
I have nothing but gratitude for you.

347
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,580
I understand. Go ahead.

348
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,690
Do your best!

349
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,520
Hey, there. Why are you all by yourself?

350
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,820
Are you lost?

351
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,590
You are going to the girls' dormitory. Right?

352
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,090
I'll take you there.

353
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,610
I'm not going to the girls' dormitory. I'm looking for the boys' dormitory.

354
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,830
Don't worry. I'm not a bad guy.

355
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,370
Look. Volunteer. I'm supposed to help you.

356
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,660
It's okay.

357
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,740
I'm fine.

358
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,083
- It's okay.
 - I'm fine.

359
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,674
It's okay.

360
00:27:47,674 --> 00:27:49,074
Leave it, you rogue!

361
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,359
You pretend to be a volunteer to trick the new girls every year.

362
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:56,000
- Wait, bro. You just...
 - What are you talking about?

363
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,556
Who's your bro?

364
00:27:57,556 --> 00:27:59,189
Don't pretend to be close to me.

365
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:02,580
Girl, there are a lot of frauds like him every year.

366
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,390
Let me tell you. If you ever see any... New girl!

367
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,910
You psycho! Psycho!

368
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,160
Stop following me.

369
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,960
 It's okay. Thank you.

370
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,760
Zhou Siyue has excellent character and grades.

371
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,230
He's handsome and he keeps a low profile.

372
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,290
If Dong Zhengfei gets the quota, I can't accept that.

373
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,160
I think he's fine.

374
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,110
Like father, like son.

375
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,710
I, for one, don't want to join his team.

376
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,390
Things are bound to happen sooner or later.

377
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,300
Hey, there!

378
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,920
This is the boys' dormitory. Girls are not allowed.

379
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,941
I know, Auntie. I'm a freshman. I'm looking for someone.

380
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,410
It's still a "no". It's against rules.

381
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,800
- I just need two minutes!
 - How can you do this?

382
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,200
- Just two minutes!
 - No.

383
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,270
I'll call security if you won't leave.

384
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,100
Zhou Siyue!

385
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,410
Zhou Siyue, I'm here for you!

386
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,640
There's a girl at the boys' dormitory

387
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,820
who traveled far to look for her boyfriend.

388
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,780
Really? That's romantic.

389
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,540
 Zhou Siyue!

390
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,760
♫  Can I spend the night?  ♫

391
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,498
 The secret that I buried in my heart

392
00:29:41,498 --> 00:29:44,020
 was carefully hidden in that dusty box.

393
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,130
♫  It's been a long day  ♫

394
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:50,010
 But boxes will be opened again sooner or later.

395
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,110
♫  I can feel you there  ♫

396
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,560
 I thought I had forgotten everything.

397
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,670
 Now I realized that I have never really let her go.

398
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:03,670
♫  I spend the long day since you're gone  ♫

399
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:09,190
♫  Would you hear me... Would you hear me now?  ♫

400
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:18,800
♫  I'm not the one who doesn't want to fall in love that way   ♫

401
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,590
Zhou Siyue!

402
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,210
 Wow!

403
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,670
Ding Xian.

404
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:28,901
♫  You got to stay in the light, all right  ♫

405
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:31,768
♫  I'm going to be another side  ♫

406
00:30:31,768 --> 00:30:34,286
♫  It has been a long day  ♫

407
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:38,146
♫  A long day, I haven't found you  ♫

408
00:30:40,608 --> 00:30:44,910
♫  You got to stay in the light, all right  ♫

409
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,715
♫  I'm going to be another side  ♫

410
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:50,301
♫  It has been a long day  ♫

411
00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:54,306
♫  A long day, I haven't heard from you  ♫

412
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:58,533
♫  And I've been waiting too  ♫

413
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,540
Zhou Siyue!

414
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,240
It's so nice to see you.

415
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,300
You never picked up my calls or returned my messages.

416
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,250
I thought you wouldn't come out to see me.

417
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,260
I changed my number and I didn't tell you.

418
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,790
I just have something to say.

419
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,020
Tell me.

420
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,270
I like you.

421
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,680
Have you ever felt the same?

422
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,630
Ding Xian,

423
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,270
I have no plans for romantic relationships now.

424
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,030
It's getting late. You should go back.

425
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:28,820
Focus on your studies

426
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,260
and don't come looking for me again.

427
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,300
We said that we were going to get into Huaqing together.

428
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,740
I tried so hard to keep up with you.

429
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,480
Now I have done it.

430
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,360
I just want to know if you ever had feelings for me.

431
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,340
Is the answer...

432
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,230
really important?

433
00:33:09,793 --> 00:33:11,293
Ding Xian.

434
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,160
We all have our own lives.

435
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,760
So what?

436
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,600
Zhou Siyue.

437
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,730
Do you know my secret?

438
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,970
It's getting late. I'm going to leave now.

439
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,350

440
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,190
Hello.

441
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:59,520
I'd like to ask if the patient in bed 2, room 318 has paid up.

442
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,180
Just a second.

443
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,000
Bed 2, room 318. Right?

444
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,260
Yes.

445
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,610
Not yet.

446
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,400
Are you a family member?

447
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,780
You need to hurry.

448
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,400
This is not something that can be delayed.

449
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
All right.

450
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,870
 Hello?

451
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,860
 Siyue, where are you?

452
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,400
 Your dad is sick.

453
00:36:02,689 --> 00:36:04,089
 What?

454
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,990
 I can't even protect my family now.

455
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,090
 How am I supposed to protect her?

456
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,870
Hello, Dad.

457
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,080
Our Xianxian has become someone now.

458
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,020
You are a student of a century-old renowned school.

459
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,370
Did you tour the campus yet?

460
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:52,010
I was too busy for the whole morning. I didn't get to tour around yet.

461
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,720
Just a second. Your mom wants to talk to you.

462
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,520
Xianxian, are you in your dormitory yet?

463
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,630
 Not yet. I will be there soon.

464
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,570
It's already late. What has kept you?

465
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,600
 You are always moving slowly.

466
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,620
I should have gone with you.

467
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,840
All right, Mom. I'll call you tonight.

468
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,150
I'm hanging up now.

469
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,200
 Don't forget to take photos.

470
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,400
I know, Mom.

471
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,190
Don't worry.

472
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,630
I was too late today.

473
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,430
I should be there earlier next time.

474
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,650
How is my grandfather?

475
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,700
I heard that the winner of the Computer Science Department is a senior from our department.

476
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,200
Who was it?

477
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,870
It is you.

478
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:46,670
We were talking about if you are the one who would join us.

479
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,740
Not bad. You've become popular right after school started.

480
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,640
Here. Sit.

481
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,410
It's okay. You can take a seat.

482
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,590
Just sit down. I'm standing here to lose weight.

483
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,940
So, my name is Lou Feng.

484
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,630
I'm Ding Xian.

485
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,840
Hello.

486
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,090
This is Ban Jiayu.

487
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,830
And this is Xu Shasha.

488
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,120
Didn't he drag you away?

489
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,520
I heard that the guy you are pursuing

490
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,190
is in the Computer Science Department.

491
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,660
And he's one of the most handsome guys on campus.

492
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,760
How come I've never heard of him?

493
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,470
Your information needs to be updated.

494
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,020
Let me give you some basic knowledge.

495
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,710
There are two characters in our department.

496
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:32,020
One is Dong Zhengfei, and the other one is your Zhou Siyue.

497
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,200
Really?

498
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,560
I've heard of Dong Zhengfei before school started.

499
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,820
But I have no memory of Zhou Siyue.

500
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,760
Let me finish.

501
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,520
The two of them are alike in some ways.

502
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,800
But they have opposite personalities.

503
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,760
One is enthusiastic like fire, and the other is as cold as ice.

504
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,950
You were talking about the robot...

505
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,150
The Robot Design Competition.

506
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,760
Tomorrow is the award ceremony of the competition.

507
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,570
I think the winner would be either Dong Zhengfei or Zhou Siyue.

508
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,270
You are so noisy.

509
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,820
She's always like that.

510
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,300
It's okay. I'll go with you.

511
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,270
Activate.

512
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,730
"The end of the world."

513
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:11,200

514
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,230

515
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:28,260

516
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,320
 This autumn is cool and sunny.

517
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,360
 Students are rolling in from the whole nation.

518
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,000
 School is starting again.

519
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,320
 A lot of university freshmen

520
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,280
 have come to the campuses with their dreams.

521
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,460
 Our reporter will be following the students...

522
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,560
It's okay.

523
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,521
I'm fine.

524
00:41:58,521 --> 00:42:02,940
 Everyone knows that Huaqing is a renowned school with a long history.

525
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,870
 And it's the sacred hall of knowledge for a lot of students.

526
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,190
 Among all the majors, computer science and math...

527
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,190
Here.

528
00:42:10,187 --> 00:42:11,937
Have an apple.

529
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,780
Is everything going well...

530
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,070
at school?

531
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,880
Everything is fine.

532
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,090
Just focus on getting better.

533
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,560
That's great.

534
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,670
You don't have to be so tired.

535
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,060
Your education should always come first.

536
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,430
Don't keep coming here all the time.

537
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,230
I'm pretty tough.

538
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,205
There you are, Siyue.

539
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,840
You've been gone for a while.

540
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,520
Have you lost directions again?

541
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:57,160
Can you stop jinxing me?

542
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:00,220
Did you find the payment office successfully?

543
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,700
Of course!

544
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,800
What kind of person do you think I am?

545
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,000
I can handle things like this.

546
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,940
Don't worry too much

547
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,220
and focus on your education.

548
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,260
Secure the quota to study abroad sooner.

549
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,421
Old Ye has told us.

550
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:20,815
Your chance is big.

551
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,300
That won't be settled anytime soon.

552
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:29,340
We can talk about that after Dad has healed.

553
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,900
I'm heading back to school now.

554
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,470
Call me if you need anything.

555
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,160
Are you coming here tonight?

556
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,840
I have been busy recently.

557
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,590
I'll come back this weekend.

558
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,000
You are busy with school

559
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,950
and you are working several part-time jobs.

560
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,430
Don't forget to eat.

561
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,930
Don't worry.

562
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,860
I'm leaving now.

563
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,500
Siyue.

564
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,060
Have your meals on time.

565
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,160
Go.

566
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,460
The team that has won the Robot Design Competition 2012,

567
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,320
please send a representative to claim your rewards.

568
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,890
Please welcome Li Minghao

569
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,400
and Liu Zhenghui.

570
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:41,870
The team that won first place is from the Automation Department.

571
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,600
Their representative is...

572
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,060
Dong Zhengfei.

573
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,700
And please welcome Professor Ye to give them their award.

574
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:01,090
He's just a representative.

575
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:02,160
It's a team reward.

576
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,050
But look how proud he is of himself

577
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:06,030
like he's claiming a personal reward.

578
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:11,020
You sound so cynical.

579
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,980
If you didn't refuse to do that,

580
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,900
he would have nothing to do with this.

581
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,410
Come on, the ceremony is almost over.

582
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,230
Now I would like to announce that the competition has ended successfully.

583
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,540
Please leave the room in order.

584
00:45:31,879 --> 00:45:33,280
Please hold on a second.

585
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,660
I don't add strangers as my contacts.

586
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,390
No, you misunderstood me.

587
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:40,760
I just want to ask, are you in the same class as Zhou Siyue?

588
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,450
I'm looking for him.

589
00:45:44,883 --> 00:45:46,980
It's you.

590
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,700
Are you still looking for him all over the place?

591
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,160
We are from the same class.

592
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,860
But... we are not close.

593
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,840
Being classmates doesn't mean we are friends.

594
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,780
You are talking to the wrong person.

595
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:13,230

596
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,470
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

597
00:46:21,718 --> 00:46:25,030
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

598
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:31,113
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

599
00:46:31,113 --> 00:46:35,370
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

600
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:42,220
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

601
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,558
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

602
00:46:46,814 --> 00:46:52,393
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

603
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:55,570
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

604
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,540
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

605
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,533
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

606
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:07,330
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

607
00:47:07,346 --> 00:47:10,303
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

608
00:47:10,303 --> 00:47:12,880
♫  After a long journey  ♫

609
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,170
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

610
00:47:38,596 --> 00:47:41,536
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

611
00:47:41,536 --> 00:47:44,210
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

612
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:48,253
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

613
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:52,130
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

614
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,670
♫  After a long journey  ♫

615
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:58,773
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
