1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:15,660

2
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,500
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,086
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:34,966
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:40,238
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,744
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:48,393
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:48,393 --> 00:00:55,452
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:55,452 --> 00:01:03,000
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:10,220
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,212
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:14,325
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,578
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:23,320
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:24,204 --> 00:01:25,892
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:28,244
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:35,601
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:39,392

19
00:01:40,082 --> 00:01:42,195

20
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,660
Ding Xian,

21
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,390
why don't you also...

22
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,410
What?

23
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,910
Why don't you also go to a university in Jiangling?

24
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,380
Did you dream of something?

25
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,980
You are flushing.

26
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,610
Did you... Did you have a nice dream?

27
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,820
No.

28
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,010
Huh?

29
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,070
Really?

30
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,160
What? What were you dreaming about?

31
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,180
Nothing.

32
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,546
Really?

33
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:30,396
What's wrong?

34
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,890
Ding Xian.

35
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,830
Huh?

36
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,830
What's wrong?

37
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,010
Stop talking to me during classes.

38
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,370
You dropped your glasses.

39
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,000
Tell me. What did you dream about?

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,340
- You were smiling so happily.
 - Nothing.

41
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,240
Have you been thinking about something so much that you are seeing it in your dream now?

42
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,320
Stop that!

43
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,090
- You are feeling guilty.
 - I'm not.

44
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,250
- You are.
 - I'm not.

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,140
Why can't you be smart about it?

46
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,600
Cherish our time in high school, Sis.

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,060
When we graduate, you two will be separated in different places.

48
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,750
Draw an auxiliary line.

49
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,930
So, can we get this angle, ACD...

50
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,870
Hey.

51
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,030
Huh?

52
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,660
What happened to you? You've been weird all day long.

53
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,500
Nothing.

54
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
I'm listening.

55
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,910
Is there anything on my face?

56
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,510
No.

57
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,530
You haven't looked at me for days now.

58
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,710
How do you know there's nothing on my face?

59
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,060
Are you going to explain the questions or not?

60
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,860
I'm going to sleep if you aren't.

61
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,840
Hey.

62
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,420
Let's put aside the fact that you are hiding something from me.

63
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,280
My tutor class is quite valuable.

64
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,060
I will be participating in the contest in a few days.

65
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,030
You are not going to find me even if you want to.

66
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,970
You should cherish this.

67
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,490
 Siyue, it's a power outage!

68
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,990
Got it.

69
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,410
Hold on a second.

70
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,350
I'll go check it out.

71
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,780
Why is the power off all of a sudden?

72
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,500
What?

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,170
Are you afraid of darkness?

74
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,290
I'm not.

75
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,703
Here.

76
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,440
You should feel better now.

77
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:55,499
♫   That him, this him, I hear the rain go drip-drop   ♫

78
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:58,830
♫  In the middle of the summer night  ♫

79
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,410
I also like this song.

80
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,804
♫  Hide in my room on a cloudy day  ♫

81
00:06:05,804 --> 00:06:13,804
♫  Slouch in the chair, messy hair, miss him  ♫

82
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,580
Zhou Siyue,

83
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,584
I want to go to university in Jiangling, too.

84
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:27,275
♫  All lovely things come together  ♫

85
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:29,846
♫  How I wish I could be a part of it  ♫

86
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:33,476
♫  The dream he loves sparkles like a star  ♫

87
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:38,539
♫  Blossoming in the endless milky way  ♫

88
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:42,251
♫  With all the crossing paths  ♫

89
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:48,740
♫  He's the only one who stays in the dream  ♫

90
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,880
You are not going anywhere. I'll break your leg.

91
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,930
I'm going anyway. What? Do it.

92
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,540
I'll see how you can go like that!

93
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,440
What should we do?

94
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,551
- How did this happen under your watch?
 - What can I do?

95
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:01,660
He was dragged away by his dad before I could talk some sense into both of them.

96
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,880
- Look how spoiled he is.
 - You can hit me. I mean it.

97
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,953
You should stop, too.

98
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:07,470
- What?
 - You are finally here. Look.

99
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,690
Siyue.

100
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,303
Jiang, Siyue is here.

101
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:13,963
You guys are unbelievable. What are you doing?

102
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:14,940
Uncle. Auntie.

103
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,733
Siyue.

104
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,733
You are just in time.

105
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:20,670
You guys are best friends.

106
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,100
Tell him what's at stake here.

107
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,130
He should go to a university before thinking about other things.

108
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,820
You should make Siyue your son.

109
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,170
He's going to a renowned university.

110
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,490
What are you talking about?

111
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,290
- Say that again!
 - Enough.

112
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,660
- Enough.
 - Uncle,

113
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,010
can I talk with you for a second?

114
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,417
That kid is becoming more and more outrageous.

115
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,817
Yes.

116
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,350
Siyue, help me persuade him.

117
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,750
All right.

118
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,250
Auntie,

119
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,130
let me talk to Jiang Chen.

120
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,110
Right. You guys should talk.

121
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,970
Don't be so stubborn.

122
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,571
Come on. Come here.

123
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,680
Dude, I owe you one.

124
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,849
That means you are fine now.

125
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:19,549
Let's go.

126
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,121
Why are you still up?

127
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,010
You scared the hell out of me.

128
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,490
I'm so hungry.

129
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,680
You didn't even wear slippers.

130
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,631
You will catch a cold later. Go back and put them on now.

131
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,710
You are drinking my milk.

132
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,650
You are acting like a little old man right now.

133
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,780
What are you talking about?

134
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,430
You are so mature.

135
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,240
No wonder you can persuade Jiang Chen's dad.

136
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,350
How did you manage to do that?

137
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,820
It's not really a huge thing.

138
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,530
I told his dad that the reason why Jiang Chen wants to be a soldier

139
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,800
is because he wants to be someone as excellent as his dad.

140
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,890
Impressive.

141
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,000
You really do know your way around words.

142
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,750
It must be hard preparing for the Academic Olympiad.

143
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,690
Break a leg.

144
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,180
I almost forgot.

145
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,530
I heard that you only got over 90 on the math test.

146
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,230
The situation is severe, little girl.

147
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,200
It's already 2:00 a.m. Can't you let me take a break?

148
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,760
I can see that you are not sleepy yet.

149
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,230
Come. Let me tutor you.

150
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,050
What?

151
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,172
I am sleepy. I'm really sleepy.

152
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:58,160
Please let me go, Mr. Zhou.

153
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,200

154
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,710
Why don't we go grab a drink later?

155
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,790
I know a really good milk tea store.

156
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,740
And it's super cheap.

157
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
AlL right. Great.

158
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,540
Jiang Chen.

159
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,790
Keke, we'll leave now.

160
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,030
What are you doing here?

161
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,213
Waiting for you.

162
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:20,013
You are waiting for me?

163
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,122
Why didn't you put on more clothes?

164
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,490
Tie it around your waist.

165
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,520
It's corny. I don't want that.

166
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,030
I'm going to the art class later.

167
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,261
Put it on.

168
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,072
- What are you doing?
 - It's cold today.

169
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,740
Sticking your finger in every pie.

170
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,150
Hop on, I'll give you a ride.

171
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,700
Come.

172
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,900
Fine.

173
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,910
It's not bad to have a free ride.

174
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,440
Hold on tight.

175
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,530
You must have figured out which school you are going to.

176
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,980
Of course.

177
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,340
It would be the Acting Department of the Film Academy.

178
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,828
If I can't succeed this year, I'll get it next year.

179
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll keep trying until I get in.

180
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,780
I think we are so alike.

181
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,100
We do not turn back until we hit the wall.

182
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,900
Who said that we were alike?

183
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,200
I have a bright future.

184
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,230
My future is not bad either.

185
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,100
I will become a soldier.

186
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,580
I have a great future.

187
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,380
You fool! Are you really going to join the army?

188
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,350
If the young people are strong, the country will be strong.

189
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,610
If the young people are wise, the country will be wise.

190
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,910
What?

191
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:55,010
I said, if the young people are strong, the country will be strong;

192
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,160
if the young people are wise, the country will be wise.

193
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,180

194
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,030
That score is too high.

195
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,920
Are you trying to get into the same university?

196
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,690
I'd love to.

197
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,150
But Huaqing is not giving me that chance.

198
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,680
I would be happy if I could go to the same city.

199
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,690
You guys have a chance to go to a university in the same city.

200
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,590
I have no hope.

201
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,210
Are you saying that we should be separated by then?

202
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,810
That's great news for me.

203
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,510
Bye-bye. I'm going to be alone and beautiful.

204
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:49,130
Oh, right!

205
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,490
Let's all go see Jiang Chen off this weekend.

206
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,570
He's about to join the army.

207
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,610
Is he leaving already?

208
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,950
Thank you for watching the movie with me.

209
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,510
Why would you thank me?

210
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,650
It just came to me that I will not see your foolish face anymore.

211
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,660
I feel like something is missing.

212
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,540
You can call me or write to me.

213
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,100
Aren't you really good at writing letters?

214
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,930
Who told you that?

215
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,300
I didn't write that.

216
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,310
Someone else wrote it for me.

217
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,440
Besides, why would I write to you?

218
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,810
You are not a good friend.

219
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,440
When have we ever been friends?

220
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,340
Then I have been presumptuous.

221
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,780
This will be yours from now on.

222
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,250
What is this?

223
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,370
A parting gift.

224
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,200
I have nothing...

225
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,750
but this motorbike.

226
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,490
That's a surprise.

227
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,910
Take it.

228
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,200
I'll keep it safe for you...

229
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:32,203
and wait for you to come back.

230
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,480
Another thing.

231
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,250
Break a leg in the exam tomorrow.

232
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,220
You will get into the university you desire.

233
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,660
I don't need you to tell me that.

234
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,230
Playing with you is boring.

235
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,780
I would like to play with you.

236
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,420
Are you sure?

237
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,120
I'm sure.

238
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,193
I think she and I are at the same level.

239
00:16:31,193 --> 00:16:34,420
Don't take this the wrong way. I just want you to take a break.

240
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,243
All right.

241
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,060
Here. Show him what you are made of.

242
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,740
Are you that lucky?

243
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,790
This is a coincidence.

244
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,260
That dude is seeking failure.

245
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,900
He thought Little Monster was soft.

246
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,090
Little did he know that he picked on a hardcore.

247
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,400
I thought you were leaving tonight.

248
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,190
You still have the time to play it out in pool?

249
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,880
I just want to party one last time before I leave.

250
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,970
And I got beaten hard.

251
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,670
Come here and have something. The food might get cold.

252
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,980
- All right. I'll finish a round.
 - Coming!

253
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,300
- Come on, Brother Song.
 - Coming.

254
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,100
Little Monster, you are so good at pool.

255
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,350
I learned from the master.

256
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,370
Um... Do contact me often.

257
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,180
- Okay.
 - Sure.

258
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,680
Better yet, tell me things about Keke.

259
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,910
So, that's your real angle, dude.

260
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,460
If she ever hangs out with another boy, do tell me about it.

261
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,090
How could I do that? I would be selling out my friend.

262
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,400
Work with me.

263
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,940
I could also sell my friend out.

264
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,204
I'm kidding. That's impossible.

265
00:18:43,204 --> 00:18:45,620
They are all my good brothers.

266
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,750
Isn't that Keke?

267
00:18:57,646 --> 00:19:00,543
Jiang Chen, why are you still taking your time here?

268
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:02,130
Aren't you worried that your dad will beat you up again?

269
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,330
Just a second.

270
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,250
Why are you riding Jiang Chen's motorbike?

271
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,980
I thought you had an exam.

272
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,780
I got there early and finished the exam early.

273
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,540
So, did you do well?

274
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,220
Why are you talking so much?

275
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,700
I'm volunteering to give you a ride.

276
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,210
- Shouldn't you get on right now?
 - Yeah. Don't make a girl wait for you.

277
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,756
- Hurry up.
 - All right. I...

278
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:26,356
Wait.

279
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,380
Did you forget your bag?

280
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,607
So, I'm leaving now.

281
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,240
Let me.

282
00:19:56,356 --> 00:19:57,856
See you.

283
00:19:57,856 --> 00:20:00,143
- Hurry up!
 - Take care.

284
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:01,943
Come on!

285
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,840
Stop looking. Let's go!

286
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,060
You will see each other again.

287
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,020
Let's go.

288
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,540
You look pretty handsome.

289
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:52,232
Siyue, the national contest is happening soon.

290
00:20:52,232 --> 00:20:54,860
Do your best. I have faith in you.

291
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,390
You will get the recommendation quota for Huaqing.

292
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,430
 - Huaqing.
 - All right.

293
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,800
 I also think he can get it.

294
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,890
 Siyue is solid.

295
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,060
 He has great performance.

296
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,760
Enough.

297
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,300
Stop the chit-chat.

298
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,370
You'd better spend the time on your own marks instead of following others. All right?

299
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:36,760
Do you know if there's anything that would help you improve your performance in exams?

300
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,670
Is it for Zhou Siyue?

301
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,330
Keep it down. Don't let him hear it.

302
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,460
I've never seen you care about yourself in exams so much.

303
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,090
This is different.

304
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,880
This exam is crucial for him.

305
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,660
They are selling test-luck pens by the school gate.

306
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,560
You could get him one.

307
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,000
That's too common.

308
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,250
How about a test-luck bookmark?

309
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:04,670
Not good enough.

310
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,320
- Anything else?
 - So,

311
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,083
if you really want to give him something special, why don't you make one yourself?

312
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,910
 Ding Xian.

313
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,110
Just a second!

314
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,610
You can come in now.

315
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,780
What are you doing?

316
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,370
I'm reading.

317
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,180
Haven't I explained this question to you before?

318
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,060
- Why did you make a mistake again?
 - Did I?

319
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,280
I'll explain it again.

320
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,210
That's okay. I'll check it myself later.

321
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,420
You should go back and rest. You have an exam tomorrow.

322
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,820
You don't need to worry about me.

323
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,210
No. I...

324
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,351
- Good night.
 - You...

325
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:57,291
- Do your best in the exam.
 - Listen!

326
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,400
Oh, no!

327
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,900
Zhou Siyue!

328
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,980
Zhou Siyue!

329
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,490
Why are you here?

330
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,490
I was going to walk with you.

331
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,110
But I got up late.

332
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,500
It's just an exam. I will be back after the exam.

333
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,970
How could you say that?

334
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,190
This will affect your university education.

335
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,370
Are you... nervous?

336
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,340
A little.

337
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,440
Stick out your hand.

338
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,050
I hope everything goes well on the test.

339
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,890
This is my first time embroidering. It may not look so good.

340
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:43,170
So, you haven't been focusing on learning because you were secretly making this.

341
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,780
You almost caught me.

342
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,210
You are so silly.

343
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,430
Come here.

344
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,940
I didn't wash my hair.

345
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,760
It's okay. I just need some aura.

346
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,010
The final exam is coming. Go back and do the exercises.

347
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,450
I also have a gift for you when school starts again.

348
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,370
Ding Xian, you are also cheering Siyue up.

349
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,170
Mr. Liu.

350
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,140
It's about time. Go inside.

351
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,220
Siyue, no need to feel nervous about the exam today.

352
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,700
Just do what you normally do.

353
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,190
You've got this.

354
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,420
Don't worry. I'm ready.

355
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:10,223
Go.

356
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,100
Mr. Liu.

357
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,380
If I can get into Huaqing, can you do me a favor?

358
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,920
I can do you ten favors.

359
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,780
 Zhou Siyue, you have to get into Huaqing.

360
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,870
 The road ahead of you is long.

361
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,570
 You will have a great future.

362
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,310
 Break a leg.

363
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:14,365

364
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,600
What are you doing?

365
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,460
Have you been too relaxed during the winter vacation?

366
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,160
Mr. Zhou, I'm so tired.

367
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,780
Don't you want to go to Jiangling anymore?

368
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,880
I don't.

369
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,430
I'd better go to Hangzhou.

370
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:56,460
Sure. It's none of my business anyway.

371
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,490
Hangzhou is a nice place. The scenery there is great.

372
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,230
And I don't have to see someone tutoring me every day.

373
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,050
What?

374
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,740
I was kidding.

375
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,680
What are you doing?

376
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,340
Hey.

377
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:32,042
Are you playing me?

378
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:34,060
I'm not.

379
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,700
Are you...

380
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,970
Why are you poking me?

381
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,580
You are always poking me. You are trying to hit me all day long.

382
00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:41,460
Just tell me if you don't want to do your homework.

383
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,830
That's not what I'm thinking.

384
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,300
It's funny, right?

385
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,270
I'm not.

386
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,892
Stop!

387
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,980
Hello, Mom.

388
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,334
 Xianxian, something happened. Come back now.

389
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:01,110
All right, got it.

390
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,920
What?

391
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,050
Something happened back home. I need to go back.

392
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,700
Uncle Ding.

393
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,044
Sorry for your loss.

394
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,970
Thank you.

395
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,710
Xianxian.

396
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,990
Senior Brother!

397
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:24,600
I thought you were not coming back for the Spring Festival.

398
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,080
I had to come back since this has happened.

399
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,680
How are you doing? Are you okay?

400
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,680
I never understood the concept of parting.

401
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,800
After growing up, I learned that...

402
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,830
parting is such a sad thing.

403
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah.

404
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,190
Growing up is a sad thing in itself.

405
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:14,313
Even the best friend would grow apart gradually.

406
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,950
There's nothing we can do about it.

407
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:24,390
Everyone will have a new life.

408
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,000
Then I don't want to grow up.

409
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:40,390
I still remember the little bully in Keshan who would cry three times a day.

410
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,210
Your face was always covered in tears whenever I saw you.

411
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,410
Yeah.

412
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:58,070
I was always bullied by those boys in junior high.

413
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:02,080
Do you remember that you once gave me a pack of toffee,

414
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,520
and they asked me for it?

415
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:10,210
I didn't want them to find the candies, so I hid them under a tree.

416
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:15,100
Later, it rained. And when I went back,

417
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,860
all I found were candy wrappers.

418
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:25,530
Do you think the more we try to hold on to something,

419
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,790
the more it will slip through our fingers?

420
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,760
Xianxian.

421
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,870
I have something for you.

422
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,520
I was going to make the kids happy with this.

423
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,210
Here.

424
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:56,850
For me... you are always the same person.

425
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,690
But I'm no longer a kid.

426
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,390
 Zhou Zongtang, do you know this is the Spring Festival?

427
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,090
 You are still going out.

428
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,280
Jinyun, I do have some serious business.

429
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,130
It's about the school.

430
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,970
You haven't been teaching for so long.

431
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,820
What serious business could the school possibly have?

432
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,850
 Besides, is it more important than the festival?

433
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,850
 Can't you just trust me? If even you are doubting me,

434
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,480
then I really can't explain this in one or two words.

435
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,680
Zhou Zongtang! If you step out today,

436
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,166
 then you can forget about the festival.

437
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,140
Aren't you going out?

438
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:26,320
Take care of things at home.

439
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,370
Xianxian, what are you doing out here?

440
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:49,220
Go inside. It's cold out here.

441
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,230
Dinner is almost ready.

442
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,090
You should go have something now.

443
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,420
I'd like to stay out here a little longer.

444
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,270
This year is a little quiet.

445
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,719
Yeah.

446
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,870
It was your grandma who planned for the goods

447
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,340
and dinner for Spring Festival.

448
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:31,150
And she would call in the whole family to gather here.

449
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:43,850
Dad, there are things we can't change.

450
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,950
We have no choice but to accept them.

451
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:04,120
Come on, let's go inside.

452
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,440
 Are you there?

453
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,890
Hello?

454
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,870
How are things going at your home?

455
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,870
Everything is fine.

456
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:00,940
 ♪ Happy New Year, Happy New Year ♪

457
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,840
 ♪ Happy New Year to you all ♪

458
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,360
 ♪ We are singing, we are dancing ♪

459
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,020
 ♪ Happy New Year to you all ♪

460
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:19,850
Are you feeling better?

461
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,050
What do you mean by that?

462
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,220
Like you knew I was not feeling good.

463
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,900
Maybe it's because we've been deskmates for a long time.

464
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,420
I can imagine your face

465
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,619
 even if I can't see you.

466
00:37:38,649 --> 00:37:41,239
How's life back in your hometown?

467
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,630
It's so festive.

468
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,070
They prepared a big feast.

469
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,380
I'm so full right now.

470
00:37:52,084 --> 00:37:53,360
How about you?

471
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,960
I...

472
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,660
I'm watching fireworks at home.

473
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,560
We have fireworks over here, too.

474
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,760
Do you also feel...

475
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:17,670
that time really flies?

476
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:23,210
 After the Spring Festival, we are going to grow up, too.

477
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,320
Yeah.

478
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,560
But it's okay.

479
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,820
Next year, we will be able to watch the fireworks together.

480
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:39,450
All right. We will watch the fireworks together next year.

481
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,460
Happy Spring Festival, Zhou Siyue.

482
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,020
Happy Spring Festival, Ding Xian.

483
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,460
Before the class is over, I have an announcement.

484
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,980
Let's all congratulate Zhou Siyue

485
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,700
for passing the national contest.

486
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,900
He's about to become a part of Huaqing officially.

487
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,470
Impressive.

488
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,950
Those who are not recommended, don't feel frustrated.

489
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,620
As long as you are fighting, there's always hope.

490
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,220
You still need to work hard in the new semester

491
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,660
and achieve better performance.

492
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,370
All right, class is over.

493
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,020
Siyue, you have become a university student now.

494
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,230
Siyue, how about helping poor students like us when you are free?

495
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,830
Siyue, me too.

496
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,020
All right. Stop...

497
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,900
Stop now. Make appointments. Siyue is busy now.

498
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,230
Anyone who wants to make an appointment can talk to me. Thank you.

499
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,570
Don't mind him. Break a leg.

500
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,970
Why are you everywhere?

501
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:10,815
Classmate Ding Xian,

502
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,720
pack your things and move back.

503
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,130
What?

504
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,330
Move back!

505
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,460
That's really bold.

506
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,990
I got permission from Mr. Liu.

507
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:30,170
I can't believe that he would agree.

508
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,660
Move now!

509
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:36,100
Stop gossiping. With that kind of time, you might as well do more exercises.

510
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,850
Switch over.

511
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,420
This is the gift you mentioned before.

512
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:24,570
Why do you want me to switch back?

513
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,580
So that I can help you study.

514
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,950
Why are you always asking questions?

515
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,553
Help me study.

516
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:40,290
How silly are you?

517
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,070
Why would you believe that?

518
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,290
Why are you always calling me silly?

519
00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:54,520
My high school life started with you being my deskmate.

520
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:59,770
It should end in the same way.

521
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,330
What a pity...

522
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,920
would it be otherwise?

523
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:35,630
You are already admitted by Huaqing,

524
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,040
and I'm not sure if I can go to Jiangling yet.

525
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,600
My deskmate,

526
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,670
since you are so good,

527
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:48,820
do you have any tricks that can improve my performance?

528
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:53,190
Are you trying to take the shortcut?

529
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:01,440
But... I do have a trick.

530
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:12,010
I made this for you. A schedule for NCEE.

531
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,500
You came prepared.

532
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,120
That's because you always worry me.

533
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,280
Always worry...

534
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,750
Do your best!

535
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,490
I won't let you down.

536
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:44,960

537
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:53,095
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

538
00:43:53,095 --> 00:43:57,107
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

539
00:43:58,304 --> 00:44:02,590
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

540
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:07,747
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

541
00:44:07,747 --> 00:44:13,597
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

542
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:18,235
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

543
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:24,070
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

544
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:28,147
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

545
00:44:28,147 --> 00:44:31,117
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

546
00:44:31,117 --> 00:44:33,810
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

547
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:39,007
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

548
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:41,680
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

549
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,257
♫  After a long journey  ♫

550
00:44:44,257 --> 00:44:49,347
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

551
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,913
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

552
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:15,587
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

553
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:20,830
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

554
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:23,407
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

555
00:45:23,407 --> 00:45:25,947
♫  After a long journey  ♫

556
00:45:25,947 --> 00:45:30,550
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
