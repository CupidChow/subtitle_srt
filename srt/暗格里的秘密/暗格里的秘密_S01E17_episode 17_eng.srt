00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,660

2
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:18,586
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,072
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:26,936
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:32,324
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:36,830
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,479
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:47,538
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:55,034
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,885 --> 00:01:01,464
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,172 --> 00:01:04,298
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,311
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:09,664
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:14,990
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:17,978
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,330
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:27,521
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:31,429

19
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:34,361

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,660
This is our Anime &amp; Comics Club.

21
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,620
And this is the pictorial of our club.

22
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,799
I'll let you take care of the contestant selection.

23
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:54,560
I trust your judgment very much.

24
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:58,519
President,

25
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,279
this is the pictorial you asked me to draw last week.

26
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,100
Good timing, Ding Xian. Let me introduce her to you.

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,599
This is the Chief Editor of Dream Journey Press,

28
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,880
as well as the organizer of the competition this time.

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,480
This is Ding Xian.

30
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,839
Very nice.

31
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,520
Are you a freshman?

32
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:21,099
Have you ever participated in any competitions organized by other presses?

33
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,139
No.

34
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:25,560
Drawing is only my hobby.

35
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,540
Looks like your president is right.

36
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,679
This girl is truly talented.

37
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:35,459
I'm glad to see that you've got gifted members like her.

38
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,859
Then I'll leave the competition preparation to you.

39
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,780
I'll see you.

40
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,280
Okay. Take care.

41
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:45,840
So, do you want to take part in the competition?

42
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,459
President, I've got things to do.

43
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,459
I have to go.

44
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,010
Hey.

45
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,806
How did you know I like this?

46
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:26,306
It's on the shop.

47
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:32,070
I hope the coffee won't keep you up the whole night like before.

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,680
You've been working on the paper for two days.

49
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,559
You still haven't finished?

50
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,660
Stop it if you can't finish.

51
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:46,479
You don't allow me to join the scientific research group anyway.

52
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,519
Why do you care?

53
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,439
The shop is closing. Go back early.

54
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,659
Let me walk you back.

55
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,720
I thought you weren't going back to school.

56
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,559
I need to get up early and go to the lab tomorrow morning.

57
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,579
It'll save me some time.

58
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,490
I see.

59
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:25,759
What are you smirking about?

60
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,999
Nothing.

61
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,240
Don't move.

62
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,000
Hey! Hey!

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,440
Who is this?

64
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,720
Isn't it Mr. Zhou, Zhou Siyue?

65
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,459
What brings you back to the dorm today?

66
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,619
I must make sure that stalker won't reappear anymore.

67
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:43,579
Stalker?

68
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:52,320
Just tell me directly that you sent Ding Xian to her dorm.

69
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,279
Didn't you?

70
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,830
Tell me. We are good buddies.

71
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,370

72
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:06,640
Morning.

73
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,139
Morning, bro.

74
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,519
Spending the night in the dorm sure makes a difference for you.

75
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:18,562

76
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,360
Hey! Let me have a look.

77
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,340
Circuits and Electronics: Data Integration of Analog and Digital Electronics.

78
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,806
We learned this in our freshman year. Why are you working on this?

79
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:33,545
To go over it.

80
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:39,720
You've almost finished it.

81
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:45,840
If any student who joins our group this year happens to see this,

82
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,199
it'll be like winning the lottery.

83
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,859
Don't tell me you are going to bribe a junior girl with it.

84
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,859
Tell me the truth, and I'll let you borrow it.

85
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:55,659
No.

86
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,159
I'll finish it myself if I want to do that.

87
00:07:58,179 --> 00:07:59,122
- Then give it back. 
 - Wait.

88
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:03,120
Now... Now that you've done it, just do me a favor and lend it to me.

89
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,459
What's in it for me?

90
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,720
Look.

91
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,740
If I succeed, I'll do everything you ask me to do.

92
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,359
You know what? I know a girl who's Ding Xian's roommate.

93
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:20,859
She's very pretty.

94
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,559
Fine, you can borrow it.

95
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,920
Treat me to something nice if you succeed.

96
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,339
You bet.

97
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,640
I'm leaving.

98
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,740
But you just got here.

99
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,519
I'll go back and sleep a bit more.

100
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,480
Bye-bye.

101
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:39,499
Trust me.

102
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:41,899
This material will be very helpful to you.

103
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:43,099
Thank you.

104
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,860
Shall we add each other's WeChat?

105
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,000
If you have any questions, you can ask me.

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,239
Say, don't you think

107
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,859
this Yuan Fang is quite insensitive?

108
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:55,000
Ban Jiayu acts so cold.

109
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,899
Apparently, she has no feelings for him.

110
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,220
Yet he still keeps hitting on her.

111
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,840
What's that?

112
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,679
Test material Yuan Fang gave to me.

113
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:11,467
Look. Why do you guys

114
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,912
want to join the scientific research group?

115
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:15,840
It's tiring and hard to pass the test.

116
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,840
But now we've got the "cheat sheet."

117
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,920
Let me see.

118
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:26,660
Ding Xian.

119
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,327
Would you like me to make a copy for you?

120
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:30,847
Sure. I really need it.

121
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,200
 Before answering the questions,

122
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,119
 you need to make sure to read the question carefully and correctly.

123
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,719
 Take this problem for example.

124
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,373
 To prove...

125
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,200
 Apparently, you didn't read it carefully.

126
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,600
 You didn't even notice the wrong character.

127
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,822
 Who would waste time looking for the wrong characters on the paper?

128
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,260
 I would.

129
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,859
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

130
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:16,440
Could you tell me how this self-ordering app works?

131
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,960
Can you teach me?

132
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,466
Pick the items you want, and check them on your phone.

133
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:23,799
And then press "order".

134
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:27,179
You can fetch your food at the counter later according to the number assigned.

135
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:31,479
But there's no introduction to the food on the page.

136
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:35,100
Could you please recommend some of your specialties?

137
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,760
You can refer to the recommendations on the menu before placing your order.

138
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,040
Then, may I please add your WeChat?

139
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,679
I'll come to your shop often in the future.

140
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,872
This is the QR code of the shop.

141
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:53,139
If you need a reservation, you can scan the code.

142
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:54,739
Sorry.

143
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,679
Let's go.

144
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,239
- What are you doing? 
 - Hurry.

145
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,859
Aren't you busy?

146
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,639
But I still need to eat, right?

147
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,679
Don't you have a test coming up?

148
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,380
Still have time to come here?

149
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,840
Don't worry.

150
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,180
I accidentally got a "secret weapon."

151
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,980
I'm sure I can pass.

152
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:49,279
It's not that easy to join the scientific research group led by Professor Ye.

153
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:54,000
I thought I didn't have a chance either.

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,719
But after browsing through this material,

155
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,599
I find myself enlightened a lot.

156
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:01,660
And I suddenly understood quite a few knowledge points.

157
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,278
Look.

158
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,459
There is a table of contents and conclusions, as well as examples of wrong answers.

159
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,319
The owner is very meticulous.

160
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:11,159
Speaking of which,

161
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,901
this person is so much like you when it comes to the quirk of picking the wrong characters.

162
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:23,639
You wish.

163
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,999
 Is it really my illusion?

164
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,240
Stop thinking about those pointless things.

165
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:48,739
Ding Xian,

166
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,419
is it too late for me to convince you to give it up?

167
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,799
It's good that you realized that.

168
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:01,059
Then, I wish you good luck.

169
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,320
Thank you.

170
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,199
Why don't you bring me a bowl of noodles? I'm hungry, too.

171
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,939
I'm a guest here today.

172
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,940
I want it, too.

173
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,220

174
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,130

175
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,430

176
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,060

177
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:47,919
Let me tell you. I inquired about it yesterday.

178
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,440
The results will come out today.

179
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,060
Ban Jiayu, I'm sure you'll pass.

180
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,280
I dare not check it.

181
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,440
I'll check it for you.

182
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,239
- Okay, you do it. 
 - All right.

183
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,700
I don't see it.

184
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,119
Then stop looking.

185
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,252
Aren't you worried?

186
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:13,080
I didn't think I'd make it anyway. I'll figure out something else then.

187
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,220
Wait. It's just a choice.

188
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,520
Ding Xian,

189
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,619
you are in!

190
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:21,760
Look, she's in!

191
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
Look!

192
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,110

193
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:28,719
I told you you'd make it!

194
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:31,600
I'm in! I'm in!

195
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,919
Siyue, the girl named Ding Xian...

196
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,859
really passed the test.

197
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,759
Is she your junior?

198
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:51,200
No.

199
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,640
She was my classmate in high school. But she repeated a year.

200
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,119
I didn't expect she'd get such high marks.

201
00:14:58,119 --> 00:14:59,659
I'm a little surprised.

202
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,619
And her way of solving problems is similar to yours.

203
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,926
I'm not surprised that she passed the test. She's always been a top student.

204
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,023
Zhou Siyue! Zhou Siyue! I passed the te...

205
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,839
Speaking of the devil.

206
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,980
I'm sorry, Professor Ye. I didn't know you were here.

207
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,760
I saw your paper.

208
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,280
You did very well.

209
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,159
But there will be an assessment period for the new members.

210
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,439
You need to prepare for it.

211
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:38,980
I will. Thank you, Professor Ye.

212
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,160
You guys talk.

213
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:59,479
So great.

214
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:01,640
I'm one step closer to going abroad with you.

215
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,520
The following assessment will be harder.

216
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,300
If your project doesn't pass,

217
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,000
you won't be recruited to the core experiment team.

218
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,320
Don't always say discouraging things.

219
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,580
Ding Xian.

220
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,059
Are you sure this is what you want?

221
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,799
Doing experiments, writing programs,

222
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,619
and collecting data every day?

223
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,559
You'll get bored of it.

224
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:34,000
If you like it, I'll like it, too.

225
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,640
All right, I'll get out of your hair now. See you.

226
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:00,640
I ordered fried chicken.

227
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,307
But I fetched it.

228
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:03,980
Want it?

229
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,179
Then apologize to me.

230
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:07,599
Call me dad if you want it.

231
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,860
- Dad. 
 - I'm sorry.

232
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:18,240
You can have it.

233
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,400
Here you go.

234
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,839
Disgusting.

235
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,030
- Hey. 
 - What?

236
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,119
I have something to tell you.

237
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,599
Ding Xian has joined the scientific research group.

238
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,420
That's good. She'll be closer to you.

239
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:44,479
Nothing good about it.

240
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,160
Think about it.

241
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,000
Ding Xian repeated a year in high school.

242
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,400
She studied so hard because of me.

243
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,679
She entered Huaqing University for me.

244
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,739
And she joined the scientific research group also for me.

245
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:58,139
It's not her interest at all.

246
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,500
Just like Kong Shadi.

247
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,499
If Kong Shadi

248
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,959
gave up on the things she likes for your sake, would you let her?

249
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,740
That's why I left her.

250
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:18,400
But even so, I still think you can't help showing your care.

251
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,640
I won't.

252
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,440
I don't believe you.

253
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,160

254
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,760
In the next three months,

255
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,599
we'll do a project assessment each month.

256
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,439
Only those who pass all assessments can stay.

257
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:40,439
Dong Zhengfei will help you familiarize yourselves with the lab in the first week.

258
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:45,180
Starting next week, every student must hand in their project.

259
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:53,580
Without further ado, Dong Zhengfei, they are yours.

260
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,859
Okay.

261
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:56,459
Please follow me.

262
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:01,176
The lab is open 24 hours a day.

263
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:05,219
Professor Ye's classes are from 6:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.

264
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:07,780
You can manage the rest of the time yourselves.

265
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:11,800
But if you really want to join the scientific research group,

266
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,520
you need to sacrifice all the time for your hobbies

267
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,859
and immerse yourselves in the lab

268
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:18,979
to prepare every experiment well.

269
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,800
Please take a seat.

270
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,319
Scientific research can be quite boring.

271
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,599
And because of that,

272
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,839
it takes full concentration when you are at it.

273
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,780
If you don't have the passion for it,

274
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,679
I suggest you give up early.

275
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,719
 I can do it.

276
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:39,580
 I'm sure I'll become a member of the group.

277
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,245
Why have you been flustered?

278
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:54,439
Lou Feng, do you have anything to eat?

279
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,779
Yes.

280
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:56,779
Hurry.

281
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,040
Take one more.

282
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,739
I can't. I'm late. See you later.

283
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:02,900
- Have another. 
 - I'm running out of time.

284
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,471
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

285
00:20:09,471 --> 00:20:12,717
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

286
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:20,521
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

287
00:20:20,524 --> 00:20:24,070
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

288
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,800
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

289
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:34,492
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

290
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:37,800
Sorry, I'm late.

291
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,300
Again? Go ahead.

292
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,940
I'm sorry.

293
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,640
Today's assignment... Let me see...

294
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,559
Love can be exhausting.

295
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:54,559
Keep your spirits up, guys.

296
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,000
Professor.

297
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
Have you handed in your report?

298
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,820
Almost done. Please give me five more minutes.

299
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,339
Why should I give you more time?

300
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:10,179
Everybody has handed in theirs.

301
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,699
Is that your attitude to do scientific research?

302
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:14,820
Don't you have a sense of time?

303
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,580
I'm sorry.

304
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:38,319
Time to go back.

305
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,139
I can't.

306
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:46,982
I haven't found the bug in this program.

307
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,759
You'll wear yourself out sooner or later.

308
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:16,560
You are much busier than me.

309
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,780
How come you don't feel tired?

310
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,039
You should ask yourself

311
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,940
why you make yourself this tired.

312
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,560
Run the following program...

313
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,680
You've got to be kidding me, Ding Xian.

314
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,319
Are you going to live in the library?

315
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,060
Professor Ye said...

316
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,979
if I can solve this problem,

317
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:53,212
I can skip the three-month assessment period and become a member directly.

318
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:57,187
Then... what will happen if you fail?

319
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,960
Pack my stuff and leave.

320
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,379
Professor Ye,

321
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:04,839
you are giving her a hard time on purpose.

322
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:08,319
She's the one who's hard on herself.

323
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,980
This problem is difficult even for upperclassmen.

324
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,079
What's going on?

325
00:23:18,987 --> 00:23:20,726
The code is wrong.

326
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,920
Siyue,

327
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,079
not just her, you also must figure out what you need to do.

328
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,659
It won't happen again.

329
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:43,219
What are you looking at?

330
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:47,719
Guys, help me think of an idea.

331
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,719
How can I start a conversation with him?

332
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,959
Go and ask him how to solve this problem.

333
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:58,159
Good idea.

334
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:06,939
Well,

335
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,400
here's a problem. I wonder if you have time to help me solve it.

336
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,380
Sure. Let me see.

337
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,492
You are only a freshman,

338
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:21,079
and your professor already assigned you such a difficult problem.

339
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,640
This is a problem given to Ding Xian by Professor Ye.

340
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,260
Ding Xian can't stay in the scientific research group unless she has this problem solved.

341
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,580
I'm impressed she's quite diligent.

342
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,239
It's all because of her high school classmate Zhou Siyue.

343
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,119
She stays up late studying every day.

344
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,400
She's dog-tired.

345
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,560
She works this hard because she wants to become a member and go abroad with him.

346
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,479
Is she that confident?

347
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:45,479
You know what?

348
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:48,800
- In order to join the group— 
 - It takes some time to solve this problem.

349
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,520
It's okay.

350
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,619
Can I add your WeChat?

351
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:53,599
Please send the answer to me when you have it solved.

352
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,199
Okay.

353
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:06,000
There's only one candidate for the overseas exchange every year.

354
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,180
Has Professor Ye really decided to let Zhou Siyue go?

355
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,799
How was it?

356
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,140
I got his WeChat.

357
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,660
I mean the problem.

358
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,520
He doesn't know how to solve it.

359
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,000
This problem is that hard?

360
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:23,899
Is Professor Ye deliberately making it difficult for you?

361
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,659
See you.

362
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,520
Bro, I'm leaving, too.

363
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,119
Bye-bye.

364
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,819
Bye-bye.

365
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,020
Zhou Siyue.

366
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,527
I really don't know how to solve

367
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,040
the problem Professor Ye gave me.

368
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,740
I won't help you.

369
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,439
Please.

370
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,939
No way.

371
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,040
Help me.

372
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,800
Only this one time.

373
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,160
Cut it out.

374
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,880
Please. Once only.

375
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,179
Have you done the experimental demonstration?

376
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,059
Not yet.

377
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,680
Then write down the codes according to the thoughts in your mind.

378
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:56,140
Without referring to the book?

379
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,119
No matter how much you read,

380
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,760
you can never find the true problems if you don't practice.

381
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,840
Write the codes down first.

382
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,860
What are you doing instead of working on the problem?

383
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,479
I couldn't help.

384
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,079
Sorry.

385
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,760
How do you like my drawing?

386
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:49,819
Better than solving the problem.

387
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:51,119
Really?

388
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,059
It's not as good as the one I drew before.

389
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:56,959
Before?

390
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,760
 What did you draw?

391
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,160
 It's a secret.

392
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,600
 Suit yourself.

393
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:19,699
You said it was a secret.

394
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,400
How could you tell me that?

395
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:27,823
Anyway, everybody knows that I like you and I like drawing.

396
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,699
Ding Xian.

397
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,059
I only hope..

398
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:00,701
that you can choose the things that you really like.

399
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,079
I will.

400
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,740
So, stop talking to me. I'll get back to my problem now.

401
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,059
No talking.

402
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,300
Mr. Zhou.

403
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,700
Done?

404
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,119
Are you sure?

405
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,020
Zero point.

406
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,639
Why?

407
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,120
What about the bugs in information security?

408
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,641
You didn't even notice such obvious information bugs.

409
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,800
If this task was assigned by a tech company,

410
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,960
you'd be sued by now.

411
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:21,460
But you asked me to write it down this way.

412
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,959
So, we've found the problems.

413
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:27,039
Do it again.

414
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,859
Zhou Siyue,

415
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,839
I feel like we are back in high school again.

416
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:43,160
Back then after the division of Arts and Sciences, you taught me math.

417
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,640
And now you are acting just as...

418
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,000
As what?

419
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,880
As mean as before.

420
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,620
You are also the same.

421
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,700
Still haven't made any progress.

422
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,119
With your current level,

423
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:06,500
you should consider changing your major.

424
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,619
Please go easy on me.

425
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:11,580
This is only my freshman year.

426
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:15,580
No one cares whether you are a freshman or not.

427
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,599
They only know that you are a student of Huaqing University.

428
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,099
Besides,

429
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,959
it's your own idea to join the scientific research group.

430
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,920
If you fail to pass the assessment,

431
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,640
I won't be surprised.

432
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,379
Professor Ye is very strict.

433
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:45,792
And I think...

434
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,959
there's no need for you to join the group.

435
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:51,419
Zhou Siyue, don't you underestimate me.

436
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:55,959
Plus, I have you, a computer guru.

437
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,860
I'm sure I can pass.

438
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,650
Hey.

439
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:10,020
What are you doing?

440
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,580
I need your help, and this is how you react?

441
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,658
Wait for me.

442
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,640
Our university is holding a welcome party for freshmen.

443
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,839
- Would you like to go with me? 
 - No.

444
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,239
Classmate Zhou Siyue, you can't go on like this.

445
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:27,199
You used to enjoy activities like this, didn't you?

446
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:29,420
How come you seldom talk to people now?

447
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:37,080
One should focus on one thing at a time so that he can live his life with no regrets.

448
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:40,539
So boring.

449
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,800
Fine.

450
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,800
I'll learn from you, and I won't go either.

451
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,620
I'm going back to the lab.

452
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,400
Focus on one thing at a time, and live with no regrets.

453
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:19,899
Ding Xian!

454
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,060
Ding Xian!

455
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,519
Ding Xian?

456
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,799
Where are you?

457
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,540
Ding Xian!

458
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:40,646
Are you all right?

459
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,680
What are you doing hiding in the dark?

460
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,560
You are too timid.

461
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,159
Who's timid?

462
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:09,279
Don't talk nonsense.

463
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,820
I thought you left. Why are you back?

464
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,959
The power turned off.

465
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:20,879
What if the data went missing?

466
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:23,059
Of course, I need to come back and check.

467
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:24,459
I'm leaving.

468
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,342
Didn't you say you wouldn't help her after she joined the scientific research group?

469
00:36:32,342 --> 00:36:33,922
So, what are you doing now?

470
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:36,480
I couldn't help.

471
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,600
Like I said, you are sharp-tongued but soft-hearted.

472
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,200
Eat your dinner.

473
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:44,320
What about you?

474
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,440
I'm not hungry.

475
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,619
Food is like fuel. You'll lose your energy without it.

476
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:55,366
You work and study hard every day. And you always stay up late doing experiments.

477
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:58,120
You need to take good care of yourself. Got it?

478
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,500
How can you get energy if you don't eat?

479
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,520
You are like my mother.

480
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,659
Come on, my son. Eat something.

481
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,239
Come here. Come on.

482
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,759
The pork shoulder is good

483
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:32,559
Is something wrong with your head?

484
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:35,659
What do you mean?

485
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:37,479
Your chopsticks.

486
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:38,679
They are upside down.

487
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,190

488
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,320
Professor Ye,

489
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,999
did I pass?

490
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,199
Very well.

491
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:58,399
But someone else solved it in the same way.

492
00:37:58,399 --> 00:38:00,300
You must know who it is.

493
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,800
Professor Ye,

494
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,479
I admit that I asked Zhou Siyue for help.

495
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:10,679
But I...

496
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,960
You know Zhou Siyue better than I do.

497
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,199
He's very passionate about scientific research,

498
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,879
and he has the power to affect the people around him.

499
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:22,700
But he's one whom others want...

500
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,580
to keep up with yet can never catch up.

501
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,040
Ding Xian, you are a clever girl.

502
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,600
You should know what to do.

503
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,700
Chocolate! I'll have one.

504
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,840
Not this time.

505
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,479
This is a gift for someone else.

506
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:49,459
I'll buy some for you next time.

507
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:51,579
A gift?

508
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,279
Are you drawing this robot for Zhou Siyue?

509
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:00,360
What's wrong with this Zhou Siyue?

510
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,080
What do you mean?

511
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,360
You've pursued him for a long time.

512
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,080
If you two are really as close as you claim,

513
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,460
he should have expressed his feelings for you by now.

514
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:18,600
I didn't ask him to be my boyfriend.

515
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,860
Then why are you chasing him?

516
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:25,320
Don't get me wrong.

517
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,600
I'm just concerned about seeing you

518
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,879
going after him this hard.

519
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:34,620
I think being happy is the most important thing. As long as you won't regret it.

520
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,520
Now, I'll go wash up. Try to go to bed early.

521
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,480
- Goodnight. 
 - Goodnight.

522
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,880
 You like Zhou Siyue, which is none of my business.

523
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,420
 But, Ding Xian,

524
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,059
 I don't think you have a passion for scientific research.

525
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:58,060
 I don't know how much you know about the prospect of this major.

526
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,639
 Neither do I know what your plan is for the future.

527
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:09,059
 But I hope you can think carefully before deciding to do scientific research.

528
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:14,899
 Figure out what your choice would be if Zhou Siyue wasn't here.

529
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,860

530
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,620
Ding Xian.

531
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,039
Senior.

532
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:39,839
Did you pass the test Professor Ye gave you?

533
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,099
I think so.

534
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:44,300
Then, will you go abroad?

535
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:48,279
I'm working on it.

536
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,260
I do believe that you are a smart girl.

537
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:57,399
Why are you wasting your time on something like this?

538
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:01,699
What do you mean?

539
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,980
You follow Zhou Siyue around every day.

540
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:10,239
I do admire you for giving up so much for the person you like.

541
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:12,033
But I don't think...

542
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,460
it's worth it.

543
00:41:15,479 --> 00:41:16,879
Senior,

544
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:21,101
whether it's worth it or not is not measured by the effort paid.

545
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,579
Certainly, Zhou Siyue has great scientific research capabilities.

546
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:28,452
For him, you are even willing to do the things that you don't like.

547
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:32,419
But he will never give up on the things that he likes for anybody.

548
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:38,280
Things like going abroad. He won't give that up for you.

549
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,133
Doesn't matter.

550
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:43,293
I don't need him to do anything for me.

551
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,560
Then what if I tell you he's the one who told Professor Ye

552
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,620
that you aren't suitable for scientific research?

553
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,080
It's not important either.

554
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,200
Ding Xian.

555
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:12,239
Ding Xian.

556
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:17,059
Sorry, President. I didn't hear you.

557
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:19,719
I said, thank you for your help today.

558
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,179
You are welcome.

559
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:06,159
Hello?

560
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,579
 Hello? Zhou Siyue.

561
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:08,979
 Where are you?

562
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:12,879
What's up?

563
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:16,139
I knew you'd be here.

564
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:18,760
Something went wrong again with the program.

565
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,840
Could you help me check it?

566
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,340
Thank you.

567
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,866
What have you been busy with?

568
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:31,087
You never reply to my messages.

569
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:33,480
Doing experiments.

570
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:36,479
But you can't always stay in the lab.

571
00:43:36,479 --> 00:43:37,500
How boring.

572
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,320
Why don't you join our Anime &amp; Comics Club?

573
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,720
It's really fun.

574
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:46,299
By the way, we just received a drawing competition invitation.

575
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,139
A drawing competition?

576
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:51,900
Yes. The winner will be signed by the press directly.

577
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:54,120
Did Ding Xian sign up for it?

578
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,399
Her?

579
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,760
I do think she's quite talented.

580
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,919
If she signed up for it,

581
00:43:58,919 --> 00:44:00,840
she might be able to win a prize.

582
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,959
But she refused.

583
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:03,959
She said she didn't have time.

584
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:08,700
I have no idea what could possibly keep a freshman like her so busy.

585
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,840
I've helped you revise it.

586
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,340
It looks good now.

587
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,080
But if you modify the program on purpose again,

588
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,760
I will not help you anymore.

589
00:44:34,379 --> 00:44:36,459
So, you noticed, huh?

590
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,700
All right. If there's nothing else, you can leave now.

591
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,600
Okay. I'll take you out for dinner.

592
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:48,399
Why did you touch my stuff?

593
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,600
Calm down.

594
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,159
It's just a piece of chocolate.

595
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,980
A piece of chocolate?

596
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,840
This is a gift someone gave me.

597
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,080
Why are you yelling?

598
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,719
How was I supposed to know it was a gift?

599
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,212
I'll buy you one exactly like this, then.

600
00:45:02,212 --> 00:45:03,760
So petty.

601
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,160
Thanks.

602
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,300
Have you finished the props?

603
00:45:18,499 --> 00:45:21,580
Almost, President. Give me a little more time.

604
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,800
Ding Xian, are you okay?

605
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,579
Are you feeling unwell or something?

606
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:28,099
Do you need a rest?

607
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:29,139
No. I'm fine.

608
00:45:29,139 --> 00:45:32,020
I'll finish it in time for tomorrow's rehearsal.

609
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,620
Okay.

610
00:45:37,879 --> 00:45:39,919
President, is Xing Lufei here yet?

611
00:45:39,919 --> 00:45:41,320
They are asking for costumes again.

612
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,320
Hold on.

613
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:44,479
I'll call her.

614
00:45:44,479 --> 00:45:45,919
Okay.

615
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:48,339
What's the hurry? Here I am.

616
00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:50,040
Great.

617
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,679
Are the costumes ready?

618
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:53,879
Almost ready. We only need two more.

619
00:45:54,959 --> 00:45:56,639
Take a look at the chart.

620
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,040
See how far you are behind the schedule.

621
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:09,619
Lufei, where did you get the chocolate?

622
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:11,540
Zhou Siyue gave it to me.

623
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:27,860

624
00:46:30,005 --> 00:46:34,595
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

625
00:46:35,443 --> 00:46:39,055
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫
