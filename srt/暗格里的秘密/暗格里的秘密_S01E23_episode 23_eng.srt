â™«  For whom will the summer slow down  â™«

3
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:23,086
â™«  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  â™«

4
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:26,950
â™«  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  â™«

5
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:32,038
â™«  For whom will the movie change its story  â™«

6
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:36,744
â™«  A sudden storm, blurred vision  â™«

7
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:40,393
â™«  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  â™«

8
00:00:40,393 --> 00:00:47,452
â™«  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  â™«

9
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:55,848
â™«  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  â™«

10
00:00:55,848 --> 00:01:01,310
â™«  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  â™«

11
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:04,212
â™«  In the sleepless winter night  â™«

12
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:06,325
â™«  A season to say goodbye  â™«

13
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:09,578
â™«  I try my best to be brave  â™«

14
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:15,204
â™«  We will keep on going like this  â™«

15
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:17,892
â™«  The secret of the answer  â™«

16
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:20,244
â™«  An insoluble question  â™«

17
00:01:20,244 --> 00:01:26,582
â™«  All comes down to a simple thank you  â™«

18
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:31,790
   

19
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,740
   

20
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,020
   

21
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,340
This is a business secret. You shouldn't read it.

22
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,300
So, you signed this labor contract to pay the royalty of half a million for me?

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,520
That's not true.

24
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,799
You don't owe me anything.

25
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,992
It has nothing to do with you.

26
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:09,098
How long were you going to keep it from me?

27
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:12,280
You don't tell me anything.

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,140
I'm not keeping anything from you.

29
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:24,039
I joined Hongguang because the company has a promising future.

30
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:29,479
So, you've been busy with this project, haven't you?

31
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm so sorry...

32
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,640
that I've been complaining...

33
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,745
What are you talking about?

34
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:44,900
You are my girlfriend.

35
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,820
Protecting you from getting hurt is my job.

36
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,859
Don't always say sorry to me.

37
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:55,659
Got it?

38
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:05,519
Silly girl.

39
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,900
Then I'll go clean up a little.

40
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,940
Don't think too much.

41
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,740
I'll sleep on the couch.

42
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,219
Zhou Siyue,

43
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,800
I can't sleep.

44
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,520
Would you like to come over?

45
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,139
Don't overthink it, though.

46
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:45,310
We each take one side.

47
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:43,760
Why is your heart beating so fast?

48
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,460
Goodnight.

49
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,440
Say it.

50
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,179
Where were you last night?

51
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:56,299
Be honest. Or you'll be punished for lying.

52
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:58,472
Why did you turn your phone off?

53
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:00,219
- Do you guys have... 
 - No.

54
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,159
- Okay. 
 - Tell us.

55
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:11,239
I went to have dinner with Zhou Siyue.

56
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:14,339
I came back too late and the dorm was closed.

57
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,200
So...

58
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,759
Where did you spend the night?

59
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,860
In his basement.

60
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,459
Basement...

61
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:26,219
Did you guys...

62
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:35,020
I thought you guys worried about my safety.

63
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,000
As it turned out, you were only prying.

64
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,580
Just tell us, so we'll know whether the makeover worked or not.

65
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,840
No.

66
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,220
We didn't do anything.

67
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,012
Why are you so disappointed?

68
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:55,600
I think we are in a good place right now.

69
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,679
Besides,

70
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:03,419
when it comes to certain things, you should be patient and take your time.

71
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,699
Take your time.

72
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,779
Be patient.

73
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,299
It's Zhou Siyue, isn't it?

74
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:14,639
So, you aren't so patient after all.

75
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,079
Hello?

76
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,605
 Hello? Do you know Zhou Siyue? 

77
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:22,739
Yes. What is it?

78
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:24,339
 This is Jiangling Municipal Public Security Bureau. 

79
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:27,979
 Zhou Siyue is suspected of revealing business secrets and has been called in for questioning. 

80
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:34,539
 Hongguang Tech hasn't ruled out the possibility that the secret was divulged by insiders. 

81
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,219
 It's reported that Hongguang Tech invested and participated in many experimental projects. 

82
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:44,360
 Hongguang Tech said they would not tolerate any unfair competition that disrupts the market order. 

83
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,120
 They'll cooperate with the police investigation. 

84
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,320
 Suspect Zhou has been detained by the police on suspicion of revealing business secrets. 

85
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,120
 - He will be sued.  
 - Honey, are you okay?

86
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,739
Nurse! Nurse, please come hurry.

87
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,290
   

88
00:09:10,172 --> 00:09:13,040
- Hello? Mom. 
 - Xianxian,

89
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,759
how's everything going with you?

90
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,319
I just helped him take leave from school.

91
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:23,920
As for the other things, there are still no results.

92
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,387
I'm asking how you are doing.

93
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:30,187
Me?

94
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:32,439
I'm doing well.

95
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,499
Don't worry.

96
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:37,599
Xianxian, you've got to take good care of yourself.

97
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:44,320
Don't wear yourself out or your mom and I, or he will be worried.

98
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,920
I hear you.

99
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:51,579
If there's nothing else, I'll hang up now.

100
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:10,160
Red Horse asked me to infiltrate Hongguang and steal information for them.

101
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,240
But I clearly rejected them at the time.

102
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,059
Then, how do you explain the source code of Red Horse's new project

103
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:19,900
that highly resembles the source code of a project you did for Hongguang?

104
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,819
I told him many times to be careful and get it done flawlessly.

105
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:31,220
How come he still got caught?

106
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:37,519
You should've seen it coming when you decided to use...

107
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,480
Hongguang's information to release the product.

108
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,927
Do I need you to lecture me?

109
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,159
This kid knows too much.

110
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:50,419
Find him a lawyer and get him out.

111
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:53,099
We must make him keep his mouth shut.

112
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,079
Mr. Su, you have a visitor.

113
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,299
- You can go back to work now. 
 - Okay.

114
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,880
   

115
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:20,972
Xianxian.

116
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:26,539
I'm here for Zhou Siyue's matter.

117
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:29,959
Take a seat.

118
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm sorry, Xianxian. This is the only thing I can't help you with.

119
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,020
I understand. After all, it's your company.

120
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,020
Xianxian, that's not what I meant.

121
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,600
Except for this, I can help you with anything.

122
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,910
   
   

123
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:10,900
How many projects does your company get Huaqing's students involved in?

124
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,680
I'm leaving.

125
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,999
Xianxian.

126
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:48,358
Ms. Zhang, please hand me that folder.

127
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:50,399
Professor Ye?

128
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,640
Hello? Professor Ye.

129
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,970
   

130
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,999
Auntie.

131
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:07,980
Xianxian? What are you doing here?

132
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,240
I've been insanely busy lately.

133
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to check on you.

134
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,919
I was being inconsiderate. I should've come and visited you earlier.

135
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:21,939
Don't say that. I'm so glad that you came here.

136
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:24,637
Have a seat.

137
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:36,693
Time flies.

138
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:40,779
You kids have all grown up.

139
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:46,920
In fact, as parents,

140
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,482
we don't want to see you guys work this hard.

141
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:53,440
We hope that you can take some time to chat with us like this.

142
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,979
Since we are getting old, we are always worried

143
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:01,499
that we'll no longer have the chance

144
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:03,680
to chat with you guys anymore.

145
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,580
You will.

146
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,950
Look... I'm always so sentimental.

147
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,240
If Siyue and his father saw me like this, they'd laugh at me again.

148
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:23,840
Please keep it to yourself.

149
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:30,940
Auntie, Uncle will be fine.

150
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,278
Thank you, Xianxian.

151
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,540
Ding Xian, I just talked to the lawyer on the phone.

152
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,380
I have something to tell you.

153
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,459
Go ahead.

154
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:47,040
Auntie, I'll be right back.

155
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,959
Siyue is being considered...

156
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:57,519
the prime suspect now.

157
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:04,232
Because he's the one on the project team who contacted Red Horse Tech.

158
00:15:04,232 --> 00:15:06,486
He did that because of me.

159
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:08,127
Don't think of it that way.

160
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:11,871
Working with Hongguang was actually a good opportunity for him.

161
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,726
There's one more thing I forgot to tell you.

162
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:17,360
Siyue asked me to give this to you...

163
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:20,355
before he was taken away.

164
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:26,567
   

165
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:34,659
Is Zhou Zongtang's family here?

166
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:35,999
Yes, I'm here.

167
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,160
The operation was a success. Don't worry.

168
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,040
- Thank you. Thank you, nurse. 
 - You are welcome.

169
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:43,879
Everything's fine now.

170
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,160
It's great.

171
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,680
- It's fine now. 
 - Great.

172
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,659
Don't worry.

173
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,820
This Lawyer Pan argued with me all the time when we were at school.

174
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,539
The more we argued, the closer we got.

175
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:05,200
And now, he's become one of the best lawyers in China.

176
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,600
- Old Ye. 
 - Old Pan.

177
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,260
Long time no see. Now, allow me to introduce you.

178
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,360
This is Lawyer Pan.

179
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,160
This is Ding Xian, my student.

180
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,020
- Nice to meet you, Lawyer Pan. 
 - You, too.

181
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,020
Now, have a seat, please.

182
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,879
So, what do you think?

183
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:24,759
Your office is only so-so.

184
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,840
It lacks a touch of culture here.

185
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,140
Stop it.

186
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,160
You'll have plenty of time to criticize me later.

187
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,779
Let's get to business.

188
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:34,059
I want to ask about my student's situation.

189
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,659
I've learned something about his situation,

190
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:39,840
and I did some research after you told me about him.

191
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,280
At the moment, a few pictures and the phone records alone can't be taken as evidence.

192
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,639
Don't worry.

193
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,167
He'll be released on bail pending trial. We'll figure out what to do after he's out.

194
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,484
You stayed up all night to do your homework again, didn't you?

195
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:06,766
Have you finished?

196
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,193
Not yet.

197
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:12,419
Look at you. You've been commuting between the hospital and school these days.

198
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:15,039
Your dark circles are so big that I can't even bear to look.

199
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,199
How about this?

200
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,719
I'll talk to the teacher and let him give you more time on the paper.

201
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:24,039
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

202
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,340
Stop smiling like that. It really breaks my heart.

203
00:17:33,045 --> 00:17:34,545
Let's go.

204
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,300
Thank you.

205
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,239
- She's sick. 
 - That's gross.

206
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,910
   

207
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,019
Have you heard?

208
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,240
Zhou Siyue has been released on bail.

209
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,281
This Zhou Siyue is really something.

210
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:58,847
He actually knew that the lawyer was sent by us.

211
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:05,665
Mr. Ma, you made a wrong bet, to begin with.

212
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,979
Instead of Hongguang Tech, we should've chosen Zhou Siyue.

213
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:21,039
Su, do you have any idea?

214
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:31,813
Hire a good lawyer and prepare for a lawsuit.

215
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:37,499
Mr. Ma, we've lost.

216
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:50,519
 Ding Xian, Old Pan is quite efficient. I've picked him up. 

217
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,019
Where are you? I'll go meet you.

218
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:56,299
 Go back to your classes now. 

219
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:59,752
 Focus on your studies. I'll see you soon. 

220
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,460
Okay.

221
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:01,413
You are back.

222
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,959
What's wrong? You got hurt?

223
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:15,359
I wanted to get you a blanket.

224
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,660
But I didn't want to wake you up.

225
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,419
So silly.

226
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:36,992
So,

227
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,360
it's been a long time. Did you miss me?

228
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:46,505
I did.

229
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:58,192
Zhou Siyue.

230
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Come here.

231
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,280
Let me hug you.

232
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:12,440
â™«  Miss you on busy days  â™«

233
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:19,500
â™«  Is it sunny or rainy in your place  â™«

234
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,720
â™«  The distance between us makes me miss you even more  â™«

235
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,999
I'm sorry.

236
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,020
â™«  I'm doing well. No need to worry  â™«

237
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,259
I thought I was strong.

238
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,700
Over the past year,

239
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,159
I did everything I could...

240
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,879
to protect you.

241
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,779
But in the end, I'm the one who makes you worry the most.

242
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,320
I'm sorry, Ding Xian.

243
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:05,600
I disappointed you.

244
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,859
How could I be disappointed?

245
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:21,199
You should trust me.

246
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,000
â™«  Later those misses and encounters  â™«

247
00:22:25,632 --> 00:22:27,572
Zhou Siyue,

248
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,360
I love you so much,

249
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,399
and I'll be with you forever.

250
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,870
No matter what happens.

251
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:43,400
â™«  It always takes time to decipher  â™«

252
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:51,560
â™«  I'll continue flying towards you  â™«

253
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,120
â™«  Where's the furthest happiness?  â™«

254
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,850
Thank you.

255
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,080
â™«  Hands are held tight. Can you feel it?  â™«

256
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,230
   

257
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:08,867
So, you are saying the people of Red Horse also wanted to bail you out?

258
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:12,585
Red Horse wants to solve this thing quietly,

259
00:23:12,585 --> 00:23:14,439
because I know too much.

260
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:17,584
It won't do them any good if I get caught.

261
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:23,640
So, I figured that Red Horse would be the first that wanted to get me out.

262
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:30,639
But our priority now is to find out the real culprit so that we can prove your innocence.

263
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:36,846
Go back and think about who could hold such a strong grudge against you.

264
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:45,252
What's wrong? Why are you looking upset?

265
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:50,064
Did you go to Su Bocong again?

266
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,892
I did that for you.

267
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:05,193
Why are you acting like a child?

268
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,153
Don't go to him anymore.

269
00:24:08,153 --> 00:24:11,366
I know what's on his mind.

270
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,499
I won't do it again.

271
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:23,079
What's the matter? Did he do something to you?

272
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,079
No.

273
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:32,279
It's just... I feel everyone has changed a lot.

274
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,759
I was once so close to him, but now I've got nothing to say to him.

275
00:24:43,005 --> 00:24:45,706
Then don't say anything to him.

276
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:50,852
I will never change, anyway.

277
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,840
I know.

278
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,380
Now, let me show you something.

279
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,379
Wait a sec. I've got something to tell you.

280
00:25:06,065 --> 00:25:10,299
I told you before that I saw Dong Zhengfei's name in Red Horse.

281
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:13,573
After I got back to school, I saw him talking to someone from Hongguang.

282
00:25:13,573 --> 00:25:16,226
Then I found out that right after you got caught,

283
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:18,500
he replaced you and signed a contract with Hongguang.

284
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,999
It doesn't make any sense.

285
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,140
- What are you doing? 
 - You are thinking exactly what I'm thinking.

286
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,919
Look.

287
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,120
I compared the code I wrote with the code of Red Horse's new product.

288
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,800
They look identical at first glance, right?

289
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,080
But look here.

290
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,979
Only one person around me

291
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:47,624
would write an outdated code like this.

292
00:25:47,624 --> 00:25:51,809
Plus, this project was carried out at school,

293
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:56,460
so he's the only one who had the opportunity to learn about this code.

294
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,840
What are you going to do?

295
00:26:02,616 --> 00:26:05,376
I'll wait for him to come to me.

296
00:26:56,203 --> 00:26:58,003
There you are.

297
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:01,229
Could you take a look at this for me?

298
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:07,276
I still can't decode the program you designed for the robot before.

299
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:11,002
It's you.

300
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:15,609
I didn't expect I'd lure you here by a simple E-mail.

301
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:21,849
I didn't expect such a simple trick would make me take the bait either.

302
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,309
Maybe it's because I really don't know how to deal

303
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:27,877
with the virus code you sent me,

304
00:27:27,877 --> 00:27:30,035
so I got worried.

305
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:37,514
If I didn't come here today, would you really hack into my computer?

306
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:40,815
I would never do anything illegal.

307
00:27:46,615 --> 00:27:48,515
You regret it?

308
00:27:51,862 --> 00:27:53,562
A little.

309
00:27:55,115 --> 00:28:00,894
To be honest, I was worried that you wouldn't show up,

310
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:03,794
and I was also afraid that you would.

311
00:28:03,794 --> 00:28:06,874
At this point, there's no need to say those fancy words.

312
00:28:06,874 --> 00:28:09,995
At this point, there's no need for me to lie to you either.

313
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:15,055
Professor Ye told me he thought highly of you.

314
00:28:15,055 --> 00:28:21,115
Although you can be stubborn sometimes, you've got solid professional abilities.

315
00:28:21,115 --> 00:28:25,495
He also said it'd be great if we could learn from each other.

316
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,874
But he's always favored you.

317
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:32,635
Actually, Professor Ye applied for two quotas for going abroad.

318
00:28:33,615 --> 00:28:37,934
So, you and I were never competitors.

319
00:28:44,654 --> 00:28:47,294
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

320
00:28:49,214 --> 00:28:51,214
Now, everything...

321
00:28:53,974 --> 00:28:55,994
is too late.

322
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:09,114
Now, let me explain to you the program you just asked for.

323
00:29:10,855 --> 00:29:15,174
After this, you may not see me for a long time.

324
00:29:15,174 --> 00:29:20,654
It's now or never. It's my pleasure to teach you something today.

325
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,800
Okay.

326
00:29:59,054 --> 00:30:02,375
Su, I've got something to tell you.

327
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:05,375
Good timing, Mr. Ma. I also have something to tell you.

328
00:30:05,394 --> 00:30:06,394
All right.

329
00:30:46,655 --> 00:30:49,795
- A cup of cold-brewed coffee, please. 
 - You got it.

330
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:56,025
Do you remember the first time when we had coffee?

331
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:59,340
It was brought by a neighbor next door from downtown.

332
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:07,794
 My dad said it wouldn't taste bitter anymore this way. 

333
00:31:11,574 --> 00:31:13,015
 Still bitter? 

334
00:31:13,015 --> 00:31:14,815
 No. 

335
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,286
 It's too sweet. 

336
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:18,353
 Try it. 

337
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:21,153
 Come on. Try it. 

338
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:25,913
Thank you.

339
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:30,927
Back then, you said you would never drink this thing again.

340
00:31:32,755 --> 00:31:36,214
Yeah, a lot has changed.

341
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:43,454
Not really.

342
00:31:43,454 --> 00:31:48,973
Look... You are always clean and neatly dressed.

343
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:52,614
 Bocong, why do you have to go back so soon? 

344
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:54,870
 I need to hurry back for the tutoring classes during vacation. 

345
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:58,195
 Shenhai High School has an intensive curriculum. You can be left behind easily. 

346
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,461
 What is Shenhai High School like? 

347
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:06,865
 It's hard to explain. You'll be in the 8th grade soon. 

348
00:32:06,865 --> 00:32:09,294
 You can find out yourself after you enter high school. 

349
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,087
 Don't fail the entrance exams. 

350
00:32:11,087 --> 00:32:14,945
 There's no way I'd fail. Since you could pass the exams, so can I. 

351
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:19,185
 Not only will I pass the exams, I'll also get higher scores than yours. 

352
00:32:19,185 --> 00:32:22,495
 Fine. I know you love to compete with me. 

353
00:32:22,495 --> 00:32:26,479
 But you need to work harder to catch up with me. 

354
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:36,100
That was the last time we met when you were in junior high.

355
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,375
After that...

356
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:42,255
After that, we met again in Shenhai.

357
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:47,994
To be honest, I envy you a lot.

358
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:51,987
We both were admitted to Shenhai High School.

359
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:57,761
I thought your high school life would be like mine,

360
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:02,460
feeling isolated and lonely.

361
00:33:07,334 --> 00:33:12,534
Adolescence can be disturbing.

362
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:22,195
But you always have people around you willing to reach out to you.

363
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:25,555
I'm envious of you,

364
00:33:26,655 --> 00:33:29,094
but also happy for you.

365
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:37,234
Because you won't...

366
00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:41,880
end up a bad person me.

367
00:33:43,352 --> 00:33:46,394
You aren't a bad person.

368
00:33:48,114 --> 00:33:50,895
You are one of the people who've been willing to reach out to me.

369
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,695
Don't you think?

370
00:33:58,753 --> 00:34:02,593
I've been thinking about our secret base.

371
00:34:03,294 --> 00:34:07,966
And I carry this picture with me all the time.

372
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:17,121
 Ding Xian. 

373
00:34:21,415 --> 00:34:25,355
 Hope you can always smile like this. 

374
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,934
 I will. 

375
00:34:27,994 --> 00:34:30,915
You look the same when you smile.

376
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:33,693
So can you.

377
00:34:35,035 --> 00:34:38,434
You can also go back to the way you were.

378
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:52,994
There's something else I want to tell you.

379
00:34:59,075 --> 00:35:04,834
Please give this to Zhou Siyue. The files inside can be of help to his father.

380
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:11,681
Why are you looking at me like this?

381
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,530
Actually, I knew a long time ago that I stood no chance.

382
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:21,160
But I still don't want to go to your wedding.

383
00:35:24,594 --> 00:35:30,314
You don't have to, but I still expect a cash gift from you.

384
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:35,395
As for the cash gift, it'll depend on my mood.

385
00:35:35,395 --> 00:35:37,294
Why are you so stingy?

386
00:35:37,294 --> 00:35:40,955
How am I stingy? Do you remember the review materials from high school?

387
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:51,214
Are you done looking at it?

388
00:35:51,986 --> 00:35:54,087
You like this photo that much?

389
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:56,026
Don't you think it's nice?

390
00:35:56,928 --> 00:35:58,955
Among all my pictures,

391
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:00,655
I looked the best in this one.

392
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:02,475
Because you are a natural beauty.

393
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:04,915
It has nothing to do with the one who took it.

394
00:36:10,455 --> 00:36:12,195
I think you are right.

395
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,710
â™«  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  â™«

396
00:36:19,715 --> 00:36:21,914
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

397
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,474
It's too close.

398
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:25,174
Look how pretty.

399
00:36:25,174 --> 00:36:28,088
I'll take your pictures in the future.

400
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,710
Okay.

401
00:36:29,715 --> 00:36:31,014
It is nice.

402
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:33,154
I want us to take pictures together.

403
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:35,615
All right.

404
00:36:35,615 --> 00:36:37,215
Here it goes.

405
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,510
â™«  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  â™«

406
00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:43,295
One, two.

407
00:36:46,235 --> 00:36:47,795
Look.

408
00:36:47,795 --> 00:36:49,275
You didn't catch that.

409
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:50,375
I did.

410
00:36:51,755 --> 00:36:53,834
I exercise every day.

411
00:36:54,574 --> 00:36:56,354
- We can exercise together someday. 
 - Sure.

412
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,475
- See you. 
 - See you.

413
00:36:59,194 --> 00:37:00,481
Let me help.

414
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:02,081
No need.

415
00:37:03,114 --> 00:37:04,955
You guys go upstairs. Leave this to me.

416
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:06,875
- Okay, be careful. 
 - I will.

417
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:09,804
It's nice to be back, right?

418
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:12,455
Zhou Siyue.

419
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:18,830
â™«  Another day that's gone  â™«

420
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:20,315
 Siyue! Siyue! 

421
00:37:20,315 --> 00:37:23,350
â™«  It's been a long day since you're gone  â™«

422
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:24,454
 The key. 

423
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,775
â™«  Would you hear me...  â™«

424
00:37:26,775 --> 00:37:28,314
 Don't. 

425
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:32,235
 You lazy bone. 

426
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:33,475
 Ding Xian. 

427
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:34,588
 What are you standing there for? 

428
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,280
 Go ahead and unload your stuff. Hurry. 

429
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
 Okay. 

430
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:41,074
 Ding Juncong. 

431
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,580
â™«  You got to stay in the light, all right  â™«

432
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,300
Do you need my help?

433
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,930
â™«  It's been a long day  â™«

434
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,950
â™«  A long day, I haven't heard from you  â™«

435
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,510
â™«  And I've been waiting too  â™«

436
00:38:09,615 --> 00:38:11,795
What? Don't remember your home?

437
00:38:12,774 --> 00:38:14,374
I do.

438
00:38:14,374 --> 00:38:18,214
I just thought that I'd never come back again.

439
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:23,154
You also thought you'd never talk to me again.

440
00:38:25,606 --> 00:38:28,886
I've apologized for that, haven't I?

441
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,720
So, what do I have to do to make you forgive me?

442
00:38:41,434 --> 00:38:43,394
My parents are here.

443
00:38:43,394 --> 00:38:44,394
 Old Zhou. 

444
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:46,354
 Old Zhou. 

445
00:38:46,354 --> 00:38:48,394
- Old Zhou. 
 - Wencheng, you are here.

446
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:51,434
Why didn't you tell us you were moving back?

447
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:55,035
We were going to invite you guys over for dinner after cleaning the house.

448
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:55,617
That's right.

449
00:38:55,617 --> 00:38:57,268
We didn't want to bother you.

450
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,475
Now that it's summer vacation,

451
00:38:58,475 --> 00:39:00,434
Xianxian and Siyue are back, too.

452
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:02,975
- Let's find a time and get together. 
 - That's right. Come to my house.

453
00:39:02,975 --> 00:39:05,755
- Siyue. 
 - We came here to help you unpack.

454
00:39:05,755 --> 00:39:07,847
- Let me help you. 
 - You don't have to...

455
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:12,713
Xianxian.

456
00:39:12,713 --> 00:39:13,713
Siyue.

457
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:21,144
- Siyue, are you okay? 
 - I sprained my ankle when I moved the stuff.

458
00:39:21,144 --> 00:39:22,534
Really? Let me see.

459
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:23,534
- Hurry. 
 - No. It's okay.

460
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:25,955
- I'll go get you some medicine. 
 - Let me help you. Let me.

461
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:29,035
- I can do it. 
 - You can't carry it alone. How do you feel?

462
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:30,315
- How do you feel? 
 - Much better.

463
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,760
Siyue finally moved back.

464
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:39,874
Where are his parents?

465
00:39:40,734 --> 00:39:43,074
They are playing Mahjong with my parents.

466
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:48,415
Shadi,

467
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:49,515
look!

468
00:39:53,286 --> 00:39:55,186
When did she post that?

469
00:39:56,464 --> 00:40:00,215
No wonder Jiang Chen insisted on taking Keke on a trip.

470
00:40:00,215 --> 00:40:02,607
As it turned out, he had a plan.

471
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:04,007
So nice.

472
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,635
It's very pretty.

473
00:40:08,795 --> 00:40:11,315
It must look good on my finger, too.

474
00:40:12,094 --> 00:40:13,415
If you like it so much,

475
00:40:13,415 --> 00:40:15,430
let Song Ziqi buy one for you.

476
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,334
Enough about me.

477
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,600
How long are you going to keep your relationship from his parents?

478
00:40:22,204 --> 00:40:24,194
What are you worried about?

479
00:40:24,194 --> 00:40:26,039
His parents like you very much, don't they?

480
00:40:27,615 --> 00:40:29,215
They do.

481
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:33,175
But we still need to wait for the right time.

482
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:36,454
Their family has finally settled down.

483
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,140
We'll tell them later.

484
00:40:40,254 --> 00:40:41,341
Don't worry about me.

485
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:42,781
Worry about yourself.

486
00:40:45,534 --> 00:40:48,234
 Song Ziqi, check your phone. 

487
00:40:51,254 --> 00:40:53,475
Let's wait and see. I'll win the next round.

488
00:40:53,475 --> 00:40:55,395
You said it in the last round.

489
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:02,194
Good for Jiang Chen.

490
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:03,987
He's getting married.

491
00:41:05,054 --> 00:41:06,834
I told him he could make it.

492
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:08,453
He was worried for nothing.

493
00:41:08,453 --> 00:41:10,353
- You knew it? 
 - Yeah.

494
00:41:11,275 --> 00:41:13,354
Why didn't he tell me?

495
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:16,354
He said you couldn't keep secrets.

496
00:41:16,354 --> 00:41:18,615
If he told you, everybody would know.

497
00:41:18,615 --> 00:41:20,994
I need to find out how much it cost him.

498
00:41:21,934 --> 00:41:23,095
Why?

499
00:41:23,095 --> 00:41:24,814
You are also in a hurry?

500
00:41:25,892 --> 00:41:29,995
Why do you think she asked me to check my phone?

501
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:31,595
That was a hint.

502
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:42,894
So expensive.

503
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,561
Then I have to start saving money.

504
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:49,774
You are getting way ahead of yourself.

505
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:51,434
It's called being prepared.

506
00:41:51,434 --> 00:41:53,795
Maybe I'll get married before you do.

507
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,441
How can you be faster than me?

508
00:41:57,975 --> 00:42:00,660
Think about it. Your father has just recovered.

509
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,040
You need to wait for the right time to tell them.

510
00:42:05,415 --> 00:42:06,795
Why would I wait?

511
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:10,995
I didn't tell them because I've been too busy.

512
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,929
But this time I am going to tell them.

513
00:42:15,275 --> 00:42:17,315
Anyway, I'll move faster than you.

514
00:42:18,574 --> 00:42:19,895
No way.

515
00:42:19,895 --> 00:42:21,754
No way?

516
00:42:24,215 --> 00:42:27,075
Come on. Pass you. I...

517
00:42:31,995 --> 00:42:33,194
I miss that time.

518
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:36,981
Come here.

519
00:42:46,906 --> 00:42:48,434
Classmate.

520
00:42:48,434 --> 00:42:50,439
- Do you go to Shenhai High School? 
 - Yes.

521
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,475
I graduated from there.

522
00:42:53,434 --> 00:42:54,934
Nice to see you, Senior Brother.

523
00:42:55,995 --> 00:42:58,354
She used to be my deskmate.

524
00:42:58,354 --> 00:42:59,754
Hello, Senior Sister.

525
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,715
Then, we are leaving now.

526
00:43:02,715 --> 00:43:04,263
Bye, Seniors.

527
00:43:09,014 --> 00:43:11,035
You are so childish.

528
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:12,659
What's wrong?

529
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:14,595
Let them envy us.

530
00:43:16,387 --> 00:43:19,646
We are grown-ups now, and we are allowed to do PDA.

531
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:28,735
I'll take you to meet my parents later.

532
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:34,107
Why so sudden?

533
00:43:34,107 --> 00:43:35,207
Sudden?

534
00:43:36,254 --> 00:43:38,494
I didn't plan to keep it a secret anyway.

535
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:44,135
But your father has just recovered.

536
00:43:44,981 --> 00:43:49,633
What if your parents don't like me?

537
00:43:50,634 --> 00:43:52,394
That's what you worry about?

538
00:43:53,135 --> 00:43:54,874
Aren't they nice to you?

539
00:43:54,874 --> 00:43:55,874
They are.

540
00:43:56,955 --> 00:43:58,694
But that's different.

541
00:43:58,694 --> 00:44:00,313
We were...

542
00:44:01,194 --> 00:44:03,267
only friends before.

543
00:44:03,267 --> 00:44:06,394
But now, I'm your girlfriend.

544
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:10,074
If they think you are out of my league...

545
00:44:12,254 --> 00:44:14,034
What are you talking about?

546
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:20,573
Ding Xian,

547
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,454
being with you is my biggest blessing.

548
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:28,334
I'm the one who's not good enough for you.

549
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:35,054
Moreover, my mom liked you so much back then.

550
00:44:35,054 --> 00:44:37,135
Even I got jealous sometimes.

551
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:39,035
You think too much.

552
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:49,414
I didn't expect you'd say something like this.

553
00:44:51,213 --> 00:44:52,713
But it's true.

554
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:57,755
Since I'm so adorable, I'm sure your mom likes me.

555
00:44:58,594 --> 00:45:01,334
Your mindset changed so fast.

556
00:45:01,334 --> 00:45:03,515
Don't push your luck.

557
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:12,094
Didn't you just say that being with me was your biggest blessing?

558
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:16,795
Around this time before,

559
00:45:16,795 --> 00:45:19,274
the kids had come home from school.

560
00:45:19,914 --> 00:45:22,555
Feels like it was just yesterday.

561
00:45:23,494 --> 00:45:25,795
How time flies. Now they've all grown up.

562
00:45:25,795 --> 00:45:27,081
Tell me about it.

563
00:45:27,081 --> 00:45:29,135
You can relax now.

564
00:45:29,135 --> 00:45:30,930
I still have a teenage son.

565
00:45:32,715 --> 00:45:35,094
When Xianxian gets married and has a kid,

566
00:45:35,094 --> 00:45:38,114
as a grandmother, I'll have to help her look after the kid.

567
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:40,115
There's no end for me.

568
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:42,759
Gets...

569
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:46,695
Xianxian has a boyfriend?

570
00:45:47,715 --> 00:45:49,994
Siyue didn't tell you?

571
00:45:52,674 --> 00:45:54,174
No.

572
00:45:55,354 --> 00:45:57,555
You know Siyue.

573
00:45:57,555 --> 00:46:00,154
He keeps everything to himself.

574
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,460
Hey.

575
00:46:05,334 --> 00:46:06,734
Do you remember

576
00:46:06,734 --> 00:46:09,368
we once talked about an arranged marriage between them when they were little?

577
00:46:09,368 --> 00:46:12,354
I do. Back then they were still little kids.

578
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:14,075
That was many years ago.

579
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:17,194
Parents back then liked to arrange marriages for their kids.

580
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:19,285
It doesn't count anymore.

581
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:21,234
Besides,

582
00:46:22,054 --> 00:46:23,734
with our situation,

583
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:27,094
we don't want to burden your family.

584
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,315
That's right. It was many years ago.

585
00:46:30,315 --> 00:46:32,415
It doesn't count anymore.

586
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:33,980
Well...

587
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,360
That's right.

588
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,953
They really broke off the engagement?

589
00:46:47,953 --> 00:46:49,834
I wouldn't put it that way.

590
00:46:50,534 --> 00:46:52,154
According to my mom,

591
00:46:52,154 --> 00:46:54,714
what they said before doesn't count anymore.

592
00:46:55,734 --> 00:46:59,054
No wonder my mom looked so upset after she came back home.

593
00:46:59,814 --> 00:47:02,037
Now I know why.

594
00:47:03,301 --> 00:47:05,421
What should we do now?

595
00:47:06,706 --> 00:47:09,655
I don't know why my mom said that all of a sudden.

596
00:47:09,655 --> 00:47:13,861
We'll have to take one step at a time.

597
00:47:13,861 --> 00:47:16,381
I knew it wouldn't go smoothly.

598
00:47:16,975 --> 00:47:19,693
Since she wanted to break off the arranged engagement,

599
00:47:19,693 --> 00:47:22,900
it means she doesn't allow us to be together.

600
00:47:24,814 --> 00:47:27,607
Don't overthink it yet.

601
00:47:27,607 --> 00:47:29,994
You are tired, right? Go to bed first.

602
00:47:29,994 --> 00:47:32,154
 How am I supposed to sleep? 

603
00:47:34,534 --> 00:47:37,201
Just relax and go to sleep.

604
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:39,500
I'll take you to a place tomorrow.

605
00:47:42,494 --> 00:47:43,854
Then, goodnight.

606
00:47:43,854 --> 00:47:44,854
Goodnight.

607
00:47:52,280 --> 00:48:02,330
