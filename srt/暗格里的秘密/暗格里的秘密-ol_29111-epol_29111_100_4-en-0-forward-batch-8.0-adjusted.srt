00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:18,460

2
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,471
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:31,057
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:34,937
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:40,109
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,815
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:44,815 --> 00:00:48,464
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:55,523
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:55,523 --> 00:01:03,919
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:09,458
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,083
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,396
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:17,649
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:23,175
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,863
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:25,863 --> 00:01:28,215
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:28,215 --> 00:01:35,501
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:39,355

19
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,322

20
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,320

21
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,540
Jealous... Jealous.

22
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,930
Good morning.

23
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,870
Xianxian.

24
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,576
Dad.

25
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,760
Your mom said that you want a cell phone.

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,043
How about this?

27
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:20,658
You can use mine and I can use the feature phone.

28
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,080
It's okay, Dad.

29
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,560
I just want a cell phone to contact my classmates.

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,147
It's nothing serious.

31
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:31,240
I'll ask them to call our landline.

32
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,939
Okay. So...

33
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:37,590
Maybe when the time is right, get your classmates to hang out at our apartment,

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,313
so that you can bond with them.

35
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:42,310
Okay.

36
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,900
You didn't write this, did you?

37
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,570
The handwriting is pretty neat.

38
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,700
Zhou Siyue wrote that.

39
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,511
I fell asleep during the English class and he helped me with my notes.

40
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:02,900
You fell asleep again during class!

41
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,750
Siyue is a nice kid.

42
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,260
He helped you to switch seats and made notes for you.

43
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,143
He does look after you.

44
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:14,660
Dad.

45
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,077
How do you know about the seats?

46
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,630
Did you ask him to do all that?

47
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,960
No wonder I saw you talking to him the other day.

48
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,110
And he has been looking after me.

49
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,320
No, Xianxian.

50
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,440
I just don't want you to be bullied.

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,263
That's why I told Siyue that...

52
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,630
Dad!

53
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,960
Please don't do that again. I don't need you to do all those things.

54
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,550
I can take care of my own business.

55
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,830
Stay out of it.

56
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:56,360
Besides, I don't want someone else to do things he doesn't like because of me.

57
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,060
How is he doing something he doesn't like?

58
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,506
Dad and Siyue...

59
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,220
Good morning.

60
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,930
Morning.

61
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,940
Why are you all alone? Where is your deskmate?

62
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,150
I don't know.

63
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,540
Did you fall out?

64
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,540
No.

65
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,902
We were never close.

66
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,707
I'm going and memorize the text at the teacher's office.

67
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,270
Hey, you...

68
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,970
Did you piss your deskmate off?

69
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,550
She stood me up this morning.

70
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,160
I was almost late.

71
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,920
How could I have pissed her off?

72
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,420
Huh?

73
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:22,120
To the other friend, I like wine.  The older, the better.

74
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,620
You did well.

75
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,330
Clearly, you spent some effort. Keep up the good work.

76
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,720
Thank you, Miss.

77
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,640
Your deskmate is Zhou Siyue, right?

78
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,500
You should practice with him more.

79
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,030
He has a standard accent.

80
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,550
Don't feel shy.

81
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,417
It's common for classmates to help each other.

82
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:43,760
I've troubled him enough already.

83
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,560
All right, go back.

84
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,506
I merely took a sip of your coke! You are so...

85
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,350
Sorry, I...

86
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,180
I didn't mean that. Sorry.

87
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,777
Just clean it up when you get back to the classroom.

88
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:03,477
Sorry.

89
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,690
What's there to look at?

90
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,160
Let's go. Come on.

91
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,740
Sorry.

92
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,010
It's okay. I don't need it.

93
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,710
Keep it on.

94
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,210
You are not trying to get back to the classroom like that, are you?

95
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,810
Thank you.

96
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,150
Why didn't you wait for me this morning?

97
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,270
I know it all.

98
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,440
My dad asked you to take care of me, didn't he?

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,400
That's what that was about?

100
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,350
Sorry for your trouble.

101
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,940
If you don't want to help me, you can stop.

102
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,923
What's with the smile?

103
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:19,260
Never mind.

104
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,180
I don't think you would remember.

105
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,750
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,715
Tell me!

107
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,880
I actually owe you a favor.

108
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,850
When I was five, I went back to my grandpa's place.

109
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,487
There was a flood, so I stayed at your place.

110
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,390
 Hey. I want to use the toilet.

111
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,524
 It's just outside. You can go by yourself.

112
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,470
 You wet the bed. Shame on you!

113
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,390
 You don't have a toilet.

114
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,110
 I can't hold it anymore. That's why...

115
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,110
 It's right outside.

116
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,310
 I don't know how to use it.

117
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,110
 How could you not know how to use a toilet at your age?

118
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,730
 I'm telling my mom.

119
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,270
 Don't tell your mom.

120
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,860
 I'll take you to fun places when you visit the city.

121
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,413
You had such an awkward moment.

122
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,213
I can't believe you...

123
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,310
If you can tell the others about this, you will be dead.

124
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,280
So, where are you taking me?

125
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,350
What?

126
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,510
You promised!

127
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,670
You are taking advantage of the situation.

128
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,150
Hey.

129
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,140
How could you do that?

130
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,010
1:00 p.m, Saturday.

131
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,930
Wait for me in front of your building.

132
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,120
Did you leave to be thief last night?

133
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,590
I couldn't sleep.

134
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,910
You look pretty energetic to me.

135
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,950
Help Ding Juncong with math later.

136
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,010
I have plans this afternoon.

137
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,330
What plan could you have on a weekend?

138
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,900
I need to do the blackboard newspaper at school.

139
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,510
The school inspection is next week.

140
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,120
I thought you lost the election.

141
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,960
I'm just helping out.

142
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,670
Try not to do that next time.

143
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,960
Your effort will be in vain. And it's taking your time for learning.

144
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,940
Okay.

145
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,535
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

146
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,595
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

147
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,645
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

148
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:33,230
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

149
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,530
Checkmate!

150
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,500
- Withdraw!
 - Don't! Don't do that.

151
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,850
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

152
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,763
Li.

153
00:10:40,763 --> 00:10:43,303
- Zhou, you are here.
 - Playing chess, are you?

154
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:51,140
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

155
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,400
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

156
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,900
Checkmate!

157
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:01,040
- Are you sure?
 - Checkmate!

158
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,610
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

159
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,930
No withdrawing.

160
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,220
I'm sorry about this.

161
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,650
I didn't see it clearly.

162
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,230
Come on, Uncle. That's the fifth time!

163
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,690
Just one step!

164
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,670
Just one!

165
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,640
There you are.

166
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,030
Uncle, I have to go now.

167
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,030
You guys play.

168
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,260
Are you afraid to lose?

169
00:11:23,443 --> 00:11:24,980
What's with you today?

170
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,213
Uncle, let me.

171
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:27,540
What are you doing?

172
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,940
It's all your fault. You took so long.

173
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,540
Little snail.

174
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,400
Girls are all like that.

175
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,720
What's that smell?

176
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,920
Hm?

177
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Nothing.

178
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,070
Fried chicken wings.

179
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,910
- Thank you, owner.
 - All right.

180
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,280
Let me pay for this.

181
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,440
I'm not used to letting a girl pay.

182
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,340
Sounds like you hang out with girls quite often.

183
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,840
How is that possible?

184
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,221
Just eat your food.

185
00:12:08,753 --> 00:12:11,399
Are there any fun places in Shenhai?

186
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,199
Fun places?

187
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,880
The Science Museum.

188
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,790
And the Seaward Theater is also nice.

189
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,300
I know a bridge nearby with a really nice night view.

190
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,550
It used to be a fishing village.

191
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:31,126
As the economy has developed, this place has been booming.

192
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,150
Sometimes I feel like you are invincible.

193
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,270
You know everything, and there's nothing you can't do.

194
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:44,902
Compared with you, I'm more than enough.

195
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
And you have lost yourself over a compliment.

196
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:53,013
Ding Xian.

197
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,790
Actually, when you are not so stubborn, you can be...

198
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,960
Can be what?

199
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,754
You can be quite normal.

200
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,220
You are the one who's not normal!

201
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:13,463
All right.

202
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,470
If you have any place you want to go, just tell me in advance.

203
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,937
I will take you there when I'm free.

204
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,600
Okay.

205
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,900
Xianxian.

206
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,233
Senior!

207
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:29,710
What are you doing here?

208
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,910
I'm doing some shopping.

209
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,280
Is this your deskmate?

210
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,280
You are pretty close.

211
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:40,663
It's okay.

212
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,150
I think I've heard of him.

213
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,694
He's Zhou Siyue, right?

214
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:47,640
Yes. Do you know him?

215
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,710
He's the man of the hour. I heard a lot about him.

216
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,550
Right. You heard the CDs I gave you last time, right?

217
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,350
Yes, after listening, the teacher praised me.

218
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,623
Thank you, Senior.

219
00:13:56,623 --> 00:13:58,000
No need to be polite with me.

220
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,407
I'll get you several more and ask Uncle Ding to bring them back.

221
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:01,670
Great.

222
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,670
Okay.

223
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,320
Go back to your meal.

224
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,930
Okay, Senior! See you.

225
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,030
See you.

226
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,670
Why did you eat all my fish balls?

227
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,740
You were having a pleasant conversation.

228
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,350
How could you be in the mood to eat?

229
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,000
But I didn't ask you to finish them all.

230
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,850
There's only one left.

231
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,590
I'm full.

232
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:43,002
Let's go to a movie this afternoon.

233
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,550
My treat.

234
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,150
All right.

235
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,500
What do you have in mind?

236
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,640
This one.

237
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,260
A Hollywood blockbuster.

238
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,790
"2012?"

239
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,640
Yes.

240
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,880
Okay. Wait for me.

241
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,380
I'll go get the tickets.

242
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,710
Sorry.

243
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,986
What are you doing?

244
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,980
Thank you.

245
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,900
Thank you.

246
00:15:43,303 --> 00:15:44,590
What's this?

247
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,040
3D glasses.

248
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,870
Have you never seen these before?

249
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,790
I have.

250
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,861
Of course.

251
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,550
Let's go.

252
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:08,613
 Sorry.

253
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,240
Sorry.

254
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:36,960
This row.

255
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,813
Siyue!

256
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:43,113
Ding Xian.

257
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,710
Are you a little sad?

258
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,400
Why would I be sad?

259
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,760
You should be sad.

260
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,900
Idiot!

261
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,317
I have returned the favor.

262
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,830
We are clear.

263
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,200
I won't need your help anymore.

264
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Really?

265
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,680
The final exam is coming.

266
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,632
I wonder if someone will have questions for me.

267
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,070
Don't worry, that won't be me.

268
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,964
Ding Xian!

269
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,517
The class adviser!

270
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,280
Ding Xian! Why are you running?

271
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,470
Ding Xian, stop running.

272
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:19,787
Hello?

273
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:21,590
 Hello, sir. Are you buying an apartment?

274
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,640
No.

275
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,350
 It doesn't hurt to hear about it.

276
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,780
 Buying an apartment with a loan is a great choice right now.

277
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,520
I'm not getting a loan, either.

278
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,180
 Sir, even if you don't want an apartment, you can check the loans.

279
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,400
Why would I get a loan if I'm not buying an apartment?

280
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,160
Is he gone?

281
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,650
I have a place to stay.

282
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,130
And I don't need...

283
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,180
No, I do need money.

284
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,920
About your interest, let me tell you.

285
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,350
What's your interest rate?

286
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:53,310
 You call that a low-interest rate?

287
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,800
 Listen!  You can't fool me.

288
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,800
 Do you know what I do for a living?

289
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,160
 I'm a teacher. I teach math. This is nothing...

290
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:08,912
 Keep talking.

291
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:11,023
This is not right.

292
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,900
Just a second. Don't hang up. Just a second.

293
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:19,744
Hello?

294
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:23,650
 Let's do it this way. Tell me how did you get the interest?

295
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:30,080
So, what do you think

296
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,320
the end of the world in 2012 would be like?

297
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,560
I think it would be like in the movie.

298
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,430
Earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and so on.

299
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,400
I don't think so.

300
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,430
If humanity...

301
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,110
is really facing distinction,

302
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,760
then there should be fireworks all over the sky.

303
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,830
To welcome death with the last bit of beauty.

304
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,430
Can you think of something good?

305
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,822
For example, what are we doing in 2012?

306
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,890
I might be...

307
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,190
watching West Lake in Hangzhou.

308
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,830
Hangzhou, again!

309
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,950
How about you?

310
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,960
I would be in Huaqing, doing experiments.

311
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,840
You want to get into Huaqing.

312
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,366
That makes sense.

313
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:33,830
You have such a good performance, you will get in.

314
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,990
And what about you?

315
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:44,760
Don't you want to see some better scenery?

316
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
I...

317
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,720
I can't do that.

318
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,210
A bigger goal...

319
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:58,608
will make a worthier challenge.

320
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,870
Besides,

321
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,270
I haven't seen many people who work harder than you do.

322
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,730
Trust yourself. You can do it.

323
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,540
I'll tell you a saying.

324
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,750
"There is still glory on the other side."

325
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,580
Nice shot!

326
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,130
I'll be back soon. You guys play.

327
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,230
There you are.

328
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,453
Nice work, Song.

329
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,453
I'm so tired.

330
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,430
Siyue, will you bring Little Monster to our New Year's Eve party?

331
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,900
Little Monster?

332
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,180
I thought you all find her annoying.

333
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,800
Why do you want to spend New Year's Eve with her?

334
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,780
We had some misunderstandings.

335
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,550
Later we found that she's a little stubborn, but she's quite a fun person.

336
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,430
How about you, Jiang Chen?

337
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,780
Do you want to join us for New Year's Eve?

338
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,213
You should have told me sooner.

339
00:23:13,213 --> 00:23:15,513
I have an appointment with someone else.

340
00:23:15,513 --> 00:23:19,380
It seems that you made some new friends in high school and forgot all about your sworn brothers.

341
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,950
We invited him to play basketball, and look how he's dressed.

342
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,590
I'm quite busy. It's hard for me to visit you.

343
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,527
- Just great.
 - Who are you trying to fool here?

344
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:28,960
- Come on, let's go. Let's play.
 - Just go.

345
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,096
Forget about him. Come on.

346
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:33,096
Have a good game!

347
00:23:33,096 --> 00:23:35,729
What did Little Monster write on your card?

348
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:36,830
What card?

349
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,780
The festival card she made. Shadi and I both got one. Didn't you get one?

350
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,283
I'm heading to school now, Mom.

351
00:23:46,283 --> 00:23:48,593
Siyue, just a second.

352
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:54,880
Wanxian told me that she has been making Xianxian Chinese medicine to make her more energetic.

353
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,090
You work so hard.

354
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,970
Let me do the same for you.

355
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,640
I'll pass.

356
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,760
Wanxian said that the medicine is really bitter.

357
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,900
But it's effective.

358
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,100
I've seen Xianxian taking it every day.

359
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,060
Really?

360
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,910
Good morning.

361
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,420
Morning.

362
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,800
Did your mom make you Chinese medicine again?

363
00:24:28,673 --> 00:24:31,793
My mom said that it's winter.

364
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:34,600
I need more energy.

365
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,580
You are so weak that you look sleepy during classes all the time.

366
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,310
You should get more energy.

367
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,940
I'm not weak!

368
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,070
Just drink it.

369
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,160
Is it really that bitter?

370
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,674
It's really bitter.

371
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,580
It's candy.

372
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,970
The bitterness is gone, right?

373
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,137
It's blueberry flavor.

374
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,451
I thought you don't like candy.

375
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,610
Let's get to the classroom.

376
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,250
Aren't you coming?

377
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:40,040
Song Ziqi needs to pick something up from me.

378
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,176
You should go.

379
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:56,830
Let's spend the holiday together tonight.

380
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:00,090
You know that I'm not interested in festivals.

381
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,250
Can you not be the exception every time?

382
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,110
You leave earlier every year.

383
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,140
Can't we spend New Year's Eve together once?

384
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,180
Students, it's time for morning class.

385
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,490
Turn to Page 6 of the English text book.

386
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,380
Read the text from yesterday together.

387
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,830
Where's my stuff?

388
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,414
I know it all.

389
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:42,480
Kong Shadi and Song Ziqi have received your holiday card.

390
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,160
It's almost New Year, and I haven't received mine as your deskmate.

391
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,370
I thought you didn't like festivals.

392
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,440
I did say that, but I didn't say I don't like gifts.

393
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,229
Everyone except me has got one.

394
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,538
Zhou Siyue! Ding Xian!

395
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,410
Stand outside the classroom.

396
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:35,170
I never said that I didn't prepare one for you.

397
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,940
I drew this myself.

398
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,420
The original one was ruined by my brother, so I got you this one.

399
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,700
It arrived a little late.

400
00:27:45,786 --> 00:27:48,949
Don't look at it now. Check it when you get home.

401
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
It's not bad.

402
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:11,420
You didn't go out with us the other day, and you are not learning at home.

403
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,480
With the time you spent on this card, you could have raised your math score by 20.

404
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,600
You should know when to take a win. Give it back if you don't want it.

405
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,902
Give it back!

406
00:28:21,386 --> 00:28:22,350
You two!

407
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,400
Come to my office now.

408
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,539
Copying the text 10 times! That's cruel!

409
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:36,741
It's 15 times!

410
00:28:36,741 --> 00:28:40,460
Aunt Liu saw you getting lectured. He added 5 times on top.

411
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,280
You two are so unlucky that you hit the tiger's belly.

412
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,640
He's going through menopause.

413
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,160
You should be thankful that he didn't put in an extra set of exercises at the end of this month.

414
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,510
Xianxian, are you free on New Year's Day?

415
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,310
Let's hang out.

416
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,520
I'll think about it.

417
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,560
I don't even know how I did on the math test last time.

418
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,880
You missed it the last time.

419
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,210
You have no idea how miserable I was.

420
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,190
It's not fun at all to hang out with the two of them.

421
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,680
How about this?

422
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,210
If I can do well on the math test this afternoon, I'll join you.

423
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,210
Really? It's a deal.

424
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:20,210
I hope you can do great on the math test this afternoon.

425
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,664
Here, take another bite.

426
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:24,860
You need the energy to keep writing.

427
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,256
With her blessing, you will be ruined on the math test.

428
00:29:29,256 --> 00:29:30,760
Shut up!

429
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,940
What?

430
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,160
You said that we were not fun to hang out with.

431
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,130
Like we want to take you out. Am I right, Siyue?

432
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,950
This is not Shadi's fault.

433
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,890
You are quite boring.

434
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,870
That hurt my feelings deeply.

435
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,686
If you don't want your feelings to get hurt, why did you eat so much of my lunch?

436
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,420
Sorry, it's...

437
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:58,110
I didn't want you to be tired, so I wanted to share your burden.

438
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,160
That's sweet of you.

439
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,940
Since you are so sweet, why don't you help me out a little?

440
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,080
I'm a little hungry.

441
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:10,390
I mean, the handwriting will be different.

442
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:13,177
You ate all the meat!

443
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:15,357
I'll do it.

444
00:30:17,665 --> 00:30:20,555
Don't say that my handwriting is ugly later.

445
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,610
Here, Deng Wanwan.

446
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,010
Send out the test papers.

447
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:40,819
Xianxian, how did you do?

448
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,130

449
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:45,430
Don't even ask.

450
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:48,110
The answer is that I can't go out.

451
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,633
You are making progress.

452
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:51,633
Let me see.

453
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,790
You scored twice as she has.

454
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,640
Enough.

455
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,310
Stop chatting.

456
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,190
Look at your scores.

457
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,040
How can you be in the mood to chat right now?

458
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,600
Aren't you worried?

459
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,680
The holiday is coming and you have all lost your focus.

460
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,706
Being late, sleeping, and chatting during classes.

461
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:24,990
You just make me proud.

462
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:29,726
Some of you haven't learned much over the semester

463
00:31:29,726 --> 00:31:32,590
but got familiar with the others sitting around.

464
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,900
They just keep talking all the time.

465
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,130
We are rearranging the seats according to the final test result.

466
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,960
I'll see who you are going to chat with by then.

467
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,152
Get back to your seats!

468
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,680
No one leaves before I say the class is over.

469
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,820
Find your papers!

470
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,590
What are you sighing for?

471
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,330
Do I owe you anything or what?

472
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,081
Check the second to the last question on the test paper.

473
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,100
Question 17.

474
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,870
That's a question of 10 points.

475
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,290
We are switching seats next semester.

476
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,529
Where are you going to find a deskmate as nice as me?

477
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,010
Stop flattering yourself.

478
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:31,500
Are you really going to stay home studying during the holiday?

479
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,530
 He said that you were making progress.

480
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,760
This is nothing.

481
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,540
I only passed two people.

482
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,210
Ranks and scores are not the same.

483
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,710
No one can progress overnight.

484
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,540
You've been stressed all the time.

485
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,840
You should relax a little.

486
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,300
Besides, you said that passing one person is enough.

487
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,610
Have you changed your mind?

488
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,830
The final exam is right behind the holiday.

489
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,863
I hope the next semester...

490
00:33:09,943 --> 00:33:11,743
What?

491
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:18,010
I hope the next semester can be easier.

492
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,040
I have had a hard time keeping up already.

493
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,070
 From the first year to the third is just a blink of an eye.

494
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,760
Easier.

495
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,830
Okay.

496
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,160
But I have to tell you, this is just the first year.

497
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,700
It will only get harder.

498
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,840
Don't say that I never reminded you.

499
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,830
I'm going to say this again.

500
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,480
NCEE...

501
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,050
 is a competition with countless contestants and few winners.

502
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,310
Fine.

503
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,760
You remembered that.

504
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,995
But... don't just pretend that you are working hard.

505
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:54,130
The result will reveal the truth.

506
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,400
Enough of that.

507
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,040
The New Year's Day holiday is just three days long.

508
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,520
Don't spend it on slacking off.

509
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,560
When you come back from the holiday, whoever makes the same mistakes

510
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,280
will copy the question 10 times.

511
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,560
Do you understand?

512
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,880
 Yes.

513
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,800
Go home.

514
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,370
 School is over!

515
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,000
Let's go.

516
00:34:19,576 --> 00:34:20,917
Come on, let's go.

517
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,500

518
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,390
 We are rearranging the seats according to the final test result.

519
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:57,070
 I'll see who you are going to chat with by then.

520
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,320
 Work hard if you don't want another deskmate.

521
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,510
Look. Those two young people look good together.

522
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:19,610
Xianxian hasn't left her room for the whole day.

523
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,841
Is she all right?

524
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:22,530
I'll go check on her.

525
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:26,690
The others would want their children to spend more time learning.

526
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,130
And you keep visiting her room.

527
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,230
You will delay her process.

528
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,270
She needs rest.

529
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,953
And it's a festival.

530
00:35:32,953 --> 00:35:34,150
Don't keep worrying for no reason.

531
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,080
She will come out if she's tired.

532
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,560
Forget about it.

533
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,150
Here. Have some fruit.

534
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,840
Mom, I want to go play with the fireworks.

535
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,150
No.

536
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,000
- I don't care! I want to go!
 - Lower your voice!

537
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,020
- I want to go! I want to play with the fireworks.
 - Stop yelling!

538
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,420
All right! All right! Fine!

539
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,070
Our child wants to go play. Just take him out.

540
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,470
People say that it's more festive outside.

541
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,280
We can go together.

542
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,230
Xianxian can take a walk with us.

543
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,700
Wait here. I'll go get your sister.

544
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,249
Great.

545
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:01,919
All you care about is playing.

546
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:05,119
Xianxian!

547
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,120
- All right.
 - Take a picture!

548
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,360
It will be out soon.

549
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,860
Hurry up!

550
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,360
How do I look?

551
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,390
Nice.

552
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,870
Really?

553
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,670
Lower.

554
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,120
Like this.

555
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,470
Wait. Check the camera and see how I look!

556
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,230
Okay. I looked. You look nice.

557
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,800
- Really?
 - Yes.

558
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,050
Are my legs in the picture?

559
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,390
Okay.

560
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,230
Come on, the fireworks will be gone.

561
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,430
Okay. I got it. Look.

562
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,390
What is that?

563
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,900
You asked me to squat down for the picture.

564
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,540
Where is my face?

565
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,030
What should we do?

566
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,453
The firework is almost out.

567
00:37:03,453 --> 00:37:04,973
Get me a new one.

568
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,363
Okay. I'll go get you some.

569
00:37:07,172 --> 00:37:08,950
They are all yours.

570
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,990
You should practice first.

571
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,460
All my money is gone again.

572
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,930
You spoiled her.

573
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,950
What can I do?

574
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,670
We grew up together.

575
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,610
Everyone will know if she makes a scene.

576
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,040
I have to make her happy.

577
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,220
Do you know Pavlov's dog?

578
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,730
That's me.

579
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,870
I don't know if there's a conditioned reflex,

580
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,030
but you do look like a dog.

581
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,910
I'll bite you!

582
00:37:42,003 --> 00:37:44,020
Right, the New Year countdown is beginning.

583
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,980
Let's go watch the fireworks.

584
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,560
You are not in the mood?

585
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
What's wrong?

586
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,651
We don't have enough people.

587
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,370
I keep feeling something is missing.

588
00:37:58,646 --> 00:38:00,870
You want to ask Little Monster to come out, don't you?

589
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,840
Master Zhou, I didn't notice this before.

590
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,040
You are worried that she will feel lonely staying home by herself, right?

591
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,343
How is that possible?

592
00:38:06,343 --> 00:38:08,343
Then who do you want to see right now? Tell me.

593
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,660
I want Ding Xian here for your sake.

594
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,902
Why?

595
00:38:14,902 --> 00:38:15,763
Think about it.

596
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:18,610
If she's here, Kong Shadi will be happy.

597
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:22,410
They can hang out together, and you will be relieved.

598
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,392
And the two of us...

599
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,320
Master Zhou, nice move!

600
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,484
That's right.

601
00:38:31,484 --> 00:38:32,660
Song Ziqi, look!

602
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,238
I got two different ones.

603
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,600
They look nice.

604
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,470
The other kids will envy you.

605
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,507
Let's go.

606
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:40,600
Come on!

607
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,390
Where are we going?

608
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,510
I'll find you someone who can take pictures. Let's go.

609
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,230
 Xianxian,

610
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,910
 we are taking Juncong to watch the fireworks.

611
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,670
 There are cut-up fruits in the kitchen.

612
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,800
 Take things easy.

613
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,520
 If you want to join us, call me and your mom.

614
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,430
 I want to watch the fireworks with the others.

615
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,470
 Little Monster!

616
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,949
 Ding Xian!

617
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:38,280
 Ding Xian!

618
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,840
 Little Monster!

619
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,140
Come out!

620
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,600
Hi!

621
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,190
What are you doing here?

622
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,600
The two of them say that

623
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,470
they don't want to watch if you are not there.

624
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,390
Don't blame that on me!

625
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,370
Come on! Get down here!

626
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,430
What do you say? It's almost midnight.

627
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,099
We will catch a cold if you don't come down.

628
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,599
I'm coming!

629
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,540
We won't get there in time.

630
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,270
We won't get to watch the fireworks today.

631
00:40:32,286 --> 00:40:35,110
You would have been better off if you hadn't come to get me.

632
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,770
Hey.

633
00:40:36,772 --> 00:40:39,290
It's okay. The streets are severely jammed.

634
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,230
We can find another place.

635
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,280
But at this point, I don't think we will get there in time.

636
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:49,040
You guys get off. I have an idea.

637
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:53,470
Here, sir. Keep the change.

638
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,670
I know a place.

639
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,340
We can get there in time.

640
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,613
Come on!

641
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:07,113
Let's go.

642
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:11,880
♫  It's okay, because you are everything I can see  ♫

643
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:18,230
♫  It's okay, to be the reason that I let you leave  ♫

644
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,670
♫  It's okay, because you are everything I believe  ♫

645
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:32,730
♫  Can't let this moment end, because it's about a dream and me  ♫

646
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,300
Sorry.

647
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,660
It's okay.

648
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,326
It's fine. The city center is jammed anyway.

649
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:20,696
And we did see it.

650
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,280
Hey. Look!

651
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,537
Oh, my god! Look! Fireworks!

652
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,800
Fireworks!

653
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,900
Impressive!

654
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,430
Happy New Year!

655
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,616
Happy New Year!

656
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:54,660
♫  It's okay, because you are everything I can see  ♫

657
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,190
♫  It's okay, to be the reason that I let you leave  ♫

658
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:07,427
Happy New Year!

659
00:43:07,427 --> 00:43:13,460
♫  Can't let this moment end, because it's about a dream and me  ♫

660
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:30,560

661
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:37,866
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

662
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:41,826
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

663
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:47,409
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

664
00:43:47,409 --> 00:43:51,466
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

665
00:43:52,554 --> 00:43:58,416
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

666
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:02,054
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

667
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:08,789
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

668
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:13,166
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

669
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:16,036
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

670
00:44:16,036 --> 00:44:18,729
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

671
00:44:18,729 --> 00:44:22,626
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

672
00:44:23,842 --> 00:44:26,499
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

673
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:28,976
♫  After a long journey  ♫

674
00:44:28,976 --> 00:44:33,766
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

675
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,732
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

676
00:44:57,732 --> 00:45:00,406
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

677
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:04,749
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

678
00:45:05,512 --> 00:45:08,326
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

679
00:45:08,326 --> 00:45:10,866
♫  After a long journey  ♫

680
00:45:10,866 --> 00:45:15,569
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
