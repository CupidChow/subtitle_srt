1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:07,660

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,500
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,086
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:26,966
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:32,238
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,744
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:40,393
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,393 --> 00:00:47,452
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:55,000
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,848 --> 00:01:02,220
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,212
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:06,325
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:09,578
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:15,320
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,204 --> 00:01:17,892
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:20,244
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,244 --> 00:01:27,601
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:31,392

19
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:34,195

20
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,660
Ding Xian,

21
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,390
why don't you also...

22
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,410
What?

23
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,910
Why don't you also go to a university in Jiangling?

24
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,380
Did you dream of something?

25
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,980
You are flushing.

26
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,610
Did you... Did you have a nice dream?

27
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,820
No.

28
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,010
Huh?

29
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,070
Really?

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,160
What? What were you dreaming about?

31
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,180
Nothing.

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,546
Really?

33
00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:22,396
What's wrong?

34
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,890
Ding Xian.

35
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,830
Huh?

36
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,830
What's wrong?

37
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,010
Stop talking to me during classes.

38
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,370
You dropped your glasses.

39
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,000
Tell me. What did you dream about?

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,340
- You were smiling so happily. 
 - Nothing.

41
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,240
Have you been thinking about something so much that you are seeing it in your dream now?

42
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,320
Stop that!

43
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,090
- You are feeling guilty. 
 - I'm not.

44
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,250
- You are. 
 - I'm not.

45
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,140
Why can't you be smart about it?

46
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,600
Cherish our time in high school, Sis.

47
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,060
When we graduate, you two will be separated in different places.

48
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,750
Draw an auxiliary line.

49
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,930
So, can we get this angle, ACD...

50
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,870
Hey.

51
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,030
Huh?

52
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,660
What happened to you? You've been weird all day long.

53
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,500
Nothing.

54
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
I'm listening.

55
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,910
Is there anything on my face?

56
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,510
No.

57
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,530
You haven't looked at me for days now.

58
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,710
How do you know there's nothing on my face?

59
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,060
Are you going to explain the questions or not?

60
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,860
I'm going to sleep if you aren't.

61
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,840
Hey.

62
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,420
Let's put aside the fact that you are hiding something from me.

63
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,280
My tutor class is quite valuable.

64
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,060
I will be participating in the contest in a few days.

65
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,030
You are not going to find me even if you want to.

66
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,970
You should cherish this.

67
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,490
 Siyue, it's a power outage!

68
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,990
Got it.

69
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,410
Hold on a second.

70
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,350
I'll go check it out.

71
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,780
Why is the power off all of a sudden?

72
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,500
What?

73
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,170
Are you afraid of darkness?

74
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,290
I'm not.

75
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,703
Here.

76
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,440
You should feel better now.

77
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:47,499
♫   That him, this him, I hear the rain go drip-drop   ♫

78
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:50,830
♫  In the middle of the summer night  ♫

79
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,410
I also like this song.

80
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,804
♫  Hide in my room on a cloudy day  ♫

81
00:05:57,804 --> 00:06:05,804
♫  Slouch in the chair, messy hair, miss him  ♫

82
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,580
Zhou Siyue,

83
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,584
I want to go to university in Jiangling, too.

84
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:19,275
♫  All lovely things come together  ♫

85
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,846
♫  How I wish I could be a part of it  ♫

86
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:25,476
♫  The dream he loves sparkles like a star  ♫

87
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:30,539
♫  Blossoming in the endless milky way  ♫

88
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:34,251
♫  With all the crossing paths  ♫

89
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:40,740
♫  He's the only one who stays in the dream  ♫

90
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,880
You are not going anywhere. I'll break your leg.

91
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,930
I'm going anyway. What? Do it.

92
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,540
I'll see how you can go like that!

93
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,440
What should we do?

94
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,551
- How did this happen under your watch? 
 - What can I do?

95
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:53,660
He was dragged away by his dad before I could talk some sense into both of them.

96
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,880
- Look how spoiled he is. 
 - You can hit me. I mean it.

97
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,953
You should stop, too.

98
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:59,470
- What? 
 - You are finally here. Look.

99
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,690
Siyue.

100
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,303
Jiang, Siyue is here.

101
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:05,963
You guys are unbelievable. What are you doing?

102
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:06,940
Uncle. Auntie.

103
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,733
Siyue.

104
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:10,733
You are just in time.

105
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,670
You guys are best friends.

106
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,100
Tell him what's at stake here.

107
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,130
He should go to a university before thinking about other things.

108
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,820
You should make Siyue your son.

109
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,170
He's going to a renowned university.

110
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,490
What are you talking about?

111
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,290
- Say that again! 
 - Enough.

112
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,660
- Enough.  
 - Uncle,

113
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,010
can I talk with you for a second?

114
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,417
That kid is becoming more and more outrageous.

115
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:34,817
Yes.

116
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,350
Siyue, help me persuade him.

117
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,750
All right.

118
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,250
Auntie,

119
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,130
let me talk to Jiang Chen.

120
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,110
Right. You guys should talk.

121
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,970
Don't be so stubborn.

122
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,571
Come on. Come here.

123
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,680
Dude, I owe you one.

124
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,849
That means you are fine now.

125
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:11,549
Let's go.

126
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,121
Why are you still up?

127
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,010
You scared the hell out of me.

128
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,490
I'm so hungry.

129
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,680
You didn't even wear slippers.

130
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,631
You will catch a cold later. Go back and put them on now.

131
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,710
You are drinking my milk.

132
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,650
You are acting like a little old man right now.

133
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,780
What are you talking about?

134
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,430
You are so mature.

135
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,240
No wonder you can persuade Jiang Chen's dad.

136
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,350
How did you manage to do that?

137
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,820
It's not really a huge thing.

138
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,530
I told his dad that the reason why Jiang Chen wants to be a soldier

139
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,800
is because he wants to be someone as excellent as his dad.

140
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,890
Impressive.

141
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,000
You really do know your way around words.

142
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,750
It must be hard preparing for the Academic Olympiad.

143
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,690
Break a leg.

144
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,180
I almost forgot.

145
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,530
I heard that you only got over 90 on the math test.

146
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,230
The situation is severe, little girl.

147
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,200
It's already 2:00 a.m. Can't you let me take a break?

148
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,760
I can see that you are not sleepy yet.

149
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,230
Come. Let me tutor you.

150
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,050
What?

151
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,172
I am sleepy. I'm really sleepy.

152
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:50,160
Please let me go, Mr. Zhou.

153
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,200

154
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,710
Why don't we go grab a drink later?

155
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,790
I know a really good milk tea store.

156
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,740
And it's super cheap.

157
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,740
AlL right. Great.

158
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,540
Jiang Chen.

159
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,790
Keke, we'll leave now.

160
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,030
What are you doing here?

161
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,213
Waiting for you.

162
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:12,013
You are waiting for me?

163
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,122
Why didn't you put on more clothes?

164
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,490
Tie it around your waist.

165
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,520
It's corny. I don't want that.

166
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,030
I'm going to the art class later.

167
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,261
Put it on.

168
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:29,072
- What are you doing? 
 - It's cold today.

169
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,740
Sticking your finger in every pie.

170
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,150
Hop on, I'll give you a ride.

171
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,700
Come.

172
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,900
Fine.

173
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,910
It's not bad to have a free ride.

174
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,440
Hold on tight.

175
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,530
You must have figured out which school you are going to.

176
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,980
Of course.

177
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,340
It would be the Acting Department of the Film Academy.

178
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,828
If I can't succeed this year, I'll get it next year.

179
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll keep trying until I get in.

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,780
I think we are so alike.

181
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,100
We do not turn back until we hit the wall.

182
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,900
Who said that we were alike?

183
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,200
I have a bright future.

184
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,230
My future is not bad either.

185
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,100
I will become a soldier.

186
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,580
I have a great future.

187
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,380
You fool! Are you really going to join the army?

188
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,350
If the young people are strong, the country will be strong.

189
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,610
If the young people are wise, the country will be wise.

190
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,910
What?

191
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:47,010
I said, if the young people are strong, the country will be strong;

192
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,160
if the young people are wise, the country will be wise.

193
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,180

194
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,030
That score is too high.

195
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,920
Are you trying to get into the same university?

196
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,690
I'd love to.

197
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,150
But Huaqing is not giving me that chance.

198
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,680
I would be happy if I could go to the same city.

199
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,690
You guys have a chance to go to a university in the same city.

200
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,590
I have no hope.

201
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,210
Are you saying that we should be separated by then?

202
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,810
That's great news for me.

203
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,510
Bye-bye. I'm going to be alone and beautiful.

204
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:41,130
Oh, right!

205
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,490
Let's all go see Jiang Chen off this weekend.

206
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,570
He's about to join the army.

207
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,610
Is he leaving already?

208
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,950
Thank you for watching the movie with me.

209
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,510
Why would you thank me?

210
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,650
It just came to me that I will not see your foolish face anymore.

211
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,660
I feel like something is missing.

212
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,540
You can call me or write to me.

213
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,100
Aren't you really good at writing letters?

214
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,930
Who told you that?

215
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,300
I didn't write that.

216
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,310
Someone else wrote it for me.

217
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,440
Besides, why would I write to you?

218
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,810
You are not a good friend.

219
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,440
When have we ever been friends?

220
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,340
Then I have been presumptuous.

221
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,780
This will be yours from now on.

222
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,250
What is this?

223
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,370
A parting gift.

224
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,200
I have nothing...

225
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,750
but this motorbike.

226
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,490
That's a surprise.

227
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,910
Take it.

228
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,200
I'll keep it safe for you...

229
00:15:22,103 --> 00:15:24,203
and wait for you to come back.

230
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,480
Another thing.

231
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,250
Break a leg in the exam tomorrow.

232
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,220
You will get into the university you desire.

233
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,660
I don't need you to tell me that.

234
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,230
Playing with you is boring.

235
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,780
I would like to play with you.

236
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,420
Are you sure?

237
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,120
I'm sure.

238
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,193
I think she and I are at the same level.

239
00:16:23,193 --> 00:16:26,420
Don't take this the wrong way. I just want you to take a break.

240
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,243
All right.

241
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,060
Here. Show him what you are made of.

242
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,740
Are you that lucky?

243
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,790
This is a coincidence.

244
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,260
That dude is seeking failure.

245
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,900
He thought Little Monster was soft.

246
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,090
Little did he know that he picked on a hardcore.

247
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,400
I thought you were leaving tonight.

248
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,190
You still have the time to play it out in pool?

249
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:26,880
I just want to party one last time before I leave.

250
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,970
And I got beaten hard.

251
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,670
Come here and have something. The food might get cold.

252
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,980
- All right. I'll finish a round. 
 - Coming!

253
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,300
- Come on, Brother Song. 
 - Coming.

254
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,100
Little Monster, you are so good at pool.

255
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,350
I learned from the master.

256
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,370
Um... Do contact me often.

257
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,180
- Okay. 
 - Sure.

258
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,680
Better yet, tell me things about Keke.

259
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,910
So, that's your real angle, dude.

260
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,460
If she ever hangs out with another boy, do tell me about it.

261
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,090
How could I do that? I would be selling out my friend.

262
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,400
Work with me.

263
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,940
I could also sell my friend out.

264
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,204
I'm kidding. That's impossible.

265
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:37,620
They are all my good brothers.

266
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,750
Isn't that Keke?

267
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:52,543
Jiang Chen, why are you still taking your time here?

268
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,130
Aren't you worried that your dad will beat you up again?

269
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,330
Just a second.

270
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,250
Why are you riding Jiang Chen's motorbike?

271
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,980
I thought you had an exam.

272
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,780
I got there early and finished the exam early.

273
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,540
So, did you do well?

274
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,220
Why are you talking so much?

275
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,700
I'm volunteering to give you a ride.

276
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,210
- Shouldn't you get on right now? 
 - Yeah. Don't make a girl wait for you.

277
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,756
- Hurry up. 
 - All right. I...

278
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,356
Wait.

279
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,380
Did you forget your bag?

280
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,607
So, I'm leaving now.

281
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,240
Let me.

282
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:49,856
See you.

283
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,143
- Hurry up! 
 - Take care.

284
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:53,943
Come on!

285
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,840
Stop looking. Let's go!

286
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,060
You will see each other again.

287
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,020
Let's go.

288
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,540
You look pretty handsome.

289
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:44,232
Siyue, the national contest is happening soon.

290
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:46,860
Do your best. I have faith in you.

291
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,390
You will get the recommendation quota for Huaqing.

292
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,430
 - Huaqing.  
 - All right.

293
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,800
 I also think he can get it.

294
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,890
 Siyue is solid.

295
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,060
 He has great performance.

296
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,760
Enough.

297
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,300
Stop the chit-chat.

298
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,370
You'd better spend the time on your own marks instead of following others. All right?

299
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,760
Do you know if there's anything that would help you improve your performance in exams?

300
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,670
Is it for Zhou Siyue?

301
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,330
Keep it down. Don't let him hear it.

302
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,460
I've never seen you care about yourself in exams so much.

303
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,090
This is different.

304
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,880
This exam is crucial for him.

305
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,660
They are selling test-luck pens by the school gate.

306
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,560
You could get him one.

307
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,000
That's too common.

308
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,250
How about a test-luck bookmark?

309
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:56,670
Not good enough.

310
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,320
- Anything else? 
 - So,

311
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,083
if you really want to give him something special, why don't you make one yourself?

312
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,910
 Ding Xian.

313
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,110
Just a second!

314
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,610
You can come in now.

315
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,780
What are you doing?

316
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,370
I'm reading.

317
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,180
Haven't I explained this question to you before?

318
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,060
- Why did you make a mistake again? 
 - Did I?

319
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,280
I'll explain it again.

320
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,210
That's okay. I'll check it myself later.

321
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,420
You should go back and rest. You have an exam tomorrow.

322
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,820
You don't need to worry about me.

323
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,210
No. I...

324
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,351
- Good night. 
 - You...

325
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:49,291
- Do your best in the exam. 
 - Listen!

326
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,400
Oh, no!

327
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,900
Zhou Siyue!

328
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,980
Zhou Siyue!

329
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,490
Why are you here?

330
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,490
I was going to walk with you.

331
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,110
But I got up late.

332
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,500
It's just an exam. I will be back after the exam.

333
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,970
How could you say that?

334
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,190
This will affect your university education.

335
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,370
Are you... nervous?

336
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,340
A little.

337
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,440
Stick out your hand.

338
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,050
I hope everything goes well on the test.

339
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,890
This is my first time embroidering. It may not look so good.

340
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:35,170
So, you haven't been focusing on learning because you were secretly making this.

341
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,780
You almost caught me.

342
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,210
You are so silly.

343
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,430
Come here.

344
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,940
I didn't wash my hair.

345
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,760
It's okay. I just need some aura.

346
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:14,010
The final exam is coming. Go back and do the exercises.

347
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,450
I also have a gift for you when school starts again.

348
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,370
Ding Xian, you are also cheering Siyue up.

349
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,170
Mr. Liu.

350
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,140
It's about time. Go inside.

351
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,220
Siyue, no need to feel nervous about the exam today.

352
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,700
Just do what you normally do.

353
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,190
You've got this.

354
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,420
Don't worry. I'm ready.

355
00:26:00,623 --> 00:26:02,223
Go.

356
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,100
Mr. Liu.

357
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,380
If I can get into Huaqing, can you do me a favor?

358
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,920
I can do you ten favors.

359
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,780
 Zhou Siyue, you have to get into Huaqing.

360
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,870
 The road ahead of you is long.

361
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,570
 You will have a great future.

362
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,310
 Break a leg.

363
00:27:01,082 --> 00:27:06,365

364
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,600
What are you doing?

365
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,460
Have you been too relaxed during the winter vacation?

366
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,160
Mr. Zhou, I'm so tired.

367
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,780
Don't you want to go to Jiangling anymore?

368
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,880
I don't.

369
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,430
I'd better go to Hangzhou.

370
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,460
Sure. It's none of my business anyway.

371
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,490
Hangzhou is a nice place. The scenery there is great.

372
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,230
And I don't have to see someone tutoring me every day.

373
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,050
What?

374
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,740
I was kidding.

375
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,680
What are you doing?

376
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,340
Hey.

377
00:28:22,342 --> 00:28:24,042
Are you playing me?

378
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:26,060
I'm not.

379
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,700
Are you...

380
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,970
Why are you poking me?

381
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,580
You are always poking me. You are trying to hit me all day long.

382
00:28:31,581 --> 00:28:33,460
Just tell me if you don't want to do your homework.

383
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,830
That's not what I'm thinking.

384
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,300
It's funny, right?

385
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,270
I'm not.

386
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,892
Stop!

387
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,980
Hello, Mom.

388
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,334
 Xianxian, something happened. Come back now.

389
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:53,110
All right, got it.

390
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,920
What?

391
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:05,050
Something happened back home. I need to go back.

392
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,700
Uncle Ding.

393
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,044
Sorry for your loss.

394
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,970
Thank you.

395
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,710
Xianxian.

396
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,990
Senior Brother!

397
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:16,600
I thought you were not coming back for the Spring Festival.

398
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,080
I had to come back since this has happened.

399
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,680
How are you doing? Are you okay?

400
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:35,680
I never understood the concept of parting.

401
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,800
After growing up, I learned that...

402
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,830
parting is such a sad thing.

403
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah.

404
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,190
Growing up is a sad thing in itself.

405
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:06,313
Even the best friend would grow apart gradually.

406
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,950
There's nothing we can do about it.

407
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:16,390
Everyone will have a new life.

408
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,000
Then I don't want to grow up.

409
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:32,390
I still remember the little bully in Keshan who would cry three times a day.

410
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:37,210
Your face was always covered in tears whenever I saw you.

411
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,410
Yeah.

412
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:50,070
I was always bullied by those boys in junior high.

413
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,080
Do you remember that you once gave me a pack of toffee,

414
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,520
and they asked me for it?

415
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:02,210
I didn't want them to find the candies, so I hid them under a tree.

416
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,100
Later, it rained. And when I went back,

417
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,860
all I found were candy wrappers.

418
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:17,530
Do you think the more we try to hold on to something,

419
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,790
the more it will slip through our fingers?

420
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,760
Xianxian.

421
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,870
I have something for you.

422
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,520
I was going to make the kids happy with this.

423
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,210
Here.

424
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:48,850
For me... you are always the same person.

425
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,690
But I'm no longer a kid.

426
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,390
 Zhou Zongtang, do you know this is the Spring Festival?

427
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,090
 You are still going out.

428
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,280
Jinyun, I do have some serious business.

429
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,130
It's about the school.

430
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,970
You haven't been teaching for so long.

431
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,820
What serious business could the school possibly have?

432
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,850
 Besides, is it more important than the festival?

433
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,850
 Can't you just trust me? If even you are doubting me,

434
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,480
then I really can't explain this in one or two words.

435
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,680
Zhou Zongtang! If you step out today,

436
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,166
 then you can forget about the festival.

437
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,140
Aren't you going out?

438
00:34:16,245 --> 00:34:18,320
Take care of things at home.

439
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,370
Xianxian, what are you doing out here?

440
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,220
Go inside. It's cold out here.

441
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,230
Dinner is almost ready.

442
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,090
You should go have something now.

443
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,420
I'd like to stay out here a little longer.

444
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,270
This year is a little quiet.

445
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,719
Yeah.

446
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:12,870
It was your grandma who planned for the goods

447
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,340
and dinner for Spring Festival.

448
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:23,150
And she would call in the whole family to gather here.

449
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:35,850
Dad, there are things we can't change.

450
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,950
We have no choice but to accept them.

451
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:56,120
Come on, let's go inside.

452
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,440
 Are you there?

453
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,890
Hello?

454
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,870
How are things going at your home?

455
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,870
Everything is fine.

456
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,940
 ♪ Happy New Year, Happy New Year ♪

457
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:57,840
 ♪ Happy New Year to you all ♪

458
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,360
 ♪ We are singing, we are dancing ♪

459
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,020
 ♪ Happy New Year to you all ♪

460
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,850
Are you feeling better?

461
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:14,050
What do you mean by that?

462
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,220
Like you knew I was not feeling good.

463
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,900
Maybe it's because we've been deskmates for a long time.

464
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,420
I can imagine your face

465
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,619
 even if I can't see you.

466
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:33,239
How's life back in your hometown?

467
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,630
It's so festive.

468
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,070
They prepared a big feast.

469
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,380
I'm so full right now.

470
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:45,360
How about you?

471
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,960
I...

472
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,660
I'm watching fireworks at home.

473
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,560
We have fireworks over here, too.

474
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,760
Do you also feel...

475
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:09,670
that time really flies?

476
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:15,210
 After the Spring Festival, we are going to grow up, too.

477
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,320
Yeah.

478
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,560
But it's okay.

479
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:26,820
Next year, we will be able to watch the fireworks together.

480
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,450
All right. We will watch the fireworks together next year.

481
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,460
Happy Spring Festival, Zhou Siyue.

482
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:42,020
Happy Spring Festival, Ding Xian.

483
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,460
Before the class is over, I have an announcement.

484
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,980
Let's all congratulate Zhou Siyue

485
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,700
for passing the national contest.

486
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,900
He's about to become a part of Huaqing officially.

487
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,470
Impressive.

488
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,950
Those who are not recommended, don't feel frustrated.

489
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:26,620
As long as you are fighting, there's always hope.

490
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,220
You still need to work hard in the new semester

491
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,660
and achieve better performance.

492
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,370
All right, class is over.

493
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:38,020
Siyue, you have become a university student now.

494
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,230
Siyue, how about helping poor students like us when you are free?

495
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,830
Siyue, me too.

496
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,020
All right. Stop...

497
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,900
Stop now. Make appointments. Siyue is busy now.

498
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,230
Anyone who wants to make an appointment can talk to me. Thank you.

499
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,570
Don't mind him. Break a leg.

500
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,970
Why are you everywhere?

501
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:02,815
Classmate Ding Xian,

502
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,720
pack your things and move back.

503
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,130
What?

504
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,330
Move back!

505
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,460
That's really bold.

506
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,990
I got permission from Mr. Liu.

507
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:22,170
I can't believe that he would agree.

508
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,660
Move now!

509
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:28,100
Stop gossiping. With that kind of time, you might as well do more exercises.

510
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,850
Switch over.

511
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:07,420
This is the gift you mentioned before.

512
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,570
Why do you want me to switch back?

513
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,580
So that I can help you study.

514
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,950
Why are you always asking questions?

515
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,553
Help me study.

516
00:41:30,553 --> 00:41:32,290
How silly are you?

517
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,070
Why would you believe that?

518
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,290
Why are you always calling me silly?

519
00:41:41,706 --> 00:41:46,520
My high school life started with you being my deskmate.

520
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:51,770
It should end in the same way.

521
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,330
What a pity...

522
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,920
would it be otherwise?

523
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,630
You are already admitted by Huaqing,

524
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:31,040
and I'm not sure if I can go to Jiangling yet.

525
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,600
My deskmate,

526
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,670
since you are so good,

527
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:40,820
do you have any tricks that can improve my performance?

528
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:45,190
Are you trying to take the shortcut?

529
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:53,440
But... I do have a trick.

530
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:04,010
I made this for you. A schedule for NCEE.

531
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:06,500
You came prepared.

532
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:10,120
That's because you always worry me.

533
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:13,280
Always worry...

534
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,750
Do your best!

535
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,490
I won't let you down.

536
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:36,960

537
00:43:39,757 --> 00:43:45,095
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

538
00:43:45,095 --> 00:43:49,107
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

539
00:43:50,304 --> 00:43:54,590
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

540
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:59,747
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

541
00:43:59,747 --> 00:44:05,597
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

542
00:44:05,597 --> 00:44:10,235
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

543
00:44:10,235 --> 00:44:16,070
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

544
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,147
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

545
00:44:20,147 --> 00:44:23,117
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

546
00:44:23,117 --> 00:44:25,810
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

547
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:31,007
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

548
00:44:31,007 --> 00:44:33,680
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

549
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,257
♫  After a long journey  ♫

550
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:41,347
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

551
00:45:01,973 --> 00:45:04,913
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

552
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:07,587
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

553
00:45:07,587 --> 00:45:12,830
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

554
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,407
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

555
00:45:15,407 --> 00:45:17,947
♫  After a long journey  ♫

556
00:45:17,947 --> 00:45:22,550
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
