1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,100

2
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,497
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,083
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,963
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:34,963 --> 00:00:40,335
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,841
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:48,490
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:55,449
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:55,449 --> 00:01:02,645
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,475
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,209
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,022
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:17,575
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:23,201
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,889
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:28,241
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:35,562
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:39,442

19
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,214

20
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,580
 Here. Astronomy Club.

21
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,800
 Here. Check our Astronomy Club.

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,440
 Take a look at the Astronomy Club.

23
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,840
This one.

24
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,270
Music club. Nice.

25
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,400
It suits you.

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,000
This is...

27
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,930
Zhou Siyue.

28
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,440
Thank you for the program last time.

29
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,890
When do I get to treat you to a meal?

30
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,220
Forget it. How can I make you pay?

31
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,720
I'll pay.

32
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,900
I'm busy today. Let's take a rain check.

33
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,840
 Take a look at the Anime &amp; Comics Club.

34
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,110
 Here. Check our Astronomy Club.

35
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,780
 Take a look at the Astronomy Club.

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,160
 Calligraphy Club! Check out our Calligraphy Club!

37
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,970
 We are recruiting!

38
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,900
Hi, do I sign up for the Anime &amp; Comics Club here?

39
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,997
Yeah. Would you like to come in and take a look?

40
00:02:53,997 --> 00:02:55,499
All right.

41
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,970

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,780
Sit.

43
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,090
Ding Xian.

44
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,670
I can see that you have basic painting skills.

45
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,926
Do you have any works that you can show me?

46
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,796
Here are some paintings I did before.

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,730
You are the painter from the Internet! Little Monster!

48
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,630
Yeah.

49
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,220
Do you know me?

50
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,900
I've been following you for a long time now.

51
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,460
I'm surprised that a painter as brilliant as you are would be my schoolmate.

52
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,530
I thought you were from some art school.

53
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,020
You are flattering me.

54
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,910
I'm an amateur at most.

55
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,930
Have some faith in yourself.

56
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,230
Sometimes inspiration is more important than any skill.

57
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,140
Presidents, I'd like to ask

58
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,110
if Zhou Siyue is in this club.

59
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,010
Zhou Siyue.

60
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,630
You have come to the wrong place if you are looking for him.

61
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,530
Siyue is not in our club.

62
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,580
He's in the class next to ours.

63
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,340
Our club is trying to do an app to issue works.

64
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,530
We asked him for help.

65
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,290
I understand.

66
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,530
Ding Xian, are you having other thoughts?

67
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,430
No.

68
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,010
Do join us for a routine meeting on Monday.

69
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,370
I'll include you in the chat group later.

70
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,670
All right.

71
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,360
I have finally found you.

72
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,250
Why didn't you answer my phone call?

73
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,050
I didn't hear it.

74
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,940
The tutor wants to talk with you.

75
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,640
- The tutor...
 - Hurry up!

76
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,100
Guys, I'm going to leave now.

77
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,030
Is the tutor here?

78
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,130
I'm waiting for him, too.

79
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,310
He's not here yet.

80
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,770
What's wrong?

81
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,133
I've been asked to come here to talk.

82
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,513
That thing happened when school started...

83
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,510
He's a nice person.

84
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,630
It won't be something serious.

85
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,890

86
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,370
I have to go now.

87
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,570
You are being too dramatic.

88
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,970
Do you think it's the same as you and Song Ziqi?

89
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,410
Don't mention him to me.

90
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,070
I'm mad every time I think about him.

91
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,780
Are you still fighting?

92
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,940
I've tried to talk to him, and he's not responding.

93
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,830
 It has been days now.

94
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,760
Can you ask Siyue about him when you have the chance?

95
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,870
You are asking me to do that?

96
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,230
I can't even talk to him.

97
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,520
- What?
 - Ban Jiayu, why are you doing your hair?

98
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,540
Hurry up.

99
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,600
I have to go now, Shadi.

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,920
 We have a party tonight.

101
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,100
Okay. I'm going to hang up. Talk to you later.

102
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,540
Later.

103
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,630
Let's go.

104
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,920
Is this what you are wearing?

105
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,820
Yeah. What's wrong?

106
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,810
You need something more colorful.

107
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,010
Really? I'll go change.

108
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,670
 We are here. Come on.

109
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,660
Come. The person of the hour is here.

110
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,540
The girl who got into Huaqing for love.

111
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,470
Are you disappointed? The guy you are after is not here today.

112
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,730
What do you care?

113
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,790
Come on! Everyone is here. Let's have a toast.

114
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,830
Let's welcome the newcomers.

115
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,490
- Thank you, Senior.
 - Thank you, Senior.

116
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,820
Stop eating. You've had enough.

117
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,570
We need to go home tomorrow.

118
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,550
Have you all finished here? Let's play a game.

119
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,950
- Great.
 - All right.

120
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,350
Truth or Dare. You've all played that before, right?

121
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,550
Yes.

122
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,540
- Then that one it is.
 - Come on.

123
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,940
All right.

124
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,000
Come on!  Think of a question.

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,800
Who has a question?

126
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,370
I do have a lot of questions for you.

127
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,190
What happened after Zhou Siyue dragged you away?

128
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,750
He brought me to the sports field to tell me about his experience.

129
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,790
Experience on how to become first in every course.

130
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,600
This is Truth or Dare.

131
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,921
You need to speak the truth. That's no way to play.

132
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:01,100
- Yes.
 - That's right.

133
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,240
Yeah, it's Truth or Dare.

134
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,820
I picked dare,

135
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,980
so I could skip the truth.

136
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,130
Okay, dare is fine.

137
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:16,400
Then recreate the scene where you confessed your love under the boys' dormitory.

138
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,790
Let us see it, too.

139
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,940
That's great.

140
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,620
How could you do this?

141
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,790
What's there to look at? It's all over the internet.

142
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,760
If you want to look,

143
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,820
just take out your cell phone.

144
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,940
Are you playing or not?

145
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,340
Yes. Of course, I'm playing.

146
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,550
So...

147
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,230
Let me sing a song for you.

148
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,690
- A song will be fine.
 - That's great. Sing a song.

149
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,160
Sing a song! Sing a song!

150
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,929
♫  The North Star makes the night linger  ♫

151
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:12,047
♫  Your heart is always further away  ♫

152
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:17,568
♫  I try to collect it by getting closer  ♫

153
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,122
♫  And grasp a little bit of energy  ♫

154
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,120
 You can sing pretty well.

155
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,290
 Zhou Siyue,

156
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,480
 I want to go to a university in Jiangling, too.

157
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:50,059
♫  I don't know why I feel sad  ♫

158
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:53,259
♫  What else could I want with you here  ♫

159
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,750
♫  What would happen after I fell for you  ♫

160
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,158
♫  How do I control my feelings  ♫

161
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:02,627
♫  I'm always in a fluster  ♫

162
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:06,190
♫  By your side, I'm thinking  ♫

163
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,375
♫  Maybe you will not forget  ♫

164
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,950
♫  The light you saw  ♫

165
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,797
♫  Came from me who's standing by your side  ♫

166
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,093
♫  What else could I want with you here  ♫

167
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:54,684
♫  What would happen after I fell for you  ♫

168
00:10:54,684 --> 00:10:58,092
♫  How do I control my feelings  ♫

169
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,561
♫  I'm always in a fluster  ♫

170
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:04,024
♫  By your side, I'm thinking  ♫

171
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:07,229
♫  Maybe you will not forget  ♫

172
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:12,570
♫  The light you saw  ♫

173
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,990
 Great!

174
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,670
Okay, all right. We played games, and we sang.

175
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,590
Now you should order some food you like.

176
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,220
I want some barbequed pig trotters.

177
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,540
You know nothing but eating.

178
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,240
Waiter.

179
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,540
Coming.

180
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,690
What a coincidence!

181
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,780
Zhou Siyue.

182
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,280
You... Are you a waiter here?

183
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,380
I'm working part-time here.

184
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,000
Let me take your orders.

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,660
Here. Have a look.

186
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,680
Your dream guy has got the vibe of a broken young master.

187
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,720
This restaurant is nice. I've always wanted to come here.

188
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,740
It's a shame.

189
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,680
If you were not on duty, we would have asked you to join us.

190
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,820
It's okay.

191
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,420
Here's the featured cuisine of this restaurant.

192
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,420
The seafood is all flown in. They are good for parties.

193
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,120
Have a look.

194
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,810
All right, we'll order them if you think they are good.

195
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,220
Okay.

196
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,900
Ask for me if you need anything else.

197
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,030
Uncle Liu, let me.

198
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,250
It's okay. I've got this.

199
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,340
I'm so sorry. I asked you to switch shifts with me at this hour.

200
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,187
It's okay. Go back to your kid now.

201
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:25,320
He will be asleep if you go back late.

202
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,441
All right. Thanks.

203
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Zhou Siyue.

204
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,220
Why are you still here?

205
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,660
You gave me one yesterday.

206
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,080
Is there anything else?

207
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,810
Did something happen to you?

208
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,250
What could have happened to me?

209
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,370
My dad has not been well lately.

210
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,450
The condition back home is not as good.

211
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,820
I'm here to work part-time to share some burdens for my family.

212
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,450
How are your parents doing?

213
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,660
If you need my help...

214
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,340
It's okay. They are fine.

215
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,240
Don't worry.

216
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,810
Didn't they say they were going to karaoke?

217
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,910
You should go with them.

218
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,530
You are trying to get rid of me again.

219
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,540
Ding Xian,

220
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,540
I told you.

221
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,680
We all have our own lives now.

222
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,940
You just joined the university. There are a lot of... interesting people and things.

223
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,210
You should get to know them all.

224
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,720
Don't waste your time on me.

225
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,350
I've moved on.

226
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,810
We all have our own lives now.

227
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,890
Does that mean we have to forget about the past?

228
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,250
Sometimes it means we have to give up something.

229
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,330
Okay.

230
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:05,940
I understand now.

231
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:28,597

232
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,010
Zhou, are you finished here?

233
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,010
The manager is asking for you.

234
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,460
I'm coming.

235
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,490
Manager Zhou, are you looking for me?

236
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,130
Did you clean this table?

237
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,570
I'll clean it again.

238
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,670
It's okay.

239
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,860
The customer from tonight filed a complaint against you.

240
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,070
I don't understand.

241
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,280
The customer, you mean...

242
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,900
Customers nowadays are a little unreasonable.

243
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:16,890
But, Zhou, you know that things have been hard for the catering industry.

244
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,760
He just paid 10,000 for membership.

245
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,210
I can't afford to piss him off.

246
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,590
I don't want to make this hard for you.

247
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:34,140
How about this? I'll finish tonight. And I'll be gone tomorrow.

248
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,990
All right.

249
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,900
I'm sorry about this.

250
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,000
It's okay.

251
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,300
You are full of surprises.

252
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,160
The school forum is all about you these two weeks.

253
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,840
This is all bunk.

254
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,420
How could they write about it like that?

255
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,660
Okay. Leave me alone for a while.

256
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,430
Okay.

257
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,480
 Does Zhou Siyue from Computer Science Department have a story or something?

258
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,210
 I don't know exactly what it's all about.

259
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,300
 The department asked us to keep it quiet. And it was settled in private.

260
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,090
 I could only find an old post.

261
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,790
 You can check it out.

262
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,980

263
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,060

264
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,540
Don't talk about things you don't know.

265
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,250
What do you know?

266
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,250
He's clearly...

267
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,300
He's clearly a dazzling person.

268
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,610
Siyue.

269
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,280
Come and sit.

270
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,550
You are having dinner so late.

271
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,800
I don't have an appetite.

272
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,730
Your dad was tired. He fell asleep.

273
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,430
The wage for this month.

274
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,910
Why did you get paid so early this month?

275
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,910
My boss said that I've been doing well.

276
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,720
Don't you need to keep some for yourself?

277
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,660
It's okay. I have the scholarship.

278
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,260
It will be enough.

279
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,850
Look how tired you are. You have lost weight.

280
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,470
Losing weight is a good thing.

281
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,150
It makes me look sharper.

282
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,970
Everything will be fine.

283
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,560
Don't worry.

284
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,610
It's all going to be fine.

285
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,677
It will.

286
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,830
Boss, slow down.

287
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,180
You've been studying for the whole afternoon.

288
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,940
Are you a perpetual motion machine?

289
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,380
You are lazy.

290
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,580
Of course.

291
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,100
Your GPA is 4.0. I can't compete with that.

292
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:24,130
Look!  That girl has become a hot topic again.

293
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,030
She's really popular.

294
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,540
Why is someone abusing you down there?

295
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,280
It has nothing to do with me.

296
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,080
Look! Look!

297
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,210
Look.

298
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,710
She's beautiful as she sings well.

299
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,730
If she were my girlfriend... Hey, hey, hey...

300
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,150
Why does this guy sound like a creep?

301
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,830
The photo is nice.

302
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:51,730
How come there's a photo of the gate of the bathhouse? Is he a stalker?

303
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,490
Right. You may not know this.

304
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,240
A guy haunted Xing Lufei when we were freshmen.

305
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,300
He kept taking photos of her everywhere.

306
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,080
And then things just ended. No one knows who that is.

307
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,440
Now he's back.

308
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,430
- Wait. Where are you going?
 - I'm heading back to the lab.

309
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,820
Weren't you there this morning?

310
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,650

311
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,830
This Yuan Fang...

312
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,920
What are you doing alone late at night?

313
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,350
So many things have happened to you.

314
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,190
Why didn't you tell me?

315
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,670
You were saying we all had our own lives...

316
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,880
as an excuse. Right?

317
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,290
You asked me to experience life in university,

318
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,160
but that's just because you are scared.

319
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,340
Are you thinking that we can't continue because of this?

320
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,260
Ding Xian.

321
00:23:38,686 --> 00:23:41,776
Have you given some thought about our relationship?

322
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:44,926
What's there to think about?

323
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,910
Our relationship is simple.

324
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:56,973
Maybe you have some misunderstanding about relationships.

325
00:23:57,774 --> 00:24:01,114
It's probably because you don't have enough experience with people.

326
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:07,090
We were a little close as deskmates,

327
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,190
and you mistook friendship for love.

328
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,280
Four years.

329
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,910
Zhou Siyue, it's been four years.

330
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,340
Do you think I haven't thought about it?

331
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,760
I've asked myself countless times

332
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,750
if I really do have feelings for you,

333
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,980
or was it just an illusion caused by adolescence?

334
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,360
If there's only one thing

335
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,480
that I can be sure of in this world,

336
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,370
that would be my feelings for you.

337
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,930
You've had enough experience with people,

338
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,880
can you be sure that what you have for me is friendship instead of love?

339
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,830
I can be sure.

340
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:17,010
I don't know if you are lying to me or to yourself.

341
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,760
We both know that's not the reason.

342
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,050
I have to go now.

343
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,183
This is so annoying.

344
00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:38,593
He's beating around the bush every day.

345
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:41,350
Can't he just speak his mind?

346
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,760
And he asked me to sort out my thoughts.

347
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,900
Do I need you to tell me that?

348
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,980
I'm so pissed.

349
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,680
Besides, what's with your attitude?

350
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,980
You are always putting on a poker face and making me guess.

351
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,190
Say something.

352
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,890
Speak!

353
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,430
Aren't you usually quite talkative?

354
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,390
You are just a piece of wood.

355
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,800
And you!

356
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,920
What are you looking at?

357
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,680
What are you looking at?

358
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,260
Do you think I can't bully you because you are short?

359
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,990
Sorry. I got carried away.

360
00:26:39,607 --> 00:26:41,307
Sorry.

361
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:18,310
 I'm worried that if you'll get too tired,

362
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,210
 and what should I do if you get depressed one day.

363
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,330
 And what if that really happens?

364
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,430
 I will be there for you

365
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,700
 and help you unconditionally.

366
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,700
I'm here to crash with you.

367
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,430
All those talking about forever.

368
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,280
 Saying all those promises.

369
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,470
All guys are liars.

370
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,090
Have I damaged my brain today?

371
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,760
Why would I say those things to him?

372
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,040
What should I do when we meet again?

373
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,960
I don't even know what to say to him now.

374
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,520
 Stop complaining.

375
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,660
At least you will get to see him.

376
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,100
I don't even know where Song Ziqi is.

377
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,020
We are so miserable.

378
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,470
Ding Xian,

379
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,800
I have a good idea that will help both of us.

380
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,250
What is it? I'm listening.

381
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,840
Say it. Why did you move out?

382
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,760
After working and going to the hospital,

383
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,760
it would be midnight when I finish everything.

384
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,590
The dormitory would be closed already.

385
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,840
That's why I just found a place to live off campus.

386
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,510
Did something happen to you?

387
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,770
I got physical with someone.

388
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,310
Me, too.

389
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,700
I got a record.

390
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,010
Me, too.

391
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,710
I broke up with my girl.

392
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,800
See? I told you we were not the same.

393
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,020
You've never been with her officially.

394
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,830
You are the one to talk.

395
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,230
Do your parents know about this?

396
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,380
Yeah. My mom scolded me harshly.

397
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,560
And you know my dad.

398
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:28,080
That's why I'm here with you to wait this out.

399
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,710
What about Shadi?

400
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,140
I told you we broke up.

401
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,240
Don't try to fool me here.

402
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,110
You two are always breaking up.

403
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,090
I'm not trying to fool you.

404
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,110
It might be real this time.

405
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,470
She's usually the one doing the dumping.

406
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,900
This time, I dumped her.

407
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,110
You can say that I have risen up.

408
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,100
You are being pretentious.

409
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,530
So, what should I do?

410
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,920
I can't tell her these.

411
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,660
Maybe it's a good thing that we've broken up. I can stop wasting her good years.

412
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,350
How long are you going to hide here?

413
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,600
I will hide as long as you hide.

414
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,330
Come on.

415
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,530
♪ Roar when you see something unfair ♪

416
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,470
♪ Strike when you see fit ♪

417
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:38,800
♪ Let's roam the world with passion ♪

418
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,750
♪ Hey, yo ♪

419
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,940
Stop messing with me.

420
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:45,520
Go and find someone else.

421
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,739
I'm here today for the dinner party of the Computer Science Department.

422
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,560
We'd like to invite sophomores to our dinner party the day after tomorrow

423
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,130
to share your experience with us.

424
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,950
Do you have the time?

425
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,730
Since you are asking me to go to someone else, I'll...

426
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,560
Wait. Just a second.

427
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,230
I didn't know that was what you were talking about.

428
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,190
I have the time. I have so much time lying around.

429
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,800
Really?

430
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,230
Since you do have time, can you do me one small favor?

431
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,160
There are a lot of sophomores who intend to participate in our freshmen party.

432
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,190
They are all going because of Ban Jiayu.

433
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,623
But if you have a tight schedule, you could...

434
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,430
Tell me.

435
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:35,520
Whatever you need, I will do whatever I can to help.

436
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,900
We are here. This is the place.

437
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,040
He was doing great in the last restaurant.

438
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,950
Why did he look for a new place all of a sudden?

439
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,350
Don't even mention it.

440
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,160
It's because of Dong Zhengfei and his lot.

441
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,450
They went to the last restaurant to make Siyue look bad.

442
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,680
He didn't get his way, and he's unbelievable.

443
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,560
He sent a complaint about Siyue.

444
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,560
A new place might be a good thing.

445
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,830
That restaurant was too far away from our campus.

446
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,630
This one is closer.

447
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,880
I brought you here.

448
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,040
Don't forget to add me to the chat group.

449
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,140
- Just a second.
 - What?

450
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,160
Can you bring this to him?

451
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,020
They are all home-cooked dishes.

452
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,660
You are asking me to do that? That would expose me.

453
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,730
Just finish your good deed here.

454
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,210
- Boss.
 - Why are you here?

455
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,920
I'm worried that you skipped a meal. So, I brought you food.

456
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,560
Are you that sensitive?

457
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,190
Of course.

458
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,320

459
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,510
All right! I'll confess.

460
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,110
That girl was so pitiful.

461
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,230
I can't say no to her.

462
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,651
Besides,

463
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,180
you are still claiming that there's nothing between the two of you.

464
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,680
You could tell it was her by her handwriting.

465
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,060
Did she come with you?

466
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,230
She's waiting by the entrance.

467
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,680
You like taking photos, right?

468
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,440
Don't show your face again.

469
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,470
Thank you.

470
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,580
I didn't know I'd been followed for so long.

471
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,930
Take this.

472
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,260
What's this?

473
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,600
It's a security alarm.

474
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,640
In case that creep comes back.

475
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,680
Did you know that?

476
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,000
Don't make me go away just yet.

477
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,730
I have something serious.

478
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,180
Kong Shadi wants to ask you if you know where Song Ziqi is.

479
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,140
You are in the mood to deal with others' affairs?

480
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,210
Aren't you afraid at all?

481
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,700
Your photos are all over the forum.

482
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,760
Have you ever thought about who's taking them?

483
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,620
If he can stalk you and take photos of you, who knows what else he might pull off?

484
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,070
Got it.

485
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,070
That's good.

486
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,750
Go back.

487
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,130
I'm afraid to go back by myself.

488
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,640
Zhou Siyue.

489
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,950
What?

490
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:17,250
I'm certain that you care about me.

491
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,770
You are thinking too much.

492
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,870
Can't we even talk anymore?

493
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,610
You have no place to hide now.

494
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,840
Why not just tell the truth?

495
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,300
Sir, just a second.

496
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,320
I should get back to work.

497
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,760
This is as far as I can go.

498
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,000
It's okay.

499
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,810
Lou Feng will pick me up later.

500
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,690
Zhou Siyue.

501
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,370
Why can't you be honest with me?

502
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,220
Ding Xian...

503
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,810
I'm going abroad next semester.

504
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,880
 You are going abroad.

505
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,450
 She got into Huaqing for you!

506
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,320
 Not that I want to get in the middle of this.

507
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,080
 I just think that...

508
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,091
 she chased you all the way here and we all saw it.

509
00:37:50,091 --> 00:37:51,630
 To be honest, it's tough for her.

510
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,750
 I don't want her to follow me all the time.

511
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,660
 I mean, I just think that it would be a pity to give up like this.

512
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,870
 You were so close, right?

513
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:08,600
 You will regret it for your whole life if you miss her.

514
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,520
 Can you walk in my shoes once?

515
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,600
 With my condition, how do I get to be in a relationship?

516
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,950
 You don't need anything to be in a relationship.

517
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:19,800
 You just need to like each other and let things happen.

518
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,180
 You are making it sound easy.

519
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,840
 Tell me!  Why are you here?

520
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,360
 The situation is different for everyone.

521
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,722
 My situation is special.

522
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,422
 There's nothing special about that.

523
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,890
 You've messed up, and you are trying to persuade me.

524
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,560
 Do you know when to stop?

525
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,770
 Will I hurt you or what?

526
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,280
 I'm saying this for your sake.

527
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,560
 I just don't understand. We were talking about you.

528
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,040
 Why are you attacking me all of a sudden?

529
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,800
 Can we stop talking about me all the time?

530
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,630
 I'm already annoyed enough, okay?

531
00:38:47,443 --> 00:38:49,490
 I think Little Monster is so much more brave than you are.

532
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,610
 She never runs away from anything.

533
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,950
 Aren't you running away?

534
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,930
 Why are you living here all the time, then?

535
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,687
 All right.

536
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:58,120
 That was me being presumptuous.

537
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,220
 I'll be damned if I ever care about you again.

538
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,260
Hey!

539
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,600
Ding Xian.

540
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,670
Ding Xian!

541
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,760
Yes?

542
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,260
Come over here.

543
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,130
Deliver this to Zhou Siyue.

544
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,740
You are asking me to give it to Zhou Siyue?

545
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,630
Yeah. We asked him to build an app for us.

546
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,620
We need some stuff changed.

547
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,870
Is it inconvenient for you?

548
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,910
What are you doing here?

549
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,630
Our president asked me to give you this.

550
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
All right.

551
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:23,999
Got it.

552
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,570
It's late.

553
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,470
You should go back.

554
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,990
I refuse to accept...

555
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,210
the reason you gave me last night.

556
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,950
Besides,

557
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:52,280
I'm not here to force you to be with me.

558
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,880
Suit yourself.

559
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,170
Zhou Siyue,

560
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,140
I like you and you feel the same.

561
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:12,320
For me, this is as simple as things get.

562
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,780
So, no matter how many times you push me away,

563
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,930
I will be by your side.

564
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,140
It's a promise.

565
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,810
This is so accurate. Let me see yours.

566
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,570
Romance luck is low.

567
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,040
 You shouldn't take rash actions,

568
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,670
 or you might fail.

569
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,910
Xianxian, why don't we forget it?

570
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,200
 By rushing things, you may achieve the opposite of what you are trying to do.

571
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,520
Don't say things like that.

572
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,360
If you say that again,

573
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,830
I'm going to leave you and Song Ziqi alone.

574
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,380
Don't. I didn't say that.

575
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,960
The book said it.

576
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,740
Besides, the experiment group sounds so hard.

577
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,740
 Let alone the quota of studying abroad.

578
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,040
I know it's hard.

579
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,500
But...

580
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,280
I don't want him to be alone again.

581
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,760
After so many things have happened,

582
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,790
I just want to make up for the time I missed.

583
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:00,260
 And I don't want to be separated from him again.

584
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,980
Besides, I'm really good.

585
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,020
I will let him know that even with fate standing in the way,

586
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,260
he still can't get rid of me.

587
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,000

588
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,880
Thank you, sir.

589
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,320
The next one is a freshman.

590
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,020
Siyue.

591
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,570
You are from the same high school.

592
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,270
Do you know her?

593
00:43:32,168 --> 00:43:33,980
Next!

594
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,430
Hello, Teachers.

595
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,560
I'm a freshman in the Computer Science Department.

596
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,270
My name is Ding Xian.

597
00:43:50,777 --> 00:43:52,523
What are you snickering about?

598
00:43:52,523 --> 00:43:54,623
What's there to snicker about?

599
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,790
Why do you want to join the research group?

600
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,160
I...

601
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,200
Ding Xian!

602
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,270
What do you want?

603
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,840
In this case, I can study abroad with you.

604
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,430
Joining a research group is big.

605
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,390
You will give up a lot of things for this.

606
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:35,910
Don't you still have the Comics Club?

607
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,180
Will you be able to handle both?

608
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,760
I will handle them.

609
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,690
And I will make a lot of time.

610
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,700
I won't give up on you or painting.

611
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,640
I always meant to ask you.

612
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:59,230
You don't like computer-related stuff.

613
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,300
Why did you choose this major?

614
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,000
I did it because...

615
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,900
Because of me.

616
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,110
Did you spend a whole year working your ass off...

617
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,020
to get into Huaqing just for these things...

618
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,370
that you take no interest in at all?

619
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:32,900
I just hope that you can figure out...

620
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,160
what you like for real...

621
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,260
before you make any decisions.

622
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,660
I have figured things out.

623
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,150
I told you, I'm not giving up on you.

624
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:49,400
If your excuse is that you are going abroad, then I'm coming with you.

625
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,470
I will make all your worries go away.

626
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,470
Don't worry.

627
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,710
Are you doubting if I can get in?

628
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:03,430
I never cared if you can get in.

629
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,390
I know you will be able to do

630
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,530
anything if you set your mind to it.

631
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,160
But this choice is complicated.

632
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,820
As long as you are in the research group, then this is simple.

633
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,150
I will get in.

634
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,249
Don't worry about me.

635
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,420
Why are you so stubborn?

636
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:44,260

637
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:51,589
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

638
00:46:52,637 --> 00:46:56,249
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

639
00:46:57,946 --> 00:47:02,132
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

640
00:47:02,132 --> 00:47:05,989

641
00:47:07,377 --> 00:47:13,239
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

642
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:16,577
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

643
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:23,512
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

644
00:47:23,512 --> 00:47:26,589
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

645
00:47:27,586 --> 00:47:30,759
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

646
00:47:30,759 --> 00:47:33,452
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

654
00:48:20,235 --> 00:48:23,049

00:48:23,049 --> 00:48:25,589
