1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,670

2
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:18,790
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:23,069
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:26,949
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:32,221
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:36,827
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:40,476
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:47,435
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:55,831
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,831 --> 00:01:02,161
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:04,295
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:06,408
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,408 --> 00:01:09,661
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:14,987
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:17,975
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:20,327
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:27,576
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:31,470

19
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:34,164

20
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,380
Didn't you say that you would be studying?

21
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,280
You didn't even open your book.

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,300
I was just about to.

23
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,730
Mom, go get some rest.

24
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,510
I will study.

25
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,000
Take it out.

26
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,130
Who were you talking to?

27
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,190
A classmate.

28
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,021
Which one? You're still chatting at this hour.

29
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,630
I was asking him about the homework.

30
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,870
Mom,

31
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,570
I promise that I will never

32
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,070
talk on the phone at night again.

33
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,160
I'm just keeping it for you.

34
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,650
This is for your own good.

35
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,213
Focus on your studies.

36
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:48,373
Finish the fruit.

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,390
Thank you.

43
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,890
Make a wish.

44
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,190
Blow them out in one breath.

45
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,560
All right!

46
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,600
No need to thank me.

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
Just have fun.

48
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,570
Go on!

49
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,000
Kong Shadi, it's really you!

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's been a while.

51
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,030
It's us!

52
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,110
We used to hang out in junior high.

53
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,510
Did you forget us?

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,550
You are...

55
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,600
It doesn't matter.

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,400
The point is you've become more beautiful now.

57
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,370
Why didn't you invite the two of us for your birthday?

58
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,070
What's with that?

59
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,440
I'm just hanging out with my classmates.

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,100
I'll invite you next time.

61
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,520
Let's not wait for next time. Come hang out in our room. Come on!

62
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,620
I'm not going.

63
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,730
Didn't you hear her refusing to go with you?

64
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,570
Who are you? You are interfering out of blue.

65
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,510
You don't know that I'm from the 18th High School, right?

66
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,380
It doesn't matter who I am.

67
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,880
Do you guys know Jiang Chen?

68
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,380
Yeah.

69
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,830
I was with him just then.

70
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,880
We have been friends for our whole lives.

71
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,920
What's your name? I'll call him and ask about it.

72
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,562
- Wait a second. 
 - Don't. Let's just drop this.

73
00:04:25,562 --> 00:04:26,670
Do not trouble Brother Chen with this.

74
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,830
Bro, it's a misunderstanding.

75
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,110
Since you know Brother Chen, then we will trouble you no more.

76
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,230
We... We should leave now.

77
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,350
We were just kidding.

78
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,140
Happy birthday.

79
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,540
Take care!

80
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,170
Ziqi, that was awesome.

81
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,410
Let's keep a low profile.

82
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,940
Go on, have fun.

83
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,920
I'm going to have the cake split.

84
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,510
What are you looking at?

85
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,070
Do you feel like you need more friends?

86
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,070
Why would you care who I hang out with?

87
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,220
So, are you going to hang out with them?

88
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,500
You keep hanging out with the wrong group. Am I not unbearable enough?

89
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,830
Focus on learning with me is the right path.

90
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,000
Did you hear me?

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,100
Did you?

92
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,200
Yes. I did.

93
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,540
Let's play a game.

94
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,760
What are we going to play?

95
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,071
Idiom Solitaire!

96
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:33,171
You are so boring.

97
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:34,880
- So boring! 
 - Let the birthday girl make that decision.

98
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,920
Shadi! Shadi, tell us. What should we play?

99
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,510
- Idiom Solitaire. 
 - See?

100
00:05:55,957 --> 00:06:01,295
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

101
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:05,007
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

102
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:10,790
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

103
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,147
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

104
00:06:15,935 --> 00:06:21,897
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

105
00:06:21,897 --> 00:06:25,435
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

106
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:31,970
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

107
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,447
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

108
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:39,417
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

109
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:42,010
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

110
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:47,307
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

111

♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

♫  After a long journey  ♫

113
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:57,047
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

114
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,070
- Mr. Liu. 
 - So? Have you thought it through?

115
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,320
Yes.

116
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,950
The abscissa of Point P is 1.

117
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,280
That's wonderful. Listen. About the last question, a lot of students...

118
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,660
Wait. That's not what I asked.

119
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,920
Are you going to tell me where you went last night or what?

120
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,347
Siyue,

121
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:31,620
if you are hiding something,

122
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,410
you can tell me.

123
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,610
I can understand.

124
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,620
But don't keep yourself closed up.

125
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,520
Do you understand?

126
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,720
Yes.

127
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,960
Next time, then.

128
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,660
Wait, you...

129
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,970
- Thank you, Mr. Liu. 
 - That kid!

130
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:53,106
Mr. Liu.

131
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,880
I know where Zhou Siyue went.

132
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,500
Why are you everywhere?

133
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,780
Wait.

134
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,127
Tell me. Where did he go last night?

135
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,570
 Hello, what is it?

136
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,890
 Where is she?

137
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,830
 I'll get over there now.

138
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,530
 You should call someone.

139
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,670
Little Monster!

140
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,110
This is an urgent request.

141
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,940
Please hand over your English homework.

142
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,709
Why aren't you borrowing Master Zhou's homework?

143
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:42,570
He just finished the competition and he's taking a nap now.

144
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,590
I don't have the nerve to wake him up.

145
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:49,550
That's why I'm going with the second-best choice and make do with your homework.

146
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,101
You are lucky that you have a choice.

147
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,810
Xianxian,

148
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,930
please hand over your math homework.

149
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,380
You two are truly deskmates.

150
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,170
Thank you.

151
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,180
Guys, we have the results of the monthly test.

152
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,670
Our class adviser said that now that the test was over, he would talk to each one of us.

153
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,788
So, be prepared.

154
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,110
 Why is this happening?

155
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,700
Yes!

156
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,570
What is it?

157
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,370
I got 270 in science comprehensive.

158
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,000
This is perfect.

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,306
I told you I could stay.

160
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,340
Hey.

161
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,790
Yes!

162
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:01,880
Oh, right! My mom took my cell phone away.

163
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,110
I can't make phone calls at night anymore.

164
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,800
Who would call you?

165
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,020
You called me.

166
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,230
It was you.

167
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,730
Did you forget that?

168
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,230
- Who did? 
 - It's you.

169
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,500
You are the one who called me.

170
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,380
Who was it did you say?

171
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,321
Stop messing with my hair!

172
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:21,250
- Say that again! 
 - What?

173
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,270
Can we focus on the study hall session?

174
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,480
Has fate favored you? You look so happy.

175
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,310
Mom, let me show you something.

176
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,580
I should be able to stay in the science class now.

177
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,090
You did pretty well this time.

178
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,314
That's nothing.

179
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:07,880
Science is not as hard as you think.

180
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,300
Xianxian,

181
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,230
although you did well this time,

182
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,790
- in fact... 
 - Stop.

183
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,106
Mom, we have a deal.

184
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:18,587
You would dishonor yourself if you go back on your word now.

185
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,640
Okay. All right. Fine.

186
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,350
You made your bed, now sleep on it.

187
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,780
You'll know how hard it is later.

188
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,980
So,

189
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,590
Mom.

190
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,440
The test is over now.

191
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,670
I would like to...

192
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,000
Like I don't know what you are thinking.

193
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,500
Thanks, Mom.

194
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:51,612
Just go ahead and play. You will pay for your arrogance.

195
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,570
 [Education Building

196
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,740
The questions in the monthly test are relatively simple.

197
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,490
You have made huge progress,

198
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,180
but your ranking is still low.

199
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,120
Don't let yourself slip.

200
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,720
Yes, Mr. Liu.

201
00:12:09,673 --> 00:12:11,096
Ding Xian.

202
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:12,396
Another thing.

203
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,250
I've noticed that you and Zhou Siyue are always chatting.

204
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,860
Did he affect your learning progress?

205
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,740
No, Mr. Liu. That's not true.

206
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,400
But I did hear that you've been quite close.

207
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,520
You have been hanging out in your private time.

208
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,060
Ding Xian, we are at a critical time right now.

209
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,950
You should focus on your studies.

210
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,586
No, Mr. Liu.

211
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:39,333
We are not like that.

212
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:41,078
How about this?

213
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:43,800
Switch your seat with Song Ziqi after you get back.

214
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,690
I will focus on my studies

215
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,220
and stop chatting.

216
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,820
Mr. Liu, don't worry.

217
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,450
If I can't make any progress in the next monthly test,

218
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,500
I will switch my seat before you tell me to.

219
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,590
Who talked to Mr. Liu?

220
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,880
That's really low.

221
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,680
They better not let me find out.

222
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,000
I think it must be a girl.

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,354
She noticed that you are close and felt jealous.

224
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,880
Stop the nonsense.

225
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,370
We are just deskmates.

226
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,780
We might not even be deskmates.

227
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,110
Why?

228
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,710
Mr. Liu asked me to switch seats so that I can focus on learning.

229
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,960
No way!

230
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,790
Why do all the teachers like doing that?

231
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,740
That's not it.

232
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,030
He asked me to switch seats with Song Ziqi.

233
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,510
You can't do that.

234
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,540
I thought you despised him.

235
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,000
I was just saying. Whatever.

236
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,210
You are not right.

237
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,130
We were at the karaoke the other day.

238
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,980
He saw me singing with another guy.

239
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,710
You should have seen his face.

240
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,480
He sat there all silent,

241
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,320
and he offered to walk me home at the end as if nothing happened.

242
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,340
I just felt that he was a little different that day.

243
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,050
Fickle.

244
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,030
You were not like this a few days ago.

245
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,340
You were so pissed when you saw him walking with someone else.

246
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,000
That was a misunderstanding.

247
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,052
Later, he told me that he was just discussing the basketball match with that girl.

248
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,860
How do you know that?

249
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,110
I went to ask her about that.

250
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,530
 Hey, there.

251
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,490
 Can I help you with anything?

252
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:37,490
She's actually a National Rank 2 Athlete in shot put.

253
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,950
You were so close to never seeing me again.

254
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,860
Let's not talk about me.

255
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,310
How about you? When are you switching seats?

256
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,150
After the monthly test.

257
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,020
Let's see how I do by then.

258
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,810
Ding Xian.

259
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,440
Do you know how to answer this question? I've been stuck on this forever.

260
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,540
Let me see.

261
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,840
The function

262
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,950
of ordinate...

263
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,230
Answer.

264
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,340
R is greater than B.

265
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,570
RX is proven to be... 1025!

266
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,280
X equals 1025.

267
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,570
That's impressive.

268
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,670
How about this one?

269
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,540
Let me try.

270
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,110
547!

271
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,560
It's 9 points.

272
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,520
547!

273
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:44,234
Do you know how to do mental calculations?

274
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,590
Don't you get tired when solving questions?

275
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,960
Like your brain gets tired?

276
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,420
No.

277
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,520
I can do a few reading comprehensionwhen I'm tired, just to relax.

278
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,570
A master is a master.

279
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,790
So, are you doing this question?

280
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,800
I don't quite get it.

281
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,840
Can you show me how you did it? I just need the basics.

282
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,450
Sure.

283
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,856
Just ask me if you ever have any questions.

284
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:13,880
All right.

285
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,980
Zhou Siyue!

286
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,070
Let's go play!

287
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:37,960
You asked me out so early just to play basketball?

288
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,620
Have you never heard of a saying from my idol?

289
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,389
Have you ever seen Shenhai at 4:00 a.m?

290
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:47,390
It's 6:00 a.m. now.

291
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,690
It's not that different. Anyway, all achievements take effort.

292
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,090
I've never seen you work so hard with courses.

293
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,780
What's going on with you?

294
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,200
It was just a contest.

295
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,890
Why do you look so tired?

296
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,320
The contest is not tiring.

297
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,150
But explaining questions is exhausting.

298
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,780
You are so strange.

299
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,780
You've never been close to Liu Xiaofeng.

300
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,540
Why are you explaining questions to him every day?

301
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,640
We don't have other participants. I'm leaving.

302
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,400
They will be here soon.

303
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,560
The match is coming. Everyone will be taking every chance to train.

304
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,310
I'm not participating in the match.

305
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,970
Why would I train?

306
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,950
Don't you want to see beautiful girls cheering for you?

307
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,530
How about helping me teach those brats from Class 8 a lesson?

308
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,910
What does that have to do with me?

309
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
But I've signed you up.

310
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,000
The kind that can't be withdrawn.

311
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,400
You keep working on that...

312
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,907
and I'm going to take a nap.

313
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,340
Keep up the good work.

314
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,740
Xianxian.

315
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,950
Why aren't you at the basketball game?

316
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,350
Why bother?

317
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm all about the monthly test now.

318
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,400
Zhou Siyue is also playing.

319
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,640
Aren't you going to watch it?

320
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,540
I thought he was not in the game.

321
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,280
Is this the first day you've known Song Ziqi?

322
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,590
When has he ever done anything without Zhou Siyue?

323
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,190
Class 8 is so arrogant.

324
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,280
They are showing off their posters and banners.

325
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,400
Why don't we make one?

326
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,430
We are not afraid!

327
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,230
We won't get back in time if we go print it now.

328
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,710
Hey. Do you have any cardboard?

329
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,420
I can draw something.

330
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,970
How did I forget about Ding Xian?

331
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,950
I'll go get some cardboard.

332
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,920
Bring me that! Hurry up. Come on!

333
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,520
This one. Here.

334
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,220
You guys, get over here.

335
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,490
Guys, a science class never lacks what?

336
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,970
That's right. The answer is boys.

337
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,540
Today is the day that Class 3 is going to show some strength.

338
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,680
Let's just focus on the target and do our best.

339
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,280
But they have cheerleaders.

340
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,710
And they've got a hand-held megaphone.

341
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,190
 Class 8, fighting!

342
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,190
 Class 8, fighting!

343
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,230
 Class 8, fighting!

344
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,950
 Class 8, fighting!

345
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,950
 Class 8, fighting!

346
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,230
So what?

347
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,400
We've got Siyue, the master.

348
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,500
Right?

349
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:19,229
Dude, please.

350
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:21,820
The girls won't be watching if you don't play.

351
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,040
I told you I don't want to play today.

352
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,220
Suit yourself.

353
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,730
Come on, bros.

354
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,350
Break a leg.

355
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,010
One, two three. Fighting!

356
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,870
Ding Xian, you did such a good job.

357
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,950
- I'm going to leave now. Thanks. 
 - Thank you, Ding Xian. See you.

358
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,650
Thank you, Ding Xian. See you.

359
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,180
All right. Let's go.

360
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,190
Just a second.

361
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,060
Xianxian.

362
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,600
Can you help me to do another piece saying "Song Ziqi is handsome"?

363
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,140
Something is not right with you.

364
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,230
Just help me.

365
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:16,120
Okay. Song Ziqi is handsome.

366
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,630
What do you mean by that?

367
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,210
Okay. I'll do it. I will.

368
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,900
 Come on!

369
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,900
 Class 8, fighting!

370
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,000
 Class 8, fighting!

371
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,900
 Class 8, fighting!

372
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,400
 Class 8, fighting!

373
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,800
Who would pass a ball like that?

374
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,610
What's the hold-up?

375
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,330
The match has been going on for a while.

376
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,160
Stop rushing us.

377
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,830
Can't you see that we are busy?

378
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,490
It's done.

379
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,380
It's so nice.

380
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,200
Look. How is it?

381
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,090
This one is for Zhou Siyue.

382
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,610
I've prepared it for you.

383
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,860
That's very nice of you. You didn't fail me.

384
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,350
I have to give it to you.

385
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,850
Childish.

386
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,950
The situation is not in our favor. Class 8 is too aggressive.

387
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,703
I can't hold on.

388
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,310
Master, just get on the field, will you?

389
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,490
I can't play.

390
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,000
You...

391
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,740
You are not at your best today.

392
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,470
Yang Chunzi, I'm glad that you are giving me water.

393
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,460
But you are with Class 8 now. If you do this, I would feel...

394
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,740
Siyue, have some water.

395
00:22:52,732 --> 00:22:54,432
Thank you.

396
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,110
Pretentious.

397
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,540
Don't you think she's phony?

398
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,830
Her face is always like that whether she's happy or not.

399
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,920
Tell me about it.

400
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,830
She's still sending water now that we are not in the same class anymore.

401
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,390
Is she a water delivery worker or what?

402
00:23:08,293 --> 00:23:09,673
What are you snickering about?

403
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:11,812
We are speaking up for you!

404
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,350

405
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,570
Who's tired?

406
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,210
- I can't hold on for longer. 
 - You can take a rest.

407
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,650
Dude, you are finally awake.

408
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,290
Let's go.

409
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,320
 Don't give up.

410
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,400
 Zhou Siyue! Fighting!

411
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,410
 Zhou Siyue! Fighting!

412
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,290
 Zhou Siyue, you are the best.

413
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,130
 Keep going, Zhou Siyue!

414
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,090
 Class 3, go!

415
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,040
 Class 3, go!

416
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,900
 Class 3, go!

417
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,960
 Class 3, go!

418
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,300
Zhou Siyue, nice shot!

419
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,580
Where's that spirit when you were making trouble?

420
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,880
Class 3 cannot lose in terms of momentum.

421
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,280
Shout your lungs out!

422
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,040
Zhou Siyue, you are the best!

423
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,680
Class 3, go!

424
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,430
 Class 3, go!

425
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,290
 Class 3, go!

426
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,120
 Class 3, go!

427
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,000
 Class 3, go!

428
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,390
 Zhou is great.

429
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,560

430
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,630
You look nice. Like you are blind.

431
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,400
It has been a whole day.

432
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,060
Why is Siyue still not here?

433
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,920
Did he ask for leave?

434
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:41,680
It's not like I'm his shadow or something, right?

435
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,170
Here. I have some good news.

436
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,420
In the city math competition,

437
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,340
Zhou Siyue from our class did a good job...

438
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,310
and won first place.

439
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:02,560
Here, Deng Wanwan.

440
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,622
Put up the certificate on the wall.

441
00:28:04,622 --> 00:28:05,830
 Zhou Siyue is awesome.

442
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,610
Of course, for those of you who didn't get a ranking, don't feel frustrated.

443
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,760
You still have a lot of opportunities.

444
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,640
Focus on the future.

445
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,560
All right, stop talking.

446
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,200
The study hall begins now.

447
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:29,130
Zhou Siyue is truly Mr. Liu's own son.

448
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,510
What is that supposed to mean?

449
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,830
Let me tell you what I mean.

450
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,560
On the night before the contest, Zhou Siyue ran off in secret and then got caught,

451
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,800
but he wasn't disqualified for that.

452
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,296
I can't compete with someone who has connections.

453
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:46,230
I just can't.

454
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,800
Listen. You better watch your mouth.

455
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,000
He Xingwen, can you not be so mean?

456
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,110
Siyue won the basketball match for us.

457
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,400
And he's also top-notch in terms of math.

458
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,940
What? Are you jealous of him?

459
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,600
I'm jealous? Why would I be?

460
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,760
I just think this is unfair.

461
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,640
Why is the teacher favoring him like that?

462
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,950
I heard that Siyue was punished.

463
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,880
He ran 10 laps on the sports field.

464
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,640
10 laps?

465
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,820
He was punished for 10 laps for making such a huge mistake.

466
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,938
Doesn't that mean the teacher was favoring him?

467
00:29:18,938 --> 00:29:23,420
If you think this is unfair, go talk to the teacher.

468
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,400
Why criticize people in secret? Does that make you better?

469
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,640
Yeah!

470
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,749
Why didn't you mention that when the teacher was here?

471
00:29:29,749 --> 00:29:32,335
 Why didn't you say so just then?

472
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,350
Zhou Siyue.

473
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,040
Zhou Siyue.

474
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,730
The light is on.

475
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,200
Zhou Siyue.

476
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,850
Zhou Siyue.

477
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,550
Zhou Siyue.

478
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,610
Zhou Siyue.

479
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,140
 Who is it?

480
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:47,139
You caught a cold?

481
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,800
From the basketball game a few days ago.

482
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,830
It's really cold in here.

483
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,050
Why did you keep the window open since you have a cold?

484
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,330
Aren't you worried that you will get worse?

485
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,438
Did you crack it?

486
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,460
I didn't mean to do that.

487
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,905
It's great to leave the window open.

488
00:31:10,905 --> 00:31:12,620
Let the air keep flowing.

489
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,920
Where is your mom?

490
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,160
She...

491
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,660
She went out.

492
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,130
Did you have anything?

493
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,310
I just got up.

494
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,130
I don't want to do anything.

495
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,610
Do you have any food?

496
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,610
Instant noodles.

497
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,060
Never mind.

498
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,400
Is it enough?

499
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,040
Is that soup?

500
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,540
It's porridge.

501
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,710
This is the first time that I ever made this.

502
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,830
It looks good.

503
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:53,539
How is it?

504
00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:55,643
Delicious.

505
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,190
You should drink more.

506
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:05,169
Let me do it myself.

507
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,070
I'll go deal with the window.

508
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,350
Leave it be.

509
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,090
You might hurt your hand.

510
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,780
Sit here.

511
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,790
Why are you visiting me all of a sudden?

512
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,180
You won first place in the competition.

513
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,910
I want to tell you that.

514
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,950
And...

515
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:46,500
did Mr. Liu punish you...

516
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,050
for leaving the camp then?

517
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,160
Who told you that?

518
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,880
Sorry.

519
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,670
It's not because of you.

520
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,120
You...

521
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,690
Are you tired?

522
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,390
Yes.

523
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,760
So what?

524
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,520
I'm worried that if you are too tired,

525
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,880
you might get depressed one day.

526
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:32,170
And what if that really happens?

527
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,300
I will be here for you

528
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,562
and help you unconditionally.

529
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,740
How silly are you?

530
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,200
I'm not as fragile as you think.

531
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,980
Besides, we will certainly have more difficulties.

532
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,500
But I won't make you worry.

533
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,370
I'll go get you a glass of hot water.

534
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,800
- Not bad. 
 - Ding Xian.

535
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,940
Where are the clothes that you changed out of?

536
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,720
I'll give them to you later.

537
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,650
What are you doing?

538
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,840
Did you make this?

539
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,560
It's so awful!

540
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,530
Sis, maybe you should stay away from the kitchen.

541
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,800
This is completely dark cuisine.

542
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,950
You could choose not to eat my food.

543
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,980
Ding Xian, come here.

544
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,000
Mom, what are you doing with my diary?

545
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,040
Ding Xian.

546
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,370
You are still young.

547
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,333
Instead of focusing on your studies,

548
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:04,130
just what are you thinking about all day long?

549
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,500
You read my diary?

550
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,011
If I didn't, how would I know what you are busy with all day long?

551
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,430
"I can't believe I lost to him in the game room."

552
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,320
Mom, stop reading it!

553
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,080
This is what you wrote.

554
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,090
Why can't you hear it?

555
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,920
Give it to me.

556
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,300
Give me the diary.

557
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,300
If you don't give it to me, this will not end easily for you.

558
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,949
Give it to me. What are you doing? Give it.

559
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,210
Are you happy now?

560
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,020
I will never write diaries again.

561
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:45,300
Suit yourself.

562
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,950
I'm telling you, Ding Xian.

563
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,087
You are grounded forever.

564
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,950
What are you doing?

565
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,040
I had a spat with my mom.

566
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,060
And I threw my diary out.

567
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,580
Are you sure you dropped it here?

568
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,910
Hey.

569
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,320
I just saw a scavenger pass by and head in that direction.

570
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,390
Hello, have you seen a scavenger nearby?

571
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,270
He's long gone.

572
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:52,833
He's gone?

573
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,230
Stop crying.

574
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,050
I'm fine.

575
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,300
It's okay if I can't find it.

576
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,430
If you don't want to go home,

577
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,250
come hang out at my place.

578
00:39:45,923 --> 00:39:47,823
Let's go.

579
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:19,980
Are you hungry?

580
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,040
You must have skipped your meal, right?

581
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,000
I made some porridge

582
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,640
and I wanted to bring it to you.

583
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,630
I run off after a fight, so I can't go back and get it.

584
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,540
Besides, the porridge tastes so horrible,

585
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,460
yet you lied to me and said it was delicious.

586
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,760
It might be because I was sick

587
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,020
and I had lost my sense of taste.

588
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,850
I don't think we have any food either.

589
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,970
Let's make do with instant noodles.

590
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,150
Here.

591
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,630
Would you like seafood flavor or braised beef flavor?

592
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,590
I'm fine with either one.

593
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,990
All right.

594
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,570
I'll go boil the water.

595
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:14,309
The noodles are ready.

596
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,000
This is the first time I've had instant noodles.

597
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,500
My mom won't let me have any.

598
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,260
So, your mom...

599
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,330
has taken good care of you.

600
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,500
Maybe.

601
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,070
But she can't understand me.

602
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,900
And she doesn't trust me.

603
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,490
The fight we had this time...

604
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,970
was because she looked at my diary.

605
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,790
Your mom...

606
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,392
She did that because she cares.

607
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,370
You have a good mom.

608
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,800
Oh, right!

609
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,700
I have something to show you.

610
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,050
What's this?

611
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:38,646
This is the robot that I used to win the robot competition.

612
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,800
Come on, D2-T3, dance for us.

613
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:55,138
It's so cute!

614
00:42:56,687 --> 00:42:59,360
Why is it dancing like Chaplin?

615
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,416
You know Chaplin!

616
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:03,016
Not bad.

617
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,460
How do you feel?

618
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,440
Better now?

619
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,930
Much better.

620
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,300
It's interesting.

621
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,250
That means the test is a success.

622
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,140
The test?

623
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,630
Yes.

624
00:43:20,635 --> 00:43:25,000
It's actually a comedian robot.

625
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:30,670
It's used to treat patients with mental diseases.

626
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,970
You are the one with mental diseases!

627
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,040
Okay. Finish your food.

628
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,230
I'll walk you home afterward.

629
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,940
I don't want to go back.

630
00:43:45,993 --> 00:43:48,353
Can you let me stay here for one night?

631
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:04,660

632
00:44:06,957 --> 00:44:12,195
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

633
00:44:12,195 --> 00:44:15,407
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

634
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:21,690
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

635
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,847
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

636
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:32,797
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

637
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:36,335
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

638
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:43,070
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

639
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:47,347
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

640
00:44:47,347 --> 00:44:50,017
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

641
00:44:50,017 --> 00:44:53,010
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

642
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:57,923
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

643
00:44:57,923 --> 00:45:00,780
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

644
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,357
♫  After a long journey  ♫

645
00:45:03,357 --> 00:45:07,647
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

646
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:32,013
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

647
00:45:32,013 --> 00:45:34,687
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

648
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:39,893
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

649
00:45:39,893 --> 00:45:42,607
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

650
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:45,047
♫  After a long journey  ♫

651
00:45:45,047 --> 00:45:49,450
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
