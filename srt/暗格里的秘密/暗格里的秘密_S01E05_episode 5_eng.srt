1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:09,990

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,495
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,081
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:26,961
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:32,333
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:36,739
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:40,488
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:47,447
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:55,843
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,843 --> 00:01:01,173
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:04,307
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:06,420
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,573
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:16,299
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:17,887
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:20,239
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:27,892
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:27,892 --> 00:01:32,056

19
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:34,695

20
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,100
You got back quite late. Why aren't you sleeping?

21
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,567
I was just about to.

22
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,667
Sleep, then.

23
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:11,207
 It is said that

24
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:15,670
 the one who spent the countdown with you on New Year's Day

25
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,400
 will be by your side for the whole year.

26
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,130
 I hope whoever said that wasn't lying.

27
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,376
Someone is selling Kongming lanterns there. Let's go.

28
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:43,420
How did you find this place?

29
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,660
My mom used to bring me here when I was young.

30
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,870
Are you really that happy?

31
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,843
- Xiansian, let's write down our wishes. 
 - Okay.

32
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,943
Come on.

33
00:03:56,943 --> 00:03:59,926
- Here. Let's write it down together. 
 - Move over.

34
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,067
You are so childish.

35
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:16,553
- Let me take a look. 
 - No way. Get back to yours.

36
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:19,081
You are so stingy!

37
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:20,936
Let's write.

38
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:40,026
What did you wish for?

39
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,966
I wished that

40
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:47,390
we don't have to be deskmates next semester.

41
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:51,240
Then if we are still deskmates,

42
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,160
it means your Kongming lantern didn't work.

43
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,790
God will hear you if you are sincere enough.

44
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,400
Xianxian, let's ignore him.

45
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,290
Move aside!

46
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,952
Come on!

47
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,288
Three, two, one.

48
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,213
 I want to keep being deskmates with Zhou Siyue.

49
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:50,033
 I want to keep being deskmates with Ding Xian.

50
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:03,960
What are you humming? It sounds awful!

51
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,066
What do you know?

52
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:07,280
This is called beatbox. Not many people can do this.

53
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,570
I've been practicing forever.

54
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,260
If you don't want to listen, I don't want to perform for you either.

55
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,013
I'm fine not listening to that. I don't want to anyway.

56
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:18,626
I've been wanting another deskmate for a long time.

57
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,226
Really?

58
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,039
It's too bad. I made a wish to keep being your deskmate.

59
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,390
Really?

60
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,020
I lied.

61
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,560
You are so annoying. I never want to talk to you again.

62
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,020
No. I wished for a new game machine.

63
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,240
But I do want to keep being deskmates with you.

64
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,310
You are not mad anymore, right?

65
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:48,050
Idiot!

66
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,440
So, I've told you my wish. Why don't you tell me yours?

67
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,680
I'm not telling you.

68
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,160

69
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,810
Xianxian, re you all right?

70
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,200
Why don't you ask the teacher for a leave of absence?

71
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:17,480
We are already here for the exam.

72
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,520
I should have listened to my mom and put on more clothes.

73
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,790
I told you so.

74
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,740
This time, I'm really done for now.

75
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,710
It's okay. Just do your best.

76
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:29,568
The answer to the 6th question is A.

77
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:32,540
- I got it wrong. 
 - The English test is over.

78
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,900
We are free!

79
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:38,386
I'm done.

80
00:08:41,946 --> 00:08:44,116
Close to my anticipation.

81
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,710
Are you sure you got all the right answers?

82
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,420
You should know who your deskmate is.

83
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,165
Oh, this is bad.

84
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,829
I'm going to spend the whole holiday in a cram school.

85
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:57,740
I'm also done.

86
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,120
I will be sitting in the last row after we rearrange seats next semester.

87
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,340
Aren't you in the second-to-last row now?

88
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:05,744
That's not the same.

89
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:08,669
After we rearrange seats next semester, I will be...

90
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,540
I'm changing seats next semester.

91
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,930
Don't think about things like that.

92
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,510
Go home and get some rest.

93
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,896
Don't let your brain burn down before the next semester starts.

94
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,150
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

95
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,670
I would be happy if it burns down.

96
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,740
Then I wouldn't have to take tests anymore.

97
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:34,747
Let's go.

98
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:56,860
 Ding Xian! Siyue is here to deliver your homework.

99
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:06,153
Come on, Siyue.

100
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:17,453
Sorry, Siyue.

101
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:18,549
It's okay, Auntie.

102
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:21,049
I'm just here to bring her the homework.

103
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:23,450
She missed the homecoming day because she was sick.

104
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,460
I just need to tell her something.

105
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,300
- Thank you for coming in person. 
 - My pleasure.

106
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,472
I'll let you two talk.

107
00:10:30,472 --> 00:10:31,872
Okay.

108
00:10:57,252 --> 00:11:01,732
You look... so unique in this photo.

109
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:05,340
You barged into my room. I can let that pass.

110
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,131
But don't look around.

111
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:11,000
All right. You are still sick. Just rest.

112
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,019
Take a seat.

113
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,690
You are still looking.

114
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:37,649
I told you not to.

115
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,350
Is there anything that you can't tell my mom

116
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,180
and had to come into my room?

117
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,890
Sure. I can talk to your mom.

118
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,863
Maybe give the exam results to her as well.

119
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:55,340
Don't!

120
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,740
Let me check the exam results first.

121
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,365
Here are the exam results,

122
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:04,440
our homework,

123
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,652
and notes.

124
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:07,752
All here.

125
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,793
It's okay. It's not as bad as you expected.

126
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,570
It's impressive that you can get a result like that since you were sick.

127
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,528
Do you want to know my scores?

128
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,833
Never mind.

129
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:41,039
Don't provoke me with your achievements like a great god.

130
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,810
Okay. I won't say it.

131
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,250
Anyway, you should hurry up and get well first.

132
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,050
If I have time during the holiday, I'll tutor you.

133
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,010
Your math is almost meaningless.

134
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,050
I need to go home for Spring Festival this year.

135
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:07,389
I just learned that recently.

136
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:27,566
This is my number. If you have questions that you can't solve, call me.

137
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:29,663
See you.

138
00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:31,863
Thank you.

139
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,496
See you at school, my deskmate.

140
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,570
See you at school.

141
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:50,266
My deskmate.

142
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:02,243
I'm back.

143
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:04,343
You are back.

144
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,846
You have started setting things up.

145
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,933
Let me help you.

146
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,500
Here.

147
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,800
Prepare some red envelopes.

148
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:24,570
Look... This Spring Festival is not festive at all, again.

149
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,300
Your dad won't come back until Spring Festival's Eve.

150
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,910
He keeps saying that he's busy.

151
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,450
And he's like that every year.

152
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,430
He keeps having all kinds of exhibitions.

153
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,260
What's keeping him busy all the time?

154
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,300
I think it's pretty good.

155
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,030
Don't you like a quiet environment instead of being surrounded by people?

156
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,470
I did say that,

157
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,760
but people will feel lonely after reaching a certain age.

158
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,340
Now I miss the old times a little.

159
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,600
The whole family would get together during the Spring Festival.

160
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,820
It's festive.

161
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,740
Oh, right! A few days ago,

162
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,000
I heard that Uncle Ding and the rest of them

163
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,510
are having Spring Festival back in our hometown.

164
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,403
Yes. Xian's mom told me when I met her a couple of days ago.

165
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:12,203
What is it?

166
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,088
Do you know their number over there?

167
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:18,780
Ding Xian doesn't have a cell phone,

168
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,253
and anyone who wants to talk to her would have to call her parents.

169
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,237
It's quite troublesome.

170
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,340
You usually don't want to talk to people unless it's necessary.

171
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,256
Why do you want to talk to her in private?

172
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,440
No. I'm not the one who wants to talk to her.

173
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,880
It's Kong Shadi.

174
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,053
You know girls. They like chatting over the phone.

175
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:48,130
That's why she asked me to get the number.

176
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,610
Why would I want to talk to her?

177
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,560
You bought a lot of flowers.

178
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,520
The orange tree looks nice.

179
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:12,855
But I think we should put it there. Am I right?

180
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,180
Leave it there.

181
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,375
I'll ask about it later.

182
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,500
It's really not for me!

183
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,126
Xianxian, help Su with the couplets.

184
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:51,410
And then help me clean the vegetables.

185
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,850
Okay.

186
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,099
I'm here.

187
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:55,710
Great. You are just in time.

188
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,510
Let's see if you have grown taller this year.

189
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,770
You are trying to give me a hard time. How could I reach that high?

190
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,840
That's not so high.

191
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,389
You are taller, of course you can reach it.

192
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:19,170
Fine. You are always right.

193
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,459
Here. Put the Fu up.

194
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,819
I'll keep an eye out for you.

195
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,700
Lower. Lower.

196
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,710
A little to your right. Great. Okay.

197
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:34,023
We are done, Xianxian.

198
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:44,450
Right, Xianxian. I didn't get to ask you.

199
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,113
How was first semester?

200
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:48,450
Has the pressure from Shenhai High School crushed you yet?

201
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,912
How is that possible?

202
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,810
But... I am a little worried.

203
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,540
I didn't do well in the final exam.

204
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,570
I feel bad every time I think about having a new deskmate.

205
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,215
You are going to arrange seats by score, right?

206
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:12,065
Is the stress flooding in?

207
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,653
I have anticipated it all.

208
00:18:17,283 --> 00:18:21,413
I always had a hard time keeping up.

209
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,190
Unlike my deskmate, the champion of the Mathematics Olympiad.

210
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,880
Everything is easy for him.

211
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,190
You can't think like that.

212
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,386
A lot of people have been working hard when you can't see them.

213
00:18:35,386 --> 00:18:38,596
He's not working hard in secret at all.

214
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,414
He plays basketball, games, all of those things.

215
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:47,098
And he still aced it in school.

216
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:55,153
Why do you keep mentioning your deskmate?

217
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,162
Do I?

218
00:18:58,162 --> 00:18:59,499
Yeah.

219
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:01,699
I'm not.

220
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,550
We are classmates.

221
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:09,399
Is that all you are?

222
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:14,566
Okay. I'll stop making fun of you.

223
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:16,946
Let's go fire the firecrackers later.

224
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,150
Maybe not today.

225
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,813
Firecrackers used to be your favorite when you were little.

226
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:30,950
I now feel good about spending Spring Festival Eve at home.

227
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,037
Why don't you take my brother?

228
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,733
 Ding Xian! Are you not done yet?

229
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,510
I'm done.

230
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,780
 Ding Juncong! Put down the food.

231
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,180
 Who said that you can eat it?

232
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,579
Thank you, Senior.

233
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:49,679
Coming, Auntie.

234
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:56,057
 Why do you keep mentioning your deskmate?

235
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:13,710
Zhou Zongtang, you finally came back, and you are still reading.

236
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,850
Can't you just have a pleasant Spring Festival with us?

237
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,210
You know I don't like these kinds of events.

238
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,733
It's not like you don't know that.

239
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:22,970
We can hardly see you over the year

240
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,533
and you always have a reason.

241
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:26,999
I asked you so many times

242
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:29,110
to move to Jiangling with me.

243
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,190
Everything would have been settled.

244
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,610
I'm not going.

245
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,180
I've been living a good life here, why do I have to move to Jiangling?

246
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,410
Why can't you move back?

247
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,230
Our son said that he doesn't mind going to school somewhere else.

248
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,050
You are the only one clinging to this place.

249
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,583
I'm not moving.

250
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,750
Didn't you tell me during the summer vacation that you're willing to go anywhere?

251
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,650
I've changed my mind.

252
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,060
Shenhai is actually nice.

253
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,210
See?

254
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,800
My son and I both like Shenhai.

255
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,973
You are the only one who likes Jiangling.

256
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,373
Here, son.

257
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:10,780
All right, you two are the best.

258
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:14,983
It's Spring Festival. Smile a little.

259
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:19,740
 Another dish is coming!

260
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,703
 Here it is.

261
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,250
Let's welcome the bright spring of the year of the tiger together.

262
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,130
Counting down: Ten!

263
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,920
Nine! Eight! Seven!

264
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,490
Six! Five! Four!

265
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,130
Three! Two! One!

266
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,869
Xianxian!

267
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,136
Hello?

268
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:24,636
 Hello.

269
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,160
Happy Spring Festival.

270
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,050
Happy Spring Festival.

271
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,559
Oh, right! How did you do on the test?

272
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,163
Now you want to know?

273
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:48,279
I'm not telling you.

274
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:50,928
Don't tell me.

275
00:22:50,928 --> 00:22:55,197
I'll know when school starts.

276
00:22:55,197 --> 00:22:59,159
Yes. You'll know when school starts.

277
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,137
Okay. Get some rest.

278
00:23:05,137 --> 00:23:07,117
I'm hanging up.

279
00:23:07,117 --> 00:23:09,393
See you at school, deskmate.

280
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,960
See you at school.

281
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,547
Ding Juncong, have some more.

282
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:35,460
 Come on.

283
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,440
 My dear granddaughter.

284
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,040
- Grandma, happy Spring Festival. 
  - Yes. Happy Spring Festival.

285
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,440
 - Come on, cheers. 
 - Yes. Let's drink together.

286
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,560
 Cheers!

287
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,430
 Happy Spring Festival!

288
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,770
 I hope everything goes well for you!

289
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,230
Stop looking.

290
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,010
The seats remain.

291
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,290
You don't believe in me?

292
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,020

293
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,332
They didn't change?

294
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,720
They really haven't.

295
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,915
So troublesome.

296
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,646
Why is it still you after everything?

297
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:51,389
I feel hurt hearing that.

298
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:55,483
I was so genuine when I said that I didn't want a new deskmate.

299
00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:56,880
If I knew I was such a jinx,

300
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,110
I should have wished to be Yang Chunzi's deskmate.

301
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,430
Do you think you deserve that?

302
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,956
Right. I don't deserve that.

303
00:25:03,956 --> 00:25:05,956
That's why I'm sitting next to you.

304
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:07,540
So, you are saying that I don't deserve someone better?

305
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,180
No. I was just saying what you said.

306
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,710
I was being kind to take you in.

307
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,310
Of course.

308
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,880
I've overstepped the line.

309
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,560
You are a fairy that has descended to the earth;

310
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,283
the princess who goes to the south of the Yangtze River.

311
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:21,373
I'm a commoner.

312
00:25:21,373 --> 00:25:23,244
It's an honor to meet you.

313
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:25,239
That's more like it.

314
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,653
What?

315
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,262
I told you that we will be deskmates again.

316
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,542
I can't believe this.

317
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:44,789
You, the golden boy, got the same scores as I did?

318
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,576
Did you fail the exam on purpose?

319
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:15,076
That's not right. Your scores. How did I...

320
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:19,789
I don't even have to do the numbers to know your scores.

321
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:23,016
You really failed the exam for me?

322
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:25,720
What? Why would you say it's for you?

323
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,839
I promised you that we would be deskmates and that's what I have to do.

324
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,590
I did well in math in the mock.

325
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,348
Let me take you out this weekend.

326
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,487
I have to check my schedule first.

327
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,206
You have ordered a lot.

328
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,650
I have to thank you properly.

329
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,280
Whatever, I have to make up for it.

330
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,580
My head has gotten bigger. (Learned a lot)

331
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,230
You actually have a conscience.

332
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:24,030
It's okay to have a nice meal.

333
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:28,560
It's my birthday after all.

334
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,240
Happy birthday.

335
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,360
Thank you.

336
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,573
What do you want for your birthday gift?

337
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
Have you finished?

338
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,880
Yeah.

339
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,500
Come on. I'll take you somewhere.

340
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,910
Where are we going?

341
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,736
Why did you bring me here?

342
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,436
Just a second.

343
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,103
Professor Liu.

344
00:28:21,103 --> 00:28:23,353
Siyue!

345
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:25,287
- Long time no see. 
 - Yes. It's been a while.

346
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,630
How's your dad?

347
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,730
He's still the same.

348
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,352
Oh, Professor Liu.

349
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:35,710
Can you do me a favor?

350
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,210
Tell me.

351
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,386
Why did you bring me here?

352
00:28:43,386 --> 00:28:44,986
Just a second.

353
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,326
You are being mysterious.

354
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Zhou Siyue.

355
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,340
Hm?

356
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,520
Why do you want to be my deskmate?

357
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,900
 Come on, say something nice.

358
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,090
Because you are dumb.

359
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,789
You can play by yourself. I'm going home.

360
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,180
Hey.

361
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,520
I can only tell you...

362
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,930
that I feel no pressure being your deskmate.

363
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,250
You don't care what my scores are,

364
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,000
and you don't ask me what time I go to bed in all the ways you can.

365
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,530
You definitely don't say that the competitions I go to are just wasting time.

366
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:37,670
Because you don't care about me and that makes me feel relaxed.

367
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,640
I thought Master Zhou was not afraid of anything.

368
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,370
I'm not afraid.

369
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,595
I just find it annoying.

370
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,382
Okay.

371
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,070
Stand over there.

372
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,060
There?

373
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,960
In the middle.

374
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,940
This is...

375
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,700
The skymap on your birthday.

376
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,460
On my birthday?

377
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,960
Yes.

378
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,200
This is your universe.

379
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,513
And what about the one on your birthday?

380
00:30:41,513 --> 00:30:43,113
Do you want to see it?

381
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,283
Just a second.

382
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,230
That's beautiful.

383
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:12,490
I really want a star that never goes out.

384
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,930
You're quite daring.

385
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,765
No star can exist forever.

386
00:31:28,565 --> 00:31:32,146
They're all just blips in the universe.

387
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:34,360
But just like the universe,

388
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,350
there will be many stars in everyone's life.

389
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,900
They may look ordinary,

390
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:49,020
but everything will make sense once the stars form a unique nebula

391
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,030
after millions of light-years.

392
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,730

393
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,267

394
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,110
Xianxian, happy birthday.

395
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,839
The gift arrived a little late. I hope you won't mind.

396
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,880
I wouldn't. Thank you.

397
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,680
Open up and have a look.

398
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,550
I have one exactly the same.

399
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,867
Now we can use the same model.

400
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:39,880
No. This is too expensive. I can't take this.

401
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,180
It's not expensive.

402
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,360
Besides, don't you want to use the same model as I do?

403
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,210
- I mean it. 
 - Just take it.

404
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,609
Take it.

405
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:50,109
It's okay.

406
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,649
Open it and take a look.

407
00:32:53,277 --> 00:32:54,833
Thank you, Shadi.

408
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:57,033
This is very nice of you.

409
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:59,893
Come on! Let's go beat those brats from Class One!

410
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:01,768
- We are depending on you today. 
 - Sure thing.

411
00:33:01,768 --> 00:33:02,970
Stop there.

412
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,700
The four of us are on cleaning duty today.

413
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,800
Did you forget that?

414
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,270
What?

415
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,610
What do we do? I told them we'd play at 5:30.

416
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,803
Let them wait.

417
00:33:14,803 --> 00:33:16,940
Are you kidding me? They will say we have no contract spirit.

418
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,989
I'm the Kobe of Shenhai High School. I need to maintain my reputation.

419
00:33:19,989 --> 00:33:22,204
Then go play by yourself.

420
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:24,046
Dude, how can I play by myself?

421
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:28,387
Why don't I help you with your cleaning duty?

422
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:32,503
Then that's settled.

423
00:33:32,503 --> 00:33:34,583
Ding Xian, you are such a good friend.

424
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,560
Did she say she would cover your duty?

425
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,797
She's covering Zhou Siyue's duty.

426
00:33:47,177 --> 00:33:51,177
Great Aunt, just help me this once.

427
00:33:51,177 --> 00:33:53,143
I'll buy your meal later.

428
00:33:53,143 --> 00:33:55,916
I can do all your cleaning duties. All right?

429
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:57,529
I can help you.

430
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:01,089
How about handling all my cleaning duties for the whole semester?

431
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,289
Sure. All right.

432
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:06,293
Go.

433
00:34:06,293 --> 00:34:08,993
All right. Just go.

434
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,613
Xianxian, you are too generous.

435
00:34:13,613 --> 00:34:16,473
You can't give a guy whatever he wants.

436
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:19,120
Forget it. Let's get started.

437
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,083
He just took you to a planetarium?

438
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,090
I think the planetarium was nice.

439
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,930
It's romantic.

440
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,180
Boring.

441
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,890
Oh, Shadi. I drew something for Zhou Siyue.

442
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,680
Can you take a look and tell me how it is?

443
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,120
Sure.

444
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,353
Take a look at it for me.

445
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,726
I know you can draw, but I didn't expect it to be so beautiful.

446
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,626
Really?

447
00:34:57,626 --> 00:34:59,559
It's really nice.

448
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:01,850
Hello. Are you Ding Xian?

449
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,539
How can I help?

450
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:05,870
Can you do me a favor?

451
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,420
What is it?

452
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,154
Deliver this to Zhou Siyue.

453
00:35:10,154 --> 00:35:13,670
I'm trusting you with this. I'll buy you a meal later.

454
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,460
Thank you.

455
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,800
How dumb are you? You could just refuse.

456
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,760
She even wrote, "To Zhou Siyue."

457
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,206
She's really straightforward.

458
00:35:27,206 --> 00:35:30,136
Does Zhou Siyue even know her?

459
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,200
What should we do now?

460
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,380
Why the panic? Just tear it up.

461
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,387
How can I tear up someone else's letter?

462
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:41,383
Why can't you?

463
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:43,569
Let me help you with that.

464
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:45,610
What are you doing, Kong Shadi?

465
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,630
What do you mean by that? Why the yelling?

466
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,840
How could you tear up someone else's letter?

467
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,740
What am I supposed to say to Zhou Siyue?

468
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,320
Are you thinking about telling him this?

469
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,130
If both of us keep our mouths shut, how could he know about this?

470
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,860
I'm doing this for your sake.

471
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,740
Besides, do you know who she is?

472
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,390
You Keke.

473
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,740
She's quite famous in our school.

474
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,330
She only hangs out with boys.

475
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,370
If you give this letter to Zhou Siyue,

476
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,200
he will have one more girl in his life. Doesn't that bother you?

477
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,600
That's his business.

478
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,290
Fine. I stopped you from being silly and you are criticizing me.

479
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,606
Ding Xian, you are so heartless.

480
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:21,043
It doesn't matter if I'm being silly,

481
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:23,900
tearing up someone else's letter is unethical.

482
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,670
Unethical...

483
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,840
Even if you can hide it from everyone, do you think you can hide it from me?

484
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,455
I obviously did what your heart most wanted to do. Did I not?

485
00:36:38,507 --> 00:36:41,387
And you are trying to deny that.

486
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,600
- Let's go home. 
 - Have you finished up here?

487
00:37:06,053 --> 00:37:08,493
- Let's go home. 
 - Come on!

488
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:11,436
Aren't you going to wait for them?

489
00:37:11,436 --> 00:37:13,536
You can wait if you want.

490
00:37:15,677 --> 00:37:18,117
I'm leaving. See you.

491
00:37:20,693 --> 00:37:22,863
What's wrong with her?

492
00:37:24,406 --> 00:37:26,406
What is it?

493
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,800
Zhou Siyue.

494
00:37:58,053 --> 00:38:01,712
We should go home separately from now on.

495
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,685
What happened?

496
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:07,436
Are you mad about covering my cleaning duty?

497
00:38:07,436 --> 00:38:11,498
I'm worried that if we get too close,

498
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,390
people will get ideas.

499
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,789
Okay.

500
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,850
 Even if you can hide it from everyone, do you think you can hide it from me?

501
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,783
 I obviously did what your heart most wanted to do.

502
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:45,463
 And you are trying to deny that.

503
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:47,287
 Did I deny it?

504
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:51,090
 I just don't understand why everyone around him

505
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,770
 is so much better than me.

506
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,000
This tastes really bad.

507
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,762
What did I tell you?

508
00:39:19,762 --> 00:39:21,991
I told you not to buy too much of that if you don't know how it tastes.

509
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:23,290
Isn't it a waste of money?

510
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:26,125
I still need to taste it to know if it's delicious.

511
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,569
How could I know otherwise?

512
00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:29,469
Strange theory.

513
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,207
Little Monster, did you have any breakfast?

514
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:36,033
Be fair here, do you think it's delicious or not?

515
00:39:36,033 --> 00:39:38,233
Give it back to me.

516
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,117
What happened with you two?

517
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:07,842
What's that?

518
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:09,586
Let me see.

519
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,230
Not bad.

520
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,900
Someone is already showing her interest in you.

521
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,381
Let me take another look.

522
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:17,181
Knock it off!

523
00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:22,104
Something is wrong. You usually throw things like that away after a glance.

524
00:40:22,104 --> 00:40:23,645
Why are you trying to hide it this time?

525
00:40:23,645 --> 00:40:26,005
- Something is... 
 - You are so annoying!

526
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,050
You are so lame!

527
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,770
Do you know what I saw in Zhou Siyue's drawer?

528
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,353
Why are you telling me?

529
00:40:34,353 --> 00:40:36,260
You are close to Ding Xian, right?

530
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,460
Talk to her about it.

531
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:44,313
You are all in a snit today!

532
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,430
Deng Wanwan, let's go have lunch together.

533
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,080
All right, I heard that they have braised pork in Canteen No. 2 today.

534
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,113
Let's hurry. It may run out soon.

535
00:41:13,113 --> 00:41:15,213
Okay. Let's go.

536
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,130
Did you two have a falling out?

537
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,569
It's okay. We have had a lot of spats.

538
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:29,383
I know her. That's just how she is.

539
00:41:29,383 --> 00:41:32,013
She will come to talk to you when she calms down.

540
00:41:32,013 --> 00:41:34,225
- Really? 
 - Yes.

541
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,733
- Thank you. 
 - That's okay.

542
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:41,630
Master, let's go have lunch.

543
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,056
Are you going or not?

544
00:41:43,056 --> 00:41:47,399
You guys go ahead. I need to finish my notes.

545
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:48,980
Let's go.

546
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:58,020
Okay, class. We are going to have another physical fitness test.

547
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,610
Boys and girls are all doing sit-ups.

548
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,370
Team up in pairs however you like.

549
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:05,190
And you will be each other's counters, all right?

550
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,895
We are starting now. Find yourself a partner and gather over there.

551
00:42:09,633 --> 00:42:11,196
Wanwan, let's go together.

552
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,096
Okay.

553
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,480
Liu Xiaofeng, why don't we team up?

554
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,089
Sure. Let's go.

555
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:24,109
Why are you stalling? Come on, let's finish up and then go play.

556
00:42:32,263 --> 00:42:34,063
Okay.

557
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,150
Ding Xian, come on!

558
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:48,110
Come on, Ding Xian!

559
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:08,810

560
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:16,167
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

561
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:20,379
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

562
00:43:21,376 --> 00:43:25,662
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

563
00:43:25,662 --> 00:43:30,819
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

564
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:36,669
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

565
00:43:36,669 --> 00:43:40,907
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

566
00:43:40,907 --> 00:43:47,042
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

567
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:51,319
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

568
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:54,289
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

569
00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:56,982
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

570
00:43:56,982 --> 00:44:01,879
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

571
00:44:01,879 --> 00:44:04,752
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

572
00:44:04,752 --> 00:44:07,329
♫  After a long journey  ♫

573
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:12,100
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

574
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,985
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

575
00:44:35,985 --> 00:44:38,659
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

576
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:43,602
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

577
00:44:43,602 --> 00:44:46,479
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

578
00:44:46,479 --> 00:44:49,019
♫  After a long journey  ♫

579
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:54,170
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
