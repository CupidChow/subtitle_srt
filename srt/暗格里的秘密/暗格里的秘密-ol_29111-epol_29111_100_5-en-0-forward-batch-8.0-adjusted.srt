1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:17,990

2
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:26,495
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:31,081
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:34,961
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:40,333
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:44,739
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:48,488
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:55,447
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:55,447 --> 00:01:03,843
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:09,173
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:12,307
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:14,420
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,573
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:24,299
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,887
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:28,239
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:35,892
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:35,892 --> 00:01:40,056

19
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:42,695

20
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,100
You got back quite late. Why aren't you sleeping?

21
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,567
I was just about to.

22
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:44,667
Sleep, then.

23
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:19,207
 It is said that

24
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:23,670
 the one who spent the countdown with you on New Year's Day

25
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,400
 will be by your side for the whole year.

26
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,130
 I hope whoever said that wasn't lying.

27
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,376
Someone is selling Kongming lanterns there. Let's go.

28
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,420
How did you find this place?

29
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,660
My mom used to bring me here when I was young.

30
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,870
Are you really that happy?

31
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,843
- Xiansian, let's write down our wishes.
 - Okay.

32
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,943
Come on.

33
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:07,926
- Here. Let's write it down together.
 - Move over.

34
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,067
You are so childish.

35
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:24,553
- Let me take a look.
 - No way. Get back to yours.

36
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:27,081
You are so stingy!

37
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,936
Let's write.

38
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,026
What did you wish for?

39
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,966
I wished that

40
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:55,390
we don't have to be deskmates next semester.

41
00:04:56,473 --> 00:04:59,240
Then if we are still deskmates,

42
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,160
it means your Kongming lantern didn't work.

43
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,790
God will hear you if you are sincere enough.

44
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,400
Xianxian, let's ignore him.

45
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,290
Move aside!

46
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,952
Come on!

47
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,288
Three, two, one.

48
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,213
 I want to keep being deskmates with Zhou Siyue.

49
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:58,033
 I want to keep being deskmates with Ding Xian.

50
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:11,960
What are you humming? It sounds awful!

51
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,066
What do you know?

52
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:15,280
This is called beatbox. Not many people can do this.

53
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,570
I've been practicing forever.

54
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,260
If you don't want to listen, I don't want to perform for you either.

55
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,013
I'm fine not listening to that. I don't want to anyway.

56
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:26,626
I've been wanting another deskmate for a long time.

57
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:28,226
Really?

58
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,039
It's too bad. I made a wish to keep being your deskmate.

59
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,390
Really?

60
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,020
I lied.

61
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,560
You are so annoying. I never want to talk to you again.

62
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,020
No. I wished for a new game machine.

63
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,240
But I do want to keep being deskmates with you.

64
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,310
You are not mad anymore, right?

65
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:56,050
Idiot!

66
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,440
So, I've told you my wish. Why don't you tell me yours?

67
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,680
I'm not telling you.

68
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,160

69
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,810
Xianxian, re you all right?

70
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,200
Why don't you ask the teacher for a leave of absence?

71
00:07:22,657 --> 00:07:25,480
We are already here for the exam.

72
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,520
I should have listened to my mom and put on more clothes.

73
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,790
I told you so.

74
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,740
This time, I'm really done for now.

75
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,710
It's okay. Just do your best.

76
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:37,568
The answer to the 6th question is A.

77
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:40,540
- I got it wrong.
 - The English test is over.

78
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,900
We are free!

79
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:46,386
I'm done.

80
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,116
Close to my anticipation.

81
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,710
Are you sure you got all the right answers?

82
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,420
You should know who your deskmate is.

83
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,165
Oh, this is bad.

84
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,829
I'm going to spend the whole holiday in a cram school.

85
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:05,740
I'm also done.

86
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,120
I will be sitting in the last row after we rearrange seats next semester.

87
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,340
Aren't you in the second-to-last row now?

88
00:09:12,288 --> 00:09:13,744
That's not the same.

89
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:16,669
After we rearrange seats next semester, I will be...

90
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,540
I'm changing seats next semester.

91
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,930
Don't think about things like that.

92
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,510
Go home and get some rest.

93
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,896
Don't let your brain burn down before the next semester starts.

94
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:31,150
- Let's go.
 - Let's go.

95
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,670
I would be happy if it burns down.

96
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,740
Then I wouldn't have to take tests anymore.

97
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,747
Let's go.

98
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,860
 Ding Xian! Siyue is here to deliver your homework.

99
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:14,153
Come on, Siyue.

100
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,453
Sorry, Siyue.

101
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:26,549
It's okay, Auntie.

102
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:29,049
I'm just here to bring her the homework.

103
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:31,450
She missed the homecoming day because she was sick.

104
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,460
I just need to tell her something.

105
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,300
- Thank you for coming in person.
 - My pleasure.

106
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,472
I'll let you two talk.

107
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,872
Okay.

108
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:09,732
You look... so unique in this photo.

109
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:13,340
You barged into my room. I can let that pass.

110
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,131
But don't look around.

111
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:19,000
All right. You are still sick. Just rest.

112
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:23,019
Take a seat.

113
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,690
You are still looking.

114
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:45,649
I told you not to.

115
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,350
Is there anything that you can't tell my mom

116
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,180
and had to come into my room?

117
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,890
Sure. I can talk to your mom.

118
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,863
Maybe give the exam results to her as well.

119
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:03,340
Don't!

120
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,740
Let me check the exam results first.

121
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,365
Here are the exam results,

122
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:12,440
our homework,

123
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,652
and notes.

124
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:15,752
All here.

125
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,793
It's okay. It's not as bad as you expected.

126
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,570
It's impressive that you can get a result like that since you were sick.

127
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,528
Do you want to know my scores?

128
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,833
Never mind.

129
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:49,039
Don't provoke me with your achievements like a great god.

130
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,810
Okay. I won't say it.

131
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,250
Anyway, you should hurry up and get well first.

132
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,050
If I have time during the holiday, I'll tutor you.

133
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,010
Your math is almost meaningless.

134
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,050
I need to go home for Spring Festival this year.

135
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:15,389
I just learned that recently.

136
00:13:30,063 --> 00:13:35,566
This is my number. If you have questions that you can't solve, call me.

137
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,663
See you.

138
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,863
Thank you.

139
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,496
See you at school, my deskmate.

140
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,570
See you at school.

141
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:58,266
My deskmate.

142
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:10,243
I'm back.

143
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:12,343
You are back.

144
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:14,846
You have started setting things up.

145
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,933
Let me help you.

146
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,500
Here.

147
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,800
Prepare some red envelopes.

148
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:32,570
Look... This Spring Festival is not festive at all, again.

149
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,300
Your dad won't come back until Spring Festival's Eve.

150
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,910
He keeps saying that he's busy.

151
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,450
And he's like that every year.

152
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,430
He keeps having all kinds of exhibitions.

153
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,260
What's keeping him busy all the time?

154
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,300
I think it's pretty good.

155
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,030
Don't you like a quiet environment instead of being surrounded by people?

156
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,470
I did say that,

157
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:58,760
but people will feel lonely after reaching a certain age.

158
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,340
Now I miss the old times a little.

159
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,600
The whole family would get together during the Spring Festival.

160
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,820
It's festive.

161
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,740
Oh, right! A few days ago,

162
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,000
I heard that Uncle Ding and the rest of them

163
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,510
are having Spring Festival back in our hometown.

164
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:18,403
Yes. Xian's mom told me when I met her a couple of days ago.

165
00:15:18,403 --> 00:15:20,203
What is it?

166
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,088
Do you know their number over there?

167
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:26,780
Ding Xian doesn't have a cell phone,

168
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,253
and anyone who wants to talk to her would have to call her parents.

169
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:31,237
It's quite troublesome.

170
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:35,340
You usually don't want to talk to people unless it's necessary.

171
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,256
Why do you want to talk to her in private?

172
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,440
No. I'm not the one who wants to talk to her.

173
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,880
It's Kong Shadi.

174
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,053
You know girls. They like chatting over the phone.

175
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,130
That's why she asked me to get the number.

176
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,610
Why would I want to talk to her?

177
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,560
You bought a lot of flowers.

178
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,520
The orange tree looks nice.

179
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:20,855
But I think we should put it there. Am I right?

180
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,180
Leave it there.

181
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,375
I'll ask about it later.

182
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,500
It's really not for me!

183
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,126
Xianxian, help Su with the couplets.

184
00:16:58,126 --> 00:16:59,410
And then help me clean the vegetables.

185
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,850
Okay.

186
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,099
I'm here.

187
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:03,710
Great. You are just in time.

188
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,510
Let's see if you have grown taller this year.

189
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:16,770
You are trying to give me a hard time. How could I reach that high?

190
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,840
That's not so high.

191
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,389
You are taller, of course you can reach it.

192
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:27,170
Fine. You are always right.

193
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,459
Here. Put the Fu up.

194
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,819
I'll keep an eye out for you.

195
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,700
Lower. Lower.

196
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,710
A little to your right. Great. Okay.

197
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:42,023
We are done, Xianxian.

198
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:52,450
Right, Xianxian. I didn't get to ask you.

199
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,113
How was first semester?

200
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:56,450
Has the pressure from Shenhai High School crushed you yet?

201
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,912
How is that possible?

202
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,810
But... I am a little worried.

203
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,540
I didn't do well in the final exam.

204
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,570
I feel bad every time I think about having a new deskmate.

205
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,215
You are going to arrange seats by score, right?

206
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,065
Is the stress flooding in?

207
00:18:21,693 --> 00:18:24,653
I have anticipated it all.

208
00:18:25,283 --> 00:18:29,413
I always had a hard time keeping up.

209
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,190
Unlike my deskmate, the champion of the Mathematics Olympiad.

210
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,880
Everything is easy for him.

211
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,190
You can't think like that.

212
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,386
A lot of people have been working hard when you can't see them.

213
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:46,596
He's not working hard in secret at all.

214
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,414
He plays basketball, games, all of those things.

215
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:55,098
And he still aced it in school.

216
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:03,153
Why do you keep mentioning your deskmate?

217
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,162
Do I?

218
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:07,499
Yeah.

219
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:09,699
I'm not.

220
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,550
We are classmates.

221
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:17,399
Is that all you are?

222
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:22,566
Okay. I'll stop making fun of you.

223
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:24,946
Let's go fire the firecrackers later.

224
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,150
Maybe not today.

225
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,813
Firecrackers used to be your favorite when you were little.

226
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:38,950
I now feel good about spending Spring Festival Eve at home.

227
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,037
Why don't you take my brother?

228
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,733
 Ding Xian! Are you not done yet?

229
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,510
I'm done.

230
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:52,780
 Ding Juncong! Put down the food.

231
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,180
 Who said that you can eat it?

232
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,579
Thank you, Senior.

233
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:57,679
Coming, Auntie.

234
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:04,057
 Why do you keep mentioning your deskmate?

235
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:21,710
Zhou Zongtang, you finally came back, and you are still reading.

236
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,850
Can't you just have a pleasant Spring Festival with us?

237
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,210
You know I don't like these kinds of events.

238
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,733
It's not like you don't know that.

239
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,970
We can hardly see you over the year

240
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,533
and you always have a reason.

241
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:34,999
I asked you so many times

242
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,110
to move to Jiangling with me.

243
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,190
Everything would have been settled.

244
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,610
I'm not going.

245
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,180
I've been living a good life here, why do I have to move to Jiangling?

246
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,410
Why can't you move back?

247
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,230
Our son said that he doesn't mind going to school somewhere else.

248
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,050
You are the only one clinging to this place.

249
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,583
I'm not moving.

250
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,750
Didn't you tell me during the summer vacation that you're willing to go anywhere?

251
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,650
I've changed my mind.

252
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,060
Shenhai is actually nice.

253
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,210
See?

254
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,800
My son and I both like Shenhai.

255
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,973
You are the only one who likes Jiangling.

256
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,373
Here, son.

257
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:18,780
All right, you two are the best.

258
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:22,983
It's Spring Festival. Smile a little.

259
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:27,740
 Another dish is coming!

260
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:30,703
 Here it is.

261
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,250
Let's welcome the bright spring of the year of the tiger together.

262
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,130
Counting down: Ten!

263
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,920
Nine! Eight! Seven!

264
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,490
Six! Five! Four!

265
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,130
Three! Two! One!

266
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,869
Xianxian!

267
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,136
Hello?

268
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:32,636
 Hello.

269
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,160
Happy Spring Festival.

270
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,050
Happy Spring Festival.

271
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,559
Oh, right! How did you do on the test?

272
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:54,163
Now you want to know?

273
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:56,279
I'm not telling you.

274
00:22:57,036 --> 00:22:58,928
Don't tell me.

275
00:22:58,928 --> 00:23:03,197
I'll know when school starts.

276
00:23:03,197 --> 00:23:07,159
Yes. You'll know when school starts.

277
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,137
Okay. Get some rest.

278
00:23:13,137 --> 00:23:15,117
I'm hanging up.

279
00:23:15,117 --> 00:23:17,393
See you at school, deskmate.

280
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,960
See you at school.

281
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,547
Ding Juncong, have some more.

282
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:43,460
 Come on.

283
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,440
 My dear granddaughter.

284
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,040
- Grandma, happy Spring Festival.
  - Yes. Happy Spring Festival.

285
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,440
 - Come on, cheers.
 - Yes. Let's drink together.

286
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,560
 Cheers!

287
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,430
 Happy Spring Festival!

288
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,770
 I hope everything goes well for you!

289
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,230
Stop looking.

290
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,010
The seats remain.

291
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,290
You don't believe in me?

292
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,020

293
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,332
They didn't change?

294
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:34,720
They really haven't.

295
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,915
So troublesome.

296
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,646
Why is it still you after everything?

297
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:59,389
I feel hurt hearing that.

298
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:03,483
I was so genuine when I said that I didn't want a new deskmate.

299
00:25:03,483 --> 00:25:04,880
If I knew I was such a jinx,

300
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,110
I should have wished to be Yang Chunzi's deskmate.

301
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,430
Do you think you deserve that?

302
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,956
Right. I don't deserve that.

303
00:25:11,956 --> 00:25:13,956
That's why I'm sitting next to you.

304
00:25:13,956 --> 00:25:15,540
So, you are saying that I don't deserve someone better?

305
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,180
No. I was just saying what you said.

306
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,710
I was being kind to take you in.

307
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,310
Of course.

308
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,880
I've overstepped the line.

309
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,560
You are a fairy that has descended to the earth;

310
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,283
the princess who goes to the south of the Yangtze River.

311
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:29,373
I'm a commoner.

312
00:25:29,373 --> 00:25:31,244
It's an honor to meet you.

313
00:25:31,244 --> 00:25:33,239
That's more like it.

314
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,653
What?

315
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,262
I told you that we will be deskmates again.

316
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,542
I can't believe this.

317
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:52,789
You, the golden boy, got the same scores as I did?

318
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,576
Did you fail the exam on purpose?

319
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:23,076
That's not right. Your scores. How did I...

320
00:26:23,076 --> 00:26:27,789
I don't even have to do the numbers to know your scores.

321
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:31,016
You really failed the exam for me?

322
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:33,720
What? Why would you say it's for you?

323
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,839
I promised you that we would be deskmates and that's what I have to do.

324
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,590
I did well in math in the mock.

325
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,348
Let me take you out this weekend.

326
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,487
I have to check my schedule first.

327
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,206
You have ordered a lot.

328
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,650
I have to thank you properly.

329
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,280
Whatever, I have to make up for it.

330
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,580
My head has gotten bigger. (Learned a lot)

331
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,230
You actually have a conscience.

332
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,030
It's okay to have a nice meal.

333
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:36,560
It's my birthday after all.

334
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,240
Happy birthday.

335
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,360
Thank you.

336
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,573
What do you want for your birthday gift?

337
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,600
Have you finished?

338
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,880
Yeah.

339
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,500
Come on. I'll take you somewhere.

340
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,910
Where are we going?

341
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,736
Why did you bring me here?

342
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:25,436
Just a second.

343
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,103
Professor Liu.

344
00:28:29,103 --> 00:28:31,353
Siyue!

345
00:28:31,353 --> 00:28:33,287
- Long time no see.
 - Yes. It's been a while.

346
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:34,630
How's your dad?

347
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,730
He's still the same.

348
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,352
Oh, Professor Liu.

349
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,710
Can you do me a favor?

350
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,210
Tell me.

351
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,386
Why did you bring me here?

352
00:28:51,386 --> 00:28:52,986
Just a second.

353
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,326
You are being mysterious.

354
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Zhou Siyue.

355
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,340
Hm?

356
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,520
Why do you want to be my deskmate?

357
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,900
 Come on, say something nice.

358
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,090
Because you are dumb.

359
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,789
You can play by yourself. I'm going home.

360
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,180
Hey.

361
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,520
I can only tell you...

362
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,930
that I feel no pressure being your deskmate.

363
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,250
You don't care what my scores are,

364
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,000
and you don't ask me what time I go to bed in all the ways you can.

365
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,530
You definitely don't say that the competitions I go to are just wasting time.

366
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,670
Because you don't care about me and that makes me feel relaxed.

367
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,640
I thought Master Zhou was not afraid of anything.

368
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,370
I'm not afraid.

369
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,595
I just find it annoying.

370
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,382
Okay.

371
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,070
Stand over there.

372
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,060
There?

373
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,960
In the middle.

374
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,940
This is...

375
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,700
The skymap on your birthday.

376
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,460
On my birthday?

377
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,960
Yes.

378
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,200
This is your universe.

379
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,513
And what about the one on your birthday?

380
00:30:49,513 --> 00:30:51,113
Do you want to see it?

381
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,283
Just a second.

382
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,230
That's beautiful.

383
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:20,490
I really want a star that never goes out.

384
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,930
You're quite daring.

385
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,765
No star can exist forever.

386
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:40,146
They're all just blips in the universe.

387
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:42,360
But just like the universe,

388
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,350
there will be many stars in everyone's life.

389
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,900
They may look ordinary,

390
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:57,020
but everything will make sense once the stars form a unique nebula

391
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,030
after millions of light-years.

392
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,730

393
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,267

394
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,110
Xianxian, happy birthday.

395
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,839
The gift arrived a little late. I hope you won't mind.

396
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,880
I wouldn't. Thank you.

397
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,680
Open up and have a look.

398
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,550
I have one exactly the same.

399
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,867
Now we can use the same model.

400
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:47,880
No. This is too expensive. I can't take this.

401
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,180
It's not expensive.

402
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,360
Besides, don't you want to use the same model as I do?

403
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,210
- I mean it.
 - Just take it.

404
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,609
Take it.

405
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:58,109
It's okay.

406
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,649
Open it and take a look.

407
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:02,833
Thank you, Shadi.

408
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:05,033
This is very nice of you.

409
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:07,893
Come on! Let's go beat those brats from Class One!

410
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:09,768
- We are depending on you today.
 - Sure thing.

411
00:33:09,768 --> 00:33:10,970
Stop there.

412
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,700
The four of us are on cleaning duty today.

413
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,800
Did you forget that?

414
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,270
What?

415
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,610
What do we do? I told them we'd play at 5:30.

416
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,803
Let them wait.

417
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:24,940
Are you kidding me? They will say we have no contract spirit.

418
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,989
I'm the Kobe of Shenhai High School. I need to maintain my reputation.

419
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:30,204
Then go play by yourself.

420
00:33:30,204 --> 00:33:32,046
Dude, how can I play by myself?

421
00:33:32,046 --> 00:33:36,387
Why don't I help you with your cleaning duty?

422
00:33:37,923 --> 00:33:40,503
Then that's settled.

423
00:33:40,503 --> 00:33:42,583
Ding Xian, you are such a good friend.

424
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,560
Did she say she would cover your duty?

425
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,797
She's covering Zhou Siyue's duty.

426
00:33:55,177 --> 00:33:59,177
Great Aunt, just help me this once.

427
00:33:59,177 --> 00:34:01,143
I'll buy your meal later.

428
00:34:01,143 --> 00:34:03,916
I can do all your cleaning duties. All right?

429
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,529
I can help you.

430
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:09,089
How about handling all my cleaning duties for the whole semester?

431
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:13,289
Sure. All right.

432
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:14,293
Go.

433
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:16,993
All right. Just go.

434
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,613
Xianxian, you are too generous.

435
00:34:21,613 --> 00:34:24,473
You can't give a guy whatever he wants.

436
00:34:24,473 --> 00:34:27,120
Forget it. Let's get started.

437
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:33,083
He just took you to a planetarium?

438
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:35,090
I think the planetarium was nice.

439
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,930
It's romantic.

440
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:39,180
Boring.

441
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,890
Oh, Shadi. I drew something for Zhou Siyue.

442
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,680
Can you take a look and tell me how it is?

443
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,120
Sure.

444
00:34:56,353 --> 00:34:58,353
Take a look at it for me.

445
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,726
I know you can draw, but I didn't expect it to be so beautiful.

446
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,626
Really?

447
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:07,559
It's really nice.

448
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:09,850
Hello. Are you Ding Xian?

449
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,539
How can I help?

450
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:13,870
Can you do me a favor?

451
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,420
What is it?

452
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,154
Deliver this to Zhou Siyue.

453
00:35:18,154 --> 00:35:21,670
I'm trusting you with this. I'll buy you a meal later.

454
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,460
Thank you.

455
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,800
How dumb are you? You could just refuse.

456
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,760
She even wrote, "To Zhou Siyue."

457
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,206
She's really straightforward.

458
00:35:35,206 --> 00:35:38,136
Does Zhou Siyue even know her?

459
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,200
What should we do now?

460
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,380
Why the panic? Just tear it up.

461
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,387
How can I tear up someone else's letter?

462
00:35:46,387 --> 00:35:49,383
Why can't you?

463
00:35:49,383 --> 00:35:51,569
Let me help you with that.

464
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:53,610
What are you doing, Kong Shadi?

465
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,630
What do you mean by that? Why the yelling?

466
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,840
How could you tear up someone else's letter?

467
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,740
What am I supposed to say to Zhou Siyue?

468
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,320
Are you thinking about telling him this?

469
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,130
If both of us keep our mouths shut, how could he know about this?

470
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,860
I'm doing this for your sake.

471
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,740
Besides, do you know who she is?

472
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,390
You Keke.

473
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,740
She's quite famous in our school.

474
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,330
She only hangs out with boys.

475
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,370
If you give this letter to Zhou Siyue,

476
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,200
he will have one more girl in his life. Doesn't that bother you?

477
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,600
That's his business.

478
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,290
Fine. I stopped you from being silly and you are criticizing me.

479
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,606
Ding Xian, you are so heartless.

480
00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:29,043
It doesn't matter if I'm being silly,

481
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:31,900
tearing up someone else's letter is unethical.

482
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,670
Unethical...

483
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,840
Even if you can hide it from everyone, do you think you can hide it from me?

484
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,455
I obviously did what your heart most wanted to do. Did I not?

485
00:36:46,507 --> 00:36:49,387
And you are trying to deny that.

486
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,600
- Let's go home.
 - Have you finished up here?

487
00:37:14,053 --> 00:37:16,493
- Let's go home.
 - Come on!

488
00:37:18,229 --> 00:37:19,436
Aren't you going to wait for them?

489
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:21,536
You can wait if you want.

490
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:26,117
I'm leaving. See you.

491
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:30,863
What's wrong with her?

492
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:34,406
What is it?

493
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,800
Zhou Siyue.

494
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:09,712
We should go home separately from now on.

495
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,685
What happened?

496
00:38:12,685 --> 00:38:15,436
Are you mad about covering my cleaning duty?

497
00:38:15,436 --> 00:38:19,498
I'm worried that if we get too close,

498
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,390
people will get ideas.

499
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:26,789
Okay.

500
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,850
 Even if you can hide it from everyone, do you think you can hide it from me?

501
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,783
 I obviously did what your heart most wanted to do.

502
00:38:50,783 --> 00:38:53,463
 And you are trying to deny that.

503
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:55,287
 Did I deny it?

504
00:38:55,287 --> 00:38:59,090
 I just don't understand why everyone around him

505
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,770
 is so much better than me.

506
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:26,000
This tastes really bad.

507
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,762
What did I tell you?

508
00:39:27,762 --> 00:39:29,991
I told you not to buy too much of that if you don't know how it tastes.

509
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:31,290
Isn't it a waste of money?

510
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:34,125
I still need to taste it to know if it's delicious.

511
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,569
How could I know otherwise?

512
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:37,469
Strange theory.

513
00:39:38,786 --> 00:39:41,207
Little Monster, did you have any breakfast?

514
00:39:41,207 --> 00:39:44,033
Be fair here, do you think it's delicious or not?

515
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:46,233
Give it back to me.

516
00:39:49,445 --> 00:39:52,117
What happened with you two?

517
00:40:14,142 --> 00:40:15,842
What's that?

518
00:40:15,842 --> 00:40:17,586
Let me see.

519
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,230
Not bad.

520
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,900
Someone is already showing her interest in you.

521
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,381
Let me take another look.

522
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:25,181
Knock it off!

523
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:30,104
Something is wrong. You usually throw things like that away after a glance.

524
00:40:30,104 --> 00:40:31,645
Why are you trying to hide it this time?

525
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:34,005
- Something is...
 - You are so annoying!

526
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,050
You are so lame!

527
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,770
Do you know what I saw in Zhou Siyue's drawer?

528
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,353
Why are you telling me?

529
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:44,260
You are close to Ding Xian, right?

530
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,460
Talk to her about it.

531
00:40:48,943 --> 00:40:52,313
You are all in a snit today!

532
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:16,430
Deng Wanwan, let's go have lunch together.

533
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,080
All right, I heard that they have braised pork in Canteen No. 2 today.

534
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,113
Let's hurry. It may run out soon.

535
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:23,213
Okay. Let's go.

536
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,130
Did you two have a falling out?

537
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,569
It's okay. We have had a lot of spats.

538
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:37,383
I know her. That's just how she is.

539
00:41:37,383 --> 00:41:40,013
She will come to talk to you when she calms down.

540
00:41:40,013 --> 00:41:42,225
- Really?
 - Yes.

541
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,733
- Thank you.
 - That's okay.

542
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:49,630
Master, let's go have lunch.

543
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,056
Are you going or not?

544
00:41:51,056 --> 00:41:55,399
You guys go ahead. I need to finish my notes.

545
00:41:55,399 --> 00:41:56,980
Let's go.

546
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:06,020
Okay, class. We are going to have another physical fitness test.

547
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,610
Boys and girls are all doing sit-ups.

548
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,370
Team up in pairs however you like.

549
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,190
And you will be each other's counters, all right?

550
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:16,895
We are starting now. Find yourself a partner and gather over there.

551
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:19,196
Wanwan, let's go together.

552
00:42:19,196 --> 00:42:21,096
Okay.

553
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,480
Liu Xiaofeng, why don't we team up?

554
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,089
Sure. Let's go.

555
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:32,109
Why are you stalling? Come on, let's finish up and then go play.

556
00:42:40,263 --> 00:42:42,063
Okay.

557
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,150
Ding Xian, come on!

558
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,110
Come on, Ding Xian!

559
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:16,810

560
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:24,167
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

561
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:28,379
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

562
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:33,662
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

563
00:43:33,662 --> 00:43:38,819
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

564
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:44,669
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

565
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:48,907
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

566
00:43:48,907 --> 00:43:55,042
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

567
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:59,319
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

568
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:02,289
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

569
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:04,982
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

570
00:44:04,982 --> 00:44:09,879
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

571
00:44:09,879 --> 00:44:12,752
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

572
00:44:12,752 --> 00:44:15,329
♫  After a long journey  ♫

573
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:20,100
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

574
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,985
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

575
00:44:43,985 --> 00:44:46,659
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

576
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:51,602
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

577
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:54,479
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

578
00:44:54,479 --> 00:44:57,019
♫  After a long journey  ♫

579
00:44:57,019 --> 00:45:02,170
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
