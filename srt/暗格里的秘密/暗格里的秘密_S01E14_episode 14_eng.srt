1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,540

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,563
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,049
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:26,929
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:32,301
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,807
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:40,456
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:47,515
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:54,911
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,441
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,275
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,275 --> 00:01:06,388
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,388 --> 00:01:09,641
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:15,367
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,955
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:20,307
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,307 --> 00:01:27,564
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:27,564 --> 00:01:31,863

19
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:34,220

20
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,360
In the exam, our class did excellently.

21
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,350
There are a few students who have made huge progress.

22
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,580
Ding Xian.

23
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,300
You scored 538.

24
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,900
Not bad. Keep up the good work.

25
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,800
And Sun Jiacheng,

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,750
you scored 559.

27
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,500

28
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,140

29
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,650
Hello, everyone.

30
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,440
I'm Zhou Siyue from Class 3, Senior 3.

31
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:13,450

32
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,600
This may have happened to a lot of you.

33
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,280
You thought the classical Chinese text were too long...

34
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,370
and the math questions were hard.

35
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,860
We feel tired every day.

36
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,400
But we can never sleep over 6 hours.

37
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,150
A new gel pen would run out of ink in two days.

38
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,450
In days overtaxing my life like these,

39
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,320
I would ask myself a question:

40
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,890
Is everything we are doing worth the effort?

41
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,120
But it was on mundane and boring days like this,

42
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,430
we got to know a bunch of sweet and kind people.

43
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,350
We share the same target.

44
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,116
And we are working toward that target together.

45
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,096
We are fighting together.

46
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,030
In the vast space and limitless time,

47
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,820
even if we are destined to part ways,

48
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,950
watching the starry sky with you is the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

49
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,340
So, keep going,

50
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,190
and don't be afraid.

51
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,010
Days may look like they are repeating themselves,

52
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,810
but there will be a day when you suddenly understand the meaning of persistence.

53
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,470
Because I always believe in one word.

54
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,180
There is still glory on the other side.

55
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,900

56
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,710
Hey!

57
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,070
Why are you here?

58
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,510
Are you expecting someone else?

59
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,190
What do you think? Do you have any place you want to go after the exam?

60
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,010
I want to get drunk.

61
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,500
Sure.

62
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,640
I know several good places.

63
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,530
We can ask Song Ziqi and the others to join us.

64
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,920
That's okay.

65
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,140
I'd like to hang out with Shadi alone.

66
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,770
Girls have a lot to talk about.

67
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,220
Let's go.

68
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,900
Cheers.

69
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,580
Why would anyone drink like that?

70
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,620
What's wrong?

71
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,720
I don't know what's wrong with me.

72
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,480
My brain went blank during the exam.

73
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,320
I couldn't think of anything.

74
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,510
It's the same for everyone.

75
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,440
I was also like that. I left a lot of questions unanswered.

76
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,230
The exam is over now.

77
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,410
Stop thinking about all those things.

78
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,650
It's hopeless now.

79
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,840
It's okay.

80
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,280
I thought I could get close to Zhou Siyue.

81
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,570
I tried so hard to study.

82
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,340
But in the end, I still can't do it, Shadi.

83
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,560
Will I ever catch up with him again?

84
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,000
You idiot.

85
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,250
You are the one to talk.

86
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,590
You are an idiot, too.

87
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,660
You clearly have feelings for Song Ziqi.

88
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,860
I don't!

89
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,250
I just...

90
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:58,470
I just feel sad that we are about to part ways.

91
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,340
That's all.

92
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Yeah.

93
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,883
We are all going our separate ways.

94
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,030
Not just me and Zhou Siyue will be separated.

95
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,760
Me and you,

96
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,030
Song Ziqi, and You Keke.

97
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,830
We are all going our separate ways.

98
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,490
Why are you talking about that now?

99
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,240
I haven't thought about those things.

100
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,540
Let's forget that now.

101
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,490
Xianxian.

102
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,300
If we can start high school all over,

103
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,140
I will be your good friend on day one.

104
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,250
Me, too.

105
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,330
We will always be friends.

106
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,150
Don't forget me when you are at university.

107
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,910
You, too.

108
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,610
You are looking awful with the crying face again.

109
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,600
You look awful!

110
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,800
All right!

111
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,360
Let's sing.

112
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,040
Come on.

113
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,450
Shadi!

114
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,790
I really don't want to be separated from you.

115
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,140
Let's go back.

116
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,760
I need a minute.

117
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,890
Zhou Siyue.

118
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,770
Hey, hey, hey!

119
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,400
Zhou Siyue.

120
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,450
Ding Xian, you are hilarious.

121
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,990
You mistook the garbage can for Zhou Siyue.

122
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,000
He is Zhou Siyue.

123
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,760
Look. Zhou Siyue is over there.

124
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,060
You are lying.

125
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,250
Ding Xian.

126
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:38,722
Come here.

127
00:11:38,722 --> 00:11:39,680
You two are ridiculous.

128
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,301
Siyue and I searched every store, and we still couldn't find you.

129
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,380
I'll take her back first.

130
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,970
Hey!

131
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,610
Why won't you talk to me?

132
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,650
I just don't want to.

133
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:58,400
We are not going to be deskmates or neighbors again.

134
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,240
Why would I care about you?

135
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,000
You are going to care about me.

136
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,480
I want you to care about me all the time.

137
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,083
It hurts!

138
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,854
I'm not going to care about you.

139
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:16,000
Slow down.

140
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,793
You...

141
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,660
I don't want to walk with you.

142
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,760
You are always walking so fast

143
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,150
and leaving me far behind.

144
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,130
I'll let you walk in front from now on, all right?

145
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:49,249
It doesn't matter who's behind,

146
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:52,710
I will not be able to walk with you again.

147
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,800
Get up first, will you?

148
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,070
Come on.

149
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:09,439
Hop on.

150
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,842
Didn't we agree that we will face everything together?

151
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,470
Siyue.

152
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,260
Zhou Siyue.

153
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,423
I'm here.

154
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:39,067
I've always been thinking

155
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:44,560
about what we would look like when we grow up.

156
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,050
Would we be leading a simple and happy life

157
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,966
as we did in high school?

158
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,980
I think so.

159
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,990
You are lying.

160
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,600
When have people ever stayed the same after they are separated?

161
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,620
Are we going to become strangers one day?

162
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,000
Stop the nonsense. You are drunk.

163
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,890
I'm not drunk.

164
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:29,290
Zhou Siyue, have you heard a saying?

165
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,640
Don't worry when the cloud covers the moon.

166
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,440
You are brighter than the stars.

167
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,970
Your future is as bright as the stars.

168
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,980
You are silly.

169
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,780
Stars don't shine.

170
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,220
I don't care.

171
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,310
I said they do, and that's what they do.

172
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,070
Silly.

173
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,260
Open your mouth.

174
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,090
So? Will you drink again?

175
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,740
Song Ziqi,

176
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,310
what should we do?

177
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,910
After this vacation,

178
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,040
I will not see you again when school starts.

179
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,130
We've been together since we were young.

180
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,440
All these years have passed.

181
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,490
How are you going to live without me?

182
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,750
Hey, hey, hey! It's okay.

183
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,530
It's just that I can't bully you or make you suffer again.

184
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,200
I'm fine.

185
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,265
You just keep lying.

186
00:16:09,265 --> 00:16:11,610
You've been lying since we were young.

187
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,552
What did I do?

188
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:16,000
When we were in kindergarten,

189
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,669
I wet my pants once.

190
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:23,880
You told me to stand on the sports field so that my pants would dry faster.

191
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,727
And when we were in elementary school,

192
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:31,090
you told me that girls would also grow beards, and I should shave with a razor.

193
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,650
My mom chased after me to hit me for that.

194
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,540
The most outrageous one was before the senior high entrance examination.

195
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,250
You lied to me and said that the essential balm could lift my spirit.

196
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,650
You told me to put some on my eyelids.

197
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,817
Song Ziqi, if you hate me so much, just tell me.

198
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:50,960
No. No, hear me out.

199
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,320
I... I just think you are interesting every time I see you.

200
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,570
I want to hoax you.

201
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,066
Are you a fool or what?

202
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:03,840
I've been indulging you for so long, can't you see that I like you?

203
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,230
So why are you always mean to me?

204
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,070
You are always hitting me,

205
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,140
making me do things, and treating me like I'm your errand boy.

206
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,460
How could I tell that you like me?

207
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,540
Stop changing the subject.

208
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,060
Just tell me,

209
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,110
do you like me or not?

210
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:46,794
Kong Shadi.

211
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,550
I've been following you around...

212
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,210
for all these years.

213
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,900
If you are not the one I like,

214
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,570
then who is?

215
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:21,930
So... So, we will be having a long-distance relationship.

216
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,630
That's okay.

217
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,540
Maybe in a long-distance relationship,

218
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,540
you will like me even more.

219
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,617
I'm serious.

220
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,960
Don't worry.

221
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,120
Even if we have a long-distance relationship,

222
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,230
I will never let you go.

223
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,710
Then we have a deal.

224
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,370
You have to call me every day,

225
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,400
and you have to answer my calls and my messages.

226
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,100
All right.

227
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,050
We are going to see each other every month.

228
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,390
All right.

229
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,680
You can't lie to me or say bad things about me.

230
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,750
- You have to care about me. 
 - All right.

231
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:07,740
If I'm bullied, you have to come to me right away.

232
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,363
And for festivals, anniversaries, and birthdays, you will...

233
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:35,500
What are you doing?

234
00:19:57,101 --> 00:20:00,490
Mom, you scared the hell out of me.

235
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,710
You brat!

236
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,890
It's already afternoon, and you are still sleeping.

237
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,330
You didn't answer my call yesterday.

238
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,940
You came home late, smelling like alcohol.

239
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,030
You are letting yourself go right after the exam.

240
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,370
How did I get back?

241
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,310
Siyue brought you back.

242
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,707
Get up now!

243
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,400
How did you do in the exam?

244
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,483
Have you estimated your score yet?

245
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:38,133
Not yet.

246
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,941
Mom, I'm going to freshen up.

247
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,550

248
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,200

249
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,530
Ding Xian, your teacher said that you would get into

250
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,950
a top university in Hangzhou.

251
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:22,990
Mom, I don't want to choose a university.

252
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,460
What did you say?

253
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,180
I said that I'm not going to choose a university.

254
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,210
I want to repeat the third year.

255
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,400
Instead of going to a top university,

256
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,200
you want to spend money and redo the third year.

257
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,190
Have you become a nerd?

258
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,130
I could have done better in the exam.

259
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,510
I can't let this go.

260
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,210
I won't agree with that.

261
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,200
I will ask your teacher to choose a university for you right now.

262
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,730
Don't even think about repeating the third year.

263
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,630
Mom, can you stop meddling?

264
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,760
This is my life, not yours.

265
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,030
Can you let me decide this time?

266
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:00,770
I can live with the consequences whether they are good or bad.

267
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,520
All right?

268
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Fine.

269
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,820
I will never care about anything you do from now on.

270
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,160
Don't worry.

271
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,850
I've packed everything.

272
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,590
We will be with you this afternoon.

273
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,560
We have to be by your side at a time like this.

274
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,930
All right. That's all.

275
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,750
What's going on, Mom? Are you going somewhere?

276
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,230
Siyue, come here and sit.

277
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,820
I need to talk to you about something.

278
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,050
What happened?

279
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:03,620
Siyue, we are going to Jiangling soon.

280
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:11,420
Is it because something happened to Dad?

281
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:19,010
I can't explain it in a few words.

282
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,880
All right, got it.

283
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,860
Mom, I need to go out shortly. I will be back soon.

284
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,520
Go.

285
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:58,290
I didn't do well in the exam.

286
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,580
I can't go to Jiangling.

287
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:07,590
So, where are you going?

288
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:10,530
I'm going to...

289
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,230
repeat the third year.

290
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,230
Repeat the third year?

291
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,230
You can wait for me in Huaqing.

292
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,390
Maybe if I outdo myself,

293
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,600
I will be joining you.

294
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,070
All right.

295
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,960
I have another thing to tell you.

296
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,930
I might be leaving soon.

297
00:25:59,353 --> 00:26:02,413
Are you coming back this summer?

298
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,480
I'm afraid that... I won't be able to come back.

299
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Fine.

300
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,290
I will miss you.

301
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,690
I have to go now.

302
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,433
I'm starting the third year all over again tomorrow.

303
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:40,333
Wait.

304
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,620
I have a parting gift for you.

305
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:04,280
Isn't this the robot called D2-T3 you showed me last time?

306
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,800
Not bad. You still remember that.

307
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,190
Why did you call it D2-T3?

308
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,240
It's a random name.

309
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,700
I'm going to give it a name.

310
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,170
All right. What do you want to call it?

311
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,410
April.

312
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,190
April?

313
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,760
 I will always remember

314
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,750
 the summer when I was 18

315
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:49,390
 that was excruciatingly hot and tough.

316
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:55,630
 Everything I knew was saying goodbye to me and leaving me.

317
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,890
 All I could do was face reality

318
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:05,490
 and say goodbye with a smile.

319
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,320
Xianxian, I would like to discuss something with you.

320
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,300
Director Wang from the senior year has always been the class adviser of honor classes.

321
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,610
They have a high university enrollment rate.

322
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,570
Your mom and I discussed it.

323
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:44,200
How about you repeat the third year in his class?

324
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,720
Great. I've also heard that Mr. Wang is excellent.

325
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,420
I might make more progress in his class.

326
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,320
All right. I should go now.

327
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,940
You should also head to school after breakfast.

328
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,480
Dad, I'm also done. Let's go together.

329
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,596
All right. Come. Let's go. I'll carry that for you.

330
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,095
Come on. We are leaving now.

331
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,440

332
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:19,480

333
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,430
All right. Guys, I'll make this short.

334
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:31,700
You all understand the pressure of the third year.

335
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,280
I'm not going to say big words here.

336
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,430
But I do have one request.

337
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:46,090
Carefully write down the university you desire

338
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:50,920
and start to work towards it today.

339
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,900
We have several students repeating the third year.

340
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,000
I hope they can face their past

341
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,130
and review themselves.

342
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,910
Make better choices this time.

343
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,660
 As the third year starts again,

344
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,210
 I feel like everyone is drifting away from me.

345
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,230
 They are all walking on the right path towards the future,

346
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:24,740
 and I'm the only one off track.

347
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:30,000
 I'm missing Zhou Siyue and everyone else.

348
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,740
 As shredded and obscure

349
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,290
 as the days are,

350
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,210
 I can never let myself relax for one second.

351
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,870
 I'm worried that once I stop,

352
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:46,120
 countless people will surpass me

353
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,440
 and make me a stepping stone.

354
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,850

355
00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:00,870
Professor Ye, hello. I'm Zhou Zongtang's son.

356
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,190
You must be Siyue.

357
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,840
Old Zhou told me a lot about you. We are finally meeting today.

358
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,130
Yes. I've heard that you and my dad are good friends.

359
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,350
That's why I came unnoticed today.

360
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,200
Not at all.

361
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,090
Here is the thing, Professor Ye.

362
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:25,060
Do you know what happened to my dad?

363
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:34,220
Ding Xian, is Huaqing your target?

364
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,910
Yes.

365
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:44,380
Ding Xian, a year is not too long or too short.

366
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,470
If your target is Huaqing,

367
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,080
you will need to put in more effort than the others.

368
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
I know.

369
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,360
And I will.

370
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,090
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

371
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,790
This is a letter for Zhou Zongtang. Please sign it.

372
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,690
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

373
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,060
Eat your food.

374
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,790
Is it for me?

375
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,900
Yes.

376
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,307

377
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,400
You guys eat. It's okay.

378
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,120
I need to make a phone call.

379
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:35,110
Mr. Wang. Sorry.

380
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,170
I've been troubling you with this.

381
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:41,090
 Zhou's thesis

382
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,680
 was reported for suspicion of plagiarism and fraud.

383
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,970
 He's under investigation now.

384
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,940
Siyue.

385
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,190
What are you thinking about?

386
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,790
Have some food.

387
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,130
You too.

388
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,710
 I've seen everything through now.

389
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,110
 There will be a day when the truth comes out.

390
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:19,526
Dad.

391
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,180
What's happening?

392
00:33:25,063 --> 00:33:26,850
I've been suffering from minor hypoglycemia.

393
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,060
A doctor has prescribed some medicine for me.

394
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,560
Don't worry.

395
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,660
Go back and rest.

396
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,770
Dad,

397
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,810
I went to see Professor Ye today.

398
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,500
I know...

399
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,780
that you are worried

400
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,700
that I will be affected in school.

401
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,920
But I'm not afraid.

402
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,380
I believe in you.

403
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,970
Sorry.

404
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,870
I've brought this on you and your mom.

405
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,300
We are a family.

406
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,300
We are supposed to share burdens.

407
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:25,050
Besides, there are so many professors in Huaqing,

408
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,530
people may not know you at all,

409
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,600
let alone me.

410
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,770
You haven't had anything yet, right?

411
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,690
I'll warm up the dishes.

412
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,790
- Hello? 
 - Hello?

413
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:22,690
Have you got the result of the entrance examination today?

414
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,060
How did it go?

415
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,210
Not bad.

416
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,580
I got a high place on the rankings.

417
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,290
Why are you calling me all of a sudden?

418
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,370
I just want to tell you that...

419
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,110
I've sorted out everything here.

420
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,840
And I will report to school tomorrow.

421
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,070
 Don't worry about me.

422
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,600
 How about you?

423
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,220
 How are you doing in school?

424
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,980
Ding Xian?

425
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,780
What's wrong?

426
00:36:01,043 --> 00:36:02,850
I'm fine.

427
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,230
My marks and ranking...

428
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,560
in this exam...

429
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,010
are both good.

430
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:14,920
The teacher said that...

431
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,360
I might get into Huaqing.

432
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
 Oh, right!

433
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,120
 Can you take some photos for me

434
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
 when you arrive at Huaqing?

435
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,430
You are silly.

436
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,970
Of course, I can.

437
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,030
I want to know what Huaqing looks like.

438
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,110
You'll know when you get here.

439
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,350
I hope everything can go well.

440
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,060
Are you really okay?

441
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,060
I'm just a little tired.

442
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,200
I feel sleepy.

443
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,870
Then go to bed.

444
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,110
Everything will be fine.

445
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,560
Everything will be fine.

446
00:37:19,491 --> 00:37:21,091
Siyue.

447
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,020
Mom.

448
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,120
You are still up.

449
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,600
I just finished the laundry and I'm about to hang them on the balcony.

450
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,510
Why are you still up?

451
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,400
Why are you putting these away?

452
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,460
These are all useless objects.

453
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,980
I want to see if I can sell them.

454
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,080
Aren't these your treasures?

455
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,320
That's when I was young.

456
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,170
I'm all grown up now.

457
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:55,136
Right, Mom.

458
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,130
I might need to go back to Shenhai

459
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,210
before school starts.

460
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,770
Ding Juncong!

461
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,230
Did you stay up all night playing games again?

462
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,590
It's a weekend.

463
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,020
What's wrong with playing games?

464
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,210
You are about to be in junior high soon.

465
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,500
You need to focus on studying.

466
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,050
If you could learn half as hard as your sister does,

467
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,290
I will never say anything about you.

468
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,390
My sis has become a nerd already.

469
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,390
Stop the nonsense.

470
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,120
Xianxian, did you stay up late studying again?

471
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,130
Yeah.

472
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,950
Mr. Wang told me that you have made

473
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,990
huge progress a few days ago.

474
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,190
You did really well in the exam.

475
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,670
But I have to warn you,

476
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,910
don't work too hard.

477
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,191
You need to relax occasionally so that you won't break.

478
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,460
Okay.

479
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,160
I understand.

480
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,550
I'm going back to my room now.

481
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,180
Is that all you are going to eat?

482
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,780
I'm full.

483
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,710
She can't keep this up.

484
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,120
Her spirit is getting worse.

485
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,180
I heard her talking in her dream last night.

486
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,140
She was reciting formulas in her dream.

487
00:39:12,788 --> 00:39:13,840
There's nothing I can do about it.

488
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,000
Why don't you go talk to her?

489
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,400
I'm not saying anything.

490
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,800
I didn't want her to repeat the third year

491
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,710
because I didn't want her to be stuck in this.

492
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,120
What's the point of all this?

493
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,390
Enough. Stop talking.

494
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,390
It won't do anything now.

495
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
What should we do?

496
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,660
I don't know.

497
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,040
I know my sister

498
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,330
might listen to this one person.

499
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,930
Who is it?

500
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,361
Mom, I'm not hungry.

501
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:45,710
I'll skip lunch. Don't wait for me.

502
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,500
 Xianxian, it's me.

503
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,770
Senior Brother!

504
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,800
I thought you were in Jiangling right now.

505
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,150
I'm here to visit your parents

506
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,000
and check up on you by the way.

507
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,200
Come on, let's go take a walk.

508
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,500
Don't lock yourself in your room studying.

509
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,830
Did my parents ask you to come?

510
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,970
They are worried about you.

511
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,440
I'm fine.

512
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,450
Repeating the third year...

513
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,030
must be tough.

514
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,270
A lot of people are living a tougher life than I am.

515
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,550
This is nothing.

516
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,690
Senior Brother,

517
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,790
do you know that...

518
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:50,470
there's a girl in our class named Lin You?

519
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,870
She's repeating the third year for the third time.

520
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,320
Her target has always been Nanjing University.

521
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,470
But she's doing worse during each year.

522
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,390
I think she's the most painstaking

523
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,410
and hard-working student in our class.

524
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,430
But the harder she works, the more often she screws up.

525
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,950
She once had a meltdown right in our classroom

526
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:18,180
and tore up all the books and papers.

527
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,250
Repeating the third year...

528
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,080
is terrifying.

529
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,030
Xianxian,

530
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,000
is this what you are thinking about?

531
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
Actually,

532
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,480
if you are tired,

533
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,630
if you want to take a break,

534
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:46,520
no one will blame you.

535
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,870
Senior Brother,

536
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,670
I'm so tired.

537
00:41:58,646 --> 00:42:01,170
I'm really tired.

538
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:35,760

539
00:42:38,815 --> 00:42:44,105
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

540
00:42:44,153 --> 00:42:47,465
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

541
00:42:49,362 --> 00:42:53,648
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

542
00:42:53,648 --> 00:42:57,405
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

543
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:04,655
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

544
00:43:04,655 --> 00:43:07,993
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

545
00:43:09,249 --> 00:43:15,028
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

546
00:43:15,028 --> 00:43:18,105
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

547
00:43:19,102 --> 00:43:22,275
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

548
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:24,868
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

549
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:28,565
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

550
00:43:29,881 --> 00:43:32,738
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

551
00:43:32,738 --> 00:43:35,315
♫  After a long journey  ♫

552
00:43:35,315 --> 00:43:39,005
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

553
00:44:01,031 --> 00:44:03,971
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

554
00:44:03,971 --> 00:44:06,645
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

555
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:10,688
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

556
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:14,465
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

557
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:17,005
♫  After a long journey  ♫

558
00:44:17,005 --> 00:44:20,808
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
