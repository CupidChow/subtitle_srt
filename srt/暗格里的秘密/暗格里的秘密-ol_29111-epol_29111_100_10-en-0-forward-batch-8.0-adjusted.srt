00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,710

2
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,566
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,052
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:34,932
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:34,932 --> 00:00:40,404
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,810
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,459
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:55,518
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:55,518 --> 00:01:03,914
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:09,440
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:12,278
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:14,391
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:17,644
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:23,270
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,958
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,310
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:35,647
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:39,421

19
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:42,440

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,720
Finish your food.

21
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,990
I'll walk you home afterward.

22
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,660
I don't want to go back.

23
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,240
Can you let me stay here for one night?

24
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,680
In your dreams.

25
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,453
You are going back no matter what.

26
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,185
Petty!

27
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,215
Great. You are all grown up now.

28
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:23,295
You've learned to run away from home.

29
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,155
Auntie,

30
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,295
I saw Ding Xian downstairs, so I took her to have dinner.

31
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:41,105
And now I have brought her back here.

32
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:43,215
Thank you so much, Siyue.

33
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:46,235
That's okay, Auntie. It's my pleasure.

34
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:50,345
Siyue, Xian has been weird lately.

35
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:53,788
I just want to ask you if Xian is close

36
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:57,294
to any of the boys in your school.

37
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,855
She never mentioned that to me.

38
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:05,415
I might be worrying for nothing.

39
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:08,895
Xian has been quite rebellious lately.

40
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:10,551
She has been hiding a lot of things.

41
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:12,961
She left me no choice.

42
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,784
But I actually think Ding Xian does listen to you.

43
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:21,185
That's why, Auntie, you don't have to worry.

44
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:24,377
All right. I shouldn't keep you any longer. Go home.

45
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:26,025
Thank you for walking Xian back.

46
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:27,825
It's my pleasure.

47
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,717
- I will get going now.
 - Okay.

48
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,291
Let me ask you.

49
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,221
What did you do to my little girl this time?

50
00:03:52,221 --> 00:03:54,658
I was worried about her,

51
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:56,961
so I read her diary.

52
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:59,105
I didn't say anything.

53
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,555
You are always defending her.

54
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:01,974
I'm defending her?

55
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:04,475
You are violating her privacy. Do you understand?

56
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:06,525
This is wrong!

57
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:08,481
Go. Go calm her down.

58
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,365
No. I'm not going.

59
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:11,985
I'm mad, too.

60
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,915
You...

61
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:16,415
You are so stubborn.

62
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,765
 It is said that...

63
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:51,655
 when one starts to face losing things

64
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:55,375
 and accepts the cruelty of reality,

65
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,425
 that's when his youth begins to fade.

66
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,480

67
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,845
Sorry, Mr. Liu. I didn't do well in the exam.

68
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:54,295
You shouldn't be apologizing to me.

69
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:57,065
This is your academic performance.

70
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,310
You do know how to answer these questions.

71
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,780
How did you get them wrong?

72
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,390
All right. Go back and think about it yourself.

73
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,310
Switch seats with someone and focus on learning.

74
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,640
Come on! Did you really mess up in the exam?

75
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,530
I was too nervous that I didn't do well.

76
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,500
Let's switch seats, then.

77
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,940
What's going on?

78
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,810
I'm sitting here.

79
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,640
Okay.

80
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,720
It's fine.

81
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,120
Pass them along.

82
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,463
This set of exercises contains classic questions from the past years.

83
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:32,760
Go back and finish it.

84
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,400
We'll be explaining it tomorrow.

85
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,320
Don't try to fool anyone.

86
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,593
Answer one more question and you may get one more point.

87
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,540
You guys watch your safety on your way home.

88
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,873
Let your parents pick you up if they can.

89
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:49,285
And for those whose parents can't come, find someone to go home together with.

90
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,875
Class is over now.

91
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,802
Siyue,

92
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:07,222
have you heard of the Devious Dragon of Shenhai High?

93
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:09,939
My friend's brother was robbed a few days ago.

94
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:11,759
He's even targeting children.

95
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,253
How awful is that?

96
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,640
Don't go. Wait for me.

97
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,718
Aren't you going to chase him?

98
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,795
I don't know what to say to him.

99
00:08:30,795 --> 00:08:34,374
It's okay. Just tell him the truth.

100
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:37,931
I'm worried that he will go talk to Mr. Liu if he knows.

101
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:41,099
Are you going to keep being awkward like this?

102
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,653
That's why you have to help me figure out a good excuse to switch seats.

103
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,453
That's easy.

104
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:55,999
Tell him that you can't see the blackboard clearly.

105
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:59,893
My mom just got me a new pair of glasses.

106
00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:02,626
Then tell him that you don't want to affect his learning process.

107
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:07,300
In terms of that, Song Ziqi has a worse influence.

108
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,860
If none of those work, tell him that you want to sit with Kong Shadi.

109
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,713
He wouldn't believe an excuse like that.

110
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,043
I ran out of solutions.

111
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,433
Hey.

112
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,233
Zhou Siyue.

113
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,870
What?

114
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,893
I'm saying that Zhou Siyue is here.

115
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,343
Didn't he leave earlier?

116
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,040
What a small world!

117
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,585
He can't see me!

118
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:42,805
You've ordered a lot.

119
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:45,963
Don't order any food. Let's just join them. Come on.

120
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,325
Sit down.

121
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,506
I just remembered that I have an art class.

122
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:17,586
I'm going to leave now.

123
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:19,540
Liar! You have no class.

124
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,113
I can't stay here.

125
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:24,093
I'm leaving, see you.

126
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,393
What happened between the two of you?

127
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,480
Nothing.

128
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,923
That's good.

129
00:10:49,923 --> 00:10:51,423
That's great.

130
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,503
Let's eat.

131
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,293
Hey.

132
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,879
Why are you walking so fast?

133
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,523
Didn't our teacher say that we need to head back home as soon as possible after school?

134
00:11:18,523 --> 00:11:22,232
What if we encounter the Devious Dragon?

135
00:11:25,678 --> 00:11:28,380
Don't you have anything to say to me?

136
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,063
Why did you switch seats?

137
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:37,893
 I wasn't at my best this time.

138
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:40,523
 I will do better next time.

139
00:11:40,563 --> 00:11:42,973
 Can I not switch seats?

140
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,553
 Sure.

141
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:47,781
 Ask Zhou Siyue to come and talk to me.

142
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,953
 He has helped you so many times, he can do it again.

143
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:09,473
Never mind.

144
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,963
Let's go home.

145
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:42,745
 Why would a girl distance herself from someone out of blue?

146
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:45,348
 Because you got under her skin.

147
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:47,586
 Who is it?

148
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:51,343
 But I have no clue what I did wrong.

149
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:56,013
 Girls don't need a reason to be mad.

150
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:58,053
 Just look at Kong Shadi.

151
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:00,993
 Who is it?

152
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,322
 So, what should I do?

153
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:07,122
 It's easy to make a girl happy. Send her a gift.

154
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:17,223
Who are they talking about?

155
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:25,803
He hasn't talked to me for a whole day.

156
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:28,353
You didn't talk to him either.

157
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:31,720
I never had the chance.

158
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,150
Hey, hey.

159
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,803
If you don't go talk to him now,

160
00:13:35,803 --> 00:13:38,244
someone else is going to snatch him away.

161
00:13:40,683 --> 00:13:44,313
Yang Chunzi! Why is she so close to Siyue again?

162
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,630
Didn't you hear?

163
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,653
The guy she usually hangs out with has gone abroad.

164
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:50,923
She's trying to get close to Siyue again.

165
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,893
- She's switching her heart all the time.
 - Enough.

166
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,533
Stop speaking up for someone else.

167
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,433
Ding Xian hasn't said anything yet.

168
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:01,623
It seems like things didn't change so much for him after I switched seats.

169
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:04,519
I thought myself too important.

170
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:06,846
That's cynical.

171
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,286
Talk to her.

172
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:10,186
One-track mind.

173
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:19,029
Song Ziqi, why are you drinking my milk tea?

174
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:20,545
Tastes awful. You can have it back.

175
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:22,175
Did I beg you to drink?

176
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,850
Hey.

177
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:29,819
What happened to Ding Xian? Has she lost her soul?

178
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:35,313
Is this necessary?

179
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:38,730
You should stop now.

180
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,593
Can you hear what they are saying?

181
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,940
Check it with your stupid eyes.

182
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,960
What are they talking about?

183
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,855
Three skewers of fish balls. No room for negotiation.

184
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:52,600
You are taking advantage of someone else's misery.

185
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,716
Four skewers. I'm paying.

186
00:14:54,716 --> 00:14:56,416
Deal.

187
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,283
"Have you selected the play yet?"

188
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,657
They want to watch a play together?

189
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:09,451
"I've booked it."

190
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:11,440
I'll send it to you on the computer.

191
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,119
And he said that they were not friends. Liar!

192
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:16,162
All guys are the same.

193
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:21,563
I also feel that Siyue is a little off.

194
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:24,063
We were discussing this in the group of three yesterday.

195
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:28,629
Zhou Siyue, this is what you call not close.

196
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:31,109
Why would you be watching a play together if you are not close?

197
00:15:31,993 --> 00:15:33,731
I'll try harder academically.

198
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:36,069
I will never talk to you again!

199
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,650
Hey.

200
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:54,693
Why are you so mad?

201
00:15:56,272 --> 00:16:01,720
I heard that Riverside Theater has a new play recently.

202
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,969
It's called "Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land," and it's pretty good.

203
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:09,493
Do you like plays?

204
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,993
I just learned about it casually.

205
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:17,044
Don't you like plays?

206
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:20,699
I've never watched a play before.

207
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:25,013
But...

208
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:29,012
it's not impossible to understand.

209
00:16:31,286 --> 00:16:33,086
I knew it.

210
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,649
Want to ask me out?

211
00:16:42,263 --> 00:16:43,680
I'm back.

212
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,088
Xian, there you are.

213
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,520
Come on, get ready. We are going to Siyue's place.

214
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,312
Uncle Zhou and Auntie are back from a business trip.

215
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:53,492
I'm not going. You guys go ahead.

216
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:55,243
You will have nothing to eat if you don't go.

217
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:57,829
I'm not hungry.

218
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:11,556
Mom, you look great with makeup.

219
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:15,513
You are beautiful already, and that makeup really makes your face stand out.

220
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:18,443
Tell me. What do you need?

221
00:17:18,443 --> 00:17:20,843
Um...

222
00:17:21,723 --> 00:17:23,702
Pocket money...

223
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:29,705
Here. Take it.

224
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:34,823
Mom, can I have a little more?

225
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:37,680
Ding Juncong!

226
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,300
How many times have I given you pocket money this month?

227
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,481
Five yuan it is. You are not getting even one more cent.

228
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:50,407
Ding Wencheng, come on!

229
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:51,813
 Coming!

230
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,348
Let's go, Ding Juncong.

231
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:56,349
I know. I'll be there later.

232
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:57,749
Hurry up.

233
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:03,983
Sis, you look great today.

234
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:06,053
I have no money.

235
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:07,313
Mom was right.

236
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:10,193
You should change your habit of spending pocket money without control.

237
00:18:10,193 --> 00:18:13,356
I didn't spend money without control. I'm going to...

238
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:17,911
Never mind. You wouldn't understand anyway.

239
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:22,882
What do I need to understand? You are trying to talk your way out of this.

240
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,022
Oh, right! Why didn't you bring Xian here?

241
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:34,358
Xian didn't do well in the recent monthly test. She's studying at home.

242
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:35,592
We are so worried.

243
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:38,572
It's common to not be at one's best in tests.

244
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:41,102
Everyone will make mistakes.

245
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:43,970
Unlike Siyue, our Xian is not that smart.

246
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,464
It takes time for her to learn.

247
00:18:45,464 --> 00:18:47,704
Look. He's familiar with technology, too.

248
00:18:48,998 --> 00:18:52,102
Besides, Xian has grown stubborn.

249
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:54,132
She insisted on studying science.

250
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:57,631
Her performance dropped,

251
00:18:57,631 --> 00:18:59,635
and she will be lucky if she could get into a basic public university.

252
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:03,024
As for renowned universities, she can forget about it.

253
00:19:04,214 --> 00:19:06,014
Auntie,

254
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:09,495
actually, that's how Ding Xian is.

255
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:12,672
If she's onto something, she will stick through with it.

256
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:17,302
That's why she will get into a renowned school even if it's hard.

257
00:19:17,312 --> 00:19:19,512
Don't worry, Auntie.

258
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:24,362
Xianxian is a child with a bright future.

259
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:25,882
You should relax.

260
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,498
Yes.

261
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,205
Ding Xian.

262
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,121
I have some news.

263
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:38,181
Do you want to hear it?

264
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:40,825
I'm not in the mood for girls' gossip. See you.

265
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:43,605
It's about Zhou Siyue and Yang Chunzi.

266
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:46,612
It doesn't hurt to hear about it.

267
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,017
In junior high, they attended math competitions together.

268
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:55,080
People started to talk gradually,

269
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,467
and Zhou Siyue distanced himself

270
00:19:57,467 --> 00:20:00,045
from Yang Chunzi to avoid rumors.

271
00:20:00,071 --> 00:20:01,607
It doesn't matter.

272
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:04,679
Whatever happens to him and Yang Chunzi,

273
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:08,247
I will focus on learning, so stop mentioning Zhou Siyue.

274
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:10,087
And don't distract me.

275
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,480
Oh, no. This is bad.

276
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,520
Another lost soul.

277
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,600
Siyue, over here.

278
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:33,907
I got it wrong again.

279
00:20:45,922 --> 00:20:48,657
Song Ziqi, do you have an eraser?

280
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:50,646
I forgot to bring it.

281
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,592
Thank you.

282
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:04,992
You are welcome.

283
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,277
Do you guys have plans this weekend?

284
00:21:15,277 --> 00:21:16,392
Yeah, to play.

285
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:18,237
A new game room has opened.

286
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:20,757
It's such a fun place. Let's go check it out together.

287
00:21:21,757 --> 00:21:23,477
What happened to your eyes?

288
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:28,397
Xianxian, how about you?

289
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:29,833
I might stay at home and study.

290
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,953
I don't know if my mom will let me go out.

291
00:21:32,796 --> 00:21:34,164
Siyue, how about you?

292
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:38,640
I'll think about it.

293
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:44,462
- Song Ziqi, come with me.
 - What is it?

294
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:45,462
Now!

295
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:54,640
Kong Shadi, what do you want?

296
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,177
- I can't stand this anymore.
 - I can't stand this either. What did I do to you?

297
00:21:57,177 --> 00:22:00,187
Not you. The two of them.

298
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:08,753
They haven't been right, indeed.

299
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:10,430
They can't keep being like this.

300
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,476
Think about it.

301
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:16,152
If they don't make up, the two of us will keep suffering.

302
00:22:17,297 --> 00:22:19,097
I agree.

303
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:21,157
So, what should we do?

304
00:22:21,157 --> 00:22:22,757
How about this?

305
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:27,079
Let's ask them out this weekend and let them spend some time alone.

306
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,289
I'll deal with Ding Xian and you are handling Siyue.

307
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:32,300
Why? Why can't we switch?

308
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,910
I don't care. If you can't do this right, don't come and see me again.

309
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:39,017
Kong Shadi!

310
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:42,507
We are brothers, and you are selling me out for Ding Xian.

311
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:46,023
Who are you calling a brother? Idiot!

312
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,777
What else could we be?

313
00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:49,697
Think about it yourself.

314
00:22:54,727 --> 00:23:00,167
Kong Shadi, are you having some ideas about me?

315
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:02,944
Don't flatter yourself.

316
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:05,687
Disgusting.

317
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:15,553
Xianxian!

318
00:23:16,773 --> 00:23:18,573
Shadi.

319
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:20,637
What are you doing this weekend? Let's hang out.

320
00:23:20,637 --> 00:23:23,377
This weekend. My mother forbids me to go out.

321
00:23:23,377 --> 00:23:27,417
Come on, we haven't hung out for a long time now!

322
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:32,018
Besides, let me show you.

323
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:36,347
Where did you get the ticket?

324
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:40,176
My dad's office gave him these. He's not going anyway. We should go.

325
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:46,323
Forget it. My mom will never agree to let me go.

326
00:23:46,323 --> 00:23:48,486
Why don't you go with Song Ziqi?

327
00:23:48,486 --> 00:23:50,596
No, I want to go with you.

328
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,616
You figure something out.

329
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:54,889
Come on!

330
00:23:54,889 --> 00:23:57,002
Remember to dress up nicely.

331
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,599
- What are you doing?
 - How did it go?

332
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,627
You have nothing to worry about when I'm on it.

333
00:24:06,627 --> 00:24:09,557
- Are you sure it's done?
 - Of course.

334
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,987
- Why are you here?
 - Is it just the two of you?

335
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:14,987
Where is Siyue?

336
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,004
Is he still mad at me?

337
00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:19,427
Don't flatter yourself.

338
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,217
What are you doing here?

339
00:24:22,217 --> 00:24:25,837
This is an urgent request. I need money.

340
00:24:25,837 --> 00:24:28,893
Did your dad deduct your pocket money again?

341
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:32,667
I'll pay it back to the two of you once I get my red envelope this year.

342
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:33,959
Double it.

343
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,717
Shadi, you are the best.

344
00:24:36,717 --> 00:24:38,589
Here.

345
00:24:43,347 --> 00:24:45,247
I...

346
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:49,767
I...

347
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,017
I don't have much. Don't spend it all at once.

348
00:24:55,017 --> 00:24:58,547
I saw a big bill there.

349
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:00,289
That's not true.

350
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:05,903
Is this a robbery?

351
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:09,497
Who are you? You dare to rob my friend.

352
00:25:09,497 --> 00:25:10,640
I'm not robbing him.

353
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,000
Don't try to talk your way out of this.

354
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,116
You are the Worm of Shenhai High School who likes to rob people around here. Right?

355
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:18,566
It's the Devious Dragon!

356
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:19,987
You are so familiar with that name.

357
00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:21,893
There's no denying it. I'm calling the police now.

358
00:25:21,893 --> 00:25:24,027
Don't! Keke, he's one of us.

359
00:25:24,027 --> 00:25:26,896
Let me introduce you. This is my friend, Jiang Chen.

360
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:28,239
He's the big boss in 18th High School.

361
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,739
Who is she?

362
00:25:30,393 --> 00:25:32,776
The school babe of Shenhai High School, You Keke.

363
00:25:32,776 --> 00:25:35,477
Oh, I've heard about you.

364
00:25:35,477 --> 00:25:38,377
You were hanging out with some boys from our school.

365
00:25:38,377 --> 00:25:39,747
That's nonsense.

366
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:42,416
There's no nice guy in your school.

367
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,777
Isn't the Devious Dragon from your school?

368
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,382
What if that's not true?

369
00:25:46,382 --> 00:25:47,547
That would be impossible.

370
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:48,947
All right.

371
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,707
Let's flush him out.

372
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:55,540
I will let you know that guys from 18th High School have nothing to hide.

373
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,756
- Sure. We'll see.
 - Let's go.

374
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:00,856
As you wish.

375
00:26:00,856 --> 00:26:04,687
Why do I feel we're a little redundant here?

376
00:26:09,757 --> 00:26:12,327
Are you still studying the stupid zodiac signs?

377
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:13,687
Don't say that.

378
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:15,827
This is accurate.

379
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:19,673
Only girls would believe that. It's a sham.

380
00:26:19,673 --> 00:26:22,677
If you don't believe it, I'll do a fortune telling for you.

381
00:26:22,677 --> 00:26:24,613
You will know if it's accurate or not.

382
00:26:24,613 --> 00:26:26,310
Sure. Go ahead.

383
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,590
I'd love to see what you can come up with.

384
00:26:33,347 --> 00:26:34,607
Um...

385
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:36,507
What?

386
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:38,839
What's your zodiac sign?

387
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:44,433
Girl, we've been friends forever, and you are asking me about my zodiac sign now?

388
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:47,157
Why would I care about things like that?

389
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,226
Just give it to me. I'll check it myself.

390
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:53,826
Aquarius, can you remember that?

391
00:26:53,826 --> 00:26:55,447
Aquarius, here.

392
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:59,087
Aquarius should stay inside as much as possible

393
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:04,057
to avoid losing money or injury.

394
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:05,567
That's bullshit!

395
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:07,017
This is bad for you, Song Ziqi.

396
00:27:07,017 --> 00:27:11,297
Losing money, getting injured...

397
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,097
Shut up!

398
00:27:18,757 --> 00:27:20,457
Ding Wencheng.

399
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:21,867
Wake up.

400
00:27:21,867 --> 00:27:23,467
What is it?

401
00:27:24,336 --> 00:27:25,657
Here.

402
00:27:25,657 --> 00:27:26,988
What?

403
00:27:26,988 --> 00:27:28,856
Movie tickets.

404
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:32,320
This is rare.

405
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,278
The last time we ever watched a movie together was more than a decade ago.

406
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,809
How did it come to you to buy movie tickets?

407
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:38,509
It's not for you.

408
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:41,520
Give it to Xianxian and ask her to go with a classmate.

409
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,697
And bring her the clothes while you are at it.

410
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:50,046
Have you thought it through?

411
00:27:50,046 --> 00:27:53,770
You should deal with your own mess and leave me out of it.

412
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:57,020
How could you do this? Why is it so hard to make you do things?

413
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,057
Look. You are the one who should do this.

414
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:03,500
If I gave these to Xianxian, should I say they are from you or me?

415
00:28:05,077 --> 00:28:06,977
I'll do it myself.

416
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:20,017
Mom.

417
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,750
What's up?

418
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:25,362
Are you heading out?

419
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:28,306
Shadi asked me to watch a concert with her.

420
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:32,651
I tried to refuse her, but I can't.

421
00:28:33,346 --> 00:28:34,897
Um...

422
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:38,572
Mom, can I go?

423
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:40,276
Yes. Go.

424
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:42,176
Thanks, Mom.

425
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:46,673
Is that what you are wearing to the concert?

426
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:49,103
I haven't decided yet.

427
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:51,857
Um...

428
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,467
I got you an outfit.

429
00:28:57,663 --> 00:28:59,163
Take it.

430
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:01,846
Mom.

431
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:06,246
Did I do something wrong?

432
00:29:06,276 --> 00:29:07,540
Silly girl!

433
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,353
Can't I do something nice for you?

434
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:10,953
Take it!

435
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:25,157
500!

436
00:29:27,537 --> 00:29:28,867
300!

437
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,437
Mom, they are too expensive.

438
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,155
You should return them.

439
00:29:32,155 --> 00:29:34,622
Just wear it.

440
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,296
Have fun, and don't come back too late.

441
00:29:39,296 --> 00:29:41,666
Remember to answer my call.

442
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:46,217
Thanks, Mom.

443
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,083
You scared me!

444
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,583
What is it?

445
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:16,757
Is this what you are wearing?

446
00:30:16,757 --> 00:30:19,294
What's wrong with what I'm wearing? The point is not to be spotted.

447
00:30:19,294 --> 00:30:21,294
Understood?

448
00:30:21,294 --> 00:30:23,256
Doesn't this look nice?

449
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,637
Hello, Shadi. Where are you?

450
00:30:31,637 --> 00:30:33,357
I'm on my way. I'll be there in a minute.

451
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:35,367
I have to go, see you.

452
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:39,663
She's in a hurry to hang up.

453
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:41,177
Why isn't Zhou Siyue here?

454
00:30:41,177 --> 00:30:42,777
I don't know. I told him.

455
00:30:42,777 --> 00:30:45,067
Zhou Siyue!

456
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:56,017
What are you doing?

457
00:30:56,017 --> 00:30:59,137
I... If I don't do this, he might spot me.

458
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:17,377
What are you doing here?

459
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:21,053
I'm here for the concert.

460
00:31:29,946 --> 00:31:32,236
They are going inside.

461
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:34,947
How did you get Zhou Siyue here?

462
00:31:34,947 --> 00:31:38,360
It's easy. I just said that Ding Xian was coming, and there he is.

463
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,160
Am I good or what?

464
00:31:40,777 --> 00:31:42,958
Okay. It's done.

465
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,658
Let's go!

466
00:31:44,658 --> 00:31:46,727
Why are we going?

467
00:31:46,727 --> 00:31:49,807
My dad got me four tickets.

468
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:53,887
Thanks to your dad.

469
00:31:53,887 --> 00:31:55,627
That's okay.

470
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:57,473
Let's go.

471
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,980

472
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:18,427
 You are pushing me.

473
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:20,772
What happened?

474
00:32:21,313 --> 00:32:23,924
Nothing. I twisted my ankle.

475
00:32:24,657 --> 00:32:26,947
Let's go sit down.

476
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,357
Let me see.

477
00:32:33,357 --> 00:32:34,757
Is this the one hurting?

478
00:32:34,757 --> 00:32:38,467
It's okay. I'll be fine after a little rest.

479
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:54,170
I realized that...

480
00:32:55,086 --> 00:32:58,067
you don't like to ask for help.

481
00:33:01,777 --> 00:33:05,277
I've always been like this.

482
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:10,610
I don't know how to say no to people, and I feel bad about troubling people.

483
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:14,173
Many times, I worry too much,

484
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:19,993
and I can’t say anything every time the words come to my lips.

485
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:26,807
You don't have to worry.

486
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:33,347
Aren't we friends?

487
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:42,047
Friends should help each other and share each other's burdens.

488
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:46,613
But I'm always troubling you.

489
00:33:46,613 --> 00:33:52,167
No one in the world can do everything perfectly.

490
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:55,137
Besides, I have never thought of you as trouble.

491
00:34:04,247 --> 00:34:09,867
Can you tell me what's going on with you now?

492
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:17,267
Actually, Mr. Liu talked to me a while ago

493
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:20,747
and said that someone told him that we were too close.

494
00:34:20,747 --> 00:34:22,507
He asked me to switch seats.

495
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:26,047
And I promised him that I would improve my performance in the monthly test

496
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:28,087
in exchange for not switching seats.

497
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:33,833
But... I didn't do well.

498
00:34:34,377 --> 00:34:37,337
And you are making up excuses...

499
00:34:38,657 --> 00:34:41,677
for something so trivial?

500
00:34:41,677 --> 00:34:43,267
No, I'm not.

501
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:48,786
Mr. Liu said you were always helping me when I was in trouble.

502
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:53,707
I didn't want to get you involved in my mess again.

503
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,087
I'm glad that you are not mad at me.

504
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,386
What? Mad at you?

505
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:01,486
Nothing.

506
00:35:01,486 --> 00:35:05,953
Anyway, you just need to focus on the target

507
00:35:05,953 --> 00:35:08,420
and leave everything else to me.

508
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:12,647
Starting tomorrow, I will be tutoring you alone.

509
00:35:12,647 --> 00:35:15,127
I'll see if you can have a bad performance again.

510
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:32,733
What are you doing?

511
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:35,007
Look at my disguise.

512
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,997
It's genius!

513
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:42,267
I really have a problem.

514
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:45,317
Instead of having fun on a weekend, I'm waiting for the blackmailer here with you.

515
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:48,033
And the weather is so cold. I'm leaving now.

516
00:35:48,033 --> 00:35:49,933
Go ahead.

517
00:35:51,256 --> 00:35:53,556
You won't even try to keep me here?

518
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:57,417
I think you were right. You should go.

519
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:59,260
I'll wait here.

520
00:36:00,857 --> 00:36:02,867
Did no one ask you out?

521
00:36:02,867 --> 00:36:04,717
Who would dare to ask me out?

522
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:08,180
Right, who would dare?

523
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:10,700
You are so smart.

524
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,267
We wouldn't even have gotteb a cab if it weren't for you.

525
00:36:13,267 --> 00:36:14,420
Of course.

526
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,267
I checked the fortune of today before I came out.

527
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:21,217
It advised us to take a walk today.

528
00:36:21,217 --> 00:36:23,706
We might have an adventure.

529
00:36:23,706 --> 00:36:25,177
That's a coincidence.

530
00:36:25,177 --> 00:36:27,067
It also says that I will be injured.

531
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:30,287
It's almost the end of the week and nothing happened to me.

532
00:36:31,037 --> 00:36:33,447
We've been waiting forever and no one turned out.

533
00:36:33,447 --> 00:36:35,477
Is your bro reliable?

534
00:36:35,477 --> 00:36:37,507
Or we...

535
00:36:38,153 --> 00:36:39,923
What are you doing?

536
00:36:40,507 --> 00:36:42,607
Someone is coming.

537
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,436
Has the temperature dropped at night? It's so cold.

538
00:36:52,436 --> 00:36:55,037
He's coming!

539
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:57,980
Why don't you get warm in my arms?

540
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,997
What are you doing? That sounds disgusting.

541
00:37:00,997 --> 00:37:02,540
- Where are you going?
 - To use the bathroom.

542
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,460
Don't follow me, you pervert.

543
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,677
That bastard! And he's a horny dragon.

544
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:11,239
Wait here. I'll go check him out.

545
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:13,539
Call the police if things are not right.

546
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,367
Pervert? Am I a pervert?

547
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:23,537
I think this coat is quite handsome.

548
00:37:23,537 --> 00:37:25,777
Devious Dragon of Shenhai High!

549
00:37:30,027 --> 00:37:32,247
Are you sure you don't want me to carry you?

550
00:37:33,547 --> 00:37:35,899
My ankle is better now.

551
00:37:37,577 --> 00:37:40,817
 Devious Dragon of Shenhai High! Let me see how devious you are.

552
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:44,827
That sounds familiar.

553
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:47,807
I think it's Jiang Chen.

554
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,936
Wait here. I'll go check it out.

555
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,747
There you are. It's the Devious Dragon of Shenhai High.

556
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:03,647
I'll beat him up.

557
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,460
- Don't.
 - You are the Devious Dragon of Shenhai High, right?

558
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,960
- What are you doing?
 - That's the Devious Dragon of Shenhai High, hit him!

559
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,980
The Devious Dragon of Shenhai High?

560
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,517
Beat the daylight out of him! Come on!

561
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:25,087
- Devious Dragon of Shenhai High!
 - Hit him!

562
00:38:25,087 --> 00:38:26,587
Kong Shadi.

563
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:28,787
He knows my name, too!

564
00:38:28,787 --> 00:38:29,947
Hit him!

565
00:38:29,947 --> 00:38:31,677
Kong Shadi!

566
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:33,197
How stupid are you? It's me.

567
00:38:33,197 --> 00:38:34,800
Kong Shadi.

568
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,517
No. Hold a second.

569
00:38:37,517 --> 00:38:39,849
Why does he sound so familiar?

570
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:41,949
Who is it?

571
00:38:50,307 --> 00:38:55,512
I did get injured today.

572
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,047
What happened today was all Jiang Chen's fault.

573
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:15,417
He said something about the Devious Dragon of Shenhai High when I arrived.

574
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:16,823
Apologize!

575
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:17,733
How about some food?

576
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:19,733
Stay away from me!

577
00:39:23,053 --> 00:39:25,263
Stay away from me!

578
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:27,426
You are being stingy right now.

579
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,710
Why don't I beat you up and see how you feel?

580
00:39:32,507 --> 00:39:34,393
All right! Fine!

581
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:40,219
I admit that what happened today was because of both of us.

582
00:39:41,363 --> 00:39:43,445
Okay. Cry it out.

583
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:45,265
You'll feel better afterward.

584
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,100
This is for you. It works well.

585
00:40:00,337 --> 00:40:04,837
Ding Xian, forget about the two of them.

586
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:07,717
Even you have become worse now.

587
00:40:07,717 --> 00:40:10,127
I got hurt, too.

588
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:12,706
Can you compare yourself with me?

589
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:16,249
I'm hurt both mentally and physically.

590
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:19,249
But I'm not crying.

591
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:25,337
You should know when to take a win.

592
00:40:25,337 --> 00:40:26,937
It hurt!

593
00:40:26,937 --> 00:40:28,967
Shut up!

594
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:34,883
Let me go! I don't have any money.

595
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:37,897
That sounds like my brother!

596
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:39,697
Let me go!

597
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:40,872
It is him!

598
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,972
Wait here.

599
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,390
Hurry up!

600
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,810
Pay up!

601
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,667
Are you the Devious Dragon of Shenhai High?

602
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,747
Who is it?

603
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,819
It's a misunderstanding.

604
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:58,097
A misunderstanding?

605
00:40:58,097 --> 00:41:00,493
You... Look at my face!

606
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:02,733
It's because of you!

607
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:09,467
Should you be crying?

608
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,640
Why didn't you say that you were being blackmailed?

609
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,200
Are you stupid or what?

610
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,617
I wanted to tell you,

611
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:21,337
but you were so mean that day.

612
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,040
That's because you are always ridiculous.

613
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,707
You spend your money without control and you like to talk back.

614
00:41:26,707 --> 00:41:27,973
That's why...

615
00:41:27,973 --> 00:41:31,033
That's why it doesn't matter if I said anything or not.

616
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:37,137
Your brother and you are alike.

617
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:40,617
Little brother.

618
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:43,407
I know you are on my sister's side.

619
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:47,217
Aren't you on her side?

620
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:49,293
Not at all. She hates me so much.

621
00:41:49,293 --> 00:41:51,613
She's always mean to me.

622
00:41:51,613 --> 00:41:53,467
How could she be so mean?

623
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:55,167
Right?

624
00:41:55,717 --> 00:41:57,217
See?

625
00:41:57,217 --> 00:42:00,787
Your sis twisted her ankle and she went to look for you.

626
00:42:00,787 --> 00:42:03,237
After she found you, she was so aggressive.

627
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:04,850
Fortunately, I stopped her.

628
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,954
How could she be so mean?

629
00:42:06,954 --> 00:42:09,667
You don't know my sister at all.

630
00:42:10,547 --> 00:42:13,507
We are almost home. Hurry up.

631
00:42:13,507 --> 00:42:15,897
You can go up now.

632
00:42:15,897 --> 00:42:18,097
I'm going to leave now.

633
00:42:18,097 --> 00:42:20,467
You guys talk.

634
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:29,605
Your brother...

635
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:33,167
is quite nice.

636
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,800
So, I... I'm going back, too.

637
00:42:40,493 --> 00:42:42,193
Just a second.

638
00:43:01,857 --> 00:43:04,147
What is this?

639
00:43:04,147 --> 00:43:05,880
A gift for you.

640
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,920
Painting tools.

641
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,820
Painting tools.

642
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,820
Painting tools?

643
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,847
No need to thank me.

644
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:20,000
So, is this why you were talking to Yang Chunzi last time?

645
00:43:21,587 --> 00:43:23,787
She has a family residing overseas.

646
00:43:23,787 --> 00:43:26,267
That's why I asked her to order this for me.

647
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:32,747
What is it?

648
00:43:32,747 --> 00:43:37,056
I think I've misunderstood you.

649
00:43:37,056 --> 00:43:40,956
Misunderstood? What is that about?

650
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:47,009
You are keeping silent again!

651
00:43:52,337 --> 00:43:54,037
Okay.

652
00:43:54,547 --> 00:43:56,347
I'm going home.

653
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,077
Thank you.

654
00:44:03,172 --> 00:44:05,465

655
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:25,410

656
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:33,228
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

657
00:44:33,228 --> 00:44:36,840
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

658
00:44:38,437 --> 00:44:42,723
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

659
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:47,980
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

660
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:53,830
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

661
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:58,368
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

662
00:44:58,368 --> 00:45:04,103
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

663
00:45:04,103 --> 00:45:08,480
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

664
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,350
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

665
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,043
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

666
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:19,040
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

667
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,913
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

668
00:45:21,913 --> 00:45:24,390
♫  After a long journey  ♫

669
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:29,480
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

670
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,146
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

671
00:45:53,146 --> 00:45:55,820
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

672
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:00,963
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

673
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:03,640
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

674
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,180
♫  After a long journey  ♫

675
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,700
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
