â™«  For whom will the summer slow down  â™«

3
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:23,044
â™«  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  â™«

00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:26,908
â™«  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  â™«

â™«  For whom will the movie change its story  â™«

â™«  A sudden storm, blurred vision  â™«

â™«  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  â™«

â™«  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  â™«

17

â™«  All comes down to a simple thank you  â™«

18
00:01:28,147 --> 00:01:31,866
   

19
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:34,345
   

20
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:43,300
Su, Xian's original comics IP is very good.

21
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,779
There's no problem for us to expand it to 200 chapters.

22
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:50,279
We can even adapt it for animation or a game.

23
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:53,900
Something like that can definitely make a hit.

24
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,819
Director Zhang, sorry, but I can't sign the contract.

25
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,060
Director Zhang, Xian has never signed a contract before.

26
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,419
She needs some time to think about it.

27
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,259
Miss, since you've agreed to work with us,

28
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:14,060
how could you change your mind?

29
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:17,919
I'm really, really sorry.

30
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,400
The artists whom I signed for my comics app are all professional cartoonists popular on Weibo.

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,899
If you refuse to work with me because of your own reasons,

32
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:28,199
what will people think of you when word gets out?

33
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,999
Director Zhang...

34
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,080
Miss, you should know what the right thing to do is.

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,260
Please sign it.

36
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,879
The right thing to do? What does that even mean?

37
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:55,040
"Party A and party B shall collaborate upon mutual consent."

38
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,900
No one should be forced to sign anything.

39
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,339
Zhou Siyue, we are talking about Ding Xian's job opportunity...

40
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:07,500
And I'm doing this for Director Zhang's own good.

41
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,439
If you sign a contract hastily before reaching an agreement,

42
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:13,559
aren't you afraid that people will question

43
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:17,579
your decision-making ability when something goes wrong with the project?

44
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,019
As for this IP, its greatest value lies in Ding Xian herself.

45
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,699
She always stays true to herself.

46
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,739
So, from the business point of view,

47
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,500
Ding Xian is not the best commodity for you, Director Zhang.

48
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,900
Here, change your shoes.

49
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,060
How come you brought me a pair of shoes?

50
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,039
I bought them on my way over here.

51
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:53,286
It's okay. You are wearing such a lovely dress.

52
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:55,379
Let me do it.

53
00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:07,085
How did you know my feet hurt?

54
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,179
Because mine hurt as well.

55
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,019
Do they fit?

56
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,760
Xianxian.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,259
Xiansian, I don't understand.

58
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:35,720
Don't you want to be looked up to and live a better life to become...

59
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,420
Senior Brother,

60
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:41,440
I just want to be who I want to be.

61
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,740
I thought we were the same kind.

62
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,679
We used to be.

63
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,380
Su.

64
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,799
Director Zhang,

65
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:29,300
I'm sorry about today...

66
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,499
Don't worry about it.

67
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:34,139
I offered her the opportunity mostly on account of you.

68
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,659
Why are you helping her this much?

69
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:40,780
If I'm right, you like her, don't you?

70
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,779
Director Zhang, let me walk you to the car.

71
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:54,299
Su, girls like her tend to target capable and rich guys like you.

72
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,420
Director Zhang, with all due respect, I don't agree with you.

73
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,585
I'm afraid I'll have to withdraw from the project this time.

74
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,679
I think I dreamed of a scene like this before.

75
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:21,744
You dreamed of me?

76
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:23,444
Yeah.

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,599
Yes. You were holding my hands like this in my dream.

78
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:32,492
Back then, I thought I'd never have a chance to be with you,

79
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,992
so I had a lot of dreams about you.

80
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:39,172
I'm sorry, Ding Xian.

81
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,819
I promise you I won't let you be wronged again.

82
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:53,300
How are you going to explain this to Xing Lufei?

83
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,720
How's this her concern?

84
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,019
She likes you.

85
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,979
How's that my concern?

86
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:04,420
- Then she and I... 
 - How's that your concern?

87
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,706
Zhou Siyue, you are avoiding my questions.

88
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:17,139
I didn't expect you'd feel insecure because of somebody like Xing Lufei.

89
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,639
Well, I didn't expect

90
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,919
you'd feel insecure because of somebody like Su Bocong.

91
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,299
I didn't feel insecure.

92
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:28,820
No way.

93
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:37,420
But somebody got so jealous even when I talked a few more words with Su Bocong.

94
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,720
Ding Xian, I've always thought...

95
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:52,340
I knew what I wanted.

96
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,870
But later on, I realized. If there is no you in my world,

97
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,840
then it's all meaningless.

98
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,559
We have a long way to go. Let's go together. Okay?

99
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,260
Zhou Siyue,

100
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,240
for all these years,

101
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:25,599
my feelings for you have never changed.

102
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,779
If I say yes, promise me that you will never give up on us.

103
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,760
I promise.

104
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,280
We'll be together forever and ever.

105
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,310
â™«  In the sleepless winter night, a season to say goodbye  â™«

106
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,530
â™«  I try my best to be brave  â™«

107
00:08:54,530 --> 00:09:01,180
â™«  We will keep on going like this  â™«

108
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,190
â™« The secret of the answer, an insoluble question â™«

109
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:13,700
â™«  All comes down to a simple thank you  â™«

110
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,540
 This is correct. And... 

111
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,640
 - there are 16 rooms altogether, right? 
 - That's right. 

112
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,860
 And then... 

113
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,680
Zhou Siyue.

114
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,039
Brother Siyue, here, after the awards ceremony,

115
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:31,139
Mr. Chen of Hongguang Tech left you his card and asked you to call him.

116
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,980
By the way, did your idea work?

117
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,340
 I've thought it over. 

118
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,479
My purpose in life is to eat.

119
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:43,619
If I don't make a lot of money,

120
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:46,340
why do I have to work my socks off?

121
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,780
Morning.

122
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,380
Morning.

123
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,372
I can carry it myself.

124
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:57,172
Get on the bus.

125
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,800
Senior.

126
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,740
Okay, I got it.

127
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,299
Sit.

128
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,719
- Maybe I should move to the other side. 
 - Sit tight.

129
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,540
Ding Xian, have you finished the news release of the Comic-Con?

130
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,559
It must be published in the public account today.

131
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,985
When did you tell me to do that?

132
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,735
It was decided at the meeting last night. You were absent.

133
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,899
Okay, I'm on it.

134
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:03,959
We should also write the competition report.

135
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,825
Dong Zhengfei...

136
00:11:06,472 --> 00:11:10,440
He wants to be the team leader, yet he doesn't do anything. Shame on him.

137
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,859
Yuan Fang, I'll do it. It's okay.

138
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:16,666
You can rest.

139
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,925
Thank you, Siyue.

140
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:21,626
Could you help me get my bag?

141
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,100
Thanks.

142
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,307
Music?

143
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,400
â™«  Can I spend the night?  â™«

144
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,450
â™«  Write a song for this time  â™«

145
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,430
â™«  It's been a long day, haven't talked  â™«

146
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,760
â™«  Would you believe it? I could feel you there  â™«

147
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,339
I'm finished. You?

148
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:24,799
Not yet. You can take a nap.

149
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,440
Okay.

150
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,500
â™«  It's been a long day since you're gone  â™«

151
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,870
â™«  Would you hear me... Would you hear me now?  â™«

152
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:43,650
â™«  I'm not the one who doesn't want to fall in love that we could have  â™«

153
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:52,510
â™«  I'm just the one who doesn't want to give you nothing but this glime  â™«

154
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:59,450
â™«  You got to stay in the light, all right 
 I'm going to be another side  â™«

155
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:06,520
â™«  It has been a long day, a long day, 
 I haven't found you  â™«

156
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:15,510
â™«  You got to stay in the light, all right 
 I'm going to be another side  â™«

157
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:21,990
â™«  It has been a long day, a long day, 
 I haven't heard from you  â™«

158
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,490
â™«  And I've been waiting too  â™«

159
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:48,640
I didn't know Zhou Siyue could be this gentle and considerate.

160
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,440
I didn't know either.

161
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:15,399
Let's go, Brother Siyue.

162
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,880
How clueless you are!

163
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,100
Wake up.

164
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,899
We've arrived?

165
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,120
Hello? Ms. Sun.

166
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,800
Ding Xian, the latest chapters of The Shadow have gained a great response.

167
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:56,979
After discussing it, we've decided to update every three days.

168
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,919
If it's okay, could you send me a new chapter tonight?

169
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,472
Tonight?

170
00:15:02,472 --> 00:15:04,386
 Yes, tonight. 

171
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,686
I see.

172
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:13,051
I need to finish a new chapter by tonight. I have to go now.

173
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:22,833
Zhou Siyue, would you like to have dinner with me?

174
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:26,185
- If you don't want to, I know a place... 
 - Could you stay away from me?

175
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:28,385
- I'm leaving. 
 - Bye.

176
00:15:30,332 --> 00:15:32,853
Do you really hate me that much?

177
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,466
I've been chasing you for a long time.

178
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,699
Everybody can see that.

179
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:40,890
How is she better than me?

180
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,860
She's better than you in everything.

181
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,459
Are you kidding me?

182
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,180
You locked Ding Xian in the dressing room that day, didn't you?

183
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,445
Xing Lufei, let me tell you one last time.

184
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,096
I like Ding Xian only.

185
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,330
   

186
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,600
I've heard about what happened between you and Director Zhang.

187
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,660
Why were you so reckless this time?

188
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,519
I'm sorry, Mr. Ma.

189
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,719
It's my fault. I'll do my best to make up for it.

190
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:47,379
Su, do you know why I chose you to be my partner for a startup?

191
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,439
Because you knew what you wanted even at such a young age.

192
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:58,490
And you were more ambitious and mature than your peers.

193
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:03,839
But now, looks like you are still too inexperienced after all.

194
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,440
Mr. Ma, I heard you.

195
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:14,860
By the way, I have a new project, and I need someone to follow it up.

196
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,820
Since you happen to have time, I'll let you take care of it.

197
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,670
   

198
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Boss... waiting for Xian's reply?

199
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,619
I didn't expect you'd also come to this.

200
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:50,079
What goes around comes around.

201
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,259
Yet you haven't even had a chance to be in a situation like this.

202
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:57,419
I find that sometimes you are so mean.

203
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,619
Professor Ye.

204
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:07,119
Siyue, Mr. Chen of Hongguang Tech came to me yesterday.

205
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,300
He's very interested in your robot, and he wants to work with our team.

206
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,920
Mr. Chen of Hongguang Tech?

207
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,320
Yes.

208
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:16,872
It does ring a bell.

209
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:18,820
I remember now.

210
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,180
He's the one who asked me to give you his name card

211
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,540
after the award ceremony of the robot design competition.

212
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:29,540
What does their company do exactly?

213
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,540
You don't know?

214
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,300
Hongguang Tech is the most authoritative intelligent robot company in China.

215
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,533
Their main products are humanoid robots.

216
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,580
Professor Ye, I don't want to work with them.

217
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,700
Are you out of your mind?

218
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,359
Working with Hongguang is not only profitable,

219
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,700
but also a good opportunity to work with the top teams in China.

220
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,479
How could you give up on something like that?

221
00:18:57,479 --> 00:19:00,560
It's true that Hongguang Tech is good,

222
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,540
and it can be considered the best option for us at the moment.

223
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,180
But why does a high-end technology company

224
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,639
want to work with a team of sophomores?

225
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,700
And our current robot technology is not perfect,

226
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,839
neither does it have a clear direction for application.

227
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,040
It may not be clear now, but it doesn't mean it'll stay unclear forever.

228
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,139
That's why it's suspicious.

229
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:28,979
They could've gone to a team with much better performance and techniques.

230
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:32,820
Or they could've come to us when our techniques have improved.

231
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,719
I suspect that the cooperation is just an excuse

232
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:37,720
since they came to us at this time.

233
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,860
Their real purpose is to buy out our patents.

234
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,179
But a buy-out of patents is not necessarily a bad thing for us. Right?

235
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:49,380
When we aren't even sure about whether we share the same cooperation concept,

236
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,080
selling our patents means we'll have to hand over all the results

237
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,100
of our years long research.

238
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,819
Are you willing to do that?

239
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,680
Professor Ye, I think you should reconsider it.

240
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,199
If Zhou Siyue doesn't want to do it, I can lead my team to work with Hongguang.

241
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:09,479
Let me think about it.

242
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:12,799
Bye, Professor.

243
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,139
I worked the whole evening on the draft. It was great to finally get to enjoy some nice food.

244
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:41,199
Aren't you tired?

245
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:45,479
No. I love drawing,

246
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:47,640
so I don't feel tired.

247
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,959
It's just... I ate too much.

248
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:55,380
Ate too much? Then why are you still buying these many snacks?

249
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,659
We girls have different stomachs for snacks.

250
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,459
What else do you want?

251
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:10,758
I want ice cream.

252
00:21:10,758 --> 00:21:13,140
Isn't that too cold?

253
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,300
Let's buy one. I'll take one bite only.

254
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,200
And the rest?

255
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,160
You finish it.

256
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,360
I don't want it.

257
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,220
Don't be this cruel.

258
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,160
What flavor do you want?

259
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,739
Blueberry.

260
00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:32,400
Blueberry.

261
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,040
So cold.

262
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,900
Just stop eating it.

263
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,979
No. It tastes very good.

264
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:45,959
I don't want to waste it.

265
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,419
Want some?

266
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:51,699
No. You enjoy it.

267
00:21:51,699 --> 00:21:54,140
Because I bit into it already?

268
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:05,540
So cold.

269
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,540
Tasty, isn't it?

270
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,540
Not bad.

271
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,600
I still have things to do in the lab. You can go back first.

272
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:25,219
Then I'll go to my studio now.

273
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,719
Okay.

274
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:31,887
See you.

275
00:22:47,305 --> 00:22:49,685
Don't come to bother her again.

276
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:53,526
What if I'm here to see you?

277
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,159
 This is a young team from Huaqing. 

278
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:59,360
 They just won the championship in a robot design competition, 

279
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,499
 and they already caught Hongguang's attention. 

280
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:04,399
 I want you to contact and talk to them. 

281
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:07,979
 You want them to join our company? 

282
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:09,719
 Not really. 

283
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:13,512
 I only want to find out what Hongguang has been up to. 

284
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,313
 By the way, I have a document here. 

285
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,112
 It may be helpful to you. 

286
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,419
I am really flattered.

287
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:28,759
But I'm just a student.

288
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,259
I'm not planning on working with any company.

289
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:34,499
Not working with us,

290
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:38,692
but working with Hongguang.

291
00:23:38,692 --> 00:23:42,279
You want me to hack information from Hongguang?

292
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:52,926
People like you would do anything for money, wouldn't you?

293
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,860
I hope you can consider it again.

294
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,080
There's no need for us to continue this conversation.

295
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,179
I will not do anything illegal.

296
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,759
You'll only embarrass yourself if we keep talking.

297
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,499
Maybe you should take a look at this first.

298
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,840
With your health condition,

299
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,780
you should take a walk outside more often, yet you never listen to me.

300
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,000
You'd rather stay inside.

301
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,079
Whenever I take a walk, I start thinking about things.

302
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:40,860
Reading, however, soothes me.

303
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,320
 I will not do anything illegal. 

304
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,680
 You'll only embarrass yourself if we keep talking. 

305
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,259
 Maybe you should take a look at this first. 

306
00:24:56,879 --> 00:25:00,930
 We've found out the guy who set your father up. 

307
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,600
   

308
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,420
Siyue, you are here.

309
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,720
You don't have classes today?

310
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,079
The classes are over.

311
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,579
Let me.

312
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,119
Do you feel better?

313
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,819
Much better.

314
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:38,460
I heard you won a competition again.

315
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,640
Well done.

316
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,299
Because you taught me well.

317
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:45,000
Here, have some water.

318
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,899
I'm sorry, Dad.

319
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,079
What did you do?

320
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:03,020
I'm sorry that I had you worried.

321
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:15,019
You are always a good boy, we know that.

322
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:19,116
It is never a concern for us if you make a mistake.

323
00:26:19,116 --> 00:26:23,580
Just feel free to do whatever you need to do.

324
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,740
You don't have to worry about anything.

325
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:31,500
What if that thing requires me to sacrifice something?

326
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,652
No pain, no gain. Right?

327
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:37,839
If it hadn't been for the accident this time,

328
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:44,140
I wouldn't have realized that we could be such a happy family.

329
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,959
Remember my words.

330
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:50,899
No matter what it is,

331
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:54,520
just go for it as long as you've thought it through.

332
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:02,359
I have no regrets, and I hope you, my son,

333
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:05,160
can live with no regrets as well.

334
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,959
I'm sure you'll get well.

335
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,779
I will.

336
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,500
It's such a simple thing. Couldn't you try harder?

337
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:32,926
 Having money is indeed good. 

338
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:35,520
 You can even buy the truth. 

339
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:42,320
 But I won't change my mind. 

340
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,560
 Just because you won't do it now doesn't mean you won't do it later. 

341
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,419
 She likes you for your honesty and integrity. 

342
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,400
 But one day you'll have to submit to reality. 

343
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:04,540
 At that time, do you think she'll still like you? 

344
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:12,753
 You and I are not the same kind. 

345
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,120
For me?

346
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,400
The shoes are delivered. I'm leaving.

347
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,660
Hey!

348
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,280
What's the rush?

349
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,980
Let me see.

350
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:10,439
How do you like them?

351
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,520
Very nice.

352
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,680
You have a good sense of taste.

353
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,700
Of course.

354
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,279
I'm the one who picked them.

355
00:29:30,806 --> 00:29:33,566
Why did you transfer me so much money?

356
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:37,959
Why not? I can't take advantage of you.

357
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:42,559
Then forget it. I can't take this.

358
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,499
I've earned money lately.

359
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:47,819
I got paid 4,000 yuan for the comics.

360
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,919
I think making money is kind of easy.

361
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,960
How about this? You can stay home in the future,

362
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,606
and I'll make money to support you.

363
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:01,179
Look. It really breaks my heart...

364
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,919
to see you being so busy lately.

365
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,820
Showing off.

366
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,119
A little money like thatmakes you satisfied already.

367
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:10,900
4,000 isn't little.

368
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,380
Besides, I earned the money with my own hands,

369
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,344
and neither did I cheat nor did I compromise with reality.

370
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,980
Let me ask you a question.

371
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,080
If...

372
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,380
If one day you find out that I changed into a person

373
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,940
who has no sense of right and wrong,

374
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,740
what would you do?

375
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,580
Why are you asking that?

376
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,573
Are you unhappy?

377
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,280
I'm fine.

378
00:30:57,859 --> 00:31:02,259
Then... is it because of the competition?

379
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:04,179
No.

380
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,952
Your experiment?

381
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:11,839
I asked you the question first. You have to answer me first.

382
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:15,859
You need to stay true to yourself.

383
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:21,739
I can't even imagine what you'd be like if you became a bad person.

384
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:31,739
Hello?

385
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:35,999
 Ding Xian, something went wrong with the copyright of the novel on which your comics adaption is based. 

386
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:43,139
Mr. Su, the blogger of the comics Little Monster's Diary seems to be in trouble.

387
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,900
Hello? Ms. Sun.

388
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,940
Ms. Sun.

389
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,740
Please sit down.

390
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:35,492
What happened to the copyright of the novel The Shadow?

391
00:32:35,492 --> 00:32:40,380
It was my fault that I didn't explain it clearly to you.

392
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,680
Take a look at Article 39.

393
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,900
After the copyright of The Shadow expires,

394
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,780
the copyright of the comics' adaption of it

395
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,780
shall be owned by the artist and Dream Journey Comics Press.

396
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,800
The ultimate right to interpret is reserved to Dream Journey Comics Press.

397
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,039
So you assigned the copyright to me

398
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,400
because it was already decided to let me bear the risk of infringement.

399
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,879
You may do some research yourself.

400
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:07,840
It is rare today for a comics press to share an adaptation copyright with an artist.

401
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,626
Aren't we doing this for you?

402
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:14,525
But you kept the expiration of the copyright from me.

403
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,180
It's stated clearly in the contract, isn't it?

404
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,479
Dream Journey has made plenty enough from the comics adaption of The Shadow to cover the reparation.

405
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:33,260
I get minimal pay for my work, yet I have to take on half of the reparation.

406
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:38,200
They planned it all along, waiting for me to jump into their trap.

407
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:44,519
It's okay. You are new in this industry. It's inevitable to be fooled.

408
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,519
But you never suspected anything when they asked you to share

409
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,900
the copyright with them?

410
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:57,620
I always believed there were more good people than bad in this world.

411
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,099
Silly girl.

412
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:02,960
Fine. You are the smartest.

413
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:06,879
Here.

414
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,859
Have some coffee, and calm yourself.

415
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:17,980
The latte art you made is so ugly.

416
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:22,779
I'm not a professional.

417
00:34:24,113 --> 00:34:26,413
You do it if you can.

418
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,599
All right. I'll do it.

419
00:34:37,538 --> 00:34:38,640
Go on.

420
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,879
What should I do?

421
00:34:43,986 --> 00:34:46,726
Hold the coffee with your left hand,

422
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:49,445
and the milk with your right hand.

423
00:34:49,445 --> 00:34:52,020
Pour slowly little by little from this angle.

424
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,999
Don't pour too fast.

425
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,710
â™«  Turns out time can be so magical  â™«

426
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,920
- What's up? 
 - I know how to do it now. Let me try it myself.

427
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:19,180
â™«  Wishing time could stop at this moment  â™«

428
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,670
Okay.

429
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:25,350
â™«  Nothing can take away our love  â™«

430
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
â™«  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  â™«

431
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,610
â™«  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  â™«

432
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:32,239
That much sugar?

433
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,840
Coffee is too bitter. I like it sweet.

434
00:35:37,745 --> 00:35:40,045
Give me a sec.

435
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:44,219
Here. Hold on.

436
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:46,990
Take a bite of this, and then drink some coffee.

437
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,510
â™«  I want to go somewhere far away with you  â™«

438
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,090
â™«  Finding each other's sea  â™«

439
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,158
â™«  Let the light of love heal the pain  â™«

440
00:35:55,158 --> 00:35:56,758
How do you like it?

441
00:35:58,038 --> 00:35:59,999
Very tasty.

442
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:01,538
Wait.

443
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:08,819
A stamp on you.

444
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:27,020
Happy now?

445
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:32,619
Thank you for cheering me up.

446
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,958
What are you going to do next?

447
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:40,920
I want to talk to the author of the novel.

448
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,210
It's better to settle this issue in private.

449
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,959
But there's another important thing.

450
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,980
Don't forget that you are also a victim.

451
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:53,180
So, when you talk to the author,

452
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:58,160
you'd better find some evidence that can prove that the comic press lied to you.

453
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,379
Do you have the contract you signed or chatting records?

454
00:37:01,379 --> 00:37:03,259
Let me take a look at them.

455
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,339
I can take care of this thing myself.

456
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,800
I know you are worried about me,

457
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,779
but I need to learn to solve problems by myself.

458
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,100
Okay. What if you can't find any evidence?

459
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,199
Then I'll have to pay the compensation.

460
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,920
How much?

461
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,119
500,000 yuan.  ($73,000) 

462
00:37:30,406 --> 00:37:33,320
Don't worry. It won't get to that point.

463
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:38,639
If worse comes to worst, I can work here with you.

464
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,610
   

465
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:06,939
Professor Ye, I want to meet with Mr. Chen of Hongguang.

466
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,840
 - Sorry to keep you waiting. 
 - Give me. 

467
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,679
 - It's okay. 
 - So sorry. 

468
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:14,279
 Never mind. 

469
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,999
I saw your performance during the competition.

470
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:26,079
But you rejected my invitation, didn't you?

471
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:29,079
Yes.

472
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:35,379
I turned you down because I thought we had different ideas about cooperation.

473
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:40,579
So, why do you want to meet with me now?

474
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:42,758
Because I need money.

475
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,940
You are quite straightforward.

476
00:38:52,740 --> 00:39:00,199
Honesty, I just wanted to buy out your robot patent.

477
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:03,499
But now, I've changed my mind.

478
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:11,100
I want your patent and a two-year labor contract with you after your graduation.

479
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,379
Name a price.

480
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:22,460
500,000 yuan.

481
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,060
Siyue.

482
00:39:28,225 --> 00:39:32,966
If it's okay, I want the money now.

483
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:36,513
Young man, don't get so greedy.

484
00:39:36,513 --> 00:39:40,266
It's at least necessary to wait
until the contract is signed, isn't it?

485
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,500
Sure. Then I'll wait for your call.

486
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,826
Hello?

487
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:03,772
 Hello? Ding Xian. 

488
00:40:03,772 --> 00:40:05,800
 I've received the 500,000 yuan from you. 

489
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,520
 Later, I'll clarify the plagiarism incident for you on Weibo. 

490
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,539
 Don't worry. 

491
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:14,579
But I didn't transfer any money to you.

492
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,180
 A gentleman called me yesterday 

493
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,660
 and said he'd help you pay the money. 

494
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,059
 You didn't know? 

495
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:24,179
May I ask the name of that gentleman?

496
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,819
I finally found you.

497
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:04,279
Xianxian, what are you doing here?

498
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:08,899
Thank you for paying the money for me.

499
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,500
I'll pay it back to you as soon as possible.

500
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:19,100
This is the least I can do for you.

501
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,879
Are you okay?

502
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:27,260
Are you all right?

503
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,879
It's okay. I'm fine.

504
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:32,840
Really. You can go back. I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

505
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,800
What can I do for you?

506
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,920
Let me take you back.

507
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,099
Senior Brother, can you walk?

508
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,200
Careful.

509
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,039
Miss, where are you going?

510
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:08,980
Hold on a sec, sir.

511
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,620
Senior Brother. Senior Brother, where do you live?

512
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,699
- Senior Brother. 
 - Jiangnan Avenue.

513
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,460
Jiangnan Avenue.

514
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,460
Okay.

515
00:42:36,092 --> 00:42:38,111
Here we are, Miss.

516
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,719
Senior Brother, wake up. Where exactly?

517
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:48,300
Miss, are you getting off or not?

518
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,900
What should I do?

519
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,719
Senior Brother, we'll... we'll be there soon.

520
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:04,319
You...

521
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:10,619
Senior Brother, you are so heavy.

522
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:18,079
Senior Brother, you are drunk.

523
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:31,539
If I weren't drunk,

524
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,659
I'd never tell you this.

525
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,670
â™«  Can I spend the night?  â™«

526
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:41,930
Ding Xian,

527
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,990
â™«  Write a song for this time  â™«

528
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,570
â™«  It's been a long day, haven't talked  â™«

529
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:50,619
...I like you.

530
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:52,879
But, Senior Brother,

531
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,160
I like someone else.

532
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,230
â™«  I hope your not alone  â™«

533
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:05,010
â™«  It's been a long day since you're gone  â™«

534
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:10,540
â™«  Would you hear me... Would you hear me now?  â™«

535
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:18,540
â™«  I'm not the one who doesn't want to fall in love that we could have  â™«

536
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:25,990
â™«  I'm just the one who doesn't want to give you nothing but this glime  â™«

537
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:29,100
â™«  You got to stay in the light, all right  â™«

538
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,720
I know.

539
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,330
â™«  I'm going to be another side  â™«

540
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:37,000
â™«  It has been a long day, a long day, 
 I haven't found you  â™«

541
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,060
Sorry about that.

542
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,640
â™«  You got to stay in the light, all right  â™«

543
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,100
Go back and get some rest.

544
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,080
â™«  I'm going to be another side  â™«

545
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:55,610
â™«  It has been a long day, a long day, 
 I haven't heard from you  â™«

546
00:44:55,610 --> 00:45:00,190
â™«  And I've been waiting too  â™«

547
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:16,880
Zhou Siyue!

548
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:57,360
   

549
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:04,180
Mr. Su, someone is waiting for you in your office.

550
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:18,519
Zhou Siyue?

551
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,953
There's 500,000 yuan on this card.

552
00:46:32,953 --> 00:46:35,760
The PIN number is Ding Xian's birthday.

553
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:47,179
Please apologize for me to Ding Xian.

554
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,500
What did you do to her?

555
00:46:56,199 --> 00:46:58,379
I'm warning you.

556
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:01,760
Leave her alone.

557
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,000
Do not push me to my limits.
