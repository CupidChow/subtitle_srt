â™«  For whom will the summer slow down  â™«

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,044
â™«  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  â™«

4
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:26,908
â™«  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  â™«

5
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:32,396
â™«  For whom will the movie change its story  â™«

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,802
â™«  A sudden storm, blurred vision  â™«

7
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:40,451
â™«  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  â™«

8
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:47,510
â™«  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  â™«

9
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:54,806
â™«  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  â™«

10
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,536
â™«  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  â™«

11
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,270
â™«  In the sleepless winter night  â™«

12
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,383
â™«  A season to say goodbye  â™«

13
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:09,636
â™«  I try my best to be brave  â™«

00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:15,262
â™«  We will keep on going like this  â™«

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,850
â™«  The secret of the answer  â™«

16
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,202
â™«  An insoluble question  â™«

17
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:27,447
â™«  All comes down to a simple thank you  â™«

18
00:01:27,447 --> 00:01:32,066
   

19
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:34,345
   

20
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,219
I'm back.

21
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:39,620
You are finally back.

22
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,380
Your laptop has been ringing the whole day.

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,500
You'd better take a look.

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,780
Let me see.

25
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,170
   

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,280
What?

27
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,500
I know what to do now.

28
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,312
- Have a taste. 
 - Well.

29
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:13,310
I can't believe you've learned how to cook.

30
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,258
Too bad that I could only have instant noodles in high school.

31
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:18,379
Will you eat or not?

32
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,079
Of course, I'll eat.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,200
Let me try this.

34
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,139
- Like it? 
 - Very nice.

35
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,659
Your cooking is much better.

36
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,379
What happened?

37
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,839
When my dad was in the hospital, I always cooked for him and brought him meals.

38
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,999
How's your father doing?

39
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,459
He's fine, except that he still has a small heart problem.

40
00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:00,140
But it was found early, so the treatment was quite effective.

41
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,532
Good to know.

42
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:04,932
- Go on and eat. 
 - By the way,

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,733
here's the half million back.

44
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,580
Where did you get so much money?

45
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,479
I was going to ask you the same question.

46
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,279
Where did you get the money to pay Senior Brother back?

47
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,553
I sold the patent right of the robot I won the championship with.

48
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:26,753
You did?

49
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:29,792
You worked so hard for it.

50
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,412
What are you going to do then?

51
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,172
What am I going to do?

52
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,724
I can always create a new one.

53
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,419
Now, tell me where you got the money.

54
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,119
I explained everything on Weibo,

55
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:56,079
and many cartoonists who were cheated by Dream Journey contacted me.

56
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,060
And then, we reported against the company jointly.

57
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,739
She's under investigation now.

58
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,685
Good for you.

59
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,805
I have another piece of good news.

60
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:09,170
Okay?

61
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,452
The author of The Shadow likes my comic adaption very much.

62
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,160
He's decided to give me his copyright

63
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,132
and let me continue to adapt his novel.

64
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:18,711
He even signed a profit-sharing contract with me.

65
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:22,038
I can continue to draw my original comics in the future.

66
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:27,721
What do you think if I draw our stories in comic format?

67
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:29,578
Is that okay?

68
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:32,290
- Hmm? 
 - Is that okay?

69
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,412
What is it?

70
00:04:36,412 --> 00:04:39,719
You think I talk too much, right?

71
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:42,878
No, you are very cute.

72
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,384
Why are you laughing?

73
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,292
You still have this?

74
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,560
So,

75
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,940
have you seen it?

76
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,665
Seen what?

77
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,199
The Secret Diary.

78
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,300
You wanted me to see it, didn't you?

79
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,320
20121221.

80
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,559
But I've been curious about something.

81
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:37,070
What?

82
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,940
 Hi, I'm April. 

83
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,220
I'm so tired, April.

84
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,159
What's that?

85
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,312
So, you've found out about it.

86
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:07,926
You once said that you wanted a star that'd shine forever.

87
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,579
When did I say that?

88
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,560
You forgot?

89
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,420
 How I wish I could have a star that'll shine forever. 

90
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,572
 That's some wish you've got there. 

91
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,000
So, ever since then, you've...

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,579
I've what?

93
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,479
How's that possible?

94
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,779
I encouraged you because I was worried that you'd get too tired of repeating a grade.

95
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,293
Looks like my plan worked.

96
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,780
 Siyue, I'm so tired. 

97
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,160
Zhou Siyue,

98
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,960
just tell me since when did you start liking me?

99
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,699
Tell me. I want to know.

100
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,979
It's a secret.

101
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,019
Your phone.

102
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,179
Hello? Mom.

103
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:44,225
 Xianxian, your winter vacation is coming. Right? When will you come back? 

104
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:48,945
I'll be back in a few days.

105
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,700
Dad! Mom! I'm home.

106
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,620
Our girl is back.

107
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,878
Uncle, how are you doing?

108
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:16,819
Hey! Siyue.

109
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:18,819
Good to see you.

110
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,960
You even brought us a gift.

111
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,259
- Wanxian. Wanxian, look. 
 - Siyue.

112
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,160
How are you?

113
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,339
I haven't seen you for more than a year. You lost weight.

114
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,759
You got to eat some more today.

115
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,500
How did you two...

116
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,120
Ding Xian wanted to come back for the Spring Festival and so did I, so we came back together.

117
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,499
Good. That's good to know.

118
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:39,640
Come on in, please.

119
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,059
Is your father getting better?

120
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,419
He's still in Jiangling under medical observation.

121
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:46,580
I see.

122
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,499
Go ahead and wash your hands. Let's have a drink later.

123
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:54,820
You don't have to change your shoes. I'll go get the liquor. I have good liquor here.

124
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,340
Go wash your hands.

125
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,840
- Auntie. 
 - Here, Siyue, have a seat.

126
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,340
- Sit down. 
 - So many dishes.

127
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,780
Don't bother. You are our guest. Sit down.

128
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,280
- Here. 
 - Thanks.

129
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,880
I feel like you are happier to see him than see me.

130
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,400
You bet.

131
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,619
Siyue is such an outstanding kid.

132
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:19,300
He was recommended for admission to Huaqing University.

133
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,740
And he's honest and upright.

134
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,179
Who wouldn't like a boy like him?

135
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:27,280
This is the liquor I collected. Let's have a drink.

136
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,239
- Sit down, guys. 
 - Ding Juncong.

137
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,660
Time to eat.

138
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,940
I'm not hungry. You guys go ahead.

139
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,840
Your sister is back. Don't you want to see her?

140
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,405
You know what? Ding Juncong is going through adolescence, a rebellious phase.

141
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:43,219
- Don't mind him. 
 - You always spoil him.

142
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,159
Siyue, you are Xianxian's senior schoolmate.

143
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,179
Please help us take care of her

144
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:55,900
when you are at school.

145
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,679
Of course, I'll take good care of her.

146
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,019
Also, help us watch her.

147
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:06,080
She's the kind of kid who tends to get lazy without supervision.

148
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,279
I'm not.

149
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,259
You better be.

150
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:14,080
If I find out that you indulge yourself in playing and dating

151
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,379
after working so hard to enter Huaqing,

152
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:19,320
I won't let you off.

153
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,626
Mom, I'm an adult now.

154
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,532
Why can't I date?

155
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:29,919
You can't.

156
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,892
- Dating is such a waste of time. 
 - That's enough. Stop nagging.

157
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:37,000
She's old enough to have a relationship. Don't interfere. Come on.

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,880
No matter how old she is, she's always my daughter.

159
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,660
- I have the right to interfere. 
 - All right, stop.

160
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,880
Now, don't mind them. Let's have a drink.

161
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,779
Here, Siyue. Welcome.

162
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,519
- Welcome to our home. 
 - Thank you, Uncle.

163
00:10:53,805 --> 00:10:58,119
Siyue, don't. You are our guest. Let me do it.

164
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:01,099
It's okay, Auntie. I clean dishes a lot at home.

165
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:02,780
Let me take care of it.

166
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,419
It's fine.

167
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:08,673
Mom, don't worry. Let me do it.

168
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,619
Are you guys sure?

169
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:14,840
No worries, Auntie. Let us do it.

170
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,020
Hey, come here.

171
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,200
Let the kids take care of it.

172
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,020
Let's go.

173
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,980
If you are bored, find something else to do.

174
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,300
Why the smile? Aren't you worried?

175
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:43,019
Why don't we just tell them?

176
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,040
No. What if my mom beats me?

177
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,680
I'll use my body as a shield and let her beat me.

178
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,079
What if she asks us to break up?

179
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,199
Then I'll beg her until she agrees.

180
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,679
What if she doesn't allow me to come home anymore?

181
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,440
Then she won't let me come here either. Right?

182
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,419
Forget about it then.

183
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,540
You'll leave in a couple of days,

184
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,633
and I'll have to face them all by myself.

185
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,579
 Tell me! 

186
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,319
 Who is this "Sweetheart" in your contact list? 

187
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,220
It hurts. You...

188
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,120
Tell me. Who is this "Sweetheart"?

189
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,019
Say it. Who is this "Sweetheart"?

190
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:43,559
Who is this "Sweetheart"?

191
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,259
"Sweetheart"? How about "Dessert"? I'll teach you a lesson.

192
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:49,559
Where's my feather duster?

193
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,779
- Don't, Mom. 
 - Get out of my way.

194
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,960
Help me.

195
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:56,613
I can only wish you good luck.

196
00:12:56,613 --> 00:12:59,113
"Sweetheart."

197
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,260
Brother-in-law, will you help me or not?

198
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,619
What did you call me?

199
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,619
Brother-in-law.

200
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,719
You are such a clever boy.

201
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,519
Hurry. Stop her. Stop her.

202
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,619
- Get out of my way. 
 - Mom.

203
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:16,480
- Siyue, step away. 
 - Auntie, stop it.

204
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,640
- Siyue, step aside. 
 - Please calm down.

205
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,280
Siyue, move away. I must beat him, or he won't learn his lesson.

206
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,939
- Stop it. Don't hurt him. 
 - What are you doing?

207
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:23,879
He deserves to be beaten, Auntie.

208
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,919
But even if you beat him, you still can't get the answer.

209
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,300
Listen up, Ding Juncong.

210
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,540
You are lucky that we've got a guest here. I'll let you off this time.

211
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,140
Let's wait and see.

212
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,679
Auntie, please calm down.

213
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,800
It's the way with adolescent boys.

214
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,180
I can't believe him.

215
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,320
Siyue, could you...

216
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,599
No problem, Auntie. I happen to be free these days.

217
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:05,799
I'll tutor Juncong and help you watch him.

218
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:09,100
Look, how thoughtful Siyue is.

219
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,973
I wonder which girl will have the bliss to marry him.

220
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,479
Who's "Sweetheart"?

221
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:24,800
The one with two braids or the one with the short skirt?

222
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,059
Ding Xian, what are you doing?

223
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:31,260
You brat.

224
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:35,740
Mind your manners.

225
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,860
Do your homework.

226
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,905
I know.

227
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:48,826
Something's wrong with you guys.

228
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:52,146
Just do your homework.

229
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,760
You two were dating in high school, so don't you judge me.

230
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,020
Who said we were dating in high school?

231
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,239
We weren't. She just had a crush on me.

232
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:06,744
Didn't you have a crush on me?

233
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:09,000
You guys are so lame.

234
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,879
It's none of your business.

235
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,919
Mind your own business. Who's that "Sweetheart"?

236
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:18,380
It's not like what you think. You guys are so bad.

237
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,159
I'll tell mom that you are dating.

238
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,959
Sit down. Don't you dare.

239
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,919
If you tell her, you are dead.

240
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,080
You guys are big bullies.

241
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,300
It's only the beginning. Take out your homework. I'll tutor you.

242
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,780
Then I'll leave him to you.

243
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,120
Looking at his homework gives me a headache. Study hard.

244
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:43,258
Let's do it, kid.

245
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:59,359
Brother-in-law, I don't want to do homework.

246
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,919
I... I'm hungry.

247
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,479
I want to eat something nice.

248
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:08,139
What did you call me?

249
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,939
Brother-in-law.

250
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,540
Don't eat too much. Stop.

251
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:19,359
That's enough.

252
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:22,219
Don't worry. Go ahead.

253
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:27,020
You are spoiling him.

254
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,000
He doesn't eat the dishes we cook at home, and he eats snacks only.

255
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,280
What's wrong with that?

256
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,985
You ate a lot of snacks in high school as well.

257
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:40,505
You also want to eat it, right?

258
00:16:40,505 --> 00:16:43,292
Here, try this.

259
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,520
What are you doing?

260
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,839
Don't just focus on eating.

261
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:55,159
You've got to finish your paper.

262
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,780
I'll check it and explain the problems afterward.

263
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:21,251
Where will you stay tonight?

264
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:24,080
Your place.

265
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,380
No. What if my mom finds out?

266
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,919
Why don't you just tell her?

267
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,239
Do your homework.

268
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:35,179
As a kid, you shouldn't listen to the conversations of adults.

269
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,519
Then...

270
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:46,150
you can come to my place.

271
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,833
Your place?

272
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,139
Let's do it.

273
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,720
How long will it take to clean up?

274
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,900
I remember I've got things to do at home. I have to go.

275
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,140
Now that you live in my house, I won't let you leave so easily.

276
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,820
Technically, I don't live here yet.

277
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,760
I'm not.

278
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,680
Siyue!

279
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,760
I brought you a blanket.

280
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,000
Thank you, Auntie.

281
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,260
I remember that your house hasn't been cleaned for a long time.

282
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,119
Make sure to use it when you sleep.

283
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,520
Why is your face so red?

284
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:42,280
It's too hot in here, Mom.

285
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,319
- Don't you feel warm? 
 - Yes, a little.

286
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,940
You wear too much.

287
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,060
Siyue, if it's not comfortable sleeping here,

288
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,499
you can come to my house and bunk up with Juncong.

289
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:57,740
It's okay, Auntie. I'll stay here. Don't bother.

290
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,419
All right. Then come to our place for breakfast tomorrow morning.

291
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:04,300
You like golden cakes, right? I'll cook for you.

292
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,100
Okay.

293
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,219
Aren't you coming?

294
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:10,339
Yes, I am.

295
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:25,520
It's not right.

296
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,280
Something's not right.

297
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,919
Don't you think something's wrong with Xianxian and Siyue?

298
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,591
I think there's something wrong with you.

299
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:52,580
What are you doing? I was watching that.

300
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,119
I've got to find out.

301
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,899
Ding Juncong, come here.

302
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:09,099
You know something, don't you?

303
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,299
I... I don't know.

304
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:18,940
Stop giving him a hard time. Is it necessary to ask so many questions?

305
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,200
Go to bed if you have nothing to do. Don't interfere.

306
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:27,720
Tell me. What do you know?

307
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,739
Ding Juncong, you look down whenever you lie.

308
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:34,439
Tell me.

309
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:38,479
If you want to know, fine. But give me my phone back.

310
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,779
I'm sorry, Brother-in-law.

311
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:52,519
Zhou Siyue is her sweetheart.

312
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,193
I'm going to bed.

313
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:16,859
Xianxian.

314
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,659
Dad.

315
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,039
Don't always be on your phone. It's not good for your eyesight.

316
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:28,500
Are you texting someone?

317
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,660
No, I'm not.

318
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,279
It's so good to be young.

319
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,439
I think so, too.

320
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:41,440
It reminds me of the days when your mom and I were young.

321
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,859
We had so much to talk about.

322
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:47,259
Even a little thing could make us happy for a long time.

323
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:52,200
Me, too. Seeing him makes me happy.

324
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,099
Dad, are you tricking me into telling the truth?

325
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:01,939
I don't have to trick you.

326
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:05,060
This little secret of yours is something I've known for a long time.

327
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,919
You are texting Siyue, aren't you?

328
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,999
I'm 21 years old. I'm allowed to date.

329
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,280
I'm here just to tell you that I watched Siyue grow up,

330
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,400
and I'm glad to see you two being together.

331
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:26,319
Thank you, Dad. You know me the best.

332
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,699
But if your mom does something to you, don't be mad at her.

333
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:37,019
You know that she can be quite controlling.

334
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:39,920
Is she mad at me?

335
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,719
Now, go to sleep.

336
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,480
Go ahead and eat.

337
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,839
Mom, I thought you'd cook golden cakes.

338
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:19,400
Congee is good enough.

339
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,039
I like congee.

340
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,580
Siyue, here.

341
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:42,080
Have some more.

342
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,540
You should put on some weight.

343
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,500
Look how thin you are.

344
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,719
Thank you, Auntie.

345
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,019
Don't look at others.

346
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:53,619
You, too. Have some more.

347
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:58,580
Mom, I'm full.

348
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:04,839
Oh, well, I just remember that I have something to do. I need to go.

349
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:07,200
It's the Spring Festival. What's so urgent?

350
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,000
It's school stuff.

351
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,920
I heard there's a student...

352
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,520
Hello?

353
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,282
Brother-in-law, you are eating.

354
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,019
Mom knows already.

355
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:43,519
So, how long has it been?

356
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,719
Auntie, we started dating last month.

357
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,340
You two lied to me.

358
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,219
Was it fun?

359
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,259
It's my fault, Auntie.

360
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:06,679
I should've taken responsibility earlier.

361
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:08,340
What did you do to my daughter?

362
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,980
What are you talking about?

363
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,419
No, Auntie, don't get me wrong.

364
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:20,560
I... I mean I've let Ding Xian wait for too long.

365
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,999
So, I'll do everything I can to give her the best life in the future.

366
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,379
Mom, please don't be angry.

367
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,000
Angry...

368
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

369
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:48,079
You told me you wouldn't allow me to date, so I dared not to tell you.

370
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,139
But you didn't tell me it was Siyue.

371
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:53,560
Siyue is such a self-motivated kid.

372
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,359
If you are with him and learn from him, of course I'll have your back.

373
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:08,759
Auntie, actually, I should thank Ding Xian.

374
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:15,219
If it hadn't been for her, my life would've still been a mess.

375
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:23,279
Siyue, as long as you and Xianxian are happy.

376
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:26,760
She's my only daughter.

377
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,820
Please take good care of her.

378
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,499
You want golden cakes, right? I've cooked them for you.

379
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:38,999
Hold on.

380
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:53,619
Are you still full?

381
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:57,839
I think I don't need to eat anything in the next three days.

382
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,480
You are leaving again.

383
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,465
When can we spend the Spring Festival together?

384
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:17,220
Professor Ye has a new program, and I need to go back to visit my parents.

385
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,520
I know.

386
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,680
You've got more important things to do.

387
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:36,460
Cheer up.

388
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:48,600
All right, you should go home now.

389
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,060
Or your parents will worry about you.

390
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,879
Let me stay with you for a little longer.

391
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,200
Don't. Or it'll be harder for me to say goodbye to you.

392
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,099
Then, give me a hug.

393
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,339
All right, we'll see each other soon.

394
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:22,620
Hug me for a little longer.

395
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:29,060
Hold me tight.

396
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:38,170
   

397
00:28:55,879 --> 00:29:00,060
 The doctor said your father's condition is a little unstable. 

398
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,440
 Go inside and keep him company. 

399
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,840
I want to go home.

400
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,979
I'll take you home when you are recovered.

401
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:30,038
Okay.

402
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,259
Now that I'm getting old,

403
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,994
I keep thinking about the past.

404
00:29:39,994 --> 00:29:43,119
I remember when you were little,

405
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,420
your art teacher...

406
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,399
asked you to make bookmarks.

407
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:55,559
You didn't want to do it, so you picked up a leaf on your way home.

408
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,380
I remember that.

409
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:07,819
The art teacher praised me for my creativity.

410
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:14,260
But after I got back home, you gave me a good scolding.

411
00:30:15,219 --> 00:30:23,179
Even though I rarely returned home, I left you with unpleasant memories.

412
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,899
Actually, when I was little,

413
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:35,220
I quite envied Song Ziqi.

414
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,159
When he was a kid, no matter what he did,

415
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:48,119
his father always stayed by his side praising and encouraging him.

416
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,420
But when I was little,

417
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:54,979
you were always strict with me.

418
00:30:56,959 --> 00:31:05,580
You taught me to be responsible, excellent, and independent.

419
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,499
I didn't understand back then,

420
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,079
so I felt very stressed,

421
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:18,849
tired, and overwhelmed.

422
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:28,359
But now I understand.

423
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:37,879
I am happy if I am able to help you and mom.

424
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:53,999
You never said things like these to me before.

425
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:59,299
You wouldn't listen before even if I did.

426
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,000
Silly kid.

427
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,719
 - Hey, Shadi.  
 - Hi, Xianxian.

428
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,559
Guess where we are now.

429
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:53,639
 Where are you? 

430
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,460
 Little Monster. 

431
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,400
When did you guys come back?

432
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,280
 We just arrived today. 

433
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,680
 Keke told me they also came back. Come and hang out with us tomorrow. 

434
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,619
Okay.

435
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:04,700
 Kong Shadi, which one do you want? 

436
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,800
 - This one or that one? 
 - I'm hanging up now. 

437
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,400
 See you tomorrow. 

438
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,139
- Recently, what have you been up to? 
 - Enjoy.

439
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:19,759
Thinking of you.

440
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:22,700
Stop the girl talk since we hang out for fun.

441
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,920
Feel free to leave if you don't want to hear it.

442
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,879
Go on. Go on.

443
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,999
I'll pick the songs.

444
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:31,139
Keke.

445
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,399
Jiang Chen?

446
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:34,900
Bro, why didn't you tell us earlier?

447
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,660
I thought you wouldn't come back for the Spring Festival this year.

448
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,460
I wanted to surprise you guys.

449
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,680
Where's Zhou Siyue?

450
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,740
He went back to Jiangling for some business.

451
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,779
Don't mind him. Today is our girls' get-together party.

452
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:47,900
Then, why did you bring your boyfriend here?

453
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,940
Yeah.

454
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,160
He insisted on coming with me.

455
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,540
And what about you?

456
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,680
You brought yours, too.

457
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,079
He's not.

458
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:59,579
It's not safe for me to go back alone at night. He's my bodyguard.

459
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,180
Bodyguard, huh?

460
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,520
What's going on with you? Are you still chasing her?

461
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,780
Don't mention it. We are in the same situation.

462
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,560
Mine is different from yours.

463
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,419
I heard Zhou Siyue has met your parents.

464
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:15,819
You guys have made progress fast.

465
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:22,079
He did meet my parents, but I don't think we are moving forward.

466
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,239
What do you mean?

467
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,600
It feels like we are still in high school.

468
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,239
Nothing has changed.

469
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,700
Where are you now?

470
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,260
We hold hands... and we kissed.

471
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,139
That's it?

472
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,940
I get it.

473
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,500
He still sees you as a kid, doesn't he?

474
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:53,539
Kind of.

475
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,260
Can't you be more confident?

476
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,239
He's treating you like a kid.

477
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:01,600
You guys are nothing like a couple.

478
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:11,099
What took you so long?

479
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,159
I've just finished the things in the lab.

480
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:15,099
You must be tired.

481
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:21,060
 Ding Xian, you need to let him know that you are a girl. 

482
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:26,360
 And you need to act girly once in a while to intrigue his desire to protect you. 

483
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,099
Handsome,

484
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,859
I'm a little cold.

485
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:41,059
What... What's with you?

486
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:42,999
I'm cold.

487
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:48,120
You don't have a fever.

488
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:54,199
I've been waiting for you for a long time. Shouldn't you do something?

489
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:02,538
Wait.

490
00:36:17,586 --> 00:36:19,700
Here, it's still hot.

491
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,180
It'll keep your hands warm.

492
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:26,179
Feel better?

493
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:30,339
Let's grab something to eat after I put away my luggage.

494
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:32,859
Maybe some other time.

495
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:36,040
I have a project that will be due soon.

496
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:39,219
Let me take you to your dorm first.

497
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:42,879
It's okay. I need to buy something first.

498
00:36:44,966 --> 00:36:47,025
Then I'm leaving.

499
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,920
Ding Xian, you are not going to dinner?

500
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,660
No. I'm not hungry.

501
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,560
Where's your boyfriend? You haven't seen him for the entire vacation.

502
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,619
Don't you want to see him?

503
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,579
He stays in the lab all day long.

504
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:13,880
I just met him for a minute, and he went back again.

505
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,779
Is he a workaholic or something?

506
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:18,419
You guys go ahead.

507
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:20,199
Then we'll bring you back some snacks.

508
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:23,020
- Let's go. 
 - See you.

509
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,800
 I've finished my project. I'm downstairs right now. 

510
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:48,859
Study?

511
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:50,740
Are you serious?

512
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:54,779
I heard Professor Wang's courses are quite difficult this semester.

513
00:37:54,779 --> 00:37:57,420
I'll help you prepare for them.

514
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,540
But I haven't had dinner yet.

515
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,020
I brought you something.

516
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,660
Your favorite cake.

517
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,180
I even bought more for your roommates.

518
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,579
But I want to have dinner with you.

519
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:20,939
It's okay. I've had dinner.

520
00:38:20,939 --> 00:38:24,599
Do you know how to solve the problem I explained to you last time?

521
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,679
This one.

522
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,479
Not yet.

523
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,260
Don't worry.

524
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,959
I'll do it first, and you can see if you like my solution.

525
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,819
D C...

526
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:46,959
Professor Wang asked me to read a book, but I can't find it anywhere.

527
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:49,879
- What book? 
 - Could you help me find it?

528
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:53,779
What book?

529
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,319
Where is it?

530
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:01,260
What's the name?

531
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,660
â™«  You make me smile unknowingly  â™«

532
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,120
Is it here?

533
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,960
â™«  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  â™«

534
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,290
Maybe not.

535
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,700
Here?

536
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:22,610
â™«  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  â™«

537
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,900
â™«  Reminding me of the love you gave me  â™«

538
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,030
â™«  I want to go somewhere far away with you  â™«

539
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,510
â™«  Finding each other's sea  â™«

540
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:37,510
â™«  Let the light of love heal the pain  â™«

541
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,390
â™«  Make a wish under the starry sky  â™«

542
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,920
â™«  After a long journey  â™«

543
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,539
Is it this book?

544
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:48,250
   

545
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,219
I'm back.

546
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:05,299
What's in the bag?

547
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:08,420
Zhou Siyue bought it for us.

548
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,039
He's so sweet. Why are you looking so sad?

549
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,799
It feels like nothing has changed.

550
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:19,220
Maybe you know each other too well,

551
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,859
and it doesn't feel exciting anymore over time.

552
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:25,659
Really?

553
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,419
Then what should I do?

554
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:31,720
I think you should do a makeover.

555
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,919
A makeover?

556
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,960
   

557
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,200
Here, look...

558
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,260
Xianxian, I hardly recognized you.

559
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,760
I thought a school belle walked in.

560
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
 That's right. 

561
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,740
Looking for Boss Zhou?

562
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,560
He just left.

563
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,740
Then I'll go find him.

564
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,740
Okay, bye-bye.

565
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,439
Zhou Siyue is so lucky.

566
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,260
That's good.

567
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:16,220
Remember, if you have any questions academically, you can ask me anytime.

568
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:20,940
Also, if there are any problems with your research...

569
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,940
Zhou Siyue!

570
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:26,940
Did you miss me?

571
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,459
Didn't we just meet yesterday?

572
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:32,980
Even so, you may still miss me today.

573
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,500
Then I'm leaving.

574
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,000
Okay.

575
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,500
What's wrong?

576
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Are you upset?

577
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,819
I know why you've been ignoring me these days.

578
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:50,420
I agreed to go out with you too quickly. Right?

579
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:54,940
Look at you. What are you thinking about?

580
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,220
That's our software engineering teacher.

581
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,840
It's an elective course.

582
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,940
An elective course.

583
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:06,399
In order to take her class, Yuan Fang secretly changed my class schedule.

584
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,839
Why would I lie to you?

585
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:15,139
Why did you dress like this today?

586
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,939
Do I look good?

587
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:22,700
You do.

588
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,240
But...

589
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,120
you might get arthritis dressing like this. It's been cold recently.

590
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,940
You'd better wear pants.

591
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,940
Okay?

592
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,900
You sound like my father.

593
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,260
Wait.

594
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:42,020
Did I say anything wrong?

595
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,980
You still treat me like a kid, don't you?

596
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,359
You help me with my study and take care of me as if we were still in high school.

597
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,379
But our relationship has changed.

598
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:00,859
I want to spend time with you every day.

599
00:43:00,859 --> 00:43:05,420
I want you to compliment me for the way I dress, and I want to hear you say you like me

600
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:11,379
I'm sorry.

601
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,500
I'm too stupid.

602
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,099
I misunderstood you every day.

603
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,239
And I ignored your feelings.

604
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:24,220
It won't happen again.

605
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,379
I like you.

606
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:38,457
I like you very much.

607
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,439
So, now you know why I was upset. Right?

608
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,520
I do.

609
00:43:54,222 --> 00:43:57,599
Let's go. You want to eat with me, right?

610
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,520
- Your cake. 
 - Thanks.

611
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,220
You are welcome.

612
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,926
Enjoy.

613
00:44:05,926 --> 00:44:08,986
Wait. Let me take a picture.

614
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,700
Done.

615
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,200
Done?

616
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,300
Here.

617
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,880
Good?

618
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,620
Look.

619
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,400
Here.

620
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,000

626
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:10,700
â™«  All comes down to a simple thank you  â™«

627
00:45:18,493 --> 00:45:20,393
Here we are.

628
00:45:20,393 --> 00:45:23,020
Thank you for bringing me back.

629
00:45:23,879 --> 00:45:25,000
All right.

630
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,200
Go upstairs.

631
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,420
Hug me.

632
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,800
All right.

633
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Go back now.

634
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,000
I'll watch you leave.

635
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,460
I'll watch you going upstairs.

636
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,379
You go first.

637
00:46:04,379 --> 00:46:07,029
Be good. Come on.

638
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:09,279
Then I'm leaving.

639
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:31,379
I can't get in.

640
00:46:32,252 --> 00:46:34,293
The door is locked.

641
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,500
Since you can't go back,

642
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:49,379
you can spend the night here.

643
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:51,980
Okay.

644
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,880
Wear these.

645
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:18,119
Sit down.

646
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:21,124
I'll go get the toiletries for you.

647
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,770
