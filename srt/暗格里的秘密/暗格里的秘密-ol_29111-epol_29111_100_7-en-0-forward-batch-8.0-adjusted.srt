1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:17,940

2
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:26,690
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:30,976
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,856
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:34,856 --> 00:00:40,428
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:44,734
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:48,383
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:55,442
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:55,442 --> 00:01:03,838
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:09,568
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:12,302
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:14,315
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:17,668
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:24,094
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:25,882
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:25,882 --> 00:01:28,434
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:28,434 --> 00:01:36,088
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:36,088 --> 00:01:39,958

19
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,134

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,101
Siyue, care to join me in a game of pool this Sunday?

21
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:58,211
Are you hanging out? I want to go, too.

22
00:01:58,211 --> 00:01:59,710
I'll think about it.

23
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,008
The competition is happening soon.

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,001
Xianxian, why don't you come with us?

25
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:06,300
You guys have fun. I don't know how to play.

26
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,122
Me neither.

27
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:11,821
Anyway, when the time comes, when you see the ball, you poke it.

28
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:13,761
You... I'm not going with you.

29
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:14,791
Oh, my god!

30
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,921
Like I would want to go with you!

31
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:26,384
Join us. I'll show you how.

32
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:29,931
Yes!

33
00:02:30,773 --> 00:02:33,531
Should we ask Jiang Chen to come as well?

34
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:37,471
Don't. None of us is going to have fun if he's there.

35
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:41,021
Just tell me if you can't see clearly.

36
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:57,327
I'll copy the notes for you.

37
00:02:57,327 --> 00:03:00,171
What about your competition paper?

38
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:02,311
I can work on it later.

39
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:14,200
- Come and have dinner.
 - Coming.

40
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,431
Come on, time for dinner.

41
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,060
Here you are.

42
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:31,349
Mom, can I discuss something with you?

43
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:35,381
I want a pair of glasses with a higher prescription.

44
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,653
Is your myopia getting worse?

45
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:38,670
A little.

46
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,561
Xianxian, you were pseudo-myopic before.

47
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:46,561
The glasses are to correct that. Why is your myopia getting worse?

48
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,876
I don't know. Sometimes things can get blurred.

49
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:52,457
Which row are you sitting in right now?

50
00:03:53,573 --> 00:03:58,571
The fifth. Talk to your teacher and move to the row in front.

51
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,615
Try not to wear your glasses.

52
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:07,511
If the prescription keeps increasing, you may have to wear them forever.

53
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:11,707
If you feel awkward talking to your teacher, I can do it.

54
00:04:11,707 --> 00:04:15,597
Never mind. I can hold on for longer.

55
00:04:17,945 --> 00:04:23,081
Your dad said that you were about to choose between liberal arts and science.

56
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:26,171
You could take the chance to switch seats

57
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,901
after you are transferred to a liberal arts class.

58
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,571
But I might choose science.

59
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:40,831
Why would a girl choose science?

60
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,831
Why can't a girl choose science?

61
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:46,041
That's not what I mean.

62
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,241
I'm saying that girls will have a hard time with science subjects.

63
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:53,041
You may feel you are doing well in both now.

64
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,351
Things will get harder in your second and third year of high school.

65
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:58,738
- But...
 - Stop fighting this.

66
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:01,791
I'll make that decision for you. Liberal arts it is.

67
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:06,591
Why? This is my business.

68
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:09,348
Don't I get to choose by myself?

69
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:12,468
You are too young to make that choice.

70
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:15,761
Liberal arts is the safe choice for you.

71
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:20,291
Your dad can tutor you so that you will get into a good university.

72
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,500
We are doing this for your sake.

73
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,427
Would we hurt you or what?

74
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:26,191
And you are fighting with me.

75
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:29,347
Enough. Let's all calm down.

76
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:31,201
This is a really important choice.

77
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:34,321
Let's sit down and talk about it.

78
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:36,221
Xianxian,

79
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,191
be patient when talking to your mother.

80
00:05:44,551 --> 00:05:46,551
I'm done.

81
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,941
That's not the way to bring up a child.

82
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:57,390
And you are good at this?

83
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,441
And you are?

84
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,990
 You are so good at this that she's refusing to have dinner now.

85
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:15,704
 Xianxian, go online.

86
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:18,904
 I've applied to be your contact. Accept my request.

87
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:27,918

88
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,153
 Wow. Welcome, Little Monster.

89
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:39,404

90
00:06:45,451 --> 00:06:48,921
 Put down the cell phone and focus on your homework.

91
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:54,961
Xianxian,

92
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:02,041
didn't you tell your mom the other day that you want a cell phone?

93
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:06,090
Your mom and I talked about it and bought you one.

94
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:10,387
What?

95
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:15,527
Sorry, Dad.

96
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,610
I kept you in the dark.

97
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,761
About what?

98
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,566
Zhou Siyue lent me this.

99
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:39,521
I saw it this morning.

100
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:40,522
How about this?

101
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:44,461
Return that one to Zhou Siyue when you have the chance.

102
00:07:48,197 --> 00:07:52,311
Xianxian, we bought you this cell phone,

103
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:55,101
but there are some conditions.

104
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:58,771
First, you mustn't bring it to school.

105
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:00,891
It will affect your studies.

106
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:03,880
Second,

107
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:09,827
I hope you can consider what your mom just said.

108
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:13,087
She's not wrong.

109
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:18,848
Dad, do you also think

110
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:21,775
that I should choose liberal arts?

111
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,533
Your mom and I are on the same page.

112
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,921
We think that you are a girl.

113
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:30,731
Choosing science will make your life harder.

114
00:08:30,731 --> 00:08:33,087
We don't want to see you having a hard time.

115
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:34,981
What about you, Dad?

116
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,301
Why did you choose politics?

117
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:38,901
I...

118
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:43,361
I wasn't doing well in science back then.

119
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:46,821
Doesn't that mean it is wrong to assume

120
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:51,142
that girls should choose liberal arts and boys should choose science?

121
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:59,667
Besides, I'm not mad at you for not letting me choose science.

122
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:02,991
I'm mad because you won't let me make my own choices.

123
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:13,374
Xianxian, grown-ups might be unreasonable,

124
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:15,764
but that's because we are worried that you might make mistakes

125
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,764
that have consequences that you can't bear.

126
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:24,741
And if you thought it through,

127
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:28,671
I will respect your choice.

128
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:38,641
Thanks, Dad.

129
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:43,251
Oh, another thing. Stop being so stubborn with your mom.

130
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:46,101
Don't be fooled by her words. You know how she is.

131
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:51,741
Besides, I think she might be going through menopause recently.

132
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:57,547
I understand. I will stop being mad at her.

133
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,310
Good girl. Get back to learning.

134
00:10:20,691 --> 00:10:23,021
Hello, Senior Brother.

135
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:26,301
I'd like to ask if you can find me some exercises and materials

136
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:28,891
of second-year science class.

137
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:33,991
This is the topic of the essay in the NCEE this year.

138
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:35,601
I'll give you two periods to finish it.

139
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,401
No break until you do.

140
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:07,950
Are those second-year science exercises?

141
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,590
Yes.

142
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,567
They're not that hard.

143
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,451
I agree.

144
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,850
I can do a lot of them right now.

145
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,120
If I choose science,

146
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,054
I might do better than you

147
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:25,011
if I put in some effort.

148
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:35,921
- Teacher.
 - Where is your essay book?

149
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:38,181
I've finished it.

150
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:46,871
Come to my office before study hall at noon.

151
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,891
You did well on the essay.

152
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:02,923
The style is good.

153
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:07,500
You are choosing science?

154
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:12,660
Mr. Liu, what's up with the girls in your class?

155
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,808
Kong Shadi was talking about choosing science yesterday.

156
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:18,302
And now, here's another one.

157
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:21,869
Have you turned in your form of intent?

158
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:23,041
Not yet.

159
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,941
Think about it.

160
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:27,285
- Excuse me.
 - Come in.

161
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:31,161
Mr. Liu, I want to participate in the math competition, too.

162
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:32,821
The placement test is close.

163
00:12:32,821 --> 00:12:35,281
- Do you have enough energy for that?
 - Literature is important.

164
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:39,301
Actually, He Xingwen, competitions are not the only way.

165
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:42,691
You are quite balanced in all the subjects.

166
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:45,130
You could get into a good university by participating in NCEE.

167
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:50,851
If Zhou Siyue can do it, why can't I since I have better performance?

168
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:52,807
How about this?

169
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:54,111
I have a set of exercise papers here.

170
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:57,261
Go back, finish them, and turn them in tomorrow.

171
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,621
Ding Xian, are you listening to me?

172
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:03,511
I am, Teacher. I will think about it.

173
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:05,154
All right.

174
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:10,064
Don't do other things in literature classes.

175
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:22,967
Did the literature teacher give you a hard time?

176
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,361
Not really.

177
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:36,623
Zhou Siyue,

178
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:42,127
do you think it's better for girls to choose liberal arts?

179
00:13:43,604 --> 00:13:46,471
What does gender have to do with this?

180
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:48,570
I don't know.

181
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,701
But my parents and the literature teacher all said

182
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,960
that girls should choose liberal arts.

183
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,518
They won't let me choose science.

184
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:04,459
So, do you think you are better at liberal arts or science?

185
00:14:06,574 --> 00:14:09,227
Actually, it doesn't matter which one it is

186
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:11,329
and don't mind what others say,

187
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:15,771
just choose what you are good at or like.

188
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:22,640
I got your back either way.

189
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:24,898
Really?

190
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:30,921
Would you still support me if I choose liberal arts?

191
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:32,945
Sure.

192
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:40,521
Never mind. I'll take a nap first.

193
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:56,961
Deng Wanwan, what was that about?

194
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:59,811
He Xingwen, are you the only one who needs to study? Don't I need to do that?

195
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:03,600
Aren't you ashamed that as a guy, you left all the cleaning duties outside to me.

196
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,239
You can do the cleaning if you want. And I can make my own choices.

197
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:09,261
I'm participating in the math competition.

198
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,787
I'm busy.

199
00:16:10,787 --> 00:16:12,950
- Don't be mad.
 - He Xingwen, you are a guy.

200
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,077
Can't you take care of Wanwan a little?

201
00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:17,521
Zhou Siyue is also participating in the competition.

202
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:19,151
Why isn't he having so many problems?

203
00:16:19,151 --> 00:16:21,917
No wonder Mr. Liu likes him but not you.

204
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:26,237
Everyone knows you like Zhou Siyue.

205
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:27,651
What are you talking about?

206
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:28,921
I'm not.

207
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,651
Mr. Liu thinks of him as his own son.

208
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:32,651
He's prepared to give him the recommendation quota.

209
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:35,961
I don't have the nerve to mess with a Huaqing candidate.

210
00:16:43,797 --> 00:16:48,697
He Xingwen, I used to think you could get into Huaqing.

211
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:53,891
Now I think you are lucky to get into a basic public university.

212
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:58,331
Just focus on your own things. Why cynically talk about others?

213
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:04,112
If one of my friends can be recommended, I would be happy for him.

214
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,921
You are saying the grapes are sour because you can't have any.

215
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:10,961
You shouldn't be so narrow-minded.

216
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:26,276
Not bad. The little rabbit is biting now.

217
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:31,439
Aren't you a good teacher?

218
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:34,322
Are you stupid or not?

219
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,580
Zhou Siyue.

220
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:48,375
I'm not stupid.

221
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:07,081
I know.

222
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:22,651
12 to 12.

223
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:27,891
You really terrified me when you were firing at He Xingwen.

224
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:29,611
How did you become so brave?

225
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:31,851
I didn't think too much.

226
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:34,681
I just think that He Xingwen is outrageous.

227
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:38,181
Now you are standing up for Zhou Siyue?

228
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:40,667
13 to 12.

229
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:46,878
Do you remember when I was called up by Mr. Liu?

230
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:50,551
He was the first one who defended me when I arrived in the city.

231
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:54,427
That's why I'm defending him now.

232
00:18:58,161 --> 00:19:02,587
Oh, Shadi. Go to a hair salon with me after the exam.

233
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:04,421
What?

234
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:07,543
I want to get bangs.

235
00:19:13,191 --> 00:19:15,811
 I want to look pretty.

236
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:23,281
You had a sudden realization!

237
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:26,521
Listen! I know a really good hairdresser.

238
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:28,191
Not everyone can get an appointment.

239
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:31,161
I will take you there after the exam.

240
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:34,654
Ding Xian.

241
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:36,664
Xian, are you all right?

242
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:38,731
Ding Xian, I didn't mean to do it.

243
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:40,331
Are you all right?

244
00:19:40,331 --> 00:19:41,591
Is she okay?

245
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:43,591
What happened?

246
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:45,621
Let me see.

247
00:19:45,621 --> 00:19:47,521
It hurts. Don't touch it.

248
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,001
Sorry.

249
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,651
Why don't I take you to the infirmary?

250
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:55,351
You guys go back to class. I'll bring her there.

251
00:19:57,921 --> 00:19:59,141
Okay. Go back!

252
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:01,041
Time for class.

253
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,531
I've checked for you.

254
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:05,471
But I would suggest getting it checked up at a hospital.

255
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:08,331
It would be really bad if your retina is injured.

256
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:13,094
Let's go. I'm taking you to a hospital.

257
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:18,901
I think it's fine. We have a class later.

258
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:23,391
Okay. You can stay blind here.

259
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,100
I'm going. Should we ask for leave first?

260
00:20:45,971 --> 00:20:47,901
Is it done?

261
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:54,011
Go back to your nap.

262
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:57,550
The test result won't be out for another half hour.

263
00:20:59,811 --> 00:21:02,621
You only injured your eye.

264
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:05,181
Why are you talking so gently?

265
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:15,591
Zhou Siyue, you don't have to copy the notes for me anymore.

266
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:21,241
I'm worried that this will slow down your preparation for the competition.

267
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:26,781
After the exam, I'll ask my mom to get a pair of glasses with a higher presecription for me.

268
00:21:26,781 --> 00:21:30,881
Don't get distracted because of me.

269
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:37,521
Okay.

270
00:21:44,811 --> 00:21:46,911
Zhou Siyue.

271
00:21:49,353 --> 00:21:51,463
Thank you.

272
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:55,081
What are you thanking me for?

273
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:58,331
That's not what I'm talking about.

274
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:00,922
I'm talking about...

275
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:06,771
when everyone is against my choice,

276
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:12,034
you are the only one who told me to choose what I like.

277
00:22:12,034 --> 00:22:16,010
So, thank you.

278
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,293
Just think it through yourself.

279
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,887
Ding Xian, come on!

280
00:22:58,611 --> 00:22:59,811
I'm late.

281
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:00,851
I'm going to leave now.

282
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:01,971
Just a second.

283
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:04,661
When are you turning in the form of intent?

284
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:08,060
In a few days.

285
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,540
Finish filling it out soon and deliver it.

286
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,385
Okay. Got it, Mom.

287
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:15,645
- I'm leaving now.
 - All right, be careful.

288
00:23:23,974 --> 00:23:27,384
Zhou Siyue, do you have brain damage?

289
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:30,951
Excuse me.

290
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,161
Ding Xian, what is it?

291
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:37,781
Mr. Liu, should I come back later?

292
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:39,801
It's okay. Come in.

293
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:47,811
Mr. Liu, this is my form of intent.

294
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:50,400
Just leave it there.

295
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,731
Do you have anything else to do?

296
00:23:58,281 --> 00:23:59,216
No.

297
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:00,791
Go back to the classroom, then.

298
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:01,691
Okay.

299
00:24:26,921 --> 00:24:28,301
You chose science?

300
00:24:29,127 --> 00:24:31,267
Are you sure you have thought it through?

301
00:24:34,921 --> 00:24:36,421
I have.

302
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:40,691
I'm going to prove to everyone that even if I chose science,

303
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:42,941
I would still do a good job.

304
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:53,401
Why was Mr. Liu so mean to you?

305
00:24:53,401 --> 00:24:54,951
What's wrong?

306
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,211
It's just that I've been making mistakes when doing exercises.

307
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:02,520
That's why he's annoyed.

308
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,161
But he shouldn't have been so mean.

309
00:25:05,161 --> 00:25:06,921
You are tired enough already.

310
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:10,801
How should you deal with the stress if he keeps pressuring you?

311
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:13,401
Don't worry.

312
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:14,801
I've got it.

313
00:25:17,371 --> 00:25:19,171
Zhou Siyue.

314
00:25:20,547 --> 00:25:24,638
Whatever you do, I got your back, too.

315
00:25:27,331 --> 00:25:29,031
I know.

316
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:32,951
Oh, right!

317
00:25:32,951 --> 00:25:34,791
My dad bought me a new cell phone.

318
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,196
So, you should take this back.

319
00:25:36,196 --> 00:25:37,696
Thanks.

320
00:25:41,436 --> 00:25:44,256

321
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:54,231
More reading and less cell phone playing.

322
00:25:57,451 --> 00:25:59,121
You too.

323
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,400

324
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:15,611
Two girls were peeking at you in the examination room.

325
00:26:15,611 --> 00:26:17,101
Did you notice that?

326
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:18,901
Really?

327
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,761
It seems that you've done well.

328
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:23,241
You even have the time to look at someone else.

329
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:24,371
It's not bad.

330
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:27,371
I'm pretty sure about Chinese, English, and comprehensive literature.

331
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:29,691
And I think I've done well in math.

332
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:32,281
As for science, I did finish writing it.

333
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:33,721
You are still talking about the exam.

334
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:36,061
Did you forget what we weresupposed to do after the exam?

335
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,521
I didn't.

336
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:40,011
Let's meet up at the pool club after dinner.

337
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,161
Come on.

338
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:43,861
Did you forget what you promised me?

339
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:44,811
Of course not.

340
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,301
- Let's meet up at your place after dinner.
 - Okay.

341
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:53,440
Shadi.

342
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,230
How do I look?

343
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,401
It's a nice outfit. This one is it.

344
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,211
 Ding Xian!

345
00:27:02,211 --> 00:27:03,911
- I prepared some fruit for you.
 - Mom.

346
00:27:03,911 --> 00:27:06,371
I'm changing clothes. Just a second.

347
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:08,771
What are you doing? You won't even let me in.

348
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:10,836
Here.

349
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:12,413
All right.

350
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:13,983
I'm going to pick up your brother.

351
00:27:13,983 --> 00:27:15,313
You two stay at home and keep an eye on things.

352
00:27:15,313 --> 00:27:16,983
All right. Don't worry.

353
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:24,283
Take me to the hairdresser when my mom is out.

354
00:27:24,283 --> 00:27:25,433
Or we won't get back in time.

355
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:29,063
Don't worry. We have sufficient time.

356
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:42,963
Don't tell me the hairdresser you mentioned is actually yourself.

357
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:45,519
You...

358
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,613
Are you sure?

359
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:47,663
Please.

360
00:27:47,663 --> 00:27:50,763
I've been cutting bangs for 15 years now.

361
00:27:50,763 --> 00:27:53,293
No hairdresser is more reliable than I am, all right?

362
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:54,943
Oblique bangs, neat bangs,

363
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:56,573
European style, Korean style, and Japanese style.

364
00:27:56,573 --> 00:27:59,803
I can cut all the bangs that you can think of.

365
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,403
Pick one.

366
00:28:02,953 --> 00:28:05,593
Maybe not this time.

367
00:28:05,593 --> 00:28:07,263
No.

368
00:28:07,263 --> 00:28:08,913
Pick one.

369
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:19,813
- This one.
 - That one doesn't look good.

370
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:21,263
It's not fashionable at all.

371
00:28:21,263 --> 00:28:22,763
How about this one? That's a nice one.

372
00:28:22,763 --> 00:28:25,523
Look how fashionable it is. We are going with this one.

373
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:32,949
Don't move.

374
00:28:33,808 --> 00:28:35,418
Should we use it like that?

375
00:28:35,418 --> 00:28:37,928
Trust me.

376
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:41,548
You will be the focus of the crowd tonight.

377
00:28:42,158 --> 00:28:43,688
Shadi.

378
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,018
I'm a little afraid.

379
00:28:45,018 --> 00:28:46,978
Don't be.

380
00:28:46,978 --> 00:28:49,948
You have a small face structure. I'll just cover your face a little.

381
00:28:49,948 --> 00:28:52,360
And according to my experience,

382
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,058
this length of the bangs is of perfect ratio. Okay?

383
00:28:56,058 --> 00:28:57,920
- Just a second.
 - I'm cutting now.

384
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,620
Take it slow.

385
00:29:15,598 --> 00:29:17,498
All right, it's done.

386
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:19,988
How do I look?

387
00:29:21,431 --> 00:29:22,961
I think

388
00:29:23,618 --> 00:29:26,677
I forgot to count the radian of your forehead in.

389
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:28,871
What do you mean?

390
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:38,908
Shadi!

391
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:43,967
I think I can find a hoe and go work in the fields.

392
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:46,238
You are exaggerating.

393
00:29:46,238 --> 00:29:48,888
It's not bad once you get used to it.

394
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:55,278
It's just that I'm not quite used to it at first sight.

395
00:29:56,568 --> 00:30:02,238
So, do you have any solutions to make it look good at first sight?

396
00:30:07,688 --> 00:30:09,498
Let's break up.

397
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,658
Slow down. I can't see the road.

398
00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:17,618
Your hat completely blocked your eyesight.

399
00:30:17,618 --> 00:30:19,138
Naturally, you would slow down when you can't see the road.

400
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:21,088
You did this to me.

401
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:28,180
Take care.

402
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,703
I'm so thirsty. I'll go get a drink.

403
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,810
- Hurry up.
 - All right.

404
00:30:34,018 --> 00:30:35,968
 Excuse me, a bottle of water.

405
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,314
Is there no one there?

406
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:38,568
 No.

407
00:30:38,568 --> 00:30:39,868
Coming!

408
00:30:50,568 --> 00:30:52,368
Sir!

409
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:57,358
Young lady, you are quite bold.

410
00:30:58,498 --> 00:30:59,718
What are you trying to do?

411
00:30:59,718 --> 00:31:00,788
Come here. Come.

412
00:31:00,788 --> 00:31:02,148
What is it?

413
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:03,908
Is there a problem?

414
00:31:06,928 --> 00:31:09,408
No. It's a misunderstanding.

415
00:31:12,658 --> 00:31:14,531
I'm here. Let's go.

416
00:31:15,358 --> 00:31:17,980
- Are you all right?
 - Yeah.

417
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:21,618
Let's go.

418
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:22,738
Sir, give us a table.

419
00:31:22,738 --> 00:31:23,928
Okay. Just a second.

420
00:31:25,257 --> 00:31:26,878
Did you smell anything?

421
00:31:28,048 --> 00:31:29,378
Like what?

422
00:31:29,378 --> 00:31:31,438
The smell of hair gel from Zhou Siyue.

423
00:31:32,118 --> 00:31:33,114
Just a second.

424
00:31:33,114 --> 00:31:35,538
This guy is using hair gel now.

425
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:37,438
What does that mean?

426
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,618
Come on. Let's begin now.

427
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:46,825
 I'll go put the drinks down.

428
00:31:48,688 --> 00:31:50,288
What are you smirking about?

429
00:31:50,288 --> 00:31:52,338
Nothing. It's nothing.

430
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:55,668
Why are you wearing a hat in the room?

431
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,488
Stop looking.

432
00:32:02,678 --> 00:32:04,478
What is it?

433
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,158
It's quite cute.

434
00:32:09,145 --> 00:32:10,845
Really?

435
00:32:12,328 --> 00:32:13,778
Stop wearing a hat.

436
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:16,218
You will lose more hair if your scalp can't breathe.

437
00:32:17,738 --> 00:32:19,788
Here. There is no room for two kings in one Shenhai High School.

438
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:21,768
Why do we need so many famous people?

439
00:32:21,768 --> 00:32:23,244
Watch me.

440
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:25,778
What kind of famous person are you?

441
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:28,418
Zhou Siyue might be pretty good, but you can stop bragging.

442
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:30,118
Let me try that.

443
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:35,151
Let me.

444
00:32:38,718 --> 00:32:40,413
It doesn't look so hard.

445
00:32:43,788 --> 00:32:45,157
Have a try. Here.

446
00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:46,777
I don't know how to do that.

447
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:49,708
Let me show you.

448
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:51,368
I would suggest that you give up right away.

449
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,115
Have you heard of a mathematical method called "half-ball hit"?

450
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:57,068
It would take me forever to teach you. Let go.

451
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:05,638
The right hitting point should be aligned with the center of a hole

452
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:07,618
and the ball you are targeting.

453
00:33:08,598 --> 00:33:10,308
Point to that spot

454
00:33:10,308 --> 00:33:12,808
and you will most likely get the ball in the hole.

455
00:33:17,268 --> 00:33:18,668
Have a try.

456
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:28,568
You are not putting your hands right.

457
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,858
Do it like I'm doing.

458
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:02,598
What's with the smile?

459
00:34:05,738 --> 00:34:07,318
Your bowl cut.

460
00:34:08,388 --> 00:34:09,888
It cracked open.

461
00:34:12,028 --> 00:34:13,628
Zhou Siyue!

462
00:34:14,538 --> 00:34:15,738
I've learned how to do it.

463
00:34:15,738 --> 00:34:17,038
Let me.

464
00:34:29,138 --> 00:34:31,828
That's just luck. Newbies' luck.

465
00:34:38,558 --> 00:34:39,758
Impressive.

466
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,598
Ding Xian,

467
00:34:41,598 --> 00:34:45,218
have you been practicing in secret?

468
00:34:45,218 --> 00:34:47,928
No. I just learned it.

469
00:34:47,928 --> 00:34:51,008
Siyue, did you notice that this girl is not good at studying,

470
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,618
but she's good at all the things like this?

471
00:34:52,618 --> 00:34:54,188
It's just like when we were in the game room.

472
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:55,378
It's so strange.

473
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:56,768
She's talented.

474
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:58,858
And she has a good teacher.

475
00:34:59,938 --> 00:35:00,978
Let me try.

476
00:35:00,978 --> 00:35:03,018
You are always protecting her. I can't say anything.

477
00:35:26,078 --> 00:35:29,328
- Hello. Are you Ding Xian's mom?
 - Yes. That's right.

478
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:31,858
Hi. I'm Liu Jiang, Ding Xian's class adviser.

479
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:33,898
- Nice to meet you.
 - Nice to meet you, Mr. Liu.

480
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,058
- Come in, please.
 - Okay.

481
00:35:36,058 --> 00:35:38,458
- Sorry for intruding. Shoe changing?
 - No, it's okay.

482
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:39,938
Please. Come in and have a seat.

483
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,328
- All right.
 - I'm going to get some water for you.

484
00:35:41,328 --> 00:35:42,658
It's okay. I won't stay long.

485
00:35:42,658 --> 00:35:44,418
It's okay. Sit.

486
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:53,808
Now I know that you two are cooperating to bully me today.

487
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:57,468
Blame it on your lack of skills.

488
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,288
You are good. Your cue never touched the balls.

489
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:02,848
That's because I had a bad teacher.

490
00:36:03,618 --> 00:36:04,808
Give me my wallet.

491
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:07,248
I'm going to pay the bill.

492
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:10,648
It's in my overcoat.

493
00:36:23,088 --> 00:36:25,898
Did Ding Xian do something at school?

494
00:36:25,898 --> 00:36:27,858
Or did she not do well in the exam?

495
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:30,518
That's not it. Ding Xian's mom, calm down.

496
00:36:30,518 --> 00:36:34,008
I'm here today for a school task.

497
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:36,528
I'm just here for a short home visit.

498
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:40,218
The vacation sessions are just over.

499
00:36:40,218 --> 00:36:42,418
The kids are about to start their second year.

500
00:36:42,418 --> 00:36:44,388
You know about liberal arts and science, right?

501
00:36:44,388 --> 00:36:47,088
I know. I told her to choose liberal arts.

502
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:48,378
- Liberal arts?
 - Yes.

503
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,698
But Ding Xian chose science.

504
00:36:53,538 --> 00:36:54,728
That's not right.

505
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:56,768
I told her to choose liberal arts.

506
00:36:56,768 --> 00:36:57,938
Well...

507
00:36:57,938 --> 00:36:59,338
Look.

508
00:37:00,394 --> 00:37:03,224
Ding Xian wrote it in the form of intent.

509
00:37:03,224 --> 00:37:04,638
She chose science.

510
00:37:05,728 --> 00:37:07,618
That girl. She didn't tell me.

511
00:37:08,618 --> 00:37:10,578
I'll change it for her. Please let me use the pen.

512
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:13,808
Ding Xian's mom. Just a second.

513
00:37:13,808 --> 00:37:18,438
I think we should ask Ding Xian's idea about this.

514
00:37:19,048 --> 00:37:22,698
What if we make this decision for her and she detests it?

515
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,184
Am I right?

516
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:25,328
Well.

517
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:30,458
I have some thoughts about her choosing science.

518
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,948
- Let me explain, and you can see if I'm right.
 - Okay.

519
00:37:32,978 --> 00:37:37,498
I think that the science classes all have better performance.

520
00:37:37,498 --> 00:37:40,568
All the students in science classes are the best ones among the elites.

521
00:37:40,568 --> 00:37:42,908
When those students get together,

522
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:45,358
Ding Xian's advantage would be less outstanding.

523
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:46,858
No. Mr. Liu, look.

524
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:52,038
You see, Ding Xian has always been one of the best in junior high.

525
00:37:52,038 --> 00:37:55,728
I've never had any worries about her academic performance.

526
00:37:55,728 --> 00:37:57,898
She's not getting worse, right?

527
00:37:57,898 --> 00:38:01,758
And my kid is quite resilient.

528
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:05,048
She never complained that she can't keep up.

529
00:38:05,048 --> 00:38:08,418
As her teacher, you should encourage her.

530
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:10,538
How could you say that?

531
00:38:11,148 --> 00:38:13,118
No. Ding Xian's mom, don't get agitated just yet.

532
00:38:13,118 --> 00:38:14,838
That's not what I meant.

533
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:16,248
Mr. Liu, I'm really sorry.

534
00:38:16,248 --> 00:38:17,378
I have other plans today.

535
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,868
How about we call it a day?

536
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:23,698
Okay. Don't let me keep you for longer.

537
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:26,118
All right. Thank you for making the trip.

538
00:38:27,248 --> 00:38:29,968
Ding Xian's mom, I think you misunderstood me.

539
00:38:29,968 --> 00:38:31,078
Here. Take care, Mr. Liu.

540
00:38:31,078 --> 00:38:33,388
- I just...
 - Thanks a lot. Thank you.

541
00:38:33,388 --> 00:38:35,238
I just want to say that...

542
00:38:35,238 --> 00:38:36,728
See you, Mr. Liu.

543
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:38,328
Take care.

544
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:43,288
Here's your change.

545
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:44,838
- All right. Thank you.
 - You are welcome.

546
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:45,978
Let's go sing karaoke.

547
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:47,618
I'll do whatever you want.

548
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:50,658
Maybe another day. My parents are coming back.

549
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:52,728
How boring would it be if you are not there?

550
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:53,808
Come with us.

551
00:38:53,808 --> 00:38:55,768
Shadi, I'll come with you next time.

552
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:57,138
You guys should go.

553
00:38:57,138 --> 00:38:58,258
I'll walk her home.

554
00:38:58,258 --> 00:39:00,348
- All right. Let's go.
 - See you.

555
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:02,148
Let's go.

556
00:39:02,938 --> 00:39:05,728
It's cold outside. Put on your clothes.

557
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:15,788
The bangs you got look good.

558
00:39:17,628 --> 00:39:19,108
Don't try to fool me.

559
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:20,778
I know how I look.

560
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:25,938
Oh, right!

561
00:39:25,938 --> 00:39:27,728
When is your competition?

562
00:39:28,568 --> 00:39:30,158
In October.

563
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:35,148
So, I will be joining a closed training after school starts.

564
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:41,488
You will be on your own for a while.

565
00:39:42,188 --> 00:39:43,988
Be careful.

566
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,290
Okay.

567
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,991
Don't worry about me. I can do it.

568
00:39:49,628 --> 00:39:51,078
That's some big words.

569
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:55,628
Since I chose science, I will work twice as hard.

570
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:58,504
Even if you are not here, I will still do well in exams.

571
00:40:00,588 --> 00:40:02,608
I will prove it to you.

572
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:04,658
All right!

573
00:40:04,658 --> 00:40:07,378
I'm looking forward to your monthly exam results.

574
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:24,088
What are you looking at?

575
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,088
I'm back.

576
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:40,988
Xianxian, you are back.

577
00:40:55,378 --> 00:40:56,878
Mom.

578
00:41:01,488 --> 00:41:02,988
You cut your hair!

579
00:41:05,138 --> 00:41:06,528
It's ugly.

580
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:07,808
Stop the nonsense.

581
00:41:07,808 --> 00:41:09,758
It's late. Go to bed.

582
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,658
I'm not sleeping.

583
00:41:22,528 --> 00:41:24,488
Who said that you can cut your hair?

584
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:26,928
Mom,

585
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:31,541
don't I even get to cut my own hair?

586
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:32,768
She's right.

587
00:41:32,768 --> 00:41:34,768
She's not little anymore.

588
00:41:34,768 --> 00:41:36,378
She has her own ideas.

589
00:41:36,378 --> 00:41:38,988
We should respect her choice.

590
00:41:46,658 --> 00:41:49,618
I've been working so hard to take care of everything for you.

591
00:41:49,618 --> 00:41:51,218
And look what I got.

592
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,908
One of you ignored my decision and chose science,

593
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:58,645
and the other one knew about it and didn't tell me.

594
00:41:58,645 --> 00:42:01,271
My words are nothing in this family, right?

595
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,588
I should have been doing all those things

596
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:05,748
without saying anything. Right?

597
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,680
Things are clear to me now.

598
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,366
Our daughter is not little anymore. She gets to make her own choices.

599
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:18,306
There's nothing I can do about that.

600
00:42:19,305 --> 00:42:22,055
But there's still something I can do about you.

601
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,908
I don't care.

602
00:42:24,908 --> 00:42:29,658
I don't care what you have to do, transfer her to a liberal arts class!

603
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:45,710

604
00:42:48,051 --> 00:42:52,241
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

605
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:56,901
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

606
00:42:58,598 --> 00:43:02,784
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

607
00:43:02,784 --> 00:43:07,041
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

608
00:43:08,029 --> 00:43:13,891
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

609
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:17,629
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

610
00:43:18,485 --> 00:43:24,264
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

611
00:43:24,264 --> 00:43:28,238
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

612
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:31,411
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

613
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:34,104
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

614
00:43:34,104 --> 00:43:38,401
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

615
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:41,974
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

616
00:43:41,974 --> 00:43:44,451
♫  After a long journey  ♫

617
00:43:44,451 --> 00:43:49,041
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

618
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:13,207
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

619
00:44:13,207 --> 00:44:15,881
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

620
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:19,924
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

621
00:44:20,987 --> 00:44:23,701
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

622
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:26,241
♫  After a long journey  ♫

623
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:30,644
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
