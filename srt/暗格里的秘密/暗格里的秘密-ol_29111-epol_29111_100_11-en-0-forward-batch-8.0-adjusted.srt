1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,080

2
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:26,713
♫  For whom will the summer slow down ♫

3
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:31,099
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:34,979
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:40,151
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:44,857
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:48,506
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:55,465
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:55,465 --> 00:01:02,461
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:09,491
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:12,325
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:14,338
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:14,338 --> 00:01:17,691
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:22,917
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:25,905
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:28,357
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:28,357 --> 00:01:35,692
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:39,199

19
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:42,100

20
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,260
I have an announcement.

21
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,530
The city is having a painting competition.

22
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,620
Each school needs to send several students to the competition.

23
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,900
- If anyone of you would like to sign up...
 - Kong Shadi.

24
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,340
Come and get the application form right now.

25
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,210
Mr. Liu, Ding Xian can do it.

26
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,380
 Yeah, she's good at it.

27
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,400
 Mr. Liu, she can do it.

28
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,930
Come on.

29
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,350
What do you think, Ding Xian? Do you think you can do it?

30
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:34,113
Mom,

31
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:37,003
have you thought it through?

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
It's good.

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,903
But...

34
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:46,390
you are already at the last second of your second year.

35
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,030
I would never have stopped you at another time.

36
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,570
But we are at a critical time right now.

37
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,420
You have to focus on your studies right now.

38
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,880
Painting is just a hobby for you.

39
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,250
Don't waste your energy on that.

40
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,790
Okay, I got it.

41
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,550
Ding Xian,

42
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,703
I'm trying to have a good conversation. What's with that face?

43
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:13,300
You will not agree anyway.

44
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,340
Can you just talk?

45
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,570
I'm saying this for your sake.

46
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,610
Would I try to damage your interest?

47
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:27,498
Mom, have some water and calm down.

48
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:35,258
Is it your essay?

49
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:36,758
Let me see.

50
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:53,948
"My family."

51
00:03:57,852 --> 00:04:00,547
My family is always noisy.

52
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:02,258
My mom and my sister are quite alike.

53
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:03,698
They are always angry.

54
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:06,528
Whenever things don't go their way, they will raise their voice in an instant.

55
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,091
"It feels like thunder, piercing through my ear."

56
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:13,968
Is this how you think of me?

57
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:16,668
It feels like thunder...

58
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:18,440
You are good with metaphors.

59
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,540
Rewrite it.

60
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:27,048
Can't I tell the truth?

61
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:29,568
Dad,

62
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,948
I will never get married.

63
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:33,898
What kind of nonsense is that?

64
00:04:34,938 --> 00:04:36,438
I can relate.

65
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:39,236
Go. Rewrite it.

66
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,060

67
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:53,668
What's there to hesitate about?

68
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,278
Come on, I'll go sign up with you.

69
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,281
What is it?

70
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,408
You two, talk to her.

71
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:03,948
She doesn't want to sign up for the painting competition.

72
00:05:03,998 --> 00:05:08,068
I heard that Yang Chunzi has signed up.

73
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:10,408
What is it, Little Monster? Are you afraid?

74
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:11,843
It's the heart that matters.

75
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:15,248
Never mind. Let me think about it.

76
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,068
The class is beginning.

77
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:19,450
Don't be afraid.

78
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,430
- Hey!
 - Hey!

79
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,398
- Oh no!
 - Sit tight.

80
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,898
Dad, why are you dressed like that?

81
00:05:40,677 --> 00:05:42,568
Dad did something great this time.

82
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:45,848
Listen. Follow my lead later.

83
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:46,960
Ding Wencheng.

84
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,128
How do I look?

85
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:50,958
Great. Just great.

86
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:53,344
- Nice.
 - Is the lipstick too bright?

87
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:55,448
Is it? I don't think so.

88
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:56,568
Xianxian, what do you say?

89
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:57,648
Doesn't your mom look nice?

90
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:00,388
Yes, she does.

91
00:06:00,388 --> 00:06:03,278
Mom, the lipstick color is so nice.

92
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:07,087
Where are you going dressed like this?

93
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:09,058
Your dad wants to be hip.

94
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:11,668
He's taking me to a concert and a fancy dinner.

95
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:13,938
I've never been to places like that before.

96
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:17,688
We should try the classic life once in a while.

97
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:19,968
Your mom and I can take Juncong

98
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:21,968
to uplift his mind and spirit in the meantime.

99
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:25,017
People say that good habits are formed in childhood.

100
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,988
Xianxian, watch the apartment.

101
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:29,658
Don't worry, I'm not a kid anymore.

102
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:30,820
Right.

103
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,128
Ding Juncong!

104
00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:34,048
Ding Juncong, hurry up!

105
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:38,728
Juncong, come on. Let's go.

106
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:40,568
What is it?

107
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:41,826
What are you doing?

108
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:44,448
What?

109
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:46,938
I'm not going. I want to watch cartoons at home.

110
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:49,768
Why would you do that? You have no ambition at all.

111
00:06:49,768 --> 00:06:51,060
Your dad went through so much trouble to get the tickets.

112
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,598
That's right. The ticket is so expensive. You have to go.

113
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:56,007
Yeah, the concert would be excellent.

114
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,780
If I didn't have to do homework at home, I would love to go.

115
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,120
Then why don't you?

116
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,153
Suit yourself. I'm not going.

117
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:04,663
Then don't go. You are so spoiled.

118
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:07,008
Ding Xian, keep him under check.

119
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:09,268
Make him do his homework, and I will check it when I get home.

120
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:11,288
Come on, let's go.

121
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:14,668
Dad.

122
00:07:15,743 --> 00:07:17,588
I can only help you this much.

123
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:18,878
Ding Wencheng.

124
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:20,278
Hurry up!

125
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:32,007
Hello?

126
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:34,088
Come down. I'm taking you to the venue.

127
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:36,248
 I don't think I can go.

128
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,680
What?

129
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:40,768
What do you mean by that?

130
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:42,904
Okay.

131
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,815
Hello?

132
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:51,829
You two should get here now.

133
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:00,197
Do you want it?

134
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:01,758
Leave it there.

135
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:03,358
All right.

136
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:07,898
Old little brother,

137
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:10,030
the weather is great today.

138
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,768
Don't you want to go out?

139
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:12,768
No.

140
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,278
Mom and Dad are finally out today.

141
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:20,278
Haven't you been wanting to go to the game room?

142
00:08:20,278 --> 00:08:22,524
You can go now. I'll keep it a secret for you.

143
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:25,318
Don't treat me like I'm clueless.

144
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:29,528
I'm not going. I just won't. What can you do?

145
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,328
Hi.

146
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:40,760
What are you doing here?

147
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,408
We're here to babysit for you. Just relax and go to the competition.

148
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:45,840
I'm the boss of the childrenat Shenhai High School.

149
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,528
Just head downstairs.

150
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:48,701
My brother is really...

151
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,960
Don't hesitate. Take your things and go.

152
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,518
- My brother...
 - Go!

153
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:53,518
Come on!

154
00:08:56,718 --> 00:08:57,918
Buddy,

155
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:02,668
why don't you hang out with me today?

156
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:08,548
What are you playing?

157
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,848
Stop snooping around.

158
00:09:10,598 --> 00:09:12,057
This kid!

159
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:14,797
It doesn't hurt even if I look.

160
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:18,941
Handsome, what are you playing?

161
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:20,485
Can I see it?

162
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:21,611
Sure.

163
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:24,261
Why don't you hang out with me today?

164
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:25,840
Okay.

165
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,480
Tell me how to play it.

166
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,968
Okay.

167
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:31,755
This is my favorite game.

168
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:33,618
Wen is a flying flag.

169
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,768
Isn't that Jiang Chen's vehicle?

170
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:40,768
Hop on.

171
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:44,041
Put on your helmet.

172
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:47,658
Are you ready?

173
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:50,818
We have successfully escaped!

174
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:57,008
Where is my motorbike?

175
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,230

176
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:15,138
Jiang Chen, are you taking me out for a ride on that?

177
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:18,268
That's right.

178
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:20,768
Look.

179
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:21,848
The weather is great today,

180
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:26,798
and you would look good on this yellow bike.

181
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,604
Come on.

182
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:30,222
I'm not going. It's embarrassing.

183
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:33,528
You are a nice-looking girl.

184
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:35,254
But why are you so picky?

185
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:36,568
Hop on.

186
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:37,928
I'm leaving if you are not coming.

187
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,721
Who's being picky?

188
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:42,441
I'll get on.

189
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:48,510
I'm going to be late.

190
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:51,364
- Go ahead.
 - See you later.

191
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:58,838
Ding Xian.

192
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:02,024
Fighting!

193
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,788
 We've prepared three themes for the competition.

194
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:24,038
 All candidates should pick one among youth, family, fight for the future,

195
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:26,618
 and do a piece about the theme you picked.

196
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:45,854

197
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:47,614
What was your painting about?

198
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,808
It's a secret.

199
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,808
Whatever.

200
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:58,818
With your skill, you will get a certificate or something.

201
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,618
The result doesn't matter.

202
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:09,545
I suddenly understood what you said to me before in the competition.

203
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,988
You said that there are things that may look ordinary,

204
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:23,718
but they would mean something when they come together.

205
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:27,928
Now I feel like painting is no longer

206
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:31,558
just a hobby for me.

207
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,458
Anyway,

208
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,588
thank you for what happened today.

209
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,218
Play!

210
00:12:47,218 --> 00:12:49,720
Smash and scored!

211
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,358
5 points for Ding Juncong! Victory! You lost!

212
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,648
Ding Juncong!

213
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:03,398
He's not an elementary school student! He's the devil walking amongst men.

214
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:05,058
I don't care, do my homework.

215
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:07,648
Or I'll tell Mom about this.

216
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:09,118
Mom.

217
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:10,988
What time is it now?

218
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,875
Oh, no. My mom is about to be home.

219
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,612
What should we do?

220
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:23,220
I'll help you with your homework.

221
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,410
Come on, clean this place up.

222
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:30,548
- Which part?
 - Here.

223
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,617
There's a crowd.

224
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:50,588
Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

225
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:53,174
You guys are...

226
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:55,228
We are in the same study group.

227
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:57,938
Zhou Siyue is tutoring Ding Juncong for his homework.

228
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,569
Yes, Auntie.

229
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:01,478
Great. That's great.

230
00:14:01,478 --> 00:14:03,738
Come on. Let me see your homework.

231
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,648
Not bad.

232
00:14:12,648 --> 00:14:14,588
You've got them all today.

233
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,038
How did you solve this one here?

234
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,188
This one...

235
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:26,458
Didn't Siyue just teach you?

236
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,868
- This one...
 - Did you forget?

237
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,671
I knew you would forget right away.

238
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:37,558
You have so many people here tutoring you,

239
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:40,648
you should grab the chance and learn from them.

240
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:44,495
Copy this question to your error notebook later and do it again.

241
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,358
You guys are all here. I'll go make some food for you.

242
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:48,478
Wait here.

243
00:14:48,478 --> 00:14:50,459
- No. It's okay, Auntie.
 - Uncle, we should leave now.

244
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,828
- See you, Uncle.
 - Auntie, see you.

245
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:55,098
My mom called me.

246
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,028
How did it go?

247
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,718
You should watch out this week.

248
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:18,028
Beware of the words of the villain.

249
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:19,238
Who's the villain?

250
00:15:19,238 --> 00:15:21,038
Who is it?

251
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,358
Ding Xian.

252
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,248
Come to my office.

253
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,209
Did you do something this time?

254
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,258
No, I didn't.

255
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:34,261
Is it really so accurate?

256
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,601
Are you all right?

257
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:52,518
Did he scold you?

258
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,677
It's okay.

259
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,990

260
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,558
Did you see a ghost or something?

261
00:16:02,558 --> 00:16:04,678
Xianxian, you are impressive.

262
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:07,158
You really are my little painter.

263
00:16:07,158 --> 00:16:10,018
Look! Xian got first place.

264
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,028
Not bad, Little Monster.

265
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:15,110
- That's brilliant, Ding Xian.
 - Give it back!

266
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,870
Oops!

267
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,138
You guys are acting crazy.

268
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:21,458
Can you act a little more mature?

269
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,634
Are you all right?

270
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:24,434
I'm fine.

271
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,780

272
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,768
And a marinated egg.

273
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,138
Come on. Little Monster is treating today.

274
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,220
I'm going to order things that I don't usually order. And I want the expensive ones.

275
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,840
Why are you always trying to take advantage of people?

276
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,308
It's my plan to thank you all today.

277
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:06,840
Without you, I wouldn't have been able to even go to the competition.

278
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,078
Brother Song is right. I would also like to order more food.

279
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,220
Go ahead.

280
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,150
Haven't you ordered enough?

281
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:16,048
Can't I?

282
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:18,593
It's okay. Order anything you want.

283
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,708
Would we be able to finish all that food?

284
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,628
You are all acting like beasts.

285
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:26,258
Of course, we can.

286
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:28,118
You've been acting as if you starved to death in your last life.

287
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:30,778
Your food expense has set us back recently.

288
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,538
Did you have another spat with your dad?

289
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:40,527
What is it this time?

290
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,078
Things are a little different this time.

291
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:45,960
It's a little serious. It's just that I want to...

292
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,520
He wants to join the army, and his dad won't let him no matter what.

293
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,378
Are you the only one who can talk?

294
00:17:51,378 --> 00:17:53,711
You are going to say it anyway.

295
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,268
I'm going to order more food.

296
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:03,138
Dude, I got the menu. You are...

297
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,468
Don't try to persuade me.

298
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:19,398
I've thought this through.

299
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,118
I'm not trying to persuade you.

300
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,958
You told me that you wanted to join the army when you were eight.

301
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,188
Did you forget that?

302
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:31,748
I told you that if you join the army,

303
00:18:31,748 --> 00:18:34,178
I will join the national defense research.

304
00:18:34,178 --> 00:18:38,608
Then, we will be protecting our country together.

305
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,668
How could I forget that?

306
00:18:43,668 --> 00:18:46,008
No backing off from that.

307
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:47,768
It's a promise, then.

308
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:49,568
It's a promise.

309
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,361
Don't worry.

310
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:56,368
We are all here.

311
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,228
There's not too much food here.

312
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:04,128
Why don't we go back?

313
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,828
Everyone has a dream.

314
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:09,898
My dream is to be a pilot.

315
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,138
If you can be a pilot, I'll become a flight attendant.

316
00:19:13,138 --> 00:19:14,278
I'll graduate sooner.

317
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,168
I'll start sooner.

318
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:18,658
Right. The clumsy bird should start sooner.

319
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,448
Who are you calling a clumsy bird?

320
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:23,108
That's me. I am.

321
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,105
Xianxian, how about you? What do you want to do?

322
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:33,868
Have you finished ordering?

323
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,688
I'm going to take it to the owner, if you are done.

324
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:36,620
Owner!

325
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,400
Coming.

326
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,648
I want... Yes, these.

327
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,248
All right!

328
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,618
- Have you ordered toast?
 - Yes.

329
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,118
We did.

330
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,388
 Right.

331
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,418
 What is my dream?

332
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,698
Isn't his dad in the military?

333
00:20:06,698 --> 00:20:09,278
Why won't he support him?

334
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,548
Jiang Chen has always had a conflict with his dad.

335
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:17,948
He always does the opposite of what his dad says.

336
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:22,490
That's why his dad thinks he doesn't have what it takes to join the military.

337
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:25,568
And you don't know Jiang Chen very well.

338
00:20:25,568 --> 00:20:27,048
That guy...

339
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:30,878
will never give in to his dad if he sets his mind to it.

340
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,728
What are you thinking about?

341
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,618
Everyone has a dream or a target.

342
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,608
That's impressive.

343
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,208
Didn't you just get first place?

344
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,668
Why would you think so much?

345
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:55,428
Painting is a hobby of mine at most.

346
00:20:55,428 --> 00:21:00,308
Shouldn't one's dream be big and powerful?

347
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,358
All dreams start from hobbies.

348
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:12,588
And I believe that you can do anything if you want to.

349
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,688
 Hobby.

350
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:24,018
 I want to be a painter.

351
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,838
This is not that simple.

352
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,168
 Ding Xian, why aren't you sleeping?

353
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:47,238
I'm going to.

354
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:03,568
Are you all right?

355
00:22:04,428 --> 00:22:07,358
I wouldn't have stayed up late if I knew this would happen.

356
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:10,168
Why do I feel like you are passing out?

357
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:11,958
That's nonsense.

358
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:14,071
How could you possibly understand the torture of that time of the month?

359
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:16,188
Don't. I have no desire to understand that.

360
00:22:16,188 --> 00:22:17,928
This is torturing.

361
00:22:17,928 --> 00:22:21,238
Maybe you should skip PE class.

362
00:22:23,588 --> 00:22:25,638
Where did you get that?

363
00:22:26,338 --> 00:22:27,878
The infirmary.

364
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:32,808
- Let's go.
 - Come on.

365
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:35,120
Xianxian, I'm going to leave now.

366
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,908
You are awake.

367
00:23:40,928 --> 00:23:43,468
What are you doing back here?

368
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:46,198
It's too hot outside.

369
00:23:46,198 --> 00:23:48,138
I don't want to join the class.

370
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:02,308
Zhou Siyue,

371
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:06,098
have you always wanted to go to Huaqing?

372
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:10,418
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

373
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:14,228
After you told me about it the other day,

374
00:24:14,228 --> 00:24:17,248
I've been thinking about it myself.

375
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:21,108
You said that dreams start with hobbies.

376
00:24:22,018 --> 00:24:24,538
And since I like painting,

377
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:27,818
I should be a painter.

378
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,208
But...

379
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,888
I've never learned to paint systematically.

380
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:38,418
I can't just do whatever comes to my mind.

381
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:46,258
What's with that smile?

382
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:49,618
I'm seriously thinking about this.

383
00:24:50,258 --> 00:24:52,038
I shouldn't have.

384
00:24:55,838 --> 00:25:00,208
Actually, I think it's good to be realistic.

385
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,688
For example.

386
00:25:03,478 --> 00:25:05,758
I've always wanted to join Huaqing...

387
00:25:06,568 --> 00:25:11,358
only because I wanted to go to a bigger place...

388
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:15,808
and see how far I can go.

389
00:25:18,438 --> 00:25:20,278
Is that all?

390
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:22,508
That's all.

391
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:29,338
Dreams...

392
00:25:30,318 --> 00:25:32,118
and targets...

393
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:39,688
are just giving us the power to keep going.

394
00:25:41,318 --> 00:25:42,918
So,

395
00:25:44,358 --> 00:25:48,058
can I call it a dream if I want to do better in exams?

396
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,968
Why are you smiling this time?

397
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,688
I just want to say...

398
00:25:58,688 --> 00:26:02,668
that your dream could be a little bigger.

399
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:10,795
Then, getting into a first-level university.

400
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:15,278
I have to take the first step.

401
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:21,158
Everyone thinks that I should settle with a basic university.

402
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:26,858
But I thought about it,

403
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:30,268
and I can't accept that.

404
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,838
I can get into a first-level university.

405
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:35,615
Okay.

406
00:26:35,615 --> 00:26:37,815
I'll help you.

407
00:26:54,701 --> 00:26:56,791
You should take a nap.

408
00:26:57,578 --> 00:26:59,978
I'll explain the questions to you when you wake up.

409
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:03,035
You will feel dizzy and confused if we do that now.

410
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:04,975
You won't remember anything.

411
00:27:07,888 --> 00:27:10,088
Sleep now.

412
00:27:34,405 --> 00:27:39,695
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

413
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:43,355
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

414
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:49,238
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

415
00:27:49,238 --> 00:27:54,483
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

416
00:27:54,483 --> 00:28:00,345
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

417
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:04,839
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

418
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:10,618
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

419
00:28:10,618 --> 00:28:14,995
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

420
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:17,965
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

421
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:20,558
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

422
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:25,755
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

423
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:28,428
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

424
00:28:28,428 --> 00:28:31,105
♫  After a long journey  ♫

425
00:28:31,105 --> 00:28:35,595
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

426
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:43,964
♫  Turns out time can be so magical  ♫

427
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:48,344
♫  Looking forward to seeing you  ♫

428
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:54,112
♫  Wishing time could stop at this moment  ♫

429
00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:58,688
♫  Nothing can take away our love  ♫

430
00:28:59,702 --> 00:29:05,516
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

431
00:29:05,516 --> 00:29:09,895

432
00:29:11,188 --> 00:29:13,288
Zhang Haojie.

433
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:15,718
Tang Jiamin.

434
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:17,198
Sounds like you did well on the test.

435
00:29:18,118 --> 00:29:19,918
Safe.

436
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:23,768
You won't get bad grades with my tutoring.

437
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:28,228
Our class ranked first

438
00:29:28,238 --> 00:29:30,508
in the whole second year.

439
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:35,418
But...

440
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:39,438
I can see someone has already grown proud.

441
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:41,128
Song Ziqi!

442
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:44,718
You are not about to join the senior year.

443
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:46,218
You are seniors now.

444
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,478
Xianxian.

445
00:29:47,478 --> 00:29:50,528
We will start the extra sessions right after summer vacation.

446
00:29:50,528 --> 00:29:52,118
 Don't forget about camping.

447
00:29:52,118 --> 00:29:53,708
 This is the last time we go big before senior year.

448
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:57,438
Don't play too hard and put your mind on learning.

449
00:29:57,438 --> 00:29:58,638
Do you understand?

450
00:30:00,838 --> 00:30:02,118
I'm back.

451
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:05,048
Xianxian, look who's here.

452
00:30:05,048 --> 00:30:06,238
Xianxian.

453
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:07,638
Senior Brother!

454
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:10,068
Why are you here?

455
00:30:10,068 --> 00:30:12,978
It's vacation time. I'm here to visit you. How have you been?

456
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,778
I'm good.

457
00:30:18,238 --> 00:30:19,718
Mom,

458
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,358
I want to ask you something.

459
00:30:22,718 --> 00:30:27,338
Kong Shadi asked me if I could hang out with her next weekend.

460
00:30:27,338 --> 00:30:31,071
- I want to ask...
 - No.

461
00:30:31,071 --> 00:30:33,828
Mom, this is the last summer vacation.

462
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:36,768
I said no because this is the last summer vacation.

463
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:42,598
Where are you going?

464
00:30:42,598 --> 00:30:44,838
We agreed that we will go camping.

465
00:30:45,768 --> 00:30:48,568
The camp beside the museum.

466
00:30:51,858 --> 00:30:55,368
Auntie, this is the last vacation.

467
00:30:55,368 --> 00:30:56,614
The pressure in Shenhai High School is huge.

468
00:30:56,614 --> 00:30:59,114
It's good to let off some steam at this point.

469
00:30:59,138 --> 00:31:02,978
I also went out back then. It didn't affect me.

470
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:06,148
You are one thing, and Xianxian is...

471
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:10,078
I'm also going there with several peers from the university.

472
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,718
We could watch over them. That should put your mind at ease.

473
00:31:13,598 --> 00:31:16,958
Mom, just let me go.

474
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,338
This summer vacation is the last time I can go out.

475
00:31:20,408 --> 00:31:21,938
Mom!

476
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:24,318
All right! All right!

477
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:25,884
But there's one condition.

478
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,598
You will focus on learning afterward.

479
00:31:27,598 --> 00:31:29,688
I promise.

480
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,078
Thanks, Mom.

481
00:31:31,078 --> 00:31:33,198
Okay. You two keep talking. I'll go prepare some food.

482
00:31:38,238 --> 00:31:40,558
Auntie, let me help you.

483
00:31:43,378 --> 00:31:45,198
 I'm so excited.

484
00:31:46,068 --> 00:31:48,388
 The last summer.

485
00:31:58,288 --> 00:31:59,888
Senior Brother!

486
00:32:01,068 --> 00:32:02,768
Xianxian.

487
00:32:04,098 --> 00:32:05,958
He looks so handsome.

488
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:08,218
He's looking better after graduation.

489
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,958
You've brought a lot of things.

490
00:32:16,318 --> 00:32:17,308
Senior,

491
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:19,368
I've heard so much about you.

492
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,398
You are Zhou Siyue, right?

493
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:23,758
I know.

494
00:32:23,758 --> 00:32:25,618
I grew up with Xianxian.

495
00:32:25,618 --> 00:32:27,678
She mentioned you before.

496
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:34,008
This is the devil's arena. Let's leave now.

497
00:32:34,008 --> 00:32:36,068
Don't get involved here! Let's go!

498
00:32:39,408 --> 00:32:41,898
Senior Brother, where should I leave this?

499
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:45,651
You guys are over there. I'll get it there for you.

500
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:47,018
It's okay.

501
00:32:47,018 --> 00:32:48,918
I got this.

502
00:32:51,008 --> 00:32:52,808
Come on.

503
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:55,468
Xianxian,

504
00:32:55,468 --> 00:32:58,118
we will have dinner at the campfire. Care to join us?

505
00:32:58,738 --> 00:32:59,838
Sure.

506
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:02,148
Let's all go together.

507
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,908
Then, you guys get ready.

508
00:33:06,908 --> 00:33:09,388
- I'll come back for you.
 - All right.

509
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:10,288
Go.

510
00:33:12,598 --> 00:33:14,198
See you, Senior Brother.

511
00:33:17,238 --> 00:33:19,038
Let's go.

512
00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:24,808
Come on.

513
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,920
Hey.

514
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:51,838
Why do I feel that Senior is getting more handsome?

515
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:56,368
I don't see any change in him.

516
00:33:58,218 --> 00:34:01,928
It's probably because you grew up with him. You are used to him.

517
00:34:01,928 --> 00:34:05,468
Anyway, I think he has become more handsome after going to university.

518
00:34:06,318 --> 00:34:09,358
So, would you like to go introduce yourself?

519
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:13,688
It would be awkward if I go introduce myself.

520
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:16,198
Why don't you introduce me?

521
00:34:19,988 --> 00:34:24,398
As long as Senior is around, even the air tastes sweet.

522
00:34:30,008 --> 00:34:31,158
Song Ziqi!

523
00:34:31,158 --> 00:34:32,534
Why are you grabbing my food?

524
00:34:32,534 --> 00:34:34,954
It's too late. That's the cost of you leching over a boy. Don't grab me.

525
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:40,428
This is not so good.

526
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,768
Why are you also stealing food?

527
00:34:43,768 --> 00:34:45,268
What?

528
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:48,908
Have you been so focused on talking about Su Bocong with Kong Shadi

529
00:34:48,908 --> 00:34:50,764
that you got careless.

530
00:34:50,764 --> 00:34:52,358
I didn't!

531
00:34:53,088 --> 00:34:54,768
I saw it myself.

532
00:34:57,198 --> 00:34:58,958
Childish.

533
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:00,398
Who are you calling childish?

534
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,848
Stop chasing me. I... I can't keep running. I can't.

535
00:35:02,848 --> 00:35:04,768
- That's the price for stealing my food.
 - Sorry.

536
00:35:06,318 --> 00:35:10,548
Oh, right! I solved the question from last night by myself.

537
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:12,368
Impressive.

538
00:35:12,368 --> 00:35:14,508
And what about the last function question?

539
00:35:16,128 --> 00:35:17,478
Don't take this too far.

540
00:35:17,478 --> 00:35:19,778
Why are you talking about studying since we are hanging out?

541
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:22,138
We didn't invite you to this conversation.

542
00:35:22,138 --> 00:35:23,808
I don't want to join you.

543
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:25,478
Come on, let's go watch the sunset.

544
00:35:34,188 --> 00:35:36,118
One second.

545
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:39,008
The last question from last night was not a function question.

546
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:40,848
It was about solid geometry.

547
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:46,525
What you are talking about is the 18th special exercise.

548
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,328
Our homework is the 18th mock.

549
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:54,158
Kong Shadi,

550
00:35:54,158 --> 00:35:56,478
did you remember the correct homework as I asked?

551
00:35:56,478 --> 00:35:58,338
Yes, the 18th.

552
00:35:58,338 --> 00:36:00,668
Right. 18th. But 18th what?

553
00:36:00,668 --> 00:36:03,768
What's your problem? There's only one 18th.

554
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:05,708
How ridiculous is he?

555
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,758
What are you doing? Where are you going? Aren't we going to watch the sunset?

556
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:10,362
We are going to a printing shop, My Lady. You got the homework wrong.

557
00:36:10,362 --> 00:36:12,242
School is starting the day after tomorrow, dude.

558
00:36:13,288 --> 00:36:14,885
Not that one.

559
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:15,894
The one from last year.

560
00:36:15,894 --> 00:36:17,394
That's right.

561
00:36:19,368 --> 00:36:21,128
Jiangsu University.

562
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:22,828
Thank you.

563
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:42,068
C.

564
00:36:42,908 --> 00:36:44,958
Because this and this added together

565
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,941
is 16.16 out of 3.

566
00:36:46,941 --> 00:36:48,720
That's why this is π and 16 out of 3.

567
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,553
Mark it here.

568
00:36:49,553 --> 00:36:51,328
Xianxian.

569
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:55,435
They are talking about dancing at the campfire. Are you joining us?

570
00:36:56,908 --> 00:36:57,948
Sure.

571
00:36:57,948 --> 00:36:59,328
Dancing by the campfire is nice.

572
00:37:00,528 --> 00:37:02,638
Let's go together.

573
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,638
Do you know how to do it?

574
00:37:04,678 --> 00:37:07,168
You can show me.

575
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:11,958
Senior, you don't mind that. Right?

576
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,488
Of course.

577
00:37:16,398 --> 00:37:18,038
Come on, let's go.

578
00:37:23,878 --> 00:37:25,968
Senior, come and dance.

579
00:37:28,048 --> 00:37:29,048
Leave us.

580
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:31,188
Have you had fun today?

581
00:37:31,188 --> 00:37:32,588
Yes.

582
00:37:33,848 --> 00:37:35,328
And this place is nice.

583
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,128
Come on, let's dance. Dance!

584
00:37:38,128 --> 00:37:39,555
Dance. Let's dance.

585
00:37:39,555 --> 00:37:41,055
Come on.

586
00:37:45,018 --> 00:37:46,518
How do we do this?

587
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:49,517
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

588
00:37:50,128 --> 00:37:52,058
Guys!

589
00:37:52,058 --> 00:37:53,328
We have a tradition here.

590
00:37:53,328 --> 00:37:55,158
By dancing around the campfire,

591
00:37:55,158 --> 00:37:57,708
our bond will be more intense.

592
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,708
So, let's all dance around the campfire together. What do you say?

593
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:02,128
 Great!

594
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:04,328
All right. Let's hold each other's hands.

595
00:38:04,328 --> 00:38:05,160
Hold hands. Come on.

596
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,904
Hold hands.

597
00:38:06,904 --> 00:38:07,904
Here.

598
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,320
Hey!

599
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:19,328
Come on, you two.

600
00:38:20,685 --> 00:38:22,268
Hold hands. Am I right?

601
00:38:22,268 --> 00:38:24,108
Yes!

602
00:39:21,878 --> 00:39:23,888
You can sing pretty well.

603
00:39:43,878 --> 00:39:45,558
What's this?

604
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:49,328
You lost your diary, right?

605
00:39:49,328 --> 00:39:50,568
So,

606
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:52,438
I built a website when I had the time.

607
00:39:53,678 --> 00:39:55,228
Something like a blog.

608
00:39:55,228 --> 00:39:56,988
But it's not connected to the internet.

609
00:39:56,988 --> 00:40:00,128
So, you can write down anything you want to say in it.

610
00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:01,888
No one can see it.

611
00:40:04,448 --> 00:40:06,248
That's impressive.

612
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:11,688
This is basic.

613
00:40:12,755 --> 00:40:15,535
Think of it as a reward for you doing well on the exam.

614
00:40:16,378 --> 00:40:19,378
I like it so much. Thanks.

615
00:40:26,988 --> 00:40:28,698
I lied...

616
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:31,628
back then.

617
00:40:33,718 --> 00:40:34,918
What?

618
00:40:35,594 --> 00:40:39,678
I told you that my dream was to get into a first-level university.

619
00:40:39,678 --> 00:40:42,118
But that's not what's on my mind.

620
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:45,888
I have been thinking about

621
00:40:45,918 --> 00:40:49,338
what kind of person I want to be

622
00:40:49,368 --> 00:40:51,578
or what dreams I have.

623
00:40:51,578 --> 00:40:56,028
After thinking about it for a long time, and I thought of you somehow.

624
00:41:04,438 --> 00:41:06,128
Don't take this the wrong way.

625
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:07,628
I...

626
00:41:08,238 --> 00:41:11,318
I just think that you are wonderful.

627
00:41:14,668 --> 00:41:16,788
You are doing great academically,

628
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,688
you care about others,

629
00:41:19,528 --> 00:41:21,668
and you are not afraid to take responsibility.

630
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:23,668
I suddenly realized that

631
00:41:23,668 --> 00:41:27,908
it would be great if I can become someone like you.

632
00:41:29,918 --> 00:41:32,698
So, my dream back then was to...

633
00:41:33,718 --> 00:41:36,128
become someone better.

634
00:41:37,468 --> 00:41:40,698
But you know me. I'm a slow learner.

635
00:41:41,268 --> 00:41:43,960
I don't know where to start.

636
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,918
And after putting some thought into it, I decided to do what you said,

637
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:48,628
which is to start with something small.

638
00:41:48,628 --> 00:41:51,560
Get better performance and then get into a good university.

639
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,608
I shouldn't give up painting, either.

640
00:41:53,608 --> 00:41:55,698
And if I ever have a chance...

641
00:42:00,188 --> 00:42:03,248
Do you also think I'm dumb?

642
00:42:04,128 --> 00:42:06,138
You are not dumb at all.

643
00:42:09,768 --> 00:42:11,258
You were right.

644
00:42:11,878 --> 00:42:14,088
To become someone better,

645
00:42:14,088 --> 00:42:16,198
you need to get to a bigger,

646
00:42:16,198 --> 00:42:17,438
grander place first.

647
00:42:18,398 --> 00:42:20,608
That's what I think anyway.

648
00:42:22,328 --> 00:42:26,078
Besides, you are already on your way.

649
00:42:26,808 --> 00:42:28,368
Look.

650
00:42:28,368 --> 00:42:31,028
You got a certificate in the painting competition,

651
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:32,608
and you improved your performance

652
00:42:32,608 --> 00:42:34,238
after you chose science class.

653
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:36,288
Now...

654
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:38,878
I also got to know you guys.

655
00:42:43,048 --> 00:42:45,808
I used to be introverted.

656
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:48,298
I didn't have any friends.

657
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:51,678
And I didn't know how to get along with people.

658
00:42:53,600 --> 00:43:03,000
Anyway, now I think it's great to have Ziqi, Shadi, and you around.

659
00:43:09,918 --> 00:43:12,138
You are wonderful as well.

660
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:46,060

661
00:43:48,281 --> 00:43:52,271
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

662
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:57,231
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

663
00:43:58,828 --> 00:44:03,014
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

664
00:44:03,014 --> 00:44:07,271
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

665
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:14,121
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

666
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:18,659
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

667
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:24,494
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

668
00:44:24,494 --> 00:44:27,571
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

669
00:44:28,668 --> 00:44:31,641
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

670
00:44:31,641 --> 00:44:34,334
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

671
00:44:34,334 --> 00:44:39,431
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

672
00:44:39,447 --> 00:44:42,204
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

673
00:44:42,204 --> 00:44:44,681
♫  After a long journey  ♫

674
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:49,171
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

675
00:45:10,497 --> 00:45:13,237
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

676
00:45:13,237 --> 00:45:16,111
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

677
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:20,454
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

678
00:45:21,217 --> 00:45:23,931
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

679
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:26,471
♫  After a long journey  ♫

680
00:45:26,471 --> 00:45:31,374
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
