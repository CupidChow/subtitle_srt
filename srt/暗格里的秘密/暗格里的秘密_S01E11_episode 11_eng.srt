1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080

2
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:18,713
♫  For whom will the summer slow down ♫

3
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:23,099
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:26,979
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:32,151
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:36,857
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,857 --> 00:00:40,506
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:47,465
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:54,461
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,858 --> 00:01:01,491
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,325
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:06,338
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,338 --> 00:01:09,691
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:14,917
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,905
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:20,357
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,357 --> 00:01:27,692
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:31,199

19
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:34,100

20
00:01:39,373 --> 00:01:41,260
I have an announcement.

21
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,530
The city is having a painting competition.

22
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,620
Each school needs to send several students to the competition.

23
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,900
- If anyone of you would like to sign up... 
 - Kong Shadi.

24
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,340
Come and get the application form right now.

25
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,210
Mr. Liu, Ding Xian can do it.

26
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,380
 Yeah, she's good at it.

27
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,400
 Mr. Liu, she can do it.

28
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,930
Come on.

29
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,350
What do you think, Ding Xian? Do you think you can do it?

30
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:26,113
Mom,

31
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:29,003
have you thought it through?

32
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
It's good.

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,903
But...

34
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:38,390
you are already at the last second of your second year.

35
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,030
I would never have stopped you at another time.

36
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,570
But we are at a critical time right now.

37
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,420
You have to focus on your studies right now.

38
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,880
Painting is just a hobby for you.

39
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,250
Don't waste your energy on that.

40
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,790
Okay, I got it.

41
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,550
Ding Xian,

42
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,703
I'm trying to have a good conversation. What's with that face?

43
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:05,300
You will not agree anyway.

44
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,340
Can you just talk?

45
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,570
I'm saying this for your sake.

46
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,610
Would I try to damage your interest?

47
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:19,498
Mom, have some water and calm down.

48
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:27,258
Is it your essay?

49
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:28,758
Let me see.

50
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:45,948
"My family."

51
00:03:49,852 --> 00:03:52,547
My family is always noisy.

52
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:54,258
My mom and my sister are quite alike.

53
00:03:54,258 --> 00:03:55,698
They are always angry.

54
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:58,528
Whenever things don't go their way, they will raise their voice in an instant.

55
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:01,091
"It feels like thunder, piercing through my ear."

56
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:05,968
Is this how you think of me?

57
00:04:06,928 --> 00:04:08,668
It feels like thunder...

58
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:10,440
You are good with metaphors.

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,540
Rewrite it.

60
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:19,048
Can't I tell the truth?

61
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:21,568
Dad,

62
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:23,948
I will never get married.

63
00:04:23,948 --> 00:04:25,898
What kind of nonsense is that?

64
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:28,438
I can relate.

65
00:04:29,128 --> 00:04:31,236
Go. Rewrite it.

66
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,060

67
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:45,668
What's there to hesitate about?

68
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:48,278
Come on, I'll go sign up with you.

69
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:50,281
What is it?

70
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,408
You two, talk to her.

71
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:55,948
She doesn't want to sign up for the painting competition.

72
00:04:55,998 --> 00:05:00,068
I heard that Yang Chunzi has signed up.

73
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:02,408
What is it, Little Monster? Are you afraid?

74
00:05:02,408 --> 00:05:03,843
It's the heart that matters.

75
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:07,248
Never mind. Let me think about it.

76
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:09,068
The class is beginning.

77
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:11,450
Don't be afraid.

78
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,430
- Hey! 
 - Hey!

79
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,398
- Oh no! 
 - Sit tight.

80
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:31,898
Dad, why are you dressed like that?

81
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:34,568
Dad did something great this time.

82
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,848
Listen. Follow my lead later.

83
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:38,960
Ding Wencheng.

84
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,128
How do I look?

85
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:42,958
Great. Just great.

86
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:45,344
- Nice. 
 - Is the lipstick too bright?

87
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,448
Is it? I don't think so.

88
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:48,568
Xianxian, what do you say?

89
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:49,648
Doesn't your mom look nice?

90
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:52,388
Yes, she does.

91
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:55,278
Mom, the lipstick color is so nice.

92
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:59,087
Where are you going dressed like this?

93
00:05:59,087 --> 00:06:01,058
Your dad wants to be hip.

94
00:06:01,058 --> 00:06:03,668
He's taking me to a concert and a fancy dinner.

95
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:05,938
I've never been to places like that before.

96
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:09,688
We should try the classic life once in a while.

97
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:11,968
Your mom and I can take Juncong

98
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:13,968
to uplift his mind and spirit in the meantime.

99
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:17,017
People say that good habits are formed in childhood.

100
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:18,988
Xianxian, watch the apartment.

101
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:21,658
Don't worry, I'm not a kid anymore.

102
00:06:21,658 --> 00:06:22,820
Right.

103
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,128
Ding Juncong!

104
00:06:24,128 --> 00:06:26,048
Ding Juncong, hurry up!

105
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:30,728
Juncong, come on. Let's go.

106
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:32,568
What is it?

107
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:33,826
What are you doing?

108
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:36,448
What?

109
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:38,938
I'm not going. I want to watch cartoons at home.

110
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:41,768
Why would you do that? You have no ambition at all.

111
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,060
Your dad went through so much trouble to get the tickets.

112
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,598
That's right. The ticket is so expensive. You have to go.

113
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:48,007
Yeah, the concert would be excellent.

114
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,780
If I didn't have to do homework at home, I would love to go.

115
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,120
Then why don't you?

116
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,153
Suit yourself. I'm not going.

117
00:06:54,153 --> 00:06:56,663
Then don't go. You are so spoiled.

118
00:06:57,665 --> 00:06:59,008
Ding Xian, keep him under check.

119
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:01,268
Make him do his homework, and I will check it when I get home.

120
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:03,288
Come on, let's go.

121
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:06,668
Dad.

122
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:09,588
I can only help you this much.

123
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:10,878
Ding Wencheng.

124
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:12,278
Hurry up!

125
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:24,007
Hello?

126
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:26,088
Come down. I'm taking you to the venue.

127
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:28,248
 I don't think I can go.

128
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,680
What?

129
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:32,768
What do you mean by that?

130
00:07:33,604 --> 00:07:34,904
Okay.

131
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,815
Hello?

132
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:43,829
You two should get here now.

133
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,197
Do you want it?

134
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:53,758
Leave it there.

135
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:55,358
All right.

136
00:07:58,398 --> 00:07:59,898
Old little brother,

137
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:02,030
the weather is great today.

138
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,768
Don't you want to go out?

139
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:04,768
No.

140
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,278
Mom and Dad are finally out today.

141
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:12,278
Haven't you been wanting to go to the game room?

142
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:14,524
You can go now. I'll keep it a secret for you.

143
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,318
Don't treat me like I'm clueless.

144
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:21,528
I'm not going. I just won't. What can you do?

145
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:31,328
Hi.

146
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:32,760
What are you doing here?

147
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,408
We're here to babysit for you. Just relax and go to the competition.

148
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:37,840
I'm the boss of the childrenat Shenhai High School.

149
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,528
Just head downstairs.

150
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:40,701
My brother is really...

151
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:42,960
Don't hesitate. Take your things and go.

152
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,518
- My brother... 
 - Go!

153
00:08:44,518 --> 00:08:45,518
Come on!

154
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:49,918
Buddy,

155
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:54,668
why don't you hang out with me today?

156
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,548
What are you playing?

157
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:01,848
Stop snooping around.

158
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:04,057
This kid!

159
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:06,797
It doesn't hurt even if I look.

160
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:10,941
Handsome, what are you playing?

161
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:12,485
Can I see it?

162
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,611
Sure.

163
00:09:13,611 --> 00:09:16,261
Why don't you hang out with me today?

164
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:17,840
Okay.

165
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,480
Tell me how to play it.

166
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,968
Okay.

167
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:23,755
This is my favorite game.

168
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:25,618
Wen is a flying flag.

169
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,768
Isn't that Jiang Chen's vehicle?

170
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:32,768
Hop on.

171
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:36,041
Put on your helmet.

172
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:39,658
Are you ready?

173
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:42,818
We have successfully escaped!

174
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:49,008
Where is my motorbike?

175
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,230

176
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:07,138
Jiang Chen, are you taking me out for a ride on that?

177
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:10,268
That's right.

178
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:12,768
Look.

179
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:13,848
The weather is great today,

180
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:18,798
and you would look good on this yellow bike.

181
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,604
Come on.

182
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:22,222
I'm not going. It's embarrassing.

183
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,528
You are a nice-looking girl.

184
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:27,254
But why are you so picky?

185
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:28,568
Hop on.

186
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:29,928
I'm leaving if you are not coming.

187
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:32,721
Who's being picky?

188
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:34,441
I'll get on.

189
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:40,510
I'm going to be late.

190
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:43,364
- Go ahead. 
 - See you later.

191
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:50,838
Ding Xian.

192
00:10:52,024 --> 00:10:54,024
Fighting!

193
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,788
 We've prepared three themes for the competition.

194
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:16,038
 All candidates should pick one among youth, family, fight for the future,

195
00:11:16,038 --> 00:11:18,618
 and do a piece about the theme you picked.

196
00:11:35,722 --> 00:11:37,854

197
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:39,614
What was your painting about?

198
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,808
It's a secret.

199
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:45,808
Whatever.

200
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:50,818
With your skill, you will get a certificate or something.

201
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,618
The result doesn't matter.

202
00:11:55,888 --> 00:12:01,545
I suddenly understood what you said to me before in the competition.

203
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,988
You said that there are things that may look ordinary,

204
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:15,718
but they would mean something when they come together.

205
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:19,928
Now I feel like painting is no longer

206
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:23,558
just a hobby for me.

207
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,458
Anyway,

208
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,588
thank you for what happened today.

209
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,218
Play!

210
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,720
Smash and scored!

211
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,358
5 points for Ding Juncong! Victory! You lost!

212
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,648
Ding Juncong!

213
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:55,398
He's not an elementary school student! He's the devil walking amongst men.

214
00:12:55,398 --> 00:12:57,058
I don't care, do my homework.

215
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:59,648
Or I'll tell Mom about this.

216
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:01,118
Mom.

217
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:02,988
What time is it now?

218
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,875
Oh, no. My mom is about to be home.

219
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,612
What should we do?

220
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:15,220
I'll help you with your homework.

221
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,410
Come on, clean this place up.

222
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:22,548
- Which part? 
 - Here.

223
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,617
There's a crowd.

224
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:42,588
Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

225
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,174
You guys are...

226
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:47,228
We are in the same study group.

227
00:13:47,228 --> 00:13:49,938
Zhou Siyue is tutoring Ding Juncong for his homework.

228
00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:51,569
Yes, Auntie.

229
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:53,478
Great. That's great.

230
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:55,738
Come on. Let me see your homework.

231
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,648
Not bad.

232
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:06,588
You've got them all today.

233
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,038
How did you solve this one here?

234
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,188
This one...

235
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,458
Didn't Siyue just teach you?

236
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,868
- This one... 
 - Did you forget?

237
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,671
I knew you would forget right away.

238
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:29,558
You have so many people here tutoring you,

239
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:32,648
you should grab the chance and learn from them.

240
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:36,495
Copy this question to your error notebook later and do it again.

241
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,358
You guys are all here. I'll go make some food for you.

242
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:40,478
Wait here.

243
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:42,459
- No. It's okay, Auntie. 
 - Uncle, we should leave now.

244
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:44,828
- See you, Uncle. 
 - Auntie, see you.

245
00:14:44,828 --> 00:14:47,098
My mom called me.

246
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,028
How did it go?

247
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,718
You should watch out this week.

248
00:15:07,718 --> 00:15:10,028
Beware of the words of the villain.

249
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:11,238
Who's the villain?

250
00:15:11,238 --> 00:15:13,038
Who is it?

251
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,358
Ding Xian.

252
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:18,248
Come to my office.

253
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,209
Did you do something this time?

254
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,258
No, I didn't.

255
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,261
Is it really so accurate?

256
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,601
Are you all right?

257
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,518
Did he scold you?

258
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,677
It's okay.

259
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,990

260
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,558
Did you see a ghost or something?

261
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:56,678
Xianxian, you are impressive.

262
00:15:56,678 --> 00:15:59,158
You really are my little painter.

263
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,018
Look! Xian got first place.

264
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,028
Not bad, Little Monster.

265
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:07,110
- That's brilliant, Ding Xian. 
 - Give it back!

266
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,870
Oops!

267
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,138
You guys are acting crazy.

268
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,458
Can you act a little more mature?

269
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,634
Are you all right?

270
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:16,434
I'm fine.

271
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,780

272
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,768
And a marinated egg.

273
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,138
Come on. Little Monster is treating today.

274
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,220
I'm going to order things that I don't usually order. And I want the expensive ones.

275
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,840
Why are you always trying to take advantage of people?

276
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,308
It's my plan to thank you all today.

277
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:58,840
Without you, I wouldn't have been able to even go to the competition.

278
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,078
Brother Song is right. I would also like to order more food.

279
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,220
Go ahead.

280
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,150
Haven't you ordered enough?

281
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:08,048
Can't I?

282
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:10,593
It's okay. Order anything you want.

283
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:13,708
Would we be able to finish all that food?

284
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,628
You are all acting like beasts.

285
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:18,258
Of course, we can.

286
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:20,118
You've been acting as if you starved to death in your last life.

287
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:22,778
Your food expense has set us back recently.

288
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,538
Did you have another spat with your dad?

289
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:32,527
What is it this time?

290
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:35,078
Things are a little different this time.

291
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:37,960
It's a little serious. It's just that I want to...

292
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,520
He wants to join the army, and his dad won't let him no matter what.

293
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,378
Are you the only one who can talk?

294
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:45,711
You are going to say it anyway.

295
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,268
I'm going to order more food.

296
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:55,138
Dude, I got the menu. You are...

297
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,468
Don't try to persuade me.

298
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:11,398
I've thought this through.

299
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,118
I'm not trying to persuade you.

300
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,958
You told me that you wanted to join the army when you were eight.

301
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,188
Did you forget that?

302
00:18:20,188 --> 00:18:23,748
I told you that if you join the army,

303
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:26,178
I will join the national defense research.

304
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:30,608
Then, we will be protecting our country together.

305
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,668
How could I forget that?

306
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:38,008
No backing off from that.

307
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:39,768
It's a promise, then.

308
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:41,568
It's a promise.

309
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,361
Don't worry.

310
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:48,368
We are all here.

311
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,228
There's not too much food here.

312
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:56,128
Why don't we go back?

313
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,828
Everyone has a dream.

314
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:01,898
My dream is to be a pilot.

315
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,138
If you can be a pilot, I'll become a flight attendant.

316
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:06,278
I'll graduate sooner.

317
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,168
I'll start sooner.

318
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:10,658
Right. The clumsy bird should start sooner.

319
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:12,448
Who are you calling a clumsy bird?

320
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:15,108
That's me. I am.

321
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,105
Xianxian, how about you? What do you want to do?

322
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:25,868
Have you finished ordering?

323
00:19:25,868 --> 00:19:27,688
I'm going to take it to the owner, if you are done.

324
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:28,620
Owner!

325
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,400
Coming.

326
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,648
I want... Yes, these.

327
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:35,248
All right!

328
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,618
- Have you ordered toast? 
 - Yes.

329
00:19:38,618 --> 00:19:40,118
We did.

330
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,388
 Right.

331
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,418
 What is my dream?

332
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,698
Isn't his dad in the military?

333
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,278
Why won't he support him?

334
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,548
Jiang Chen has always had a conflict with his dad.

335
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:09,948
He always does the opposite of what his dad says.

336
00:20:09,948 --> 00:20:14,490
That's why his dad thinks he doesn't have what it takes to join the military.

337
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:17,568
And you don't know Jiang Chen very well.

338
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:19,048
That guy...

339
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:22,878
will never give in to his dad if he sets his mind to it.

340
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,728
What are you thinking about?

341
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,618
Everyone has a dream or a target.

342
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:38,608
That's impressive.

343
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,208
Didn't you just get first place?

344
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,668
Why would you think so much?

345
00:20:43,668 --> 00:20:47,428
Painting is a hobby of mine at most.

346
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:52,308
Shouldn't one's dream be big and powerful?

347
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,358
All dreams start from hobbies.

348
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:04,588
And I believe that you can do anything if you want to.

349
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,688
 Hobby.

350
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:16,018
 I want to be a painter.

351
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,838
This is not that simple.

352
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,168
 Ding Xian, why aren't you sleeping?

353
00:21:37,168 --> 00:21:39,238
I'm going to.

354
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:55,568
Are you all right?

355
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:59,358
I wouldn't have stayed up late if I knew this would happen.

356
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:02,168
Why do I feel like you are passing out?

357
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:03,958
That's nonsense.

358
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:06,071
How could you possibly understand the torture of that time of the month?

359
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:08,188
Don't. I have no desire to understand that.

360
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:09,928
This is torturing.

361
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,238
Maybe you should skip PE class.

362
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:17,638
Where did you get that?

363
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,878
The infirmary.

364
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:24,808
- Let's go. 
 - Come on.

365
00:22:24,808 --> 00:22:27,120
Xianxian, I'm going to leave now.

366
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,908
You are awake.

367
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:35,468
What are you doing back here?

368
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:38,198
It's too hot outside.

369
00:23:38,198 --> 00:23:40,138
I don't want to join the class.

370
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:54,308
Zhou Siyue,

371
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:58,098
have you always wanted to go to Huaqing?

372
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:02,418
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

373
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:06,228
After you told me about it the other day,

374
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:09,248
I've been thinking about it myself.

375
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:13,108
You said that dreams start with hobbies.

376
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:16,538
And since I like painting,

377
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:19,818
I should be a painter.

378
00:24:20,508 --> 00:24:22,208
But...

379
00:24:22,218 --> 00:24:25,888
I've never learned to paint systematically.

380
00:24:27,018 --> 00:24:30,418
I can't just do whatever comes to my mind.

381
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:38,258
What's with that smile?

382
00:24:38,258 --> 00:24:41,618
I'm seriously thinking about this.

383
00:24:42,258 --> 00:24:44,038
I shouldn't have.

384
00:24:47,838 --> 00:24:52,208
Actually, I think it's good to be realistic.

385
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,688
For example.

386
00:24:55,478 --> 00:24:57,758
I've always wanted to join Huaqing...

387
00:24:58,568 --> 00:25:03,358
only because I wanted to go to a bigger place...

388
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:07,808
and see how far I can go.

389
00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:12,278
Is that all?

390
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,508
That's all.

391
00:25:19,838 --> 00:25:21,338
Dreams...

392
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:24,118
and targets...

393
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:31,688
are just giving us the power to keep going.

394
00:25:33,318 --> 00:25:34,918
So,

395
00:25:36,358 --> 00:25:40,058
can I call it a dream if I want to do better in exams?

396
00:25:43,258 --> 00:25:45,968
Why are you smiling this time?

397
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,688
I just want to say...

398
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:54,668
that your dream could be a little bigger.

399
00:26:00,135 --> 00:26:02,795
Then, getting into a first-level university.

400
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:07,278
I have to take the first step.

401
00:26:07,908 --> 00:26:13,158
Everyone thinks that I should settle with a basic university.

402
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:18,858
But I thought about it,

403
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:22,268
and I can't accept that.

404
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,838
I can get into a first-level university.

405
00:26:25,838 --> 00:26:27,615
Okay.

406
00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:29,815
I'll help you.

407
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:48,791
You should take a nap.

408
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:51,978
I'll explain the questions to you when you wake up.

409
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:55,035
You will feel dizzy and confused if we do that now.

410
00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:56,975
You won't remember anything.

411
00:26:59,888 --> 00:27:02,088
Sleep now.

412
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:31,695
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

413
00:27:31,743 --> 00:27:35,355
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

414
00:27:36,952 --> 00:27:41,238
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

415
00:27:41,238 --> 00:27:46,483
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

416
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:52,345
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

417
00:27:52,345 --> 00:27:56,839
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

418
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:02,618
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

419
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:06,995
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

420
00:28:06,995 --> 00:28:09,965
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

421
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:12,558
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

422
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:17,755
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

423
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:20,428
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

424
00:28:20,428 --> 00:28:23,105
♫  After a long journey  ♫

425
00:28:23,105 --> 00:28:27,595
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

426
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:35,964
♫  Turns out time can be so magical  ♫

427
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:40,344
♫  Looking forward to seeing you  ♫

428
00:28:42,161 --> 00:28:46,112
♫  Wishing time could stop at this moment  ♫

429
00:28:46,112 --> 00:28:50,688
♫  Nothing can take away our love  ♫

430
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:57,516
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

431
00:28:57,516 --> 00:29:01,895

♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

432
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:05,288
Zhang Haojie.

433
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:07,718
Tang Jiamin.

434
00:29:07,718 --> 00:29:09,198
Sounds like you did well on the test.

435
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:11,918
Safe.

436
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,768
You won't get bad grades with my tutoring.

437
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:20,228
Our class ranked first

438
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:22,508
in the whole second year.

439
00:29:26,018 --> 00:29:27,418
But...

440
00:29:28,118 --> 00:29:31,438
I can see someone has already grown proud.

441
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,128
Song Ziqi!

442
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:36,718
You are not about to join the senior year.

443
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:38,218
You are seniors now.

444
00:29:38,218 --> 00:29:39,478
Xianxian.

445
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:42,528
We will start the extra sessions right after summer vacation.

446
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,118
 Don't forget about camping.

447
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:45,708
 This is the last time we go big before senior year.

448
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:49,438
Don't play too hard and put your mind on learning.

449
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:50,638
Do you understand?

450
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:54,118
I'm back.

451
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:57,048
Xianxian, look who's here.

452
00:29:57,048 --> 00:29:58,238
Xianxian.

453
00:29:58,238 --> 00:29:59,638
Senior Brother!

454
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:02,068
Why are you here?

455
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:04,978
It's vacation time. I'm here to visit you. How have you been?

456
00:30:04,978 --> 00:30:06,778
I'm good.

457
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:11,718
Mom,

458
00:30:11,718 --> 00:30:13,358
I want to ask you something.

459
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:19,338
Kong Shadi asked me if I could hang out with her next weekend.

460
00:30:19,338 --> 00:30:23,071
- I want to ask... 
 - No.

461
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,828
Mom, this is the last summer vacation.

462
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:28,768
I said no because this is the last summer vacation.

463
00:30:33,008 --> 00:30:34,598
Where are you going?

464
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:36,838
We agreed that we will go camping.

465
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:40,568
The camp beside the museum.

466
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:47,368
Auntie, this is the last vacation.

467
00:30:47,368 --> 00:30:48,614
The pressure in Shenhai High School is huge.

468
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:51,114
It's good to let off some steam at this point.

469
00:30:51,138 --> 00:30:54,978
I also went out back then. It didn't affect me.

470
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,148
You are one thing, and Xianxian is...

471
00:30:58,948 --> 00:31:02,078
I'm also going there with several peers from the university.

472
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:04,718
We could watch over them. That should put your mind at ease.

473
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:08,958
Mom, just let me go.

474
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:11,338
This summer vacation is the last time I can go out.

475
00:31:12,408 --> 00:31:13,938
Mom!

476
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:16,318
All right! All right!

477
00:31:16,318 --> 00:31:17,884
But there's one condition.

478
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:19,598
You will focus on learning afterward.

479
00:31:19,598 --> 00:31:21,688
I promise.

480
00:31:21,688 --> 00:31:23,078
Thanks, Mom.

481
00:31:23,078 --> 00:31:25,198
Okay. You two keep talking. I'll go prepare some food.

482
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:32,558
Auntie, let me help you.

483
00:31:35,378 --> 00:31:37,198
 I'm so excited.

484
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:40,388
 The last summer.

485
00:31:50,288 --> 00:31:51,888
Senior Brother!

486
00:31:53,068 --> 00:31:54,768
Xianxian.

487
00:31:56,098 --> 00:31:57,958
He looks so handsome.

488
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,218
He's looking better after graduation.

489
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,958
You've brought a lot of things.

490
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:09,308
Senior,

491
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:11,368
I've heard so much about you.

492
00:32:12,438 --> 00:32:14,398
You are Zhou Siyue, right?

493
00:32:14,408 --> 00:32:15,758
I know.

494
00:32:15,758 --> 00:32:17,618
I grew up with Xianxian.

495
00:32:17,618 --> 00:32:19,678
She mentioned you before.

496
00:32:24,118 --> 00:32:26,008
This is the devil's arena. Let's leave now.

497
00:32:26,008 --> 00:32:28,068
Don't get involved here! Let's go!

498
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,898
Senior Brother, where should I leave this?

499
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:37,651
You guys are over there. I'll get it there for you.

500
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:39,018
It's okay.

501
00:32:39,018 --> 00:32:40,918
I got this.

502
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,808
Come on.

503
00:32:46,502 --> 00:32:47,468
Xianxian,

504
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:50,118
we will have dinner at the campfire. Care to join us?

505
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:51,838
Sure.

506
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:54,148
Let's all go together.

507
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,908
Then, you guys get ready.

508
00:32:58,908 --> 00:33:01,388
- I'll come back for you. 
 - All right.

509
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:02,288
Go.

510
00:33:04,598 --> 00:33:06,198
See you, Senior Brother.

511
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,038
Let's go.

512
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,808
Come on.

513
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,920
Hey.

514
00:33:40,528 --> 00:33:43,838
Why do I feel that Senior is getting more handsome?

515
00:33:46,168 --> 00:33:48,368
I don't see any change in him.

516
00:33:50,218 --> 00:33:53,928
It's probably because you grew up with him. You are used to him.

517
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:57,468
Anyway, I think he has become more handsome after going to university.

518
00:33:58,318 --> 00:34:01,358
So, would you like to go introduce yourself?

519
00:34:02,168 --> 00:34:05,688
It would be awkward if I go introduce myself.

520
00:34:05,688 --> 00:34:08,198
Why don't you introduce me?

521
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:16,398
As long as Senior is around, even the air tastes sweet.

522
00:34:22,008 --> 00:34:23,158
Song Ziqi!

523
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:24,534
Why are you grabbing my food?

524
00:34:24,534 --> 00:34:26,954
It's too late. That's the cost of you leching over a boy. Don't grab me.

525
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:32,428
This is not so good.

526
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:35,768
Why are you also stealing food?

527
00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:37,268
What?

528
00:34:37,268 --> 00:34:40,908
Have you been so focused on talking about Su Bocong with Kong Shadi

529
00:34:40,908 --> 00:34:42,764
that you got careless.

530
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:44,358
I didn't!

531
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:46,768
I saw it myself.

532
00:34:49,198 --> 00:34:50,958
Childish.

533
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,398
Who are you calling childish?

534
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:54,848
Stop chasing me. I... I can't keep running. I can't.

535
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,768
- That's the price for stealing my food. 
 - Sorry.

536
00:34:58,318 --> 00:35:02,548
Oh, right! I solved the question from last night by myself.

537
00:35:02,548 --> 00:35:04,368
Impressive.

538
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,508
And what about the last function question?

539
00:35:08,128 --> 00:35:09,478
Don't take this too far.

540
00:35:09,478 --> 00:35:11,778
Why are you talking about studying since we are hanging out?

541
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:14,138
We didn't invite you to this conversation.

542
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:15,808
I don't want to join you.

543
00:35:15,808 --> 00:35:17,478
Come on, let's go watch the sunset.

544
00:35:26,188 --> 00:35:28,118
One second.

545
00:35:28,118 --> 00:35:31,008
The last question from last night was not a function question.

546
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:32,848
It was about solid geometry.

547
00:35:34,848 --> 00:35:38,525
What you are talking about is the 18th special exercise.

548
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:41,328
Our homework is the 18th mock.

549
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:46,158
Kong Shadi,

550
00:35:46,158 --> 00:35:48,478
did you remember the correct homework as I asked?

551
00:35:48,478 --> 00:35:50,338
Yes, the 18th.

552
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:52,668
Right. 18th. But 18th what?

553
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:55,768
What's your problem? There's only one 18th.

554
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:57,708
How ridiculous is he?

555
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:59,758
What are you doing? Where are you going? Aren't we going to watch the sunset?

556
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:02,362
We are going to a printing shop, My Lady. You got the homework wrong.

557
00:36:02,362 --> 00:36:04,242
School is starting the day after tomorrow, dude.

558
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,885
Not that one.

559
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:07,894
The one from last year.

560
00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:09,394
That's right.

561
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:13,128
Jiangsu University.

562
00:36:13,128 --> 00:36:14,828
Thank you.

563
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:34,068
C.

564
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:36,958
Because this and this added together

565
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:38,941
is 16.16 out of 3.

566
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:40,720
That's why this is π and 16 out of 3.

567
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,553
Mark it here.

568
00:36:41,553 --> 00:36:43,328
Xianxian.

569
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:47,435
They are talking about dancing at the campfire. Are you joining us?

570
00:36:48,908 --> 00:36:49,948
Sure.

571
00:36:49,948 --> 00:36:51,328
Dancing by the campfire is nice.

572
00:36:52,528 --> 00:36:54,638
Let's go together.

573
00:36:54,638 --> 00:36:56,638
Do you know how to do it?

574
00:36:56,678 --> 00:36:59,168
You can show me.

575
00:37:00,608 --> 00:37:03,958
Senior, you don't mind that. Right?

576
00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:06,488
Of course.

577
00:37:08,398 --> 00:37:10,038
Come on, let's go.

578
00:37:15,878 --> 00:37:17,968
Senior, come and dance.

579
00:37:20,048 --> 00:37:21,048
Leave us.

580
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:23,188
Have you had fun today?

581
00:37:23,188 --> 00:37:24,588
Yes.

582
00:37:25,848 --> 00:37:27,328
And this place is nice.

583
00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:30,128
Come on, let's dance. Dance!

584
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:31,555
Dance. Let's dance.

585
00:37:31,555 --> 00:37:33,055
Come on.

586
00:37:37,018 --> 00:37:38,518
How do we do this?

587
00:37:39,997 --> 00:37:41,517
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

588
00:37:42,128 --> 00:37:44,058
Guys!

589
00:37:44,058 --> 00:37:45,328
We have a tradition here.

590
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:47,158
By dancing around the campfire,

591
00:37:47,158 --> 00:37:49,708
our bond will be more intense.

592
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:52,708
So, let's all dance around the campfire together. What do you say?

593
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,128
 Great!

594
00:37:54,128 --> 00:37:56,328
All right. Let's hold each other's hands.

595
00:37:56,328 --> 00:37:57,160
Hold hands. Come on.

596
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,904
Hold hands.

597
00:37:58,904 --> 00:37:59,904
Here.

598
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,320
Hey!

599
00:38:10,328 --> 00:38:11,328
Come on, you two.

600
00:38:12,685 --> 00:38:14,268
Hold hands. Am I right?

601
00:38:14,268 --> 00:38:16,108
Yes!

602
00:39:13,878 --> 00:39:15,888
You can sing pretty well.

603
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:37,558
What's this?

604
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:41,328
You lost your diary, right?

605
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:42,568
So,

606
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:44,438
I built a website when I had the time.

607
00:39:45,678 --> 00:39:47,228
Something like a blog.

608
00:39:47,228 --> 00:39:48,988
But it's not connected to the internet.

609
00:39:48,988 --> 00:39:52,128
So, you can write down anything you want to say in it.

610
00:39:52,128 --> 00:39:53,888
No one can see it.

611
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:58,248
That's impressive.

612
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:03,688
This is basic.

613
00:40:04,755 --> 00:40:07,535
Think of it as a reward for you doing well on the exam.

614
00:40:08,378 --> 00:40:11,378
I like it so much. Thanks.

615
00:40:18,988 --> 00:40:20,698
I lied...

616
00:40:21,768 --> 00:40:23,628
back then.

617
00:40:25,718 --> 00:40:26,918
What?

618
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:31,678
I told you that my dream was to get into a first-level university.

619
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:34,118
But that's not what's on my mind.

620
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:37,888
I have been thinking about

621
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:41,338
what kind of person I want to be

622
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:43,578
or what dreams I have.

623
00:40:43,578 --> 00:40:48,028
After thinking about it for a long time, and I thought of you somehow.

624
00:40:56,438 --> 00:40:58,128
Don't take this the wrong way.

625
00:40:58,128 --> 00:40:59,628
I...

626
00:41:00,238 --> 00:41:03,318
I just think that you are wonderful.

627
00:41:06,668 --> 00:41:08,788
You are doing great academically,

628
00:41:08,808 --> 00:41:10,688
you care about others,

629
00:41:11,528 --> 00:41:13,668
and you are not afraid to take responsibility.

630
00:41:13,668 --> 00:41:15,668
I suddenly realized that

631
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:19,908
it would be great if I can become someone like you.

632
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:24,698
So, my dream back then was to...

633
00:41:25,718 --> 00:41:28,128
become someone better.

634
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:32,698
But you know me. I'm a slow learner.

635
00:41:33,268 --> 00:41:35,960
I don't know where to start.

636
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,918
And after putting some thought into it, I decided to do what you said,

637
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:40,628
which is to start with something small.

638
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:43,560
Get better performance and then get into a good university.

639
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,608
I shouldn't give up painting, either.

640
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:47,698
And if I ever have a chance...

641
00:41:52,188 --> 00:41:55,248
Do you also think I'm dumb?

642
00:41:56,128 --> 00:41:58,138
You are not dumb at all.

643
00:42:01,768 --> 00:42:03,258
You were right.

644
00:42:03,878 --> 00:42:06,088
To become someone better,

645
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:08,198
you need to get to a bigger,

646
00:42:08,198 --> 00:42:09,438
grander place first.

647
00:42:10,398 --> 00:42:12,608
That's what I think anyway.

648
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:18,078
Besides, you are already on your way.

649
00:42:18,808 --> 00:42:20,368
Look.

650
00:42:20,368 --> 00:42:23,028
You got a certificate in the painting competition,

651
00:42:23,028 --> 00:42:24,608
and you improved your performance

652
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,238
after you chose science class.

653
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,288
Now...

654
00:42:28,288 --> 00:42:30,878
I also got to know you guys.

655
00:42:35,048 --> 00:42:37,808
I used to be introverted.

656
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:40,298
I didn't have any friends.

657
00:42:40,298 --> 00:42:43,678
And I didn't know how to get along with people.

658
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:55,000
Anyway, now I think it's great to have Ziqi, Shadi, and you around.

659
00:43:01,918 --> 00:43:04,138
You are wonderful as well.

660
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:38,060

661
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:44,271
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

662
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:49,231
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

663
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:55,014
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

664
00:43:55,014 --> 00:43:59,271
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

665
00:44:00,259 --> 00:44:06,121
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

666
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:10,659
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

667
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:16,494
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

668
00:44:16,494 --> 00:44:19,571
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

669
00:44:20,668 --> 00:44:23,641
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

670
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:26,334
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

671
00:44:26,334 --> 00:44:31,431
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

672
00:44:31,447 --> 00:44:34,204
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

673
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,681
♫  After a long journey  ♫

674
00:44:36,681 --> 00:44:41,171
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

675
00:45:02,497 --> 00:45:05,237
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

676
00:45:05,237 --> 00:45:08,111
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

677
00:45:08,111 --> 00:45:12,454
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

678
00:45:13,217 --> 00:45:15,931
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

679
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:18,471
♫  After a long journey  ♫

680
00:45:18,471 --> 00:45:23,374
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
