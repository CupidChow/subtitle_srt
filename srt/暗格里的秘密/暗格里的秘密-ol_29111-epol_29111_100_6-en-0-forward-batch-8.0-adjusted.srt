1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,770

2
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:26,613
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:31,072
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,979
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:40,051
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:44,757
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:44,757 --> 00:00:48,406
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:55,465
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:55,465 --> 00:01:03,861
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:09,591
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:12,225
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:14,338
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:14,338 --> 00:01:17,691
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:22,917
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:25,905
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:28,324
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:28,324 --> 00:01:35,628
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:39,508

19
00:01:40,276 --> 00:01:42,189

20
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,150
Okay.

21
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:54,283
Ding Xian, come on!

22
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,070
Dude, how many have I done?

23
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,290
Come on, Ding Xian!

24
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:11,745
Were you counting or not?

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,920
If you are done with the physical fitness test, it's your free activity time.

26
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,158
Come on, let's split teams.

27
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:33,728
Here. I'm first.

28
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:35,558
Pass it to me.

29
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:38,938
Ding Xian, are you tired?

30
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:40,838
No. I feel fine.

31
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:44,488
You guys play.

32
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:46,700
What?

33
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,758
Are you quitting now?

34
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:49,008
Never mind. Ignore him. Let's play.

35
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:50,678
Come on.

36
00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:51,907
Pass me the ball!

37
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:56,521
 I have an announcement before school is over.

38
00:02:56,521 --> 00:03:00,088
Sports Day is next month.

39
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:05,485
You are always so reluctant to switch your PE classes with math classes.

40
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:09,708
Now it's time for you to show your enthusiasm for PE.

41
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,728
I'm not asking a lot.

42
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:16,324
I'm good as long as I can see someone from our class in every sport.

43
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:18,719
And it would be great if you can get medals.

44
00:03:18,724 --> 00:03:20,962
Song Ziqi, you are the Sports Representative.

45
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:25,317
Make a list of participants and leave it on my desk in two days.

46
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:26,367
All right, Mr. Liu.

47
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:27,667
School is over.

48
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:31,517
So?

49
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:33,157
Why don't I sign you up for the shot put?

50
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:37,436
Song Ziqi, what's wrong with you?

51
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:39,007
Why are you cursing me?

52
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:41,007
I think you can make our class look good.

53
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:42,827
You always punch me hard.

54
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:44,997
Maybe you can get a medal for us.

55
00:03:44,997 --> 00:03:47,227
Think about it.

56
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:54,427
Little Monster!

57
00:03:56,347 --> 00:03:57,497
Never mind.

58
00:03:57,497 --> 00:04:00,457
You don't look like someone who's good at sports at all.

59
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,647
Siyue!

60
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:04,541
Why don't you sign up for long-distance?

61
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,697
Whatever you like.

62
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:07,317
Whatever I like. All right.

63
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:10,107
I'll sign you up for short-distance,

64
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:12,396
shot put, high jump, and long jump.

65
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:19,727
I mean, do we have other entertainment other than games?

66
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,077
What can we do?

67
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:22,631
We can play basketball and pool.

68
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:25,340
We agreed that you would give me several shots ahead during our basketball game last time.

69
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,076
When are you going to do that?

70
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:28,756
When can I get those shots?

71
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:35,407
Ding Xian, do you still remember me?

72
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:36,557
You Keke.

73
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:38,867
I have something for you.

74
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:44,877
Bring this to Zhou Siyue tomorrow.

75
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:46,583
I... Or...

76
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,487
I spent the whole morning making this.

77
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:49,747
Don't break it.

78
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,247
Thank you.

79
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:56,437
Why am I the one doing this again?

80
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:25,325

81
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,020

82
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:46,737
I bought it on the way.

83
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:49,997
Thank you, I'll pass.

84
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,437
I read your letter.

85
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:01,997
And I'll forgive you.

86
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:09,117
I didn't write that.

87
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,227
You are still trying to deny it.

88
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:16,617
You Keke from Class 10 gave you that letter.

89
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:38,345
What about this?

90
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:41,924
This one...

91
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,736
Come with me.

92
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,247
The class is beginning.

93
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:54,047
Come!

94
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:13,300
You are delivering letters and gifts.

95
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:15,813
Are you a courier?

96
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:18,877
I was just doing someone a favor.

97
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:20,857
Can't you say no?

98
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:34,574
It was my fault before.

99
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:36,114
I would like to apologize to you.

100
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:38,877
I'll swear to never let you cover my cleaning duty again if you like.

101
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:40,477
I'm not so stingy.

102
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,914
So, what are you mad about?

103
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,287
Aren't you afraid that people will talk if you are close to Liu Xiaofeng?

104
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:50,687
We are all classmates. What's the difference?

105
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,819
Talk.

106
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:06,528
Ding Xian,

107
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:09,383
can you just tell me what's on your mind?

108
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,073
Or do you think it's fun for us to be awkward like this every day?

109
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:13,573
I don't think so.

110
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:15,639
Then tell me.

111
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:19,461
What are you afraid of?

112
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:34,721
Stop stuffing my desk drawer with junk like this.

113
00:10:50,135 --> 00:10:52,029

114
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,820
 The sports field is covered with sunshine.

115
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,655
 The high jump competition for sophomore's Group B is beginning.

116
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:03,569
 They leave the perfect arcs on the field with the sky as their background.

117
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:07,029
 The ocean is vast and the drums are wonderful.

118
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:10,839
 Athletes, do not be as small as usual.

119
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,260
 We are praying for you silently.

120
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,589
Why are you here by yourself again?

121
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:16,549
I'm writing the newsletter.

122
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,459
That's not what I asked.

123
00:11:20,302 --> 00:11:22,222
Is your deskmate in the competition?

124
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,149
Yes.

125
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:27,280
 Coming up, the long-distance for freshmen.

126
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,680
 All participants, please report to the starting point.

127
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,560
Zhou Siyue, you are up.

128
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,139
Let's go.

129
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:40,839
Just a second. I need to check my newsletter.

130
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,289
Hold on.

131
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:47,079
Ding Xian, have you finished your newsletter? I'm up.

132
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,859
In a minute. I'll go deliver it.

133
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:51,779
You really wrote it to me.

134
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:54,709
I'm going to leave. See you.

135
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:57,309
Let's go.

136
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:01,589
That boy is treating you differently.

137
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:03,389
Stop the nonsense.

138
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:08,149
I'm going to deliver the newsletter.

139
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:11,839
 Athletes on the sports field.

140
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,769
 You have no flowers around you.

141
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,959
 You are the rainbow after the storm.

142
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,369
 Athletes from Class 3, you will always be our pride.

143
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:20,619
 Liu Xiaofeng, you can do it!

144
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:21,829
 Class 3, fighting!

145
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:23,539
 Class 3, fighting!

146
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:25,329
 Class 3, fighting!

147
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,029
 Class 3, fighting!

148
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:28,889
 Class 3, fighting!

149
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,189
Did you write that?

150
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:31,972
Yeah.

151
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,589
It's so much better than my letter.

152
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:36,709
I'll leave that to you next time.

153
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:40,509
Sorry, your letter...

154
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:47,639
Right, what were you going to say about my letter?

155
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:52,059
- Your letter...
 - Did you keep my letter?

156
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:53,609
No, no, no.

157
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:56,039
I'm kidding. Don't be nervous.

158
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,539
What happened?

159
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,595
I accidentally tore your letter apart.

160
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:03,709
But I did write it again.

161
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:06,469
You read my letter to Zhou Siyue!

162
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:10,149
What did you think of it?

163
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,530
Whatever. I didn't write it myself anyway.

164
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,459
I know you don't care.

165
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,945
But I'm sorry.

166
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:27,258
I didn't mean to do that.

167
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:33,309
If you feel sorry, then do me one more favor.

168
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:34,795
What is it?

169
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:36,515
Class 3, fighting!

170
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:41,829
Shadi, look! I bought the same one.

171
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:44,209
We will be using the same model from now on.

172
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:46,349
But I realized something after I bought it.

173
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:48,449
It's not as good as the one I used before.

174
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:51,049
Why don't I have lunch with you every day?

175
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,664
Have lunch with me?

176
00:13:53,664 --> 00:13:55,079
Yes, that's right.

177
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,109
What about the other girls in your class?

178
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:02,069
I don't like to hang out with them.

179
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:04,589
Okay, that's settled.

180
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:06,649
We will be having lunch together from now on.

181
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:08,071
- See you.
 - I...

182
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:15,449
 Long-distance for the freshmen is coming to an end.

183
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:18,779
 After such a long hard journey, victory is right ahead.

184
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,669
 Let's cheer for the contestants.

185
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:24,269
 You can do it! You can do it!

186
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:25,859
 You can do it!

187
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,179
You've made it. Great.

188
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:45,082
Is the water for me? Come on.

189
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:04,589
I knew it.

190
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:27,819
 The final exam is coming.

191
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:32,939
 I still haven't given Zhou Siyue the drawing that I prepared for him.

192
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:37,282
 I still haven't made up with Kong Shadi.

193
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,339
 And I still don't know how to say "no" to You Keke.

194
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,394
 Maybe...

195
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,779
 I really am a useless girl...

196
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:51,531
 who doesn't know how to say no.

197
00:15:58,483 --> 00:16:02,123

198
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:08,829
The final exam of the first year is really important.

199
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:10,259
It will affect your choice

200
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,029
of liberal arts or science in your sophomore year.

201
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:17,179
If any of you already know what you are going to choose, be prepared.

202
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:21,109
Those who are still hesitating can take the exam as an opportunity

203
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:24,909
and see what you like or what's better for you.

204
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:27,469
Now, break a leg for all of you.

205
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:28,669
You can do it!

206
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:29,979
Fighting!

207
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:31,149
 Fighting!

208
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:32,149
 Fighting!

209
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,429
You hit me again! Can you be gentle?

210
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:10,569
So what?

211
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:14,799
That's the price for being so talkative.

212
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,739
I'm going. Bye-bye.

213
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,165
How was the robot contest during summer vacation?

214
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:24,389
Did you win?

215
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:26,026
What do you think?

216
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:28,949
Not bad, Zhou.

217
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:30,962
You've gotten so many rewards. Huaqing is in your pocket.

218
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,389
Getting into Huaqing is not so easy.

219
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:36,799
So, tonight is your birthday party.

220
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,259
We have two good things to celebrate.

221
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,959
Nice.

222
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,692
Isn't that Little Monster?

223
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:47,595
Did you invite her?

224
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:04,139
Sis, I don't want to play over here anymore.

225
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:05,809
It's so boring.

226
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:07,559
I'm going over there.

227
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:10,269
Go ahead.

228
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,989
You guys have all been weird.

229
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:16,019
You even took happiness from me.

230
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:20,709
The thing between the two of them and the thing between me and her are not the same.

231
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:23,159
What are you talking about?

232
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:24,279
I don't understand.

233
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,779
I just know that it's horrible to be caught in the middle.

234
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,409
Girls are so complicated.

235
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,669
We are so much simpler.

236
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:36,169
You are simple-minded. Don't drag me down the road.

237
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,559
 What are you doing?

238
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,502
 Feisty, are you!

239
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:42,936
 What?

240
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:44,916
 Leave. And you too.

241
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:49,299
Go, or you won't catch her.

242
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,409
See? She's gone.

243
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,072
Leave me alone!

244
00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:57,250
What are you guys doing?

245
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,679
Move!

246
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,439
Stop running, or I'll punch you!

247
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:06,539
Are you all right?

248
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,389
What do you care?

249
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,799
Come on, let's go home.

250
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:14,089
Try to run again!

251
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,509
Hurry up.

252
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,820
Okay.

253
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:40,929
You are always so arrogant at home

254
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,189
and look how useless you are out there.

255
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:45,019
Why didn't you fight back?

256
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,619
None of your business.

257
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:47,989
None of my business.

258
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:50,589
I'm your sister. Who would care for you if I don't?

259
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:52,849
Don't move!

260
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,472
Now you can feel pain!

261
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:56,829
You are so inconsistent.

262
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,542
You even had the nerve to say that. Aren't you the same?

263
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:00,635
You've always been so tough with me.

264
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:03,095
And you become a nice girl in front of your classmates.

265
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:08,329
Ding Juncong!

266
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,795
That cake seems so delicious.

267
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:19,775
Why don't we get started?

268
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,137
Wait for a little while. What's the rush?

269
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:17,944

270
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:20,875
How long do we have to keep waiting?

271
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,507
Why are you so talkative?

272
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:23,607
So?

273
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:27,345
It's okay.

274
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:29,068
Let's get started.

275
00:22:49,405 --> 00:22:51,105
There you are.

276
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:00,894
Sorry.

277
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:03,065
I'm late.

278
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:06,405
Where are the others?

279
00:23:07,405 --> 00:23:09,325
Song Ziqi and the others went to sing karaoke.

280
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:12,431
Why didn't you join them?

281
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:14,635
It's the same thing every year.

282
00:23:14,635 --> 00:23:16,135
I'm tired of it.

283
00:23:20,435 --> 00:23:22,065
Sorry.

284
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,635
Why are you apologizing?

285
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:30,395
Are you sorry because you fought with me

286
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:32,685
or you missed my birthday party?

287
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,190
Both.

288
00:23:39,015 --> 00:23:40,015
Okay.

289
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,508
I forgive you.

290
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:46,208
But shouldn't you make it up to me?

291
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:49,875
So...

292
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:53,535
I will be there for your next birthday.

293
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:55,867
Why next birthday?

294
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,375
My birthday isn't over yet.

295
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:16,035
Zhou Siyue.

296
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,332
Happy birthday.

297
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:22,468
Thank you.

298
00:24:22,498 --> 00:24:24,098
This is for you.

299
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:27,935
I have a gift!

300
00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:32,625
Let me see.

301
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:42,839
This is the skymap on your birthday.

302
00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:49,165
You did some good work.

303
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:50,120
Great.

304
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,836
I like it.

305
00:24:52,635 --> 00:24:54,825
I'm glad.

306
00:24:56,021 --> 00:24:57,721
Thank you.

307
00:25:01,315 --> 00:25:04,025
Blow out the candles.

308
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:12,565
I hope your birthday wish can come true.

309
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,875
It did come true.

310
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,905
What did you wish for?

311
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:21,335
I'm not telling you.

312
00:25:22,735 --> 00:25:24,331
Oh, right!

313
00:25:24,331 --> 00:25:26,634
I have a gift for you, too.

314
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:33,361
No. That's too expensive.

315
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:35,625
- I can't accept it.
 - It's not expensive.

316
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:37,245
It's free.

317
00:25:37,975 --> 00:25:40,085
It's free?

318
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:42,155
I participated in a contest a while ago.

319
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:43,880
This is the prize.

320
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,655
That's one more reason I can't take this.

321
00:25:46,655 --> 00:25:49,907
Or think of this as the payment for the painting you gave me.

322
00:25:50,635 --> 00:25:52,615
My painting isn't worth much.

323
00:25:52,615 --> 00:25:54,525
Who told you that?

324
00:25:57,465 --> 00:26:00,085
It might be worth a lot one day.

325
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:02,975
It's okay.

326
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:06,205
Let's say I'm lending you this cell phone.

327
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:09,155
You can give it back to me when you get a new one.

328
00:26:10,255 --> 00:26:12,938
Don't lose contact with me again.

329
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,445
Hello?

330
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:39,555
 Hello, Ding Xian.

331
00:26:39,555 --> 00:26:42,136
I... I pushed the wrong button.

332
00:26:50,065 --> 00:26:52,504
Silly!

333
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,145
 Xianxian, time to get up.

334
00:27:20,275 --> 00:27:21,775
Dad.

335
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:24,135
This is still my vacation. I want to sleep in.

336
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:27,005
What are you thinking, Xianxian?

337
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:28,455
Vacation ended yesterday.

338
00:27:28,455 --> 00:27:30,545
The summer session starts today.

339
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:33,875
Hurry up. Breakfast is on the table.

340
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:35,085
I'm heading to work now.

341
00:27:36,675 --> 00:27:38,275
What's that sound?

342
00:27:42,731 --> 00:27:44,015
It's the clock, Dad.

343
00:27:44,015 --> 00:27:45,117
I need to change now.

344
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:48,005
Okay. Hurry up.

345
00:27:59,035 --> 00:28:02,575
 Let's walk to school together. I'll be waiting for you downstairs.

346
00:28:10,918 --> 00:28:12,518
Morning.

347
00:28:12,521 --> 00:28:15,615
If you arrived later, we might as well have just skipped the morning class.

348
00:28:15,615 --> 00:28:17,905
Sorry, I overslept.

349
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:23,046
Did you forget that school started today?

350
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:28,926
I always feel like the summer vacation is not over yet.

351
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,236
You are so silly.

352
00:28:31,236 --> 00:28:32,356
It's sophomore year.

353
00:28:32,356 --> 00:28:34,556
We are about to choose between liberal arts and science.

354
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:40,196
Why do we have to make so many choices in life?

355
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:44,476
Come on!

356
00:28:44,476 --> 00:28:46,386
We are really going to be late with this speed.

357
00:28:46,386 --> 00:28:48,366
My hair!

358
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:58,476
Siyue, let me have a look at your math homework.

359
00:28:58,476 --> 00:28:59,476
Ding Xian,

360
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,458
lend him your homework.

361
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:05,476
Did you two talk things out?

362
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:07,996
That's what I said.

363
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,406
Deskmates should always keep good comradeship.

364
00:29:10,406 --> 00:29:12,576
- Or you...
 - I'm throwing away your breakfast.

365
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:15,326
I'm here, My Lady. Don't throw it away!

366
00:29:17,926 --> 00:29:19,836
What did you do to her?

367
00:29:19,836 --> 00:29:21,836
It's all because of your stupid letter.

368
00:29:21,836 --> 00:29:24,046
You are the one to bring up that letter!

369
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:25,526
It was an accident!

370
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,996
You have a lot of accidents.

371
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:33,096
I'm sorry.

372
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:34,966
I promise that it will never happen again.

373
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:43,926
So, in the three draws, what's the chance of red balls

374
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:48,016
showing up more times than the white balls?

375
00:29:48,016 --> 00:29:49,984
What's the chance?

376
00:29:49,984 --> 00:29:52,379
You just need to remember this formula.

377
00:29:53,096 --> 00:29:54,596
Keep sleeping.

378
00:29:55,046 --> 00:29:56,896
You guys just keep sleeping.

379
00:29:58,976 --> 00:30:01,886
We'll continue this lesson when you all wake up.

380
00:30:02,786 --> 00:30:06,166
How do you know things in sophomore lessons?

381
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:09,886
I've seen it in the Math Olympiad, so I've learned it before.

382
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:14,381
Keep your heads straight, all of you!

383
00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:18,116
The liberal arts and science division test is coming soon.

384
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,116
You are sophomores now.

385
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:22,186
Sophomore year is as important as senior year.

386
00:30:22,186 --> 00:30:24,206
You even don't have a clue.

387
00:30:24,686 --> 00:30:26,046
Song Ziqi!

388
00:30:26,046 --> 00:30:27,107
Stand up!

389
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:32,436
If anyone gets sleepy again, stand up for the class.

390
00:30:33,446 --> 00:30:37,073
You all look like you are forced. For what?

391
00:30:37,806 --> 00:30:39,766
Do you know that all the teachers

392
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:41,686
are giving you the sessions for free?

393
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:44,836
We only want to let you finish all the high school courses

394
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:48,476
so that you will have enough time to review in the senior year.

395
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:51,360
Or why would I leave a wonderful summer vacation behind

396
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,237
and come here to give you extra classes on such a hot day?

397
00:30:53,237 --> 00:30:55,497
Do I have brain damage or what?

398
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:03,884
Okay. A physics class is coming up next.

399
00:31:04,886 --> 00:31:06,286
Stay awake.

400
00:31:06,286 --> 00:31:09,206
Go wash your face if you feel sleepy, all right?

401
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:10,476
 Okay!

402
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,886
Oh, right!

403
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:16,532
Deng Wanwan. I will send you the volunteer form for the Arts and Sciences Department later.

404
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:17,396
Okay.

405
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:21,336
And use the time to think about where you want to go.

406
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:23,976
Hand in the form by Friday.

407
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:25,316
Zhou Siyue.

408
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,916
Come with me.

409
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:38,456
- Shadi.
 - Wanwan.

410
00:31:38,456 --> 00:31:40,026
I need to get some water as well. Let's go together.

411
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:41,526
Sure.

412
00:31:44,866 --> 00:31:46,946
Little Monster, don't mind her.

413
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,146
She has always been like that.

414
00:31:49,165 --> 00:31:51,376
Please help me hand out the homework. I need to use the bathroom.

415
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,776
Thank you.

416
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:04,476
I have already signed you up for the city math competition.

417
00:32:04,476 --> 00:32:06,666
And I'll get you several exercise papers.

418
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:08,596
You should be prepared.

419
00:32:08,596 --> 00:32:10,356
If you can get a reward,

420
00:32:10,356 --> 00:32:12,716
you will be able to take the national examination next year.

421
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:14,983
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

422
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:18,029
Although you've participated in city contests in junior high,

423
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:20,646
the difficulty in high school will increase.

424
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:23,366
Anyway, arrange your time however you see fit.

425
00:32:24,646 --> 00:32:26,446
I've got this.

426
00:32:26,476 --> 00:32:28,436
I believe in your strength.

427
00:32:33,675 --> 00:32:35,475
Break a leg.

428
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:58,576
You are finished.

429
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:01,856
This is Kong Shadi's favorite dairy.

430
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:09,926
Shadi, sorry.

431
00:33:09,926 --> 00:33:12,246
I didn't mean it.

432
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:34,416
What are you doing here?

433
00:33:37,397 --> 00:33:38,687
I didn't mean to do that.

434
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:40,977
I'll get you a new notebook.

435
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:42,905
How are you going to do that?

436
00:33:42,905 --> 00:33:45,627
My dad got that for me from Japan.

437
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,910
I'll figure something out.

438
00:33:48,947 --> 00:33:50,248
Like what?

439
00:33:50,248 --> 00:33:52,367
Are you going to buy exactly the same notebook

440
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:56,167
and copy everything in it like what you did with You Keke's letter?

441
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,727
What do you mean by that?

442
00:33:57,727 --> 00:34:00,057
Isn't that what you like the most, Ding Xian?

443
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:02,677
Are you done, Kong Shadi?

444
00:34:20,957 --> 00:34:22,767
Sorry, Shadi.

445
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:24,487
Don't cry.

446
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:25,577
 Who gave you the right to meddle in my business?

447
00:34:25,577 --> 00:34:28,327
 I can't even cry? Who are you?

448
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,945
I didn't mean it that day.

449
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,835
Really, I didn't mean it. Stop crying.

450
00:34:35,835 --> 00:34:37,675
Forgive me.

451
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,379
Stop crying.

452
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,649
I'm going to cry now if you don't stop.

453
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,889
 You are so cruel, Ding Xian.

454
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:49,319
Yes. I'm cruel.

455
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:53,559
 Why aren't you with You Keke right now?

456
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,709
 Isn't she your friend?

457
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:56,946
 Why are you here with me?

458
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:59,705
You are also my friend.

459
00:35:03,419 --> 00:35:05,079
You know, Shadi.

460
00:35:05,998 --> 00:35:08,818
After the letter,

461
00:35:08,818 --> 00:35:12,292
I feel like my whole life was broken.

462
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:14,475
You were mad at me,

463
00:35:14,475 --> 00:35:17,004
Zhou Siyue was mad at me.

464
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:20,919
I feel like I turned back time

465
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:23,499
to when I just arrived at Shenhai High School.

466
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:30,089
I realized that I am cowardly and indecisive.

467
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:33,634
While you are brave and confident.

468
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:36,999
So, I really enjoy being your friend.

469
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:40,469
Just forgive me. What do you say?

470
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:48,948
This bathroom is so smelly.

471
00:35:48,948 --> 00:35:51,435
You look ugly when you are crying.

472
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:53,475
All right.

473
00:35:53,475 --> 00:35:55,125
Let's go back.

474
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:58,109
Stop crying.

475
00:36:00,015 --> 00:36:01,619
You look awful when you are crying.

476
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:02,619
You look awful.

477
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:07,279
So, let's have lunch together.

478
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:09,449
Let's go have something delicious.

479
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:14,240
Are you two done not talking to each other?

480
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,229
Do you need to be taught a lesson?

481
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:18,829
Have you worked things out?

482
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,920
Yeah.

483
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:22,969
It took me some time to sweet-talk her.

484
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:26,001
You've learned how to sweet-talk.

485
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:27,739
That's huge.

486
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:35,309
You apologized to her, but you never let me off.

487
00:36:36,312 --> 00:36:38,375
I have spoiled you.

488
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:42,479
That's different.

489
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:44,449
How is that different?

490
00:36:56,969 --> 00:36:59,069
Anyway, if we ever get into a spat,

491
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:01,869
you need to have that kind of attitude.

492
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:05,419
Got it.

493
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,162
You are here.

494
00:37:16,135 --> 00:37:19,785
Siyue, have you handed in your department's form of intent?

495
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:22,609
Not yet.

496
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:23,609
Do I still have time?

497
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:26,048
You handed it in so fast.

498
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:26,889
Yes.

499
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:28,629
I'm going to pick science anyway.

500
00:37:28,629 --> 00:37:30,449
Why waste two weeks?

501
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:31,969
You are choosing science.

502
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:34,569
Of course. Did you think I would choose liberal arts?

503
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:37,068
Then I'm choosing science as well.

504
00:37:38,185 --> 00:37:39,609
You are a copycat.

505
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:41,129
Are you choosing science for me?

506
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:42,559
Don't flatter yourself.

507
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,069
What if I choose liberal arts

508
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:45,709
and am assigned to the same class as Yang Chunzi?

509
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:46,999
I don't want that.

510
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:50,509
Right. Don't girls always prefer liberal arts?

511
00:37:50,509 --> 00:37:52,509
Look how open-minded Yang Chunzi is.

512
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:54,569
She knows liberal arts would be easier.

513
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:57,671
And if you are choosing science,

514
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:00,739
wouldn't you be separated from Little Monster?

515
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:03,429
Xian, are you choosing liberal arts?

516
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:06,029
If you choose liberal arts, will we stop seeing each other?

517
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:08,555
I don't want that.

518
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:11,099
No one said that I was choosing liberal arts.

519
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,949
I might choose science.

520
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:14,849
Really?

521
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:18,195
Then our Master Zhou will be able to keep tutoring you.

522
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:20,659
Don't worry.

523
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:21,859
I can do well by myself.

524
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:23,359
I don't need him.

525
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:28,229
I knew you forgot.

526
00:38:29,279 --> 00:38:30,579
Keke.

527
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:31,712
Why are you here?

528
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:34,802
Ding Xian promised to have lunch with me.

529
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:38,429
Sorry.

530
00:38:39,129 --> 00:38:42,408
Or... why don't you join us?

531
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:46,969
Hey, someone should introduce us.

532
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:48,939
Who's this beautiful lady?

533
00:38:48,939 --> 00:38:50,319
Why did you stomp me?

534
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:52,279
You are doing it again! What's your problem, Kong Shadi?

535
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:53,989
You are the one having a problem. Eat your food.

536
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:55,229
Hello, Zhou Siyue.

537
00:38:55,229 --> 00:38:56,889
I've heard so much about you.

538
00:38:57,799 --> 00:38:59,079
I'm from Class 10.

539
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,959
The one who sent you the letter.

540
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:07,942
I know.

541
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:10,309
Don't take this the wrong way.

542
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:11,949
I did send you the letter.

543
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,889
But I'm not a pest.

544
00:39:14,749 --> 00:39:17,278
Your deskmate is so much more interesting than you are.

545
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:21,839
Little Monster is getting more and more popular now.

546
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,319
Can you stop stomping me?

547
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,069
Just eat your food.

548
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,367
I'm finished. You guys enjoy it.

549
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:34,689
Why are you so annoying?

550
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:35,905
You are everywhere.

551
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:38,239
I'm here for Ding Xian, not you.

552
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:40,609
If you find me annoying, you can leave.

553
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:42,819
Why should I leave instead of you?

554
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:45,169
Kong Shadi,

555
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:47,024
do you hate me so much

556
00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:50,537
because I'm more beautiful and you are afraid that I'll steal your thunder?

557
00:39:50,537 --> 00:39:52,549
How is that possible?

558
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:54,260
Anyway, stop coming to us.

559
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,120
I want to. And not just you, I'll go talk to Zhou Siyue, too.

560
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,419
And that guy named Qi something.

561
00:39:59,419 --> 00:40:00,919
You...

562
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,759
Xianxian, I really want to hit her.

563
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:04,999
It's okay, Shadi.

564
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:06,209
Go back to the classroom.

565
00:40:06,209 --> 00:40:07,509
I'll talk to her.

566
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:09,549
Don't be too polite to her.

567
00:40:09,549 --> 00:40:11,249
I don't like her.

568
00:40:20,029 --> 00:40:21,329
Keke,

569
00:40:22,138 --> 00:40:24,278
let's talk somewhere else.

570
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:33,939
Okay. It's a quiet spot. Let's talk here.

571
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:42,809
Sorry, Keke.

572
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:46,031
Why are you apologizing to me?

573
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:48,199
Did you do anything to anyone?

574
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,750
Um...

575
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:54,972
Forget it.

576
00:40:54,972 --> 00:40:58,449
Actually, I'm the one who should apologize.

577
00:40:58,449 --> 00:41:02,319
I was using you to get close to Zhou Siyue at first.

578
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,129
Because I'm the kind of girl

579
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,989
who usually doesn't get along with other girls.

580
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:08,215
I always hang out with boys.

581
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,955
But later I realized that...

582
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:12,645
you are so much more interesting than them.

583
00:41:13,302 --> 00:41:19,859
Besides, I've noticed that this guy does have some charm.

584
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:23,959
But I don't like being friends with people who are superior and boring.

585
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:28,139
He's actually quite interesting.

586
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:29,719
Not like how you described him.

587
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:31,519
Never mind.

588
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:34,899
I might prefer to hang out with mindless boys like Song Ziqi.

589
00:41:34,899 --> 00:41:37,669
No, no. Song Ziqi is out of the question.

590
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:39,975
I said that I wouldn't hang out with Zhou Siyue.

591
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:42,315
But I never mentioned anything about Song Ziqi.

592
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:46,779
If you do that, Shadi will be upset.

593
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:49,099
All right.

594
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:50,899
I'll stop teasing you.

595
00:41:53,702 --> 00:41:55,742
You would look prettier if you got bangs.

596
00:41:56,689 --> 00:41:59,339
Shadi said the same thing.

597
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:02,489
Really?

598
00:42:04,419 --> 00:42:08,039
I think you can be good friends.

599
00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:11,409
All right, I have to go back to class.

600
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:34,769
What's the deal about You Keke?

601
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,740
She's my friend.

602
00:42:38,419 --> 00:42:41,299
You've become friends after you delivered her letter?

603
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,644
It's a little complicated.

604
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:47,150
It would take some time to explain it.

605
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:53,029
I didn't realize you were quite keen on your relationships with classmates until now.

606
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:57,649
But I have to tell you, I'm not interested in You Keke.

607
00:42:57,649 --> 00:43:00,698
Don't make a fuss.

608
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,060
Okay.

609
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:08,509
Why?

610
00:43:08,509 --> 00:43:10,369
You Keke is so popular.

611
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,715
If I were friends with whoever is popular,

612
00:43:14,715 --> 00:43:16,805
then there would be so many popular people,

613
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:18,945
would I have enough time for all of them?

614
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:23,702
That's good thinking.

615
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:26,734
I was presumptuous this time.

616
00:43:26,734 --> 00:43:28,519
I would like to apologize to you.

617
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:29,919
Sorry.

618
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,220
What?

619
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:33,938
Sorry.

620
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,262
Not bad.

621
00:43:36,262 --> 00:43:38,362
That's progress.

622
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:56,180

623
00:43:58,015 --> 00:44:03,305
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

624
00:44:03,305 --> 00:44:06,965
