1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,010

2
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,285
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:31,064
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:34,944
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:40,016
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,822
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:48,471
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:55,530
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:02,426
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:09,356
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:10,164 --> 00:01:12,190
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,303
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:17,656
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:22,682
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,870
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,222
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:35,566
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:39,814

19
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:42,214

20
00:01:43,457 --> 00:01:45,117
Things are clear to me now.

21
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:46,777
Our daughter is not little anymore.

22
00:01:46,777 --> 00:01:49,077
She gets to make her own choices.

23
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:51,207
There's nothing I can do about that.

24
00:01:52,907 --> 00:01:55,747
But there's still something I can do about you.

25
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:58,307
I don't care.

26
00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:02,837
I don't care what you have to do, transfer her to a liberal arts class!

27
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:05,097
If you fail to do that,

28
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:08,077
you are doing all the laundry and cooking yourself starting tomorrow.

29
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:09,947
I'm not doing anything for you.

30
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:11,947
You...

31
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:23,647
Xian.

32
00:02:24,507 --> 00:02:28,627
Your teacher did a home visit and gave us this.

33
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:32,627
How could your mom not be mad?

34
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:35,247
Xian,

35
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:37,847
do you know why your mom is acting like that?

36
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:41,116
She thinks you've grown up and you no longer need her.

37
00:02:41,116 --> 00:02:43,297
But she doesn't know how to express herself.

38
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,017
That's why she's acting like that.

39
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:46,537
You should understand your mom.

40
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,016
And I also need to say something.

41
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:53,147
Why did you turn in the form of intent behind our backs?

42
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:58,598
Dad, that's my fault.

43
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:01,767
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

44
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,377
Can you talk to mom

45
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:06,867
so that I won't be transferred to a liberal arts class?

46
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:09,607
My life in the current class is nice.

47
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:13,577
And I don't want to be separated from my friends.

48
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:19,477
Okay. I'll talk to your mom for you.

49
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:23,017
But my power is limited.

50
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:24,767
I can only give you one month.

51
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:28,147
If you can get good results in the next monthly test,

52
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:31,867
then maybe we can work something out.

53
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:33,567
Agreed?

54
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,220

55
00:04:18,227 --> 00:04:22,427
Therefore, the staff arrangement of the liberal arts and sciences departments is temporarily like this.

56
00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:25,577
And, of course, this is not final.

57
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:28,007
If any of you feel like transferring

58
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:31,757
to a liberal arts class after a while, come talk to me.

59
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:34,317
We'll arrange that as soon as possible.

60
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:38,067
I'm not going to talk about the questions in the placement test.

61
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,877
You will get the answers later.

62
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:46,044
Analyze the ones you got wrong and deliver it by Friday.

63
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:48,767
Okay. Let's get back to the lesson.

64
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:55,627
 I can only give you one month.

65
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:58,967
 If you can get good results in the next monthly test,

66
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:02,787
 then maybe we can work something out.

67
00:05:02,787 --> 00:05:04,287
 Agreed?

68
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:13,983
What are you thinking about?

69
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,357
I'm thinking...

70
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:24,347
that things didn't change much after the placement.

71
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:26,907
That's because not many people chose liberal arts.

72
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,727
How can you say things didn't change?

73
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,533
Yang Chunzi, the goddess, is gone.

74
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:35,007
Do you feel so sorry about that?

75
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:38,167
Why don't you go with her?

76
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:41,217
It's too late.

77
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:44,727
Do you know what else is late?

78
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:46,327
What?

79
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:50,027
You can forget about this video game

80
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:52,057
- I promised to lend to you.
 - Don't!

81
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:53,647
My Lady, please let me borrow it.

82
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:55,017
Go ask Yang Chunzi if she has a copy.

83
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:56,597
You can borrow it from her.

84
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,453
I'm not lending it to you.

85
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:00,347
Song Ziqi! Kong Shadi!

86
00:06:00,347 --> 00:06:01,957
Stand up.

87
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,127
It's all your fault.

88
00:06:08,697 --> 00:06:10,297
Go stand in the back.

89
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:16,607
The rest of you, take out your math textbook...

90
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:19,217
and turn to page 23.

91
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,700
Let's continue our lesson.

92
00:06:23,737 --> 00:06:26,757
Today, we are going to talk about the division algorithm.

93
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,907
The division algorithm is a method

94
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:32,357
documented in Euclid's original script.

95
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,917
There are no two same numbers.

96
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:38,407
If you keep deducting the small numbers from the bigger ones,

97
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:41,697
keep doing that if the former number has a remainder after the division

98
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:44,367
until the remainder is deduced to one unit.

99
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:52,627
Dad.

100
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:55,720
- Xianxian.
 - Why are you on this floor?

101
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,933
I thought you said that I had one month.

102
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:59,120
I'm here to print something.

103
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,700
The printer upstairs is broken. Don't worry.

104
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,547
Did you talk to Mom?

105
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:06,357
Is she still mad?

106
00:07:06,907 --> 00:07:08,537
A little.

107
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,604
Your mom has one condition.

108
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:14,974
You need to achieve 270 or above on the science comprehensive.

109
00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:17,375
Is she trying to kill me?

110
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:19,157
Just let her have my life.

111
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:22,667
Silly girl, she gave you your life.

112
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:25,347
There's only so much I can do.

113
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:26,937
I can only take you this far.

114
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,077
Break a leg.

115
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,990
Thank you, Dad.

116
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:35,836
How am I supposed to get 270?

117
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:45,367
Preparing for the contest and learning at the same time.

118
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:48,017
No common person can bear that.

119
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:51,107
Poor thing.

120
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:03,537
You are awake.

121
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:06,937
Did you stay up late to do exercises again?

122
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:11,207
Wouldn't you get too tired from that?

123
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,202
Can you get enough sleep?

124
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,107
It's okay.

125
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:18,567
I've taken a nap.

126
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:28,957
What happened?

127
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:33,577
I would like to ask

128
00:08:33,577 --> 00:08:36,277
if there's any way that I can achieve more than 270

129
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:39,647
on the science comprehensive in one month?

130
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,757
You can dream about it.

131
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:55,787
You need to think less and do more exercises.

132
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:58,497
With your current level, forget about 270.

133
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,657
It would be hard for you to get to 250.

134
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:04,457
You are 250.

135
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:14,007
I need to work hard starting now.

136
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:15,607
Fighting!

137
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:35,817
Here, Juncong.

138
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:37,227
Have some more meat.

139
00:09:37,227 --> 00:09:40,102
Boys need to have more meat when they are growing.

140
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,226
Mom,

141
00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:47,310
why did you make so much delicious food?

142
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,067
For you two students.

143
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:53,456
Come on, the dishes will get cold.

144
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,880
Okay.

145
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:01,507
They are delicious.

146
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,730
Mom, thank you.

147
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,130
Have more food.

148
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:14,687
I've been cooking for more than a decade now,

149
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:16,997
and that's the only nice word I've heard.

150
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,367
Here, Juncong.

151
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:21,097
Have some more.

152
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:27,477
We are having a feast tonight.

153
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,033
Where's my...

154
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:40,657
I'm not so hungry.

155
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:43,369
You guys enjoy it.

156
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:45,927
I'll go read.

157
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:09,937
Tomorrow is the weekend.

158
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:13,167
I'll take you to buy a pair of glasses with a higher prescription.

159
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:15,276
Thanks, Mom.

160
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:17,617
Do not slip.

161
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:19,957
We agreed on 270 for the science comprehensive.

162
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:21,977
Not even one point less.

163
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,350
Okay.

164
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,327
270.

165
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:30,507
Not even one point less.

166
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,940

167
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,357
Guys, quiet.

168
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:38,937
You have all gotten the physics weekly test results.

169
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:41,177
Mr. Yang asked all of you to do a wrong answer analysis within a week

170
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:43,557
and bring it to his office.

171
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:45,947
Don't forget that.

172
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,760
What is it?

173
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,830
I'm hopeless.

174
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,017
Let me see.

175
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,180
You've got the formulas for this question wrong.

176
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,030
You shouldn't have lost points.

177
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,766
And this one.

178
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:34,207
You misunderstood the question.

179
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:36,787
The mass of the table tennis ball is the misleading factor.

180
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:39,667
And you shouldn't have been wrong about this, either.

181
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,227
This one.

182
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:45,867
This one is more ridiculous.

183
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:47,347
Most of it is right.

184
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:50,017
Why did you make a mistake on the math which is the simple part?

185
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:52,350
What were you thinking?

186
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:55,057
If I had done all the right things,

187
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:58,327
then I would have been the one who scored 90.

188
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:01,072
You are looking for excuses when you made mistakes.

189
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,457
This one...

190
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,627
Xianxian.

191
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,197
Senior!

192
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:27,127
What are you doing here?

193
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:30,557
Don't you have classes at the university?

194
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:34,197
School hasn't started yet. I wanted to check on you.

195
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,877
Do you have a minute?

196
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,807
Your mom has such a high demand for you means she believes you have the potential.

197
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:59,007
So, you don't need to feel frustrated.

198
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:02,447
Because I also believe that you can do it.

199
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,094
I thought I could do it, too.

200
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:11,107
But the difference is obvious under comparison.

201
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,907
You can ask me any questions.

202
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,567
Didn't you choose liberal arts?

203
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,917
You are underestimating me.

204
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:22,447
I can at least tutor you.

205
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,627
I might be going through a little confidence crisis.

206
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,087
But thank you, Bocong.

207
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:34,477
Oh, right!

208
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:36,677
There's another reason that I came here.

209
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,597
I was going to take a photo with you at the graduation ceremony.

210
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:44,847
But I didn't have the chance. You have to make it up to me today.

211
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:46,720
No problem.

212
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,123
Come.

213
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,489
You are already a university student in the blink of an eye.

214
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:11,947
Are we not going to see each other for a long time?

215
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:14,907
That's not a problem. I will be back for the holidays.

216
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,907
I need to get back to class.

217
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:22,417
The class adviser will be there soon.

218
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,584
Xianxian.

219
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,957
This is for you.

220
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,287
I hope you...

221
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:54,707
can always smile like that.

222
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,757
Of course.

223
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,970
Go back to class.

224
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,320
Okay.

225
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,297
Xian, I just remembered that...

226
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,900
Hey.

227
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,717
Who took that photo for you?

228
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:33,208
Senior Bocong took the photo just now.

229
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,328
Let me see.

230
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,668
Look at her smile when she turned around.

231
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:38,347
This Bocong really knows how to take photos.

232
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:40,697
Look!

233
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,717
I've written down why you made all the mistakes.

234
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:46,187
Go back and take a look tonight.

235
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:48,497
And there are two sets of exercises.

236
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,957
Finish them tonight and return them to me tomorrow.

237
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,737
Two sets of exercises in one night?

238
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:58,767
You can skip them if you think they're hard.

239
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,707
You can still get into a university with 200 points in the science comprehensive.

240
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,507
I'm not refusing to do them.

241
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:06,427
Zhou Siyue.

242
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:09,877
Why are you so cruel to Xian?

243
00:17:09,877 --> 00:17:11,806
You think this is cruel?

244
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:13,857
The NCEE is so much more ruthless.

245
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:16,087
I'm helping her.

246
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,687
Maybe you should focus on the Math Olympiad first.

247
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,310
Okay.

248
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,287
You will no longer be my problem.

249
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,983
Xianxian.

250
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,347
Why aren't you at school?

251
00:17:58,347 --> 00:17:59,937
Morning, Auntie.

252
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:01,427
I'm waiting for Zhou Siyue.

253
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,447
Is he coming?

254
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:05,097
Didn't he tell you?

255
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:09,957
He went to the training camp first thing in the morning with the Math Olympiad group.

256
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,727
I understand now.

257
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,387
I should leave now, Auntie.

258
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,147
Take care.

259
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:19,760
See you, Auntie.

260
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,210
See you.

261
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,497
 With its huge waves are gone all those heroes of bygone years.

262
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:30,217
 West of the ancient fortress appears Red Cliff

263
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:34,307
 where General Zhou won his early fame when the three kingdoms were in flames.

264
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:38,017
 Rocks tower in the air and waves beat on the shore.

265
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:40,567
 Rolling up a thousand heaps of snow.

266
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,547
 After Zhou Siyue went to the Math Olympiad,

267
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,247
 I found days without a deskmate to be so strange.

268
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:00,117
 It's like he headed to a battlefield by himself.

269
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,387
 Maybe it's my illusion.

270
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,217
 After all,

271
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:10,517
 he should be familiar with the life of competitions.

272
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,827
 Who will pick the fallen flowers up now?

273
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,787
 Sitting along at the window, waiting for the day to darken.

274
00:19:25,787 --> 00:19:31,077
 On the parasol tree leaves the fine rain drizzles as twilight grizzles.

275
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:35,587
 What can I do with grief, beyond belief?

276
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:42,537
 I always thought that he would head to a world that was more vast.

277
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,417
 By the light he shed,

278
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,737
 I caught a glimpse of that world.

279
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:54,607
 And I realized that I want to be in that world, too.

280
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:57,397
 I don't want to be left behind.

281
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,510
I heard that the shot put team has not been recruiting recently.

282
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,687
All right.

283
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,067
What are you doing?

284
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,700
What? You scared me!

285
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:39,720
Are you stalking someone?

286
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,990
Yeah.

287
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,217
I'm not stalking.

288
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:46,537
You are denying it after being caught.

289
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,167
That Song Ziqi!

290
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,957
Not only did he not wait for me after school,

291
00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:53,567
but he's also walking with another girl.

292
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:55,067
I'm so pissed right now.

293
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,467
Are you jealous?

294
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,967
I'm not jealous!

295
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,777
I'm going home.

296
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,657
So,

297
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,020
do you have any solutions?

298
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,397
I don't have one yet,

299
00:21:23,397 --> 00:21:26,023
but I'm a little hungry.

300
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,280
I understand. I'll make the arrangement.

301
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,080
Let's go.

302
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,667
Xianxian.

303
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:37,297
Shadi. Keke.

304
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,180
Xianxian, why have you been working so hard?

305
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,127
The monthly test is coming. I have to be prepared.

306
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,267
When did you two become so close?

307
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,337
Hello. What would you like?

308
00:21:56,337 --> 00:21:57,584
Two lemonade.

309
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,084
All right.

310
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:08,717
I thought you didn't care about Song Ziqi.

311
00:22:08,717 --> 00:22:12,907
If the dog you raised since childhood ran away with someone else, wouldn't you be anxious?

312
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:17,157
If I'm mad, Song Ziqi can't have any peace either.

313
00:22:17,157 --> 00:22:19,237
I have a solution.

314
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:22,397
You can go hang out with someone else and piss him off.

315
00:22:24,097 --> 00:22:28,889
Throw a party and invite everyone in front of him but leave him out.

316
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,467
See how he would react.

317
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:31,907
That's a good idea.

318
00:22:31,907 --> 00:22:33,757
My birthday is coming up.

319
00:22:33,757 --> 00:22:36,217
I'm going to throw a birthday party this weekend.

320
00:22:36,217 --> 00:22:38,557
You have to come.

321
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:43,807
When did you two become so close?

322
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:46,827
Your friends are my friends.

323
00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:48,300
Are you coming or not?

324
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,977
Of course. I will come.

325
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:52,930
Lemonade is here.

326
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:57,610
- Thank you.
 - You are welcome.

327
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,357
What are you doing here?

328
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,620
You didn't even tell me.

329
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:07,597
Let me take a sip. I'm so thirsty.

330
00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:09,137
Go buy one yourself.

331
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,937
Let me drink...

332
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,007
Song Ziqi!

333
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:18,387
What's wrong with taking a sip from your glass? You are so stingy right now.

334
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:23,707
Thank you.

335
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,536
Come on, let's go home.

336
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:26,757
You can go home by yourself.

337
00:23:26,757 --> 00:23:29,037
I'm leaving with Keke today.

338
00:23:31,187 --> 00:23:34,507
Okay. I'm leaving now. See you.

339
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:54,397
Do you think that was an indirect kiss?

340
00:24:01,577 --> 00:24:05,057
Okay. I got it. Wait for me at the pool club.

341
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:07,327
I can't talk any longer. See you.

342
00:24:11,277 --> 00:24:13,917
Hello, Siyue. Aren't you at the training camp?

343
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:18,107
 Yes. Do me a favor. Keep an eye on Little Monster.

344
00:24:28,207 --> 00:24:32,007
My classmates, I'm having a birthday party this weekend.

345
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:33,667
Why don't you all join us?

346
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:36,423
Sure. Who else will be there?

347
00:24:36,423 --> 00:24:39,384
It's just me, Ding Xian,

348
00:24:39,384 --> 00:24:41,687
and a girl from Class 10.

349
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:43,197
The three of us.

350
00:24:43,197 --> 00:24:45,337
Why don't you all come?

351
00:24:45,337 --> 00:24:48,427
- Okay.
 - All right. That's what they like.

352
00:24:48,427 --> 00:24:51,817
- Are you coming?
 - Kong Shadi, what have you planned?

353
00:24:51,817 --> 00:24:53,707
My birthday party...

354
00:24:53,707 --> 00:24:57,977
You know, karaoke, dinner, pool.

355
00:24:57,977 --> 00:24:59,827
Whatever you like.

356
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:03,307
You guys have fun and my dad will pay the bill.

357
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:05,020
Awesome.

358
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,587
Really? Don't lie to us.

359
00:25:06,587 --> 00:25:07,987
Why would I do that?

360
00:25:07,987 --> 00:25:09,477
I'll vouch for her.

361
00:25:09,477 --> 00:25:11,917
The one she had last year was bigger than this one.

362
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:13,917
It was fun, to be honest.

363
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:15,387
Count me in, then.

364
00:25:15,387 --> 00:25:16,947
Okay. You are in.

365
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:19,517
Who else wants to come? Come talk to me after the class.

366
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,787
Come talk to me. Come and talk to me after the class!

367
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,707
Come and talk to me after the class!

368
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:29,237
My Queen, are you having a huge birthday party?

369
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,507
You've made some big moves.

370
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:35,467
Do you know that the monthly test is right after the National Day holiday?

371
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,257
Can you get full marks or what?

372
00:25:38,257 --> 00:25:40,057
Can you?

373
00:25:40,057 --> 00:25:41,263
No.

374
00:25:41,263 --> 00:25:43,453
Then watch your behaviors.

375
00:25:43,453 --> 00:25:45,560
Get back to your homework!

376
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:54,017
You are awake.

377
00:26:15,637 --> 00:26:17,337
Coming!

378
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:18,977
Xianxian.

379
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,600
Shadi. Keke. Come in.

380
00:26:24,187 --> 00:26:26,077
No need to change your shoes.

381
00:26:26,077 --> 00:26:27,636
I was just mopping the floor.

382
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:29,836
- Okay.
 - Come inside.

383
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:32,787
You guys have a seat.

384
00:26:33,587 --> 00:26:35,330
Are you alone at home?

385
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,630
Yes. My mom took my brother out

386
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,830
and my dad went back to Keshan.

387
00:26:41,837 --> 00:26:43,420
What brought you here?

388
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,120
To ask you to come to my birthday party.

389
00:26:46,737 --> 00:26:50,707
When Mr. Liu scolded you last time, didn't you say you wouldn't do the party?

390
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:54,753
Don't mention it. That twat, Song Ziqi, didn't react at all.

391
00:26:54,753 --> 00:26:58,997
But the three of us can still hang out.

392
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:04,600
But I have a lot of homework to finish.

393
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,977
Are you crazy?

394
00:27:05,977 --> 00:27:08,933
This is my birthday, Ding Xian.

395
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:13,197
Yeah. You could bring your homework along if you have to.

396
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:19,226
Okay. So, let's go.

397
00:27:19,226 --> 00:27:25,031
Ding Xian, is that what you are wearing for her birthday?

398
00:27:25,031 --> 00:27:28,077
What's wrong with what I'm wearing?

399
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:31,587
I knew it.

400
00:27:31,587 --> 00:27:35,197
Fortunately, I prepared something. Here. Put it on.

401
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:37,607
What's this?

402
00:27:38,177 --> 00:27:40,617
Why would I be wearing it

403
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,977
if it's your birthday?

404
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:44,217
No one would look at me even if I wear it.

405
00:27:44,217 --> 00:27:47,457
Why don't you try it on?

406
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:49,303
Just a second.

407
00:27:50,992 --> 00:27:55,592
What is it now? What's the deal with your bowl cut?

408
00:27:55,592 --> 00:28:00,013
Don't even mention it. What else could be the matter?

409
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:04,197
All right. I'll handle it for you.

410
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:05,597
Let's go.

411
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:06,447
How are you going to handle it?

412
00:28:06,447 --> 00:28:08,577
Fix your bowl cut.

413
00:28:08,577 --> 00:28:10,867
Would it be...

414
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:27,886
I'm going back if you two keep being so lame.

415
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:32,717
This is the most boring birthday I've ever had.

416
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:36,577
I'm so miserable!

417
00:28:36,577 --> 00:28:40,227
Why don't I go shopping with you?

418
00:28:40,227 --> 00:28:41,337
Boring.

419
00:28:41,337 --> 00:28:43,097
How about the amusement park?

420
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,297
Also boring.

421
00:28:46,547 --> 00:28:48,807
- So, what do you want?
 - I want a crowd.

422
00:28:48,807 --> 00:28:50,497
I want to party.

423
00:28:50,497 --> 00:28:55,007
I want him to be here with me.

424
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:03,197
I knew you would be here.

425
00:29:05,217 --> 00:29:06,497
Aren't you having a birthday party?

426
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:07,667
Where are the others?

427
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,890
The birthday party is canceled.

428
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,420
What?

429
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,336
I thought you were not coming.

430
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:17,827
Why would I do that? I have been here for all your birthdays.

431
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,000
This is your gift.

432
00:29:20,547 --> 00:29:22,907
Don't ask me anything again this year.

433
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,300
What happened, My Lady?

434
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,000
She wants a crowd, she wants to party.

435
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,707
And she wants everyone to be here with her.

436
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:38,617
That's it?

437
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:40,307
Come on, let's go sing karaoke.

438
00:29:40,307 --> 00:29:43,827
I'll contact our classmates and invite more people.

439
00:29:43,827 --> 00:29:46,687
Really? All right!

440
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:49,287
Xianxian, let's go together.

441
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:53,607
You guys should go. I need to finish the exercises.

442
00:29:53,607 --> 00:29:58,257
This is my birthday. I want you to be there with me.

443
00:29:58,257 --> 00:30:00,587
I can't sing anyway.

444
00:30:00,587 --> 00:30:02,707
I would be a liability there.

445
00:30:02,707 --> 00:30:05,427
I'll make it up to you after the monthly test.

446
00:30:05,427 --> 00:30:07,327
I swear.

447
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:11,147
Just let her go home. Or her family would be worried.

448
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:15,337
All right. Be careful on the way home.

449
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:16,857
- We are going to leave now.
 - Okay.

450
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,126
See you.

451
00:30:18,126 --> 00:30:19,926
See you.

452
00:30:26,487 --> 00:30:31,487
 Zhou Siyue, the monthly test is coming.

453
00:30:32,307 --> 00:30:38,897
 My parents might transfer me to a liberal arts class if I can't do well.

454
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,117
 I'm so nervous.

455
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:55,317
- I want two.
 - Okay.

456
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:01,377
Here. Take them.

457
00:31:01,377 --> 00:31:02,547
Thank you.

458
00:31:02,547 --> 00:31:04,047
Let's go.

459
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:06,337
Hello. I want a bottle of water.

460
00:31:06,337 --> 00:31:07,837
All right.

461
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:10,137
Here's the money. Take it.

462
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:12,237
Okay. Thanks.

463
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,547
Hello, what would you like?

464
00:31:13,547 --> 00:31:15,867
- A bottle of water, please.
 - All right.

465
00:31:26,497 --> 00:31:30,407
- Here's your cell phone.
 - You! Thief! Don't run!

466
00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:43,737
Hello. What is it?

467
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:46,837
 Siyue, Ding Xian was followed.

468
00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:48,700
Where is she?

469
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,260
 I'll get over there now. You should call someone.

470
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,006
Thief! Give me back my cell phone!

471
00:31:53,006 --> 00:31:54,950
And if I won't?

472
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,477
Bro, there you are.

473
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,867
It's you!

474
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,720
Hey!

475
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:05,626
Stop there!

476
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:07,237
Come back!

477
00:32:07,237 --> 00:32:08,237
Come down now!

478
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:10,608
Stop running! Get back!

479
00:32:11,787 --> 00:32:13,427
Hold there! Get back!

480
00:32:20,427 --> 00:32:22,427
Song Ziqi, come here! We got a problem!

481
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,517
 Open the door! Open the door and come out!

482
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:35,067
 Open up and show yourself!

483
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:36,467
 Open the door now!

484
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:37,857
 Open the door!

485
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:39,257
 Open it and come out!

486
00:32:40,217 --> 00:32:41,217
 Come out now!

487
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:43,137
 Do you think this will be over if you keep hiding there?

488
00:32:43,137 --> 00:32:45,137
 Open the door now! Come out!

489
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:47,097
 Open the door!

490
00:32:48,737 --> 00:32:50,237
Open the door!

491
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,520
Hey!

492
00:32:56,137 --> 00:32:57,137
What are you doing?

493
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:01,257
You are the guy from last time!

494
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:05,307
Listen. This has nothing to do with you.

495
00:33:05,307 --> 00:33:06,807
Leave now!

496
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:09,377
And if I don't?

497
00:33:22,607 --> 00:33:24,427
What are you doing?

498
00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:26,007
You want to get rough here?

499
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:32,377
 Go to hell!

500
00:33:33,187 --> 00:33:34,327
 You want a fight!

501
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:35,827
 Go to hell!

502
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:39,257
 You think you are tough?

503
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:43,847
 Brat!

504
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:47,967
Siyue!

505
00:33:53,017 --> 00:33:53,830
Are you okay?

506
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,150
Hey!  It's another one.

507
00:34:01,547 --> 00:34:03,047
This is boring.

508
00:34:17,507 --> 00:34:19,107
Siyue!

509
00:34:26,947 --> 00:34:28,347
- What are you doing?
 - Who are you?

510
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,007
Leave if you don't want to die.

511
00:34:31,617 --> 00:34:32,720
Let's go.

512
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,720
Let's go, come on.

513
00:34:34,894 --> 00:34:36,394
Ding Xian.

514
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:52,707
Xianxian, are you all right?

515
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:54,377
I was so worried!

516
00:34:57,617 --> 00:34:59,317
I'll walk her home.

517
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:01,913
 We should also leave. They might call in more people.

518
00:35:01,913 --> 00:35:02,913
Let's go.

519
00:35:05,297 --> 00:35:06,637
Come on!

520
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:09,267
No. We haven't celebrated my birthday yet.

521
00:35:10,187 --> 00:35:13,067
I'll go celebrate your birthday with you. Let's go sing karaoke. Come on.

522
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:36,577
Okay.

523
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:38,467
Go inside.

524
00:35:40,187 --> 00:35:42,187
Are you hurt?

525
00:35:42,187 --> 00:35:43,187
No.

526
00:35:43,957 --> 00:35:45,787
How is that possible?

527
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:48,097
Don't worry.

528
00:35:48,097 --> 00:35:50,907
They will never look for you again.

529
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,197
How did you find me?

530
00:35:54,197 --> 00:35:59,547
Jiang Chen accidentally saw someone following you, so he called me.

531
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:06,677
Did you see the text I sent you?

532
00:36:07,607 --> 00:36:09,007
Yes.

533
00:36:09,987 --> 00:36:11,387
You just...

534
00:36:12,097 --> 00:36:13,617
try to relax.

535
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:15,767
Don't get yourself stressed out.

536
00:36:17,027 --> 00:36:20,017
I did well in the last weekly math test.

537
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:23,777
I think the monthly test won't be a problem.

538
00:36:24,947 --> 00:36:28,577
It seems that you are doing well without me.

539
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:30,277
Of course.

540
00:36:31,637 --> 00:36:33,437
No.

541
00:36:35,057 --> 00:36:38,967
I would do better if you were here.

542
00:36:42,297 --> 00:36:43,797
Okay.

543
00:36:44,817 --> 00:36:45,817
Go home.

544
00:36:47,377 --> 00:36:48,377
All right.

545
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:59,457
Zhou Siyue, you will do a good job...

546
00:37:01,717 --> 00:37:04,047
and I will stay in the science class.

547
00:37:05,187 --> 00:37:06,587
Break a leg.

548
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:09,177
Break a leg.

549
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,157
I'm leaving now.

550
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,920

551
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,863
Mom, you scared the hell out of me.

552
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:01,817
You finally remembered to come home!

553
00:38:01,817 --> 00:38:02,817
I...

554
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:05,987
Whose clothes are you wearing?

555
00:38:08,297 --> 00:38:10,027
They are from a classmate.

556
00:38:10,027 --> 00:38:14,337
It's her birthday, so we went out together.

557
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:15,747
Fine.

558
00:38:15,747 --> 00:38:17,427
The monthly test is coming.

559
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:18,747
If you can't do well...

560
00:38:18,747 --> 00:38:19,847
I know.

561
00:38:20,537 --> 00:38:22,707
Mom, I will keep learning.

562
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:50,330
♫  Can I spend the night?  ♫

563
00:38:50,337 --> 00:38:51,237
 Hello?

564
00:38:53,907 --> 00:38:56,060
Are you back?

565
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,700
Yes.

566
00:38:57,707 --> 00:38:59,347
I'm in my dorm.

567
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:04,957
Were you scolded after you went back?

568
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,490
How is that possible?

569
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,520
The teachers never caught me.

570
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,290
♫  It's been a long day since you're gone  ♫

571
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:14,697
That's great.

572
00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:19,307
I'm relieved that you are fine.

573
00:39:19,307 --> 00:39:25,990
♫  I am not the one who doesn't wanna fall in love
  that we could have  ♫

574
00:39:26,777 --> 00:39:28,690
 Didn't you say that you would be studying?

575
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:33,810
♫  I'm just the one who doesn't want to give you nothing
 but this glime  ♫

576
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:38,900
♫  You got to stay in the light all right  ♫

577
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,990
♫  I'm gonna be another side  ♫

578
00:39:40,997 --> 00:39:44,257
 Leaving the camp without reporting could get you disqualified.

579
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:45,847
 Do you understand that?

580
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:47,507
 Where did you go? Are you telling me or not?

581
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,807
 If you won't tell me, go run 10 laps and think about what you've done.

582
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,060
♫  You got to stay in the light all right  ♫

583
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,890
♫  I'm going to be another side  ♫

584
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,420
♫  It has been a long day  ♫

585
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,390
♫  A long day haven't heard from you  ♫

586
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,190
♫  And I've been waiting too  ♫

587
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:29,750

588
00:40:32,492 --> 00:40:36,682
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

589
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:41,442
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

590
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,225
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

591
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:51,482
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

592
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:58,332
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

593
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:02,070
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

594
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:08,705
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

595
00:41:08,705 --> 00:41:12,882
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

596
00:41:12,882 --> 00:41:15,952
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

597
00:41:15,952 --> 00:41:18,545
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

598
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:23,758
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

599
00:41:23,758 --> 00:41:26,415
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

600

♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

603
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,322
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

604
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:04,865
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

605
00:42:05,528 --> 00:42:08,142
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

606
00:42:08,142 --> 00:42:10,682
♫  After a long journey  ♫
