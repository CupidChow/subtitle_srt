1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000

2
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:17,696
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,082
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:26,862
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:31,934
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,148 --> 00:00:36,740
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,389
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:47,448
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:55,890
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,874
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:04,208
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,321
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:09,574
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,574 --> 00:01:14,800
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,888
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:20,240
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,403
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:31,437

19
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,405

20
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,590
Hey.

21
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,629
Make my deskmate happy.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,200
If you can do that, I'll give you three-shot handicap.

23
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,950
Little Monster, you are a generous person.

24
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,980
Please forgive me.

25
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,696
Never mind. I'll let this go.

26
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:00,726
Siyue, let's play!

27
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:52,726
 A little to your left.

28
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:56,033
 You scared me.

29
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:58,490
- Sure. 
 - But we have to trade.

30
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,580
- Then maybe forget about it. 
 - I'm going to seriously consider this.

31
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,090
Little Monster, you are so nice.

32
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,490
You are not angry, and you are giving me chocolate.

33
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,190
This is for Shadi.

34
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,653
Thank you, Ding Xian.

35
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:15,240
Here.

36
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,483
Little Princess, can I have one?

37
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:19,270
You are calling me princess now.

38
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,120
Why didn't you do that earlier? No.

39
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,980
We've known each other for so long. Why can't I have a piece of chocolate?

40
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,030
I'm not giving you any.

41
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,780
- Haojie, chocolate. 
 - Thank you, Shadi.

42
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,726
Little Monster, can I have one?

43
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:32,526
Sure.

44
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,595
Xian, you should have some, too.

45
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,830
 Xian, it takes time to get familiar with your classmates.

46
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,260
 In time, you will find that everyone has a kind side.

47
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:55,029
Here.

48
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,620
Snacks are banned in the classroom.

49
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,390
Really?

50
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,720
Then why did I see you having Bugles the other day?

51
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,800
It's in the Campus Code Article 11.

52
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,860
Ding Xian, didn't you read it?

53
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,359
Come on, please!  Who would read that?

54
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,959
Yeah!

55
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,760
Besides, even if you are going to have chocolate, it can't be this kind of stuff.

56
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,550
The chocolate I usually have are all imported.

57
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,400
Siyue, if you like chocolate, I'll bring you some tomorrow.

58
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,280
Why are you eating that?

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,150
I'm a little hypoglycemic.

60
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:49,250
I'm going back to my seat.

61
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,680
- Bye-bye! 
 - Bye-bye!

62
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:11,417
Siyue!

63
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:13,043
- Where is your bike? 
 - I didn't ride it.

64
00:05:13,043 --> 00:05:14,647
Why?

65
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,007
Why do you have so many questions?

66
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:20,650
Just a second. I have another question.

67
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,480
I noticed that you've been paying a lot of attention to Little Monster.

68
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,730
We are classmates and our parents are close.

69
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,670
What's wrong with us taking care of each other a little?

70
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,670
That's not it.

71
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,040
Something is not right with you.

72
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,540
There's a story!

73
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,120
You are the one who's not right.

74
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,148
So, are you still coming to the game room on Saturday?

75
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,070
Xianxian!

76
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,820
Go help me pick up your little brother from the extra-curricular class.

77
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,610
If he's not nearby, look for him in the game room. He will be there.

78
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,016
He went to the game room again?

79
00:05:55,016 --> 00:05:56,480
It's the weekend. It's okay to have a little fun.

80
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,823
Hurry up.

81
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,830
How did I forget that?

82
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,630
Go now.

83
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,550
Ding Juncong, we are going home.

84
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,070
Just one more game.

85
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,760
You want another game?

86
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,820
You don't agree?

87
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,930
If that's the case, I will tell Mom that you hit me when we get home.

88
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,410
I hit you?

89
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,760
Ding Juncong, you've learned some skills, have you?

90
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,060
It hurts!

91
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,050
Help! Children trafficking!

92
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,200
- I'm your sister! 
 - It hurts! Let me go!

93
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,353
- Xianxian! 
 - Help!

94
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:33,596
Isn't this the spicy girl?

95
00:06:34,656 --> 00:06:37,760
Come on, I'm kidding. Don't take that seriously.

96
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
I'll get some coins.

97
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:46,116
Move your seat back on Monday.

98
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,510
I was going to call you last night to hang out together.

99
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,312
Then, I realized that I don't have your number.

100
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:57,582
Write it down for me next time.

101
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,100
Ding Xian, we should switch seats on Monday.

102
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,160
I didn't mean to steal your seat.

103
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,050
Don't be mad at me.

104
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,200
Besides, Siyue also talked with me.

105
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,550
What did he say?

106
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,890
He said that you had a poor foundation.

107
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,640
He would be able to help you with your courses, if you sit in the back.

108
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,140
And he said that it was my responsibility as the monitor.

109
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,680
So, that's settled. We are switching our seats back on Monday.

110
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,960
I'm going to buy you something to eat.

111
00:07:28,076 --> 00:07:30,176
I've got the coins.

112
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,860
Come on. Let's go challenge the leaderboard.

113
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,520
What are you staring at?

114
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,320
Go have some fun.

115
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,670
Who told you that I had a poor foundation?

116
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,550
That's up to you.

117
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,246
Do you want to move your seat back or do you want to keep being He Xingwen's deskmate?

118
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,010
- You... 
 - You are welcome.

119
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,130
Little Brother.

120
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,832
Thank you, Brother.

121
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,490
Let's go.

122
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,960
Just go!

123
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,930
I just can't find a competitor.

124
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,000
You just won a few games. What's all the fuss about?

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,550
Little Monster, dance with me.

126
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,830
I'm not dancing with him. Come on, let's dance.

127
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,840
- I don't know how to do that. 
 - It's okay. Come on.

128
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,520
- I really can't. 
 - Come on.

129
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,413
Have a try.

130
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,050
Just have a try.

131
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,266
- Come on! 
 - I really can't do that.

132
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,814
Take him down a peg or two.

133
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,905
Hey!

134
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,080
Brother Song, you are not that good.

135
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
Just wait and see.

136
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,460

137
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:36,340
That's really impressive.

138
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,380
I can't accept this. I want another round.

139
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,810
Why not just admit that you lost?

140
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,646
Come on, let's go play the prize claw.

141
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:45,628
Come on, let's go together!

142
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:52,727
What are you doing?

143
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,872
That one looks nice.

144
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,950
The rabbit is really cute.

145
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,680
Or maybe that piggy.

146
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,115
I like that one!

147
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:09,265
Are you really a girl?

148
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:10,370
That one is cute.

149
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,520
Come on.

150
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,783
You play with her.

151
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:14,670
This girl has been quite out there today.

152
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,776
- She kept beating me. 
 - Boring!

153
00:10:16,776 --> 00:10:18,696
Are you afraid to compete?

154
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,910
- What do you have in mind? 
 - Say it!

155
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,670
This one, then. The prize claw.

156
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,030
You first.

157
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,390
Here. What do you want?

158
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,940
This one.

159
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,280
Nice, Siyue. That's impressive.

160
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,880
- Wanwan, which one do you want? 
 - This one.

161
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,380
Okay.

162
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,340
Sorry, Wanwan.

163
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,840
Come on.

164
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:26,280
Which one do you want?

165
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,520
I'll get it myself.

166
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,080
Sister, you can't do it.

167
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,620
Just let Siyue get it for you.

168
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,710
I'm going to call it a day. I need to get him home.

169
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,676
Come on, let's go home.

170
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,730
You are leaving?

171
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,550
We are back!

172
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,570
There you are.

173
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,130
Wash your hands. Time for dinner.

174
00:12:21,176 --> 00:12:23,680
How have you been doing at school?

175
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,030
Pretty good.

176
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:30,320
Help your brother with math tonight if you have the time.

177
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,375
Right, Mom. I want a cell phone.

178
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,470
My classmates are asking for my number. I don't even have one.

179
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,753
Focus on studies at your age. Why bother to keep in contact with your classmates?

180
00:12:47,753 --> 00:12:51,110
A new cell phone would cost a lot. I don't have that kind of money.

181
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,560
I didn't see any objection from you when Ding Juncong went to the game hall.

182
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,610
He's just a kid. Why are you comparing yourself with him?

183
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,610
Eat your food.

184
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,310
- Mr. Liu. 
 - Siyue, why aren't you going inside?

185
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,670
Mr. Liu, I need to ask your permission for something.

186
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,200
What is it?

187
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,252
Can you make Ding Xian my deskmate again?

188
00:13:18,953 --> 00:13:22,113
Zhou Siyue, you've just become a high schooler.

189
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:25,543
You should focus on your studies.

190
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:26,726
I know that.

191
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:31,104
Then tell me, why do you have to be deskmates with Ding Xian?

192
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:32,780
Good morning, Ding Xian.

193
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,710
- Morning. 
 - Do I still get free breakfast today?

194
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,969
Not today.

195
00:13:36,969 --> 00:13:38,869
Okay.

196
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,167
Switch seats.

197
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:46,861
You are moving back!

198
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,340
You have a lot of books. Let me help you.

199
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,140
Okay.

200
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,150
I just realized that Liu Xiaofeng is quite complicated.

201
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,673
You are the most complicated person in the room.

202
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:05,683
That's not right. We are about the same.

203
00:14:05,683 --> 00:14:08,380
Aren't you helping Little Monster switch seats?

204
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,451
How did you manage to do that?

205
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,080
 Here's the thing.

206
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,690
 Mr. Ding helped me with politics before.

207
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,080
 Ding Xian doesn't have many friends in the class for now.

208
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,580
 I'll help her a little to return the favor.

209
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,808
 Returning the favor.

210
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,730
 Do you think I would believe you?

211
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,680
 Who are you waiting for?

212
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,790
 - Mr. Ding. 
 - Mr. Liu.

213
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,030
 Good morning, Mr. Ding.

214
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,670
 Good morning.

215
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,193
 Siyue, is the question you asked me the other day clear to you now?

216
00:14:43,193 --> 00:14:44,640
 I figured it out.

217
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,420
 Siyue is such a hard-working student.

218
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,700
 I hope Xian could be more like you.

219
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,280
 I was just talking to Mr. Liu about making Ding Xian my deskmate again.

220
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,880
 Ding Xian is doing better in liberal arts subjects.

221
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,113
 She can help me, too.

222
00:15:02,113 --> 00:15:06,760
 That's great. You two can be partners and learn from each other.

223
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,420
 It's a good thing.

224
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,820
 Mr. Liu, sorry for the trouble.

225
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,250
 - Yes. 
 - Thank you.

226
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,780
 - Sure. It's all for their education. 
 - That's right.

227
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,362
 - I need to go now. 
 - Okay.

228
00:15:17,362 --> 00:15:19,565
 Go back to class!

229
00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:21,873
 - Mr. Liu, thank you. 
 - Not at all.

230
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:23,060
 Xianxian...

231
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,940
Impressive!

232
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,000
So, I'm going to the PE class now.

233
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:37,083
You are back.

234
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:44,527
Xianxian, this is for you.

235
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:46,340
You got it!

236
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,200
I didn't.

237
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,590
Your deskmate got it and asked me to give it to you.

238
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,420
Let's go. Time for class.

239
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,020
All right!

240
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,840
You are welcome. It was convenient for me.

241
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,400
Why did you get that for me?

242
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,540
All the girls had one.

243
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,340
So I thought I could also get you one.

244
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,936
You are quite considerate.

245
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:16,126
To everyone, it seems.

246
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,110
Give it back if you don't want it.

247
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,050
I do want it. Who said that I didn't?

248
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,690
Give it to me!

249
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,250
You can have it.

250
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,120
I don't want such an ugly dinosaur.

251
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,570
It's not ugly.

252
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,520
And it's clearly a crocodile.

253
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,590
It is a dinosaur.

254
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,465
Look!  It looks just like you.

255
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:02,950
Don't make this personal.

256
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,070
- Dinosaur! 
 - Crocodile!

257
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,320
This is a dinosaur!

258
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,580
It's clearly a crocodile!

259
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,460
See for yourself! It's a dinosaur baby!

260
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,090
From now on, I will be your owner.

261
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,737
And you are a crocodile because I said so.

262
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:36,040
Why are you two stalling? Time for class!

263
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
Coming.

264
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:44,226
 Dear diary.

265
00:17:44,226 --> 00:17:50,490
 My high school life which I once considered miserable is getting better.

266
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,010
The distance between people...

267
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:12,671
What are you looking at?

268
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,310
I'm thinking why do we have to learn math?

269
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,443
Do we need to use functions to get results for formulas when we buy groceries?

270
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,950
It's probably used to eliminate students with poor performance like us.

271
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,610
The situation is grim, my deskmate.

272
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,760
Never mind.

273
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,430
I am just a hopeless person.

274
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:56,510
I have no ambitions and I never thought about key universities.

275
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,777
My target is a top public university in another province.

276
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:05,280
A top public university in another province?

277
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,700
I want to go to Hangzhou.

278
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,640
Hangzhou?

279
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,340
Nice.

280
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,780
It's pretty.

281
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,180
Have you been to Hangzhou?

282
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,780
So, have you visited West Lake and Leifeng Pagoda?

283
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,016
And Broken Bridge by the pagoda!

284
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:26,656
You have watched "White Snake" too many times.

285
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
White Snake?

286
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,200
You can ask me questions.

287
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,130
You don't even listen during classes.

288
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,130
Would you know what I'm talking about if I ask you?

289
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,456
I'm still better without listening.

290
00:19:47,456 --> 00:19:49,275
Give me your test paper.

291
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,830
The most important thing in math is the way you look at questions.

292
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,920
Take this question as an example.

293
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,140
We already know that Tan α equals 2.

294
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,970
So, we can conclude that Sin α is twice Cos α, right?

295
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,190
Then, we use the formula

296
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,410
and we would get the result of Sin α times Cos α equals two-fifths.

297
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,950
What are you smiling about?

298
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,070
Write it down.

299
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,209
You didn't listen at all, did you?

300
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:32,020
I did.

301
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,930
- What did I say? 
 - You said that...

302
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,070
You are truly hopeless! You can't remember anything.

303
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,340
I wonder how you got in here.

304
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:45,130
I know someone who's awesome.

305
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,810
He encouraged me to get into this place.

306
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,045
Is he the senior

307
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:54,790
who you had lunch with?

308
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,520
I used to do poorly at school when I was little.

309
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,730
The others can memorize 26 letters really quickly and I spent a month doing the same.

310
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,280
Then, I met Su Bocong.

311
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,586
He told me that...

312
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,420
there's nothing the others can do and I can't.

313
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,180
If I can't do it, that means I wasn't working hard enough.

314
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,900
And don't deny him. He was actually right.

315
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,850
Because of what he said, I decided to put in more effort.

316
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,500
If it takes the others one hour, I'll put in two hours.

317
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,680
That's why you always study until 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. and show up in class all tired out.

318
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:45,159
Do you think everyone can remember things after just one look like you do?

319
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,210
The difference between people is not that huge.

320
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,060
You are encountering so many problems now because you are using the wrong method.

321
00:21:57,123 --> 00:21:58,630
Look at your notes.

322
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:03,060
Didn't I tell you to note down just the key points?

323
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,400
How are you going to remember all that if you write everything down?

324
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,486
It would be weird if you can get good marks.

325
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,180
Then, please, tell me more about it.

326
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,250
That depends on you.

327
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,680
Please explain this question again.

328
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,720
 Time for dinner!

329
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,752
 Ding Xian, let me see your notes!

330
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,860
Xian, come and have dinner.

331
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,946
Ding Xian, why do your notes keep getting thinner?

332
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,552
Have you been slacking off?

333
00:23:01,552 --> 00:23:04,652
Mom, that's because I only noted down key points.

334
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:07,000
What key points?

335
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,363
You are clearly slacking off.

336
00:23:08,363 --> 00:23:10,593
I'm not.

337
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,362
Mom, your learning system is outdated.

338
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:22,140
To be honest, the notes are clearer now.

339
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,110
Stop looking and eat. The food is getting cold.

340
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,520
Zhou Siyue told me to keep notes like that.

341
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,800
You should learn from him.

342
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,546
That's what I thought.

343
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,756
Dad! Mom! I have become the monitor!

344
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,910
You are the monitor now?

345
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,060
That's a good thing.

346
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,830
My son is so awesome. You make me proud.

347
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,760
I will take you to the grocery store to buy something delicious.

348
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,280
I think we are having a cadres election soon.

349
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,710
Really? What do you have in mind?

350
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,823
I haven't decided yet.

351
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,886
Would that drag down your performance?

352
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:07,950
No.

353
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,378
If you ask me, Xianxian, you are good at drawing.

354
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:13,680
You would be more than competent to be an art committee member.

355
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,222
I think Xian's drawings are enough to represent the school in competitions. Am I right?

356
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:21,940
My sister is a coward. She won't participate in the election.

357
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,050
- Who said that? 
 - You are a coward.

358
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,099
You are a coward.

359
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,380
All right! Enough.

360
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,810
You are participating. You must.

361
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:34,590
If Xianxian can also be a cadre, then we would have two cadres at home.

362
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,526
It's a good thing.

363
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,304
Your breakfast.

364
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:07,314
When did you go to bed last night?

365
00:25:07,314 --> 00:25:09,330
1:00.

366
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,210
What about you?

367
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,085
3:00.

368
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:18,186
You work really hard.

369
00:25:18,186 --> 00:25:19,970
Not really.

370
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,680
I played games the whole night.

371
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,680
Of course you did.

372
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:33,130
Can you walk faster? Are you a snail?

373
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,346
My backpack is too heavy.

374
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:40,440
That's because you are bringing all the books that we don't need.

375
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,720
Of course, yours would be heavy.

376
00:25:57,466 --> 00:25:59,266
Hurry up.

377
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,210
We are at school now. I can carry it myself.

378
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:13,233
Hurry.

379
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,207
Siyue,

380
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,049
it's been a while.

381
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:20,146
Have you recovered?

382
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:23,896
Yes. But I'm really behind at school.

383
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:25,616
You will catch up.

384
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:28,772
I hope that's true. See you in the classroom later.

385
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,170
Is she the classmate who asked for a leave?

386
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,110
She's Yang Chunzi.

387
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,280
Siyue, isn't that Yang Chunzi?

388
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,426
She looks so much better than she did in junior high.

389
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:47,820
Why do I feel something changed between you and Zhou Siyue?

390
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,253
He even carried your backpack.

391
00:26:50,253 --> 00:26:54,030
That's not true. My backpack is too heavy.

392
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,810
I really want to be Yang Chunzi's deskmate.

393
00:27:17,257 --> 00:27:19,540
- What did you say? 
 - That hurts!

394
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,720
I said that I really wanted to be your deskmate.

395
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,190
Really?

396
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:29,270
Why did I hear you say that you want to be Yang Chunzi's deskmate?

397
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,503
No. You heard it wrong. How is that possible?

398
00:27:31,503 --> 00:27:33,640
You are so much better than she is.

399
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,350
Stop. That hurts!

400
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,940
- Are you still trying to lie? 
 - I will say it!

401
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,398
Yang Chunzi has good performance, popularity, and looks.

402
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:43,820
Stop! Why are you still hurting me when I'm speaking the truth?

403
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,340
I want to hear the truth. Keep talking.

404
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,521
Let me go and hear me out.

405
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:53,460
The thing is I don't care if she's popular or not.

406
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,950
Don't you know that?

407
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,540
She and Siyue were pretty close when we were in junior high.

408
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,760
Am I right, Siyue?

409
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,920
What?

410
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,340
Did you forget that?

411
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,680
Everyone said that you were made for each other in junior high.

412
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,980
You are so boring.

413
00:28:10,192 --> 00:28:12,192
Don't be mad.

414
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,840
What are you thinking about?

415
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,440
Nothing.

416
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,640
Chunzi! Over here!

417
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,310
Pretentious.

418
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,010
Jealousy makes people ugly.

419
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,970
Really?

420
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,410
Aren't you jealous? She's sitting beside Zhou Siyue!

421
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,630
What does that have to do with me?

422
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:54,802
Do you think everyone likes girls like her?

423
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,710
Maybe. Perhaps.

424
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,860
But to be honest, I think you would be so much prettier than her with some work.

425
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,820
Really? It's just that your forehead is a little high.

426
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,040
Why don't you try to get bangs?

427
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,310
No. My mom once went to a fortune teller

428
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,300
who said that with a big forehead, I will be an officer. I can't cover it.

429
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,490
Come on, you would believe that?

430
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,630
All right. Eat your food. We have an election this afternoon.

431
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:28,130
Does that mean you will participate, too?

432
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,700
I want to try.

433
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,462
Stand up!

434
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,300
 Hello, Teacher.

435
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,100
Sit down.

436
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,350
This semester has been going on for a while now.

437
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,920
I believe that all of you have gotten used to life in high school.

438
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,230
We will have a lot of activities.

439
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,760
And we need people to do the organizing and managing.

440
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,770
Today, we will elect cadres for our class.

441
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,110
First, our monitor.

442
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,040
Deng Wanwan has been the acting monitor for a while.

443
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,970
Is there anyone else who wants to sign up?

444
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,460
My classmates. I've been the acting monitor for a while now.

445
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,560
I've been nothing but dedicated.

446
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,970
I hope that you can make this official. Thank you.

447
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,040
 Great.

448
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,620
Study Representative.

449
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,880
Zhou Siyue, I think you can do this.

450
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,946
I'll pass, Mr. Liu. Sorry.

451
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:34,420
Then, He Xingwen. You take the job.

452
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,886
I...

453
00:30:35,886 --> 00:30:37,886
Okay.

454
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:39,260
Sports Representative.

455
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,730
I...

456
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,010
Sit down. Can you let me have it?

457
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,660
No. We need to be fair and square.

458
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,160
You can borrow my limited-edition basketball.

459
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,960
I...

460
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,860
Think you are the right person.

461
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:55,110
Trust me, guys. I will let you have fun in PE classes.

462
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,360
Arts Representative.

463
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,533
Is anyone signing up for Arts Representative?

464
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,200
Ding Xian, Arts Representative! You are up!

465
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,920
Come on!

466
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,350
My name's Yang Chunzi.

467
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,830
I love singing, dancing, and painting.

468
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,920
I was an art representative in junior high for three years.

469
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,859
If I can be elected, I will be more strict with myself and do my best to serve you.

470
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:28,738
I will not let you down.

471
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:31,210
Great.

472
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Okay, Yang Chunzi.

473
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,490
Here's a form.

474
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,900
Send it out after class.

475
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,280
Guys, go back and fill out your personal information and skills.

476
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,530
Get them back to me in two days, all right?

477
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,780
Next, Environment Representative.

478
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,700
Mr. Liu, I've always loved cleaning.

479
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,680
It's what I'm good at.

480
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,580
Okay. Let's put your skill to good use.

481
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,480
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

482
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,720
Xiaofeng, are you done?

483
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,210
Xian, why did you cover the skill blank with ink?

484
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,580
I just saw your painting the other day and it's pretty good.

485
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,974
Marinated Egg Man.

486
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:27,184
Why does that look so familiar?

487
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,920
Ding Xian, you are so good at drawing.

488
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,830
Although, I also think it looks familiar.

489
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:45,060
Ding Xian, would you be interested to do our blackboard newspaper with me?

490
00:32:46,187 --> 00:32:48,230
All right. Great.

491
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,276
The theme of our first issue shall be National Day in Golden Autumn.

492
00:32:51,276 --> 00:32:53,280
But someone will check it next week.

493
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,760
So, you'll have to stay behind after school this week.

494
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,780
Okay.

495
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,520
- Are you done? 
 - Yes.

496
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,800
Siyue.

497
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,400
Thank you.

498
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,360
See you.

499
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:23,310
Are you a little jealous of me?

500
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,136
Me, jealous of you?

501
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,210
Why would I be jealous of you?

502
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,900
No reason.

503
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,440
It's nothing.

504
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,960
Are you really going to do the blackboard newspaper with her?

505
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,950
Yes. I have already promised her.

506
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,920
She's always pretentious.

507
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,052
If she ever gives you a hard time, tell me.

508
00:33:51,052 --> 00:33:52,640
I think she's nice.

509
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,590
She's so gentle to everyone.

510
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,560
Big Brother, she made it look that way!

511
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,760
Do you understand?

512
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,430
If you get her hairstyle and say all the phony things,

513
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,110
you would be just like her.

514
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,996
- Like this! 
 - Kong Shadi!

515
00:34:05,996 --> 00:34:08,140
You sound a little like her now.

516
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,640
Siyue, it's been a while.

517
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,320
- Copy that! 
 - I'm not doing that.

518
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,020
Siyue!

519
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,670
You look great.

520
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:40,220
She put on perfume.

521
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,700
It was all your fault.

522
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,900
I'm serious!

523
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,190
Give me a three-shot handicap today.

524
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,090
Nice try!

525
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,980
Or I can keep making your deskmate happy today,

526
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,940
and you can give me a three-shot handicap in return.

527
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,710
You are so boring.

528
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,710
Fine. You are so stubborn, Zhou Siyue.

529
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,470
- Let's go. 
 - Ding Xian.

530
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:09,220
Let's stay behind for the blackboard newspaper during the PE class. I have gotten the teacher's permission.

531
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,710
Okay.

532
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,900
Poor you!

533
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,020
I'm going to watch them playing basketball by myself.

534
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,530
I have to go.

535
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,800
The number of girls watching boys from our class playing basketball has been increasing.

536
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,000
Especially Siyue.

537
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:27,057
Whatever. What does this have to do with me?

538
00:35:27,057 --> 00:35:28,016
Stubborn.

539
00:35:28,016 --> 00:35:30,116
Bye-bye. I'm going.

540
00:35:31,127 --> 00:35:32,530
Xuanxuan! I'm going now.

541
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,330
 I'm coming!

542
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,170
Let's get started.

543
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,172
Do you have a structure in mind?

544
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:40,036
We don't have that kind of time. You can do whatever you can.

545
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:41,950
I'll find some sentences and write them down.

546
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,950
Okay.

547
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,556
Why don't you use mine?

548
00:35:50,556 --> 00:35:52,770
He doesn't like people messing with his stuff.

549
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,320
It doesn't matter if it's me.

550
00:35:57,013 --> 00:36:00,363
 They have a special relationship.

551
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:05,649
What's wrong, Brother Song?

552
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:07,380
I'm so pissed at those guys from Class 8.

553
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,430
I'll hit them every time I see them. They always bring bad luck!

554
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,290
Enough. We'll beat them next weekend.

555
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,993
Oh, right! The robot contest that you signed up for is beginning. Right?

556
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:24,120
Do you know which one of my memories was triggered?

557
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,770
I remembered that you and Yang Chunzi

558
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,290
were a couple in fate back then.

559
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,380
You worked so well together.

560
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,280
Now that she's back in our class, aren't you feeling a little strange?

561
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,670
That's not strange.

562
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,720
I think Brother Song must be having mixed feelings right now.

563
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,180
No. I won't do something like that.

564
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,510
Is it so obvious?

565
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,320
Yang Chunzi!

566
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,480
Have you lived long enough? You...

567
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,750
Yang Chunzi, what are you doing?

568
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,550
I'm doing the blackboard newspaper.

569
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,760
You are back.

570
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,892
You are slacking off.

571
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:06,370
Did you draw this, Little Monster?

572
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,020
Impressive!

573
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,320
Or what? Did you draw it?

574
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:16,276
I realized that you have become angrier after you become Siyue's deskmate.

575
00:37:19,046 --> 00:37:22,530
Yang Chunzi, this must be your work.

576
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,790
It looks good whether the colors, or the shape...

577
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,890
Does it look good?

578
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:28,920
What are you doing?

579
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,850
What do you mean by that?

580
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,589
Can't you be more like Yang Chunzi? Don't...

581
00:37:32,589 --> 00:37:34,580
- Why should I be more like her? 
 - Don't keep hitting me!

582
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,260
- I want to hit you! 
 - I'm warning you, stop hitting me!

583
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,260
Xian, you face...

584
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,910
Looks so much better than usual.

585
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,520
Yes. Like you are wearing makeup. Look.

586
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:12,673
Am I right?

587
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,180
Not at all!

588
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,581
I was helping you.

589
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:21,093
- You did that on purpose. 
 - You would have fallen.

590
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:24,510
- You did that on purpose. Stop talking. 
 - This is how couples fight. Right?

591
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,420
I think so.

592
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,320
- Shut up! 
 - Shut up!

593
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:45,890
Never b-been... Never been to middle school, I try... look at you—

594
00:38:45,896 --> 00:38:47,996
Not right.

595
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,990
Never been to middle school, I pre—

596
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,460
What are you snickering at?

597
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,670
Because I saw someone doing a last-minute thing again.

598
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,050
At least I can do that.

599
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:11,030
How about you? Did you memorize the whole English text?

600
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,150
How is that possible? There are so many new words.

601
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,430
You memorized that over one night?

602
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,420
Not one night.

603
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,040
I just read it a couple of times.

604
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:26,746
Aren't you the best, ace man?

605
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:33,560
I can't finish in time. Give it back.

606
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,860
Are you memorizing Chinese or English?

607
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:44,240
- Knock it off! 
 - I'm not joking!

608
00:39:45,173 --> 00:39:47,390
You need to remember the phonetic transcriptions!

609
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,400
Why would anyone memorize English with Chinese?

610
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,246
What do you care?

611
00:39:52,246 --> 00:39:55,366
I think this works.

612
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,020
Have all of you memorized the text as I have required yesterday?

613
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,710
Do we have a volunteer?

614
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:10,870
If not, I'm going to call your names.

615
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:14,510
Ding Xian. You first.

616
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,460
My name is Wang Kun.

617
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,554
Ever since middle school...

618
00:40:26,554 --> 00:40:30,040
I have...

619
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,350
What are you laughing about?

620
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:38,160
You need to practice your oral English. Recite it for me later.

621
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,929
Sit down.

622
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,800
Yang Chunzi, have a try.

623
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,700
My name is Wang Kun.

624
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,200
Ever since middle school,

625
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,007
my sister Wang Wei and I have dreamed about taking a great bike trip...

626
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:08,116
Xianxian.

627
00:41:09,706 --> 00:41:12,186
These are the English tutorial materials you need.

628
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,190
Thank you, Senior.

629
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,960
Did your English teacher criticize your accent?

630
00:41:22,786 --> 00:41:26,460
It's normal. We never even learned the proper pronunciations of letters.

631
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,900
You just need to practice more with the tape.

632
00:41:37,716 --> 00:41:39,916
Do you have something on your mind?

633
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:47,340
There's a girl in our class who's so good.

634
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,570
She's pretty and is good at studies.

635
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,660
And she's popular.

636
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:57,570
Besides, I think my deskmate cares about her a lot.

637
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,620
So, is it her that you care about or your deskmate?

638
00:42:06,236 --> 00:42:09,122
Your deskmate is a boy, right?

639
00:42:09,122 --> 00:42:12,040
No. It's not like that.

640
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,470
We are in puberty. It's understandable.

641
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:18,290
I was telling you the truth. He's just a friend.

642
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,470
When did you start to gossip?

643
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,840
Okay. I'll stop making fun of you.

644
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,530
Come on, let's go back.

645
00:42:34,748 --> 00:42:38,548
Zhou Siyue, where is Ding Xian?

646
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,435
She went to the bathroom.

647
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:48,752
You are still sleeping. Wake up!

648
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,120
Where did you go?

649
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,190
I'm not telling you.

650
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,110
You are escaping class now.

651
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,270
I can do a lot of things.

652
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,430
How great is that?

653
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,330
I copied the notes in English class for you.

654
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:27,040
Look at your handwriting. It's like you were doodling.

655
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,090

657
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:58,090

658
00:44:01,077 --> 00:44:06,667
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

659
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:10,427
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

660
00:44:11,924 --> 00:44:15,810
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

661
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:21,067
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

662
00:44:21,067 --> 00:44:26,917
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

663
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:31,555
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

664
00:44:31,555 --> 00:44:37,190
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

665
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:41,567
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

666
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:44,537
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

667
00:44:44,537 --> 00:44:47,130
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

668
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:52,427
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

669
00:44:52,427 --> 00:44:55,000
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

670
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,577
♫  After a long journey  ♫

671
00:44:57,577 --> 00:45:02,867
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

672
00:45:23,393 --> 00:45:26,233
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

673
00:45:26,233 --> 00:45:28,907
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

674
00:45:28,907 --> 00:45:33,850
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

675
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:36,727
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

676
00:45:36,727 --> 00:45:39,267
♫  After a long journey  ♫

677
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:44,570
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
