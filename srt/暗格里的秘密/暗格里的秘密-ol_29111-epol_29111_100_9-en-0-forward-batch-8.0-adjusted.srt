1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,670

2
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:26,790
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:31,069
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:34,949
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:40,221
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:44,827
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:48,476
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:55,435
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:55,435 --> 00:01:03,831
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:10,161
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:12,295
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:14,408
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,661
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:22,987
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:24,046 --> 00:01:25,975
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:28,327
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:28,327 --> 00:01:35,576
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:39,470

19
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:42,164

20
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,380
Didn't you say that you would be studying?

21
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,280
You didn't even open your book.

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,300
I was just about to.

23
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,730
Mom, go get some rest.

24
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,510
I will study.

25
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,000
Take it out.

26
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,130
Who were you talking to?

27
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,190
A classmate.

28
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,021
Which one? You're still chatting at this hour.

29
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,630
I was asking him about the homework.

30
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,870
Mom,

31
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,570
I promise that I will never

32
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,070
talk on the phone at night again.

33
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,160
I'm just keeping it for you.

34
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,650
This is for your own good.

35
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,213
Focus on your studies.

36
00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:56,373
Finish the fruit.

00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,390
Thank you.

43
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,890
Make a wish.

44
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,190
Blow them out in one breath.

45
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,560
All right!

46
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,600
No need to thank me.

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,000
Just have fun.

48
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,570
Go on!

49
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,000
Kong Shadi, it's really you!

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's been a while.

51
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,030
It's us!

52
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,110
We used to hang out in junior high.

53
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,510
Did you forget us?

54
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,550
You are...

55
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,600
It doesn't matter.

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,400
The point is you've become more beautiful now.

57
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,370
Why didn't you invite the two of us for your birthday?

58
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,070
What's with that?

59
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,440
I'm just hanging out with my classmates.

60
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,100
I'll invite you next time.

61
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,520
Let's not wait for next time. Come hang out in our room. Come on!

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,620
I'm not going.

63
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,730
Didn't you hear her refusing to go with you?

64
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,570
Who are you? You are interfering out of blue.

65
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,510
You don't know that I'm from the 18th High School, right?

66
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,380
It doesn't matter who I am.

67
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,880
Do you guys know Jiang Chen?

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,380
Yeah.

69
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,830
I was with him just then.

70
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,880
We have been friends for our whole lives.

71
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,920
What's your name? I'll call him and ask about it.

72
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,562
- Wait a second.
 - Don't. Let's just drop this.

73
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:34,670
Do not trouble Brother Chen with this.

74
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,830
Bro, it's a misunderstanding.

75
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,110
Since you know Brother Chen, then we will trouble you no more.

76
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,230
We... We should leave now.

77
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,350
We were just kidding.

78
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,140
Happy birthday.

79
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,540
Take care!

80
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,170
Ziqi, that was awesome.

81
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,410
Let's keep a low profile.

82
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,940
Go on, have fun.

83
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,920
I'm going to have the cake split.

84
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,510
What are you looking at?

85
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,070
Do you feel like you need more friends?

86
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,070
Why would you care who I hang out with?

87
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,220
So, are you going to hang out with them?

88
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,500
You keep hanging out with the wrong group. Am I not unbearable enough?

89
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,830
Focus on learning with me is the right path.

90
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,000
Did you hear me?

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,100
Did you?

92
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,200
Yes. I did.

93
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,540
Let's play a game.

94
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,760
What are we going to play?

95
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,071
Idiom Solitaire!

96
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:41,171
You are so boring.

97
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:42,880
- So boring!
 - Let the birthday girl make that decision.

98
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,920
Shadi! Shadi, tell us. What should we play?

99
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,510
- Idiom Solitaire.
 - See?

100
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:09,295
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

101
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:13,007
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

102
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:18,790
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

103
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,147
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

104
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:29,897
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

105
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:33,435
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

106
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:39,970
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

107
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,447
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

108
00:06:44,444 --> 00:06:47,417
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

109
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:50,010
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

110
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:55,307
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

111
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:57,980
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

112

♫  After a long journey  ♫

113
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:05,047
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

114
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,070
- Mr. Liu.
 - So? Have you thought it through?

115
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,320
Yes.

116
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,950
The abscissa of Point P is 1.

117
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,280
That's wonderful. Listen. About the last question, a lot of students...

118
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,660
Wait. That's not what I asked.

119
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,920
Are you going to tell me where you went last night or what?

120
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,347
Siyue,

121
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:39,620
if you are hiding something,

122
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,410
you can tell me.

123
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,610
I can understand.

124
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,620
But don't keep yourself closed up.

125
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,520
Do you understand?

126
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,720
Yes.

127
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,960
Next time, then.

128
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,660
Wait, you...

129
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,970
- Thank you, Mr. Liu.
 - That kid!

130
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:01,106
Mr. Liu.

131
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,880
I know where Zhou Siyue went.

132
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,500
Why are you everywhere?

133
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,780
Wait.

134
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,127
Tell me. Where did he go last night?

135
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,570
 Hello, what is it?

136
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,890
 Where is she?

137
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,830
 I'll get over there now.

138
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,530
 You should call someone.

139
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,670
Little Monster!

140
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,110
This is an urgent request.

141
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,940
Please hand over your English homework.

142
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,709
Why aren't you borrowing Master Zhou's homework?

143
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:50,570
He just finished the competition and he's taking a nap now.

144
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,590
I don't have the nerve to wake him up.

145
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:57,550
That's why I'm going with the second-best choice and make do with your homework.

146
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,101
You are lucky that you have a choice.

147
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,810
Xianxian,

148
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,930
please hand over your math homework.

149
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,380
You two are truly deskmates.

150
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,170
Thank you.

151
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,180
Guys, we have the results of the monthly test.

152
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,670
Our class adviser said that now that the test was over, he would talk to each one of us.

153
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,788
So, be prepared.

154
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,110
 Why is this happening?

155
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,700
Yes!

156
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,570
What is it?

157
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,370
I got 270 in science comprehensive.

158
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,000
This is perfect.

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,306
I told you I could stay.

160
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,340
Hey.

161
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,790
Yes!

162
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:09,880
Oh, right! My mom took my cell phone away.

163
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,110
I can't make phone calls at night anymore.

164
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,800
Who would call you?

165
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,020
You called me.

166
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,230
It was you.

167
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,730
Did you forget that?

168
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,230
- Who did?
 - It's you.

169
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,500
You are the one who called me.

170
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,380
Who was it did you say?

171
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,321
Stop messing with my hair!

172
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:29,250
- Say that again!
 - What?

173
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,270
Can we focus on the study hall session?

174
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,480
Has fate favored you? You look so happy.

175
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,310
Mom, let me show you something.

176
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,580
I should be able to stay in the science class now.

177
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,090
You did pretty well this time.

178
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,314
That's nothing.

179
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:15,880
Science is not as hard as you think.

180
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,300
Xianxian,

181
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,230
although you did well this time,

182
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,790
- in fact...
 - Stop.

183
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,106
Mom, we have a deal.

184
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:26,587
You would dishonor yourself if you go back on your word now.

185
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,640
Okay. All right. Fine.

186
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,350
You made your bed, now sleep on it.

187
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,780
You'll know how hard it is later.

188
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,980
So,

189
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,590
Mom.

190
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,440
The test is over now.

191
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,670
I would like to...

192
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,000
Like I don't know what you are thinking.

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,500
Thanks, Mom.

194
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:59,612
Just go ahead and play. You will pay for your arrogance.

195
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,570
 [Education Building

196
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,740
The questions in the monthly test are relatively simple.

197
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,490
You have made huge progress,

198
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,180
but your ranking is still low.

199
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,120
Don't let yourself slip.

200
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,720
Yes, Mr. Liu.

201
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:19,096
Ding Xian.

202
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:20,396
Another thing.

203
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,250
I've noticed that you and Zhou Siyue are always chatting.

204
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,860
Did he affect your learning progress?

205
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,740
No, Mr. Liu. That's not true.

206
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,400
But I did hear that you've been quite close.

207
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,520
You have been hanging out in your private time.

208
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,060
Ding Xian, we are at a critical time right now.

209
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,950
You should focus on your studies.

210
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,586
No, Mr. Liu.

211
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:47,333
We are not like that.

212
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:49,078
How about this?

213
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:51,800
Switch your seat with Song Ziqi after you get back.

214
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,690
I will focus on my studies

215
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,220
and stop chatting.

216
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,820
Mr. Liu, don't worry.

217
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,450
If I can't make any progress in the next monthly test,

218
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,500
I will switch my seat before you tell me to.

219
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,590
Who talked to Mr. Liu?

220
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,880
That's really low.

221
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,680
They better not let me find out.

222
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
I think it must be a girl.

223
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,354
She noticed that you are close and felt jealous.

224
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,880
Stop the nonsense.

225
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,370
We are just deskmates.

226
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,780
We might not even be deskmates.

227
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,110
Why?

228
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,710
Mr. Liu asked me to switch seats so that I can focus on learning.

229
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,960
No way!

230
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,790
Why do all the teachers like doing that?

231
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,740
That's not it.

232
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,030
He asked me to switch seats with Song Ziqi.

233
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,510
You can't do that.

234
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,540
I thought you despised him.

235
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,000
I was just saying. Whatever.

236
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,210
You are not right.

237
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,130
We were at the karaoke the other day.

238
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,980
He saw me singing with another guy.

239
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,710
You should have seen his face.

240
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,480
He sat there all silent,

241
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,320
and he offered to walk me home at the end as if nothing happened.

242
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,340
I just felt that he was a little different that day.

243
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,050
Fickle.

244
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,030
You were not like this a few days ago.

245
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,340
You were so pissed when you saw him walking with someone else.

246
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,000
That was a misunderstanding.

247
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,052
Later, he told me that he was just discussing the basketball match with that girl.

248
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,860
How do you know that?

249
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,110
I went to ask her about that.

250
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,530
 Hey, there.

251
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,490
 Can I help you with anything?

252
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:45,490
She's actually a National Rank 2 Athlete in shot put.

253
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,950
You were so close to never seeing me again.

254
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,860
Let's not talk about me.

255
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,310
How about you? When are you switching seats?

256
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,150
After the monthly test.

257
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,020
Let's see how I do by then.

258
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,810
Ding Xian.

259
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,440
Do you know how to answer this question? I've been stuck on this forever.

260
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,540
Let me see.

261
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,840
The function

262
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,950
of ordinate...

263
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,230
Answer.

264
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,340
R is greater than B.

265
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,570
RX is proven to be... 1025!

266
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,280
X equals 1025.

267
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,570
That's impressive.

268
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,670
How about this one?

269
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,540
Let me try.

270
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,110
547!

271
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,560
It's 9 points.

272
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,520
547!

273
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:52,234
Do you know how to do mental calculations?

274
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,590
Don't you get tired when solving questions?

275
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,960
Like your brain gets tired?

276
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,420
No.

277
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,520
I can do a few reading comprehensionwhen I'm tired, just to relax.

278
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,570
A master is a master.

279
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,790
So, are you doing this question?

280
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,800
I don't quite get it.

281
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,840
Can you show me how you did it? I just need the basics.

282
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,450
Sure.

283
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,856
Just ask me if you ever have any questions.

284
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:21,880
All right.

285
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,980
Zhou Siyue!

286
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,070
Let's go play!

287
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:45,960
You asked me out so early just to play basketball?

288
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,620
Have you never heard of a saying from my idol?

289
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,389
Have you ever seen Shenhai at 4:00 a.m?

290
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:55,390
It's 6:00 a.m. now.

291
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,690
It's not that different. Anyway, all achievements take effort.

292
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,090
I've never seen you work so hard with courses.

293
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,780
What's going on with you?

294
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,200
It was just a contest.

295
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,890
Why do you look so tired?

296
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,320
The contest is not tiring.

297
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,150
But explaining questions is exhausting.

298
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,780
You are so strange.

299
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,780
You've never been close to Liu Xiaofeng.

300
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,540
Why are you explaining questions to him every day?

301
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,640
We don't have other participants. I'm leaving.

302
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,400
They will be here soon.

303
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,560
The match is coming. Everyone will be taking every chance to train.

304
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,310
I'm not participating in the match.

305
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,970
Why would I train?

306
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,950
Don't you want to see beautiful girls cheering for you?

307
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,530
How about helping me teach those brats from Class 8 a lesson?

308
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,910
What does that have to do with me?

309
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
But I've signed you up.

310
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,000
The kind that can't be withdrawn.

311
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,400
You keep working on that...

312
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,907
and I'm going to take a nap.

313
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,340
Keep up the good work.

314
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,740
Xianxian.

315
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,950
Why aren't you at the basketball game?

316
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,350
Why bother?

317
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm all about the monthly test now.

318
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,400
Zhou Siyue is also playing.

319
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,640
Aren't you going to watch it?

320
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,540
I thought he was not in the game.

321
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,280
Is this the first day you've known Song Ziqi?

322
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,590
When has he ever done anything without Zhou Siyue?

323
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,190
Class 8 is so arrogant.

324
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,280
They are showing off their posters and banners.

325
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,400
Why don't we make one?

326
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,430
We are not afraid!

327
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:34,230
We won't get back in time if we go print it now.

328
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,710
Hey. Do you have any cardboard?

329
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,420
I can draw something.

330
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,970
How did I forget about Ding Xian?

331
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,950
I'll go get some cardboard.

332
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,920
Bring me that! Hurry up. Come on!

333
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,520
This one. Here.

334
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,220
You guys, get over here.

335
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,490
Guys, a science class never lacks what?

336
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,970
That's right. The answer is boys.

337
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,540
Today is the day that Class 3 is going to show some strength.

338
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,680
Let's just focus on the target and do our best.

339
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,280
But they have cheerleaders.

340
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,710
And they've got a hand-held megaphone.

341
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,190
 Class 8, fighting!

342
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,190
 Class 8, fighting!

343
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,230
 Class 8, fighting!

344
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,950
 Class 8, fighting!

345
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,950
 Class 8, fighting!

346
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,230
So what?

347
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,400
We've got Siyue, the master.

348
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,500
Right?

349
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,229
Dude, please.

350
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:29,820
The girls won't be watching if you don't play.

351
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,040
I told you I don't want to play today.

352
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,220
Suit yourself.

353
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,730
Come on, bros.

354
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:41,350
Break a leg.

355
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,010
One, two three. Fighting!

356
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,870
Ding Xian, you did such a good job.

357
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,950
- I'm going to leave now. Thanks.
 - Thank you, Ding Xian. See you.

358
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,650
Thank you, Ding Xian. See you.

359
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,180
All right. Let's go.

360
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,190
Just a second.

361
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,060
Xianxian.

362
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,600
Can you help me to do another piece saying "Song Ziqi is handsome"?

363
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,140
Something is not right with you.

364
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,230
Just help me.

365
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:24,120
Okay. Song Ziqi is handsome.

366
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,630
What do you mean by that?

367
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,210
Okay. I'll do it. I will.

368
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,900
 Come on!

369
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,900
 Class 8, fighting!

370
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,000
 Class 8, fighting!

371
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,900
 Class 8, fighting!

372
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,400
 Class 8, fighting!

373
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,800
Who would pass a ball like that?

374
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,610
What's the hold-up?

375
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,330
The match has been going on for a while.

376
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,160
Stop rushing us.

377
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,830
Can't you see that we are busy?

378
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,490
It's done.

379
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,380
It's so nice.

380
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,200
Look. How is it?

381
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,090
This one is for Zhou Siyue.

382
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,610
I've prepared it for you.

383
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,860
That's very nice of you. You didn't fail me.

384
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,350
I have to give it to you.

385
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,850
Childish.

386
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,950
The situation is not in our favor. Class 8 is too aggressive.

387
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,703
I can't hold on.

388
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,310
Master, just get on the field, will you?

389
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,490
I can't play.

390
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,000
You...

391
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,740
You are not at your best today.

392
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,470
Yang Chunzi, I'm glad that you are giving me water.

393
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,460
But you are with Class 8 now. If you do this, I would feel...

394
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,740
Siyue, have some water.

395
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:02,432
Thank you.

396
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,110
Pretentious.

397
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,540
Don't you think she's phony?

398
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,830
Her face is always like that whether she's happy or not.

399
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,920
Tell me about it.

400
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,830
She's still sending water now that we are not in the same class anymore.

401
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,390
Is she a water delivery worker or what?

402
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:17,673
What are you snickering about?

403
00:23:17,673 --> 00:23:19,812
We are speaking up for you!

404
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,350

405
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,570
Who's tired?

406
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,210
- I can't hold on for longer.
 - You can take a rest.

407
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,650
Dude, you are finally awake.

408
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,290
Let's go.

409
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,320
 Don't give up.

410
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,400
 Zhou Siyue! Fighting!

411
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,410
 Zhou Siyue! Fighting!

412
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,290
 Zhou Siyue, you are the best.

413
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,130
 Keep going, Zhou Siyue!

414
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,090
 Class 3, go!

415
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,040
 Class 3, go!

416
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,900
 Class 3, go!

417
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,960
 Class 3, go!

418
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,300
Zhou Siyue, nice shot!

419
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,580
Where's that spirit when you were making trouble?

420
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,880
Class 3 cannot lose in terms of momentum.

421
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,280
Shout your lungs out!

422
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,040
Zhou Siyue, you are the best!

423
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,680
Class 3, go!

424
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,430
 Class 3, go!

425
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,290
 Class 3, go!

426
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,120
 Class 3, go!

427
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,000
 Class 3, go!

428
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,390
 Zhou is great.

429
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,560

430
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,630
You look nice. Like you are blind.

431
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,400
It has been a whole day.

432
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,060
Why is Siyue still not here?

433
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,920
Did he ask for leave?

434
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:49,680
It's not like I'm his shadow or something, right?

435
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,170
Here. I have some good news.

436
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,420
In the city math competition,

437
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,340
Zhou Siyue from our class did a good job...

438
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,310
and won first place.

439
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:10,560
Here, Deng Wanwan.

440
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,622
Put up the certificate on the wall.

441
00:28:12,622 --> 00:28:13,830
 Zhou Siyue is awesome.

442
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,610
Of course, for those of you who didn't get a ranking, don't feel frustrated.

443
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,760
You still have a lot of opportunities.

444
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,640
Focus on the future.

445
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,560
All right, stop talking.

446
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,200
The study hall begins now.

447
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,130
Zhou Siyue is truly Mr. Liu's own son.

448
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,510
What is that supposed to mean?

449
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,830
Let me tell you what I mean.

450
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,560
On the night before the contest, Zhou Siyue ran off in secret and then got caught,

451
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,800
but he wasn't disqualified for that.

452
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,296
I can't compete with someone who has connections.

453
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:54,230
I just can't.

454
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,800
Listen. You better watch your mouth.

455
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,000
He Xingwen, can you not be so mean?

456
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,110
Siyue won the basketball match for us.

457
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,400
And he's also top-notch in terms of math.

458
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,940
What? Are you jealous of him?

459
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,600
I'm jealous? Why would I be?

460
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,760
I just think this is unfair.

461
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,640
Why is the teacher favoring him like that?

462
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,950
I heard that Siyue was punished.

463
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,880
He ran 10 laps on the sports field.

464
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,640
10 laps?

465
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,820
He was punished for 10 laps for making such a huge mistake.

466
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,938
Doesn't that mean the teacher was favoring him?

467
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:31,420
If you think this is unfair, go talk to the teacher.

468
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,400
Why criticize people in secret? Does that make you better?

469
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,640
Yeah!

470
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,749
Why didn't you mention that when the teacher was here?

471
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:40,335
 Why didn't you say so just then?

472
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,350
Zhou Siyue.

473
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,040
Zhou Siyue.

474
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,730
The light is on.

475
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,200
Zhou Siyue.

476
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,850
Zhou Siyue.

477
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,550
Zhou Siyue.

478
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,610
Zhou Siyue.

479
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,140
 Who is it?

480
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:55,139
You caught a cold?

481
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,800
From the basketball game a few days ago.

482
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,830
It's really cold in here.

483
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,050
Why did you keep the window open since you have a cold?

484
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,330
Aren't you worried that you will get worse?

485
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:11,438
Did you crack it?

486
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,460
I didn't mean to do that.

487
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,905
It's great to leave the window open.

488
00:31:18,905 --> 00:31:20,620
Let the air keep flowing.

489
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,920
Where is your mom?

490
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,160
She...

491
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,660
She went out.

492
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,130
Did you have anything?

493
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,310
I just got up.

494
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,130
I don't want to do anything.

495
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,610
Do you have any food?

496
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,610
Instant noodles.

497
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,060
Never mind.

498
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,400
Is it enough?

499
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,040
Is that soup?

500
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,540
It's porridge.

501
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,710
This is the first time that I ever made this.

502
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,830
It looks good.

503
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:01,539
How is it?

504
00:33:02,543 --> 00:33:03,643
Delicious.

505
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,190
You should drink more.

506
00:33:11,449 --> 00:33:13,169
Let me do it myself.

507
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,070
I'll go deal with the window.

508
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,350
Leave it be.

509
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,090
You might hurt your hand.

510
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,780
Sit here.

511
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,790
Why are you visiting me all of a sudden?

512
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,180
You won first place in the competition.

513
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,910
I want to tell you that.

514
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,950
And...

515
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:54,500
did Mr. Liu punish you...

516
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,050
for leaving the camp then?

517
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,160
Who told you that?

518
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,880
Sorry.

519
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,670
It's not because of you.

520
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,120
You...

521
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,690
Are you tired?

522
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,390
Yes.

523
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,760
So what?

524
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,520
I'm worried that if you are too tired,

525
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,880
you might get depressed one day.

526
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:40,170
And what if that really happens?

527
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,300
I will be here for you

528
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,562
and help you unconditionally.

529
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,740
How silly are you?

530
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,200
I'm not as fragile as you think.

531
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,980
Besides, we will certainly have more difficulties.

532
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,500
But I won't make you worry.

533
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,370
I'll go get you a glass of hot water.

534
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,800
- Not bad.
 - Ding Xian.

535
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,940
Where are the clothes that you changed out of?

536
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,720
I'll give them to you later.

537
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,650
What are you doing?

538
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,840
Did you make this?

539
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,560
It's so awful!

540
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,530
Sis, maybe you should stay away from the kitchen.

541
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,800
This is completely dark cuisine.

542
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,950
You could choose not to eat my food.

543
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,980
Ding Xian, come here.

544
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:03,000
Mom, what are you doing with my diary?

545
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,040
Ding Xian.

546
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,370
You are still young.

547
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,333
Instead of focusing on your studies,

548
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:12,130
just what are you thinking about all day long?

549
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,500
You read my diary?

550
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,011
If I didn't, how would I know what you are busy with all day long?

551
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,430
"I can't believe I lost to him in the game room."

552
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,320
Mom, stop reading it!

553
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,080
This is what you wrote.

554
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,090
Why can't you hear it?

555
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,920
Give it to me.

556
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,300
Give me the diary.

557
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,300
If you don't give it to me, this will not end easily for you.

558
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,949
Give it to me. What are you doing? Give it.

559
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,210
Are you happy now?

560
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,020
I will never write diaries again.

561
00:37:50,825 --> 00:37:53,300
Suit yourself.

562
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,950
I'm telling you, Ding Xian.

563
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,087
You are grounded forever.

564
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,950
What are you doing?

565
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,040
I had a spat with my mom.

566
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,060
And I threw my diary out.

567
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,580
Are you sure you dropped it here?

568
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,910
Hey.

569
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,320
I just saw a scavenger pass by and head in that direction.

570
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,390
Hello, have you seen a scavenger nearby?

571
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,270
He's long gone.

572
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:00,833
He's gone?

573
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,230
Stop crying.

574
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,050
I'm fine.

575
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,300
It's okay if I can't find it.

576
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,430
If you don't want to go home,

577
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,250
come hang out at my place.

578
00:39:53,923 --> 00:39:55,823
Let's go.

579
00:40:26,463 --> 00:40:27,980
Are you hungry?

580
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,040
You must have skipped your meal, right?

581
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,000
I made some porridge

582
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,640
and I wanted to bring it to you.

583
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:39,630
I run off after a fight, so I can't go back and get it.

584
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,540
Besides, the porridge tastes so horrible,

585
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,460
yet you lied to me and said it was delicious.

586
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,760
It might be because I was sick

587
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,020
and I had lost my sense of taste.

588
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,850
I don't think we have any food either.

589
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,970
Let's make do with instant noodles.

590
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,150
Here.

591
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,630
Would you like seafood flavor or braised beef flavor?

592
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,590
I'm fine with either one.

593
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,990
All right.

594
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,570
I'll go boil the water.

595
00:41:20,287 --> 00:41:22,309
The noodles are ready.

596
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,000
This is the first time I've had instant noodles.

597
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,500
My mom won't let me have any.

598
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,260
So, your mom...

599
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,330
has taken good care of you.

600
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,500
Maybe.

601
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,070
But she can't understand me.

602
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,900
And she doesn't trust me.

603
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,490
The fight we had this time...

604
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,970
was because she looked at my diary.

605
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,790
Your mom...

606
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,392
She did that because she cares.

607
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,370
You have a good mom.

608
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,800
Oh, right!

609
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,700
I have something to show you.

610
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,050
What's this?

611
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,646
This is the robot that I used to win the robot competition.

612
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:51,800
Come on, D2-T3, dance for us.

613
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:03,138
It's so cute!

614
00:43:04,687 --> 00:43:07,360
Why is it dancing like Chaplin?

615
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,416
You know Chaplin!

616
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:11,016
Not bad.

617
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,460
How do you feel?

618
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,440
Better now?

619
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,930
Much better.

620
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,300
It's interesting.

621
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,250
That means the test is a success.

622
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,140
The test?

623
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,630
Yes.

624
00:43:28,635 --> 00:43:33,000
It's actually a comedian robot.

625
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:38,670
It's used to treat patients with mental diseases.

626
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,970
You are the one with mental diseases!

627
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,040
Okay. Finish your food.

628
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,230
I'll walk you home afterward.

629
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,940
I don't want to go back.

630
00:43:53,993 --> 00:43:56,353
Can you let me stay here for one night?

631
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:12,660

632
00:44:14,957 --> 00:44:20,195
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

633
00:44:20,195 --> 00:44:23,407
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

634
00:44:25,404 --> 00:44:29,690
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

635
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:34,847
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

636
00:44:34,847 --> 00:44:40,797
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

637
00:44:40,797 --> 00:44:44,335
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

638
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:51,070
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

639
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:55,347
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

640
00:44:55,347 --> 00:44:58,017
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

641
00:44:58,017 --> 00:45:01,010
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

642
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:05,923
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

643
00:45:05,923 --> 00:45:08,780
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

644
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,357
♫  After a long journey  ♫

645
00:45:11,357 --> 00:45:15,647
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

646
00:45:37,073 --> 00:45:40,013
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

647
00:45:40,013 --> 00:45:42,687
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

648
00:45:42,687 --> 00:45:47,893
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

649
00:45:47,893 --> 00:45:50,607
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

650
00:45:50,607 --> 00:45:53,047
♫  After a long journey  ♫

651
00:45:53,047 --> 00:45:57,450
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
