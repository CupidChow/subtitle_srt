â™«  For whom will the summer slow down  â™«

3
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:23,044
â™«  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  â™«

4
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:26,408
â™«  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  â™«

5
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:31,996
â™«  For whom will the movie change its story  â™«

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,802
â™«  A sudden storm, blurred vision  â™«

7
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:40,451
â™«  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  â™«

8
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:47,510
â™«  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  â™«

9
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:54,406
â™«  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  â™«

10
00:00:55,903 --> 00:01:01,136
â™«  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  â™«

11
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:04,270
â™«  In the sleepless winter night  â™«

12
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,283
â™«  A season to say goodbye  â™«

13
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:09,736
â™«  I try my best to be brave  â™«

14
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:16,200
â™«  We will keep on going like this  â™«

15
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:17,950
â™«  The secret of the answer  â™«

16
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,302
â™«  An insoluble question  â™«

17
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:27,947
â™«  All comes down to a simple thank you  â™«

18
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:31,266
   

19
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,300
   

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,720
Thank you.

21
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,440
The end-of-the-world fireworks gave me the motivation to apply for Huaqing again.

22
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,512
Tomorrow is the opening exhibition of the robot design competition.

23
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:54,165
Would you like to come?

24
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,285
Don't push your luck.

25
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,540
We have made a deal.

26
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,819
It was just an accident that we ended up hanging out together today.

27
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,539
Then you've got to hang on a little longer,

28
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:09,645
because I'm not going to give up.

29
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,560
Xianxian.

30
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:16,173
Senior Brother, what are you doing here?

31
00:03:16,173 --> 00:03:18,919
I just went to your room to look for you. Your roommate said you went out.

32
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:21,819
It was raining outside. Did you get wet?

33
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:24,580
I was with her. I wouldn't let her get wet.

34
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:30,959
Am I interrupting you guys?

35
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,578
No.

36
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:34,099
A little.

37
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:37,858
Do you mind giving us a second?

38
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,160
Sorry, but I have something about work to discuss with Xianxian.

39
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,900
She's a little tired.

40
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,320
Can't you talk to her some other time?

41
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:53,146
Senior Brother, it's okay.

42
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:55,372
What do you want to talk about?

43
00:03:57,192 --> 00:04:00,173
Let's find a quiet place where we can sit down to talk.

44
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,652
Okay.

45
00:04:01,652 --> 00:04:02,952
Let's go.

46
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,485
Please take a look at this, Xianxian.

47
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,719
This is...

48
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,739
You are just everywhere, aren't you?

49
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:32,239
Good question.

50
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,192
I can't be here to drink something?

51
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,880
Xianxian, a comics company in Huaicheng asked us to design an app.

52
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,079
It's almost done and will soon be launched.

53
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,620
Director Zhang of the comics company

54
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,259
asked me if I could recommend an artist.

55
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,819
So, I thought of you.

56
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,786
Technology companies also develop comics apps?

57
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:13,326
Your company has a wide business scope indeed.

58
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:15,060
That's right. We are a startup company.

59
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,552
Our boss wants to tap into different fields.

60
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,479
That's very far-sighted of him.

61
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,399
Thank you.

62
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,878
Otherwise, he wouldn't send me to talk to Xianxian for cooperation.

63
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,579
You are right about that.

64
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,520
This is probably the one thing that we can see eye to eye.

65
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:40,000
But I've never worked for a comics app before.

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,359
Don't worry about that.

67
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:43,480
This app is the first of its kind in China,

68
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,079
as well as a professional platform exclusively for comics.

69
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,679
It's worth trying, in my opinion.

70
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,920
I wonder if you are interested.

71
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,379
Then, what do you need me to do?

72
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,359
Now that we are both in Huaicheng,

73
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:56,820
if you are interested,

74
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,701
you can come with me to meet with Director Zhang tomorrow.

75
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:03,600
Tomorrow? I'm afraid I won't be available tomorrow.

76
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,640
Because of him?

77
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,320
No.

78
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,799
Our club needs to prepare the exhibition stand for the Comic-Con.

79
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,819
I don't think I have the time.

80
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:21,739
Then I'll make an appointment when you are free.

81
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:24,072
That'd be great. Thank you, Senior Brother.

82
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:25,359
Then I'll go back now.

83
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,679
I still have a deadline for my drawing.

84
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,219
- Let me walk you back. 
 - Let me walk you back.

85
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:40,419
Don't we all stay here in the same hotel?

86
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,312
I'll go back now. You can both stop here.

87
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:05,746
Wait.

88
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,945
I still need to talk to you.

89
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:15,153
Do you mind?

90
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:26,211
Senior Brother, then I'll see you later.

91
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:30,859
Okay.

92
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:32,559
Try to sleep early.

93
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,799
Call me if you need any help.

94
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,399
Okay. Bye, Senior Brother.

95
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,399
Bye-bye.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Have a good night.

97
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,100
What's up?

98
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,759
Honestly, I don't like that guy.

99
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,740
But...

100
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,019
what he just said does sound like a good opportunity.

101
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:02,620
I think you can consider giving it a try.

102
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:10,520
Since you've chosen the thing you like, of course I'll have your back.

103
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:19,679
Then I'll go back to my room now.

104
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,050
Hey.

105
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,019
Don't miss tomorrow's robot design competition opening exhibition.

106
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,452
I'll be waiting for you.

107
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,260
You two got back together?

108
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,719
We've never been together.

109
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,680
How could we "get back"?

110
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:52,559
Enough about me.

111
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,500
You betrayed me today.

112
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,520
You had a fun day in the amusement park,

113
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,879
and earned a course from Professor Ye.

114
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,319
You didn't lose anything.

115
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,460
   

116
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,079
Ding Xian is not here yet?

117
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:19,905
How come? It's late already.

118
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,460
   

119
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:25,759
Hurry.

120
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,779
Lou Feng, after loading the truck,

121
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,619
please go upstairs to get tomorrow's schedule

122
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:39,379
and check the costumes in the dressing room.

123
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,880
I have to go to the dressing room?

124
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,459
Let me do it.

125
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,280
I've just finished here.

126
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,579
Aren't you going to the opening of the robot design competition?

127
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:50,220
No time for chat here. Get moving.

128
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,220
All right. I'm going then.

129
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,760
Xianxian, I love you.

130
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,759
Go get the schedule. Hurry.

131
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,579
Sir, everything's loaded. You can drive now.

132
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:13,059
Are you ready?

133
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:15,460
Later, you all need to go to the central exhibition hall to give speeches.

134
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,780
Could you give us a bit more time? We may have to be there a little late.

135
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,019
How many plans are you going to demonstrate?

136
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,319
We'll demo one first.

137
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,120
Aren't you guys coming?

138
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,740
You go ahead and demo first.

139
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,719
Don't wait for me.

140
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:38,079
Sorry.

141
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:44,151
Even if Ding Xian isn't here, you can still show your robot.

142
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,399
There's no point showing it if she's not here today.

143
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,980
Please go inside. I'll be fine.

144
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,119
So, one, two, three, four, five, six.

145
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,819
Why is the door locked?

146
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,559
 Let me do it. I've just finished here. 

147
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,980
Anybody out there?

148
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
I'm locked inside.

149
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:36,239
Thank you. Okay, you may go back now.

150
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:37,679
- Bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

151
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,580
Xing Lufei, I got the schedule.

152
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,620
Okay.

153
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,379
Good.

154
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,080
Then let's call it a day.

155
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,599
Thank you.

156
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:48,599
Well...

157
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,920
Where's Ding Xian?

158
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,719
Ding Xian went to check the costumes.

159
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:59,440
And then she left for some emergency.

160
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,779
I'll go back now.

161
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,740
See you.

162
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Emergency?

163
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,900
Siyue, the opening ceremony is over.

164
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,320
I don't think Ding Xian is coming.

165
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,920
Why don't we go back?

166
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,618
It's okay. You go first.

167
00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:29,018
No need to wait for me.

168
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,059
All right. Then come back early.

169
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:36,385
I will.

170
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,879
Sir, how come you have Ding Xian's cell phone?

171
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,980
Okay, I'll go fetch it right now.

172
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,640
Wasn't she with you?

173
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,280
Maybe she's still at the Comic-Con Center.

174
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,780
Ding Xian.

175
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:17,319
Ding Xian.

176
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,460
Ding Xian.

177
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,199
 Ding Xian. 

178
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:27,859
Zhou Siyue.

179
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,319
Zhou Siyue!

180
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:35,139
 Zhou Siyue, I'm here. 

181
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:36,239
Ding Xian!

182
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,180
 I'm here, Zhou Siyue. Can you hear me? 

183
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,520
 Ding Xian, are you inside? 

184
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,940
I'm locked inside.

185
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,680
Step back.

186
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,800
 Step back. 

187
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,539
Are you all right?

188
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:05,199
I'm fine.

189
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,620
Come on.

190
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,320
Are you sure we won't get caught getting in like this?

191
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,099
It's an emergency.

192
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,540
Give me a second.

193
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:34,819
How did you get locked in the room?

194
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:36,246
I have no idea.

195
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,780
You need to be more careful in the future.

196
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,439
What are you going to do if I'm not around?

197
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,560
Anyway, someone will get me out the next day.

198
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,799
I'll just wait for the door to be opened.

199
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,860
Stop pretending to be tough.

200
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,338
By the way, how was your opening ceremony?

201
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,679
I didn't do it.

202
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,200
Why not?

203
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,799
Isn't that the reason why you came to the robot design competition?

204
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,580
Not the only reason, though.

205
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm also here for you.

206
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,420
Since when did you become so unambitious?

207
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,659
That's because I've got enough confidence.

208
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:28,905
I'm sure I'll win the robot design competition,

209
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:31,725
and I'll win you over.

210
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:36,218
I'm leaving.

211
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,200
You really don't want to stay here with me?

212
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:45,606
Zhou Siyue,

213
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:48,093
when did you become so clingy?

214
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:50,338
Then, you should get to know me better.

215
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:53,846
Come here.

216
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,500
Come on.

217
00:15:57,298 --> 00:15:59,739
Stand here. Don't move.

218
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,339
 Guys, I have to go now. 

219
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:21,400
 I want to go somewhere far away. 

220
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,339
 Will you come back? 

221
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,640
 I will. See you. 

222
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,919
 See you. 

223
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,039
 We'll wait for you to come back. 

224
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,679
 I will miss you guys. 

225
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,940
 Please don't forget about me. 

226
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,740
 Help! Help! 

227
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,640
 He woke up! Yeah! Great! 

228
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,679
 It's great! 

229
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:20,686
I thought you never checked Weibo.

230
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,691
"Little Monster's Diary."

231
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,625
It's a perfect name.

232
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,500
Ding Xian,

233
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,370
that day you asked me

234
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:43,535
what true love was.

235
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,412
I have an answer now.

236
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,699
She's average-looking,

237
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:55,380
yet always easy on the eyes.

238
00:17:56,773 --> 00:18:00,902
She can be so stubborn and drive people crazy,

239
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:04,218
yet you can't help thinking

240
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:06,898
she's the most adorable girl in the world.

241
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:10,232
Though you know she's lying,

242
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:15,286
and yet, you can't bear to debunk her lame acting.

243
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:23,621
She's a mess every time she cries,

244
00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:27,865
yet you still find she's cute.

245
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,280
You are mess.

246
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,860
Who is "she"?

247
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:44,280
Ding Xian,

248
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,240
I like you.

249
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:54,979
Would you like to be with me?

250
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,830
â™«  The secret of the answer  â™«

251
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,240
â™«  An insoluble question  â™«

252
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:10,000
â™«  All comes down to a simple thank you  â™«

253
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,659
What are you doing here?

254
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:17,159
Who let you in?

255
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,307
How did you get in?

256
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,820
You think us security guards are a joke, don't you?

257
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,560
Put down your information.

258
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,420
Sir, I'm sorry.

259
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,819
I brought her in.

260
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:40,829
She has nothing to do with it.

261
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:46,459
Young couples like you guys like to seek thrills.

262
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,873
Keep writing. What are you looking at?

263
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:50,799
Hurry, and behave yourself.

264
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,746
We are not a couple.

265
00:19:53,746 --> 00:19:56,031
You are a good-looking young man.

266
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,431
How come you can't even get a girlfriend?

267
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:03,060
I was working on it.

268
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,375
But you interrupted us.

269
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,520
Wait here.

270
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,672
I'll go in and investigate.

271
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:11,312
You can't leave until I make sure everything's fine.

272
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,343
You haven't answered me yet.

273
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:29,380
Zhou Siyue, I'm sorry,

274
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,225
but I'm not ready for a relationship yet.

275
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,720
Good for you.

276
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,580
You sure can hold a grudge.

277
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:43,625
Fine.

278
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,235
I'll be waiting for you.

279
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:49,507
Until you give me an answer.

280
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,319
Xianxian,

281
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:56,079
what are you doing here?

282
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,560
Senior Brother.

283
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,839
Mr. Su, what brings you here?

284
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,439
You know them?

285
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:05,779
They are my friends.

286
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:08,279
Here you go.

287
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,439
- Thank you. 
 - All right. You can leave now.

288
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,039
Don't do it again.

289
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,687
Mr. Su, then I'll go back now.

290
00:21:15,687 --> 00:21:17,187
Thank you.

291
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,039
What are you doing here?

292
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,320
The competition starts tomorrow.

293
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,900
I came here to confirm the agenda with the organizer.

294
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:29,319
Are you going back to the hotel? I can give you a ride.

295
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,486
Okay.

296
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:32,286
Thank you.

297
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:48,045
Xianxian, your mom called me a few days ago.

298
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:49,519
She asked me to take good care of you

299
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,520
since we both came to Huaicheng.

300
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm a little busy these days.

301
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,380
I'll take you out for fun when I'm free.

302
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,399
Mr. Su, you are a busy man.

303
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,440
You don't have to do that to make yourself look good.

304
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:07,086
That's because you don't us well.

305
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:09,499
Xianxian has always been close to me.

306
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:11,759
And she's been seeing me as her big brother.

307
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:14,338
Oh, yeah?

308
00:22:14,351 --> 00:22:17,212
Then, how come I've never heard her

309
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,192
talk about you, her big brother?

310
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:26,439
You're probably not as close to her as you think you are.

311
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:30,853
It makes sense that you didn't know.

312
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:35,139
Xianxian wouldn't tell an outsider about us.

313
00:22:35,139 --> 00:22:37,945
Even if she doesn't tell me anything,

314
00:22:37,945 --> 00:22:42,032
I still know what she likes and what she dislikes.

315
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,160
Xianxian, I want to talk to you about the comics app.

316
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,300
Sure. What is it?

317
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,739
Do you mind?

318
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,520
It's not a secret anyway.

319
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,360
Why can't you talk here?

320
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,301
It's okay, Senior Brother. Go ahead.

321
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,279
Director Zhang of the comics company

322
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,880
saw your works on Weibo, and he likes them very much.

323
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,420
He'll meet me for dinner tomorrow,

324
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,199
and he wants to sign you.

325
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:32,580
That's great. Thank you, Senior Brother.

326
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,119
I didn't do much. All I did was recommend you.

327
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,959
I'll take you to buy some clothes tomorrow.

328
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,940
It's better to dress formally.

329
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,979
What's wrong with what she's wearing now?

330
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,839
It's okay, Senior Brother.

331
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,359
I have clothes.

332
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,659
Don't worry.

333
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,339
Okay. Then I'll go with you tomorrow.

334
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:56,660
Don't be nervous.

335
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,160
Okay.

336
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,199
Ding Xian won't be nervous.

337
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:02,219
You know so little about her.

338
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,799
I'll go back now.

339
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:23,860
Zhou Siyue, I told you to stay away from Xianxian.

340
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:30,100
And I told you that I wouldn't let her go.

341
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,420
That's all for today's discussion.

342
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,239
I wish you all the best in the contest.

343
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:46,719
Thank you.

344
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:54,539
Woke up?

345
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:58,060
You even took notes?

346
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:04,140
Unlike me, you are able to manage your career and your love at the same time.

347
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:09,460
Look at him.

348
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,300
What a mixer.

349
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,279
He talks to everybody.

350
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,460
Stop. It's not your concern.

351
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,700
Let's go.

352
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,800
Where are you going?

353
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,620
The Comic-Con.

354
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,380
Maybe you shouldn't go.

355
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,073
Why?

356
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,932
Because Ding Xian isn't there.

357
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:36,879
How do you know she's not there?

358
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:38,999
I asked Lou Feng. She told me.

359
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,339
Then, where is Xian?

360
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:49,197
She was taken back to the hotel by Su Bocong.

361
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,580
Xianxian, how did it go today?

362
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,619
Very well.

363
00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:58,219
There were a lot of people.

364
00:25:58,219 --> 00:25:59,700
I've finally got it done.

365
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,120
So, you haven't eaten anything yet?

366
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,360
- I've got used to it. I'm not hungryâ€” 
 - Ding Xian...

367
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,079
Why didn't you answer your phone?

368
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:18,900
My phone is dead.

369
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:23,239
Didn't you go to the seminar?

370
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:25,400
You came back already?

371
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,060
It's over.

372
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,300
Don't you have a speech to prepare?

373
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,051
I pulled an all-nighter and finished it.

374
00:26:31,051 --> 00:26:34,403
Then why are you here instead of getting some sleep?

375
00:26:36,242 --> 00:26:38,639
I want to see you.

376
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,859
Mr. Zhou, you are just everywhere and hard to get rid of.

377
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:47,719
Right back at you.

378
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:52,020
Mr. Su, you are in no position to say that to me.

379
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:00,900
Would you guys like some juice?

380
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:01,800
- I'll go get it. 
 - I'll go get it.

381
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,539
Don't bother. I'll go.

382
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,280
- Wait here. 
 - Wait here.

383
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:10,780
Waiter, a glass of juice, please.

384
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,079
What kind of juice would you like?

385
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,479
- Blueberry. 
 - Blueberry.

386
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:15,880
Hot or iced?

387
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,280
- Iced. 
 - Iced.

388
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,859
And sweetness?

389
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:21,559
- Regular. 
 - Regular.

390
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,599
One cup?

391
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,599
One for each.

392
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,480
I'll pay for mine, and he'll pay for his.

393
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,939
Okay.

394
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,999
Thank you.

395
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:54,619
I can't finish it all by myself.

396
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,599
Xianxian, you must be hungry. Let's go grab something to eat first.

397
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,099
Okay.

398
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,359
You treated me to a meal last time. I've always wanted to pay you back.

399
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,179
This time it's on me.

400
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,599
I haven't said yes yet.

401
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,859
Sure.

402
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:20,820
Why don't we call up everybody?

403
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,940
We haven't had a chance to eat together since we came to Huaicheng.

404
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,379
I know a nice place.

405
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:27,019
But...

406
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:28,880
I'm afraid it's going to cost you.

407
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:31,719
Instead of worrying about me,

408
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:35,452
you should worry about if you still stand a chance.

409
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:41,559
So bitter.

410
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:51,173
I'll go back now.

411
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,639
You are back.

412
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:07,525
What's this?

413
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:08,679
Blueberry juice.

414
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,859
I don't want it. It's too tart.

415
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,079
I heard the two handsome guys both went to find you today.

416
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,660
Tell me what happened.

417
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,580
You must be very happy today, right?

418
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,066
How's that possible?

419
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:26,019
They are two big babies.

420
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:28,180
I can't stand them anymore.

421
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:35,319
Anyway, I still root for you and Zhou Siyue.

422
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:38,940
You've been into him for years.

423
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:45,000
It'd be such a pity if you two don't end up together.

424
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,699
Actually,

425
00:29:48,939 --> 00:29:50,959
he confessed his feelings to me.

426
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:54,979
I almost said yes.

427
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,300
You rejected him?

428
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,459
I've liked him for years.

429
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:01,406
He only chased after me for a few days.

430
00:30:01,406 --> 00:30:03,580
If I said yes so easily,

431
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,300
I'd be completely under his control in the future.

432
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,900
That makes sense.

433
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:17,019
But I always feel that something's missing between us.

434
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:18,280
What's missing?

435
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:20,999
I'm not sure.

436
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:22,860
I can't figure it out.

437
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:28,639
 Is she going? 

438
00:30:29,358 --> 00:30:33,440
Are you going to the dinner party he organized?

439
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,319
No. I'll pass.

440
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,699
 Come over, now. 

441
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,559
I'll go out for a while.

442
00:30:52,425 --> 00:30:54,525
Brother Bocong.

443
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,139
Why don't you go inside?

444
00:30:56,139 --> 00:30:58,259
I have something to talk to you about.

445
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:00,079
What is it?

446
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,599
Here's the thing.

447
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,420
You like Ding Xian, right?

448
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,920
I can help you.

449
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:09,193
Why are you helping me?

450
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:12,493
For Zhou Siyue?

451
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,399
They aren't together yet. I still have a chance, and so do you.

452
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,379
Lou Feng, you forgot something again, didn't you?

453
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:30,079
You are so...

454
00:31:32,885 --> 00:31:34,825
What are you doing here?

455
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:36,379
To take you to dinner.

456
00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:38,079
I'm not hungry.

457
00:31:45,246 --> 00:31:48,025
You don't want to see me, do you?

458
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,355
Don't flatter yourself.

459
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:55,800
I'm buying dinner for everyone because of you.

460
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,804
Yet you aren't even coming.

461
00:31:58,804 --> 00:32:01,680
I didn't ask you to do it.

462
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,712
Anyway, if you aren't coming, I'll starve here to death. I won't go either.

463
00:32:06,953 --> 00:32:08,532
Fine. I'll go.

464
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:10,759
Let's go eat.

465
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,660
Welcome.

466
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,800
Xianxian.

467
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,880
- Come here. 
 - Xianxian, over here. I saved you a seat.

468
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,159
Thanks.

469
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,940
Zhou Siyue, you can sit here.

470
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,980
Siyue, come here.

471
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,620
Listen, guys.

472
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,700
We've been here for days, yet still haven't had a meal together.

473
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,739
Today, Siyue will treat us a dinner.

474
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,380
Order whatever you want. He deserves a round of applause.

475
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,439
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Charming.

476
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:44,859
You are welcome. Just enjoy yourselves.

477
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:46,399
Now, let's start to order.

478
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:53,879
 Thanks. 

479
00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:58,599
 I want this. 

480
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,839
Thank you, sir.

481
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:05,560
Since we are all here today,

482
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,019
let's play a game while we are eating.

483
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,339
- What game? 
 - The game we play all the time.

484
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:11,826
The King game.

485
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:13,359
I brought the cards. Here.

486
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,580
You are so well-prepared.

487
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,780
Of course.

488
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,000
Do you know how to play?

489
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,019
No.

490
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:22,400
- Now, I'll deal. 
 - Don't worry. I'll teach you.

491
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:26,839
Pass it on.

492
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,739
Who's the King in this round?

493
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,546
I'm the King.

494
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:34,180
What I want is simple.

495
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,540
Toast me, and call me gorgeous.

496
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,760
That's it.

497
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,299
- Who is it going to be? 
 - All right. Which number?

498
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:40,699
- Which number? 
 - Which number?

499
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
Number 2.

500
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,119
- Number 2. 
 - Who's number 2? Who?

501
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,419
Who's number 2?

502
00:33:53,058 --> 00:33:54,660
Gorgeous, cheers.

503
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,759
- What? I didn't hear you. 
 - What did you say?

504
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,919
Ban Jiayu, I'm sorry.

505
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,660
- Gorgeous, cheers. 
 - Thank you.

506
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,599
Drink it up. Come on.

507
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,720
- Bottoms up. 
 - Nice.

508
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,779
Well done. Nice.

509
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:15,220
Very nice.

510
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,939
Go on.

511
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,239
Who's the King? Who?

512
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,899
I am the King.

513
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:33,400
I want number 3 to ask number 6 a question.

514
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,379
Okay. Number 3 and number 6.

515
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:36,679
I'm number 6.

516
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,300
Number 3. Who's number 3?

517
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,579
Number 3.

518
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:43,800
I'm number 3.

519
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,579
Go ahead and ask.

520
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:47,620
A question...

521
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:52,745
Have you done anything bad recently?

522
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:57,679
What kind of question is that? You got to drink as punishment. Hurry.

523
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,360
Are you serious, Zhou Siyue?

524
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,740
You still blame me for taking away your chocolate?

525
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,840
You are so petty. It doesn't count. Ask me another question.

526
00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:09,325
It's okay. I've asked my question. I'll drink myself.

527
00:35:09,325 --> 00:35:10,433
Drink up.

528
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:11,959
Finish it.

529
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:13,799
I'm a light drinker. Don't force me.

530
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:15,586
Fine.

531
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,720
All right.

532
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,260
You deal this time.

533
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,860
All right.

534
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,045
 What kind of question was that? 

535
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,780
We are missing one here.

536
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:41,120
 I suspect that she's the one who locked you in the dressing room. 

537
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,999
 No way! 

538
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,339
I'm the King.

539
00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:51,339
Since you are all so reserved,

540
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:53,260
I'll play the bad guy.

541
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:59,219
Now, I want number 5 to kiss number 4.

542
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,239
Number 4, number 5.

543
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,760
Number 4, number 5.

544
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,300
Number 4, number 5.

545
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,000
Stop. Stop.

546
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,399
- Who? 
 - Who is it?

547
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:13,679
- Who?
- Who?

548
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,700
- Who? 
 - I'm number five. I'll drink myself.

549
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,120
Hey.

550
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:22,799
Hold on.

551
00:36:26,379 --> 00:36:28,240
I'll join you.

552
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:40,800
Drink up. Drink up.

553
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,860
So, you can drink, after all.

554
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,720
They didn't kiss. Boring.

555
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,719
Boring.

556
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,120
One more round. Come on.

557
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,320
Siyue, I...

558
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:57,980
Zhou Siyue, I'm leaving.

559
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,220
Okay.

560
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,320
See you.

561
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:02,560
Thank you, Mr. Charming.

562
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:05,460
Take care of Yuan Fang.

563
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,239
Why would I do that?

564
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,520
Zhou Siyue.

565
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,959
You should know that she'll be better off if she's with me.

566
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,600
The thing is if she wants to be with you.

567
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,339
That's not how I see it.

568
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:28,239
Give me some time, and I'll make her realize that.

569
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:33,059
I'm afraid it's just your wishful thinking.

570
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:35,740
But that's the truth.

571
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,239
As long as she's willing to, we'll become the same kind sooner or later.

572
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,639
What about you?

573
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,840
You'll study abroad or find a job?

574
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:47,859
You really think that high school romance of yours is strong enough

575
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:50,360
to get you through all that?

576
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:55,279
Just think about it.

577
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,639
Here is 20 for you, sir.

578
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,740
Thank you.

579
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,040
You are welcome.

580
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:10,160
The robot design competition has concluded successfully today.

581
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,080
During the competition,

582
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,320
we saw so many outstanding students from major universities across the country.

583
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,059
Nanjing University, Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology...

584
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:18,819
How much longer?

585
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:20,180
Any minute now.

586
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,720
So, now we are going to announce

587
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,299
the top three winners of this year's robot design competition.

588
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:29,099
First of all, the champion is Zhou Siyue from Huaqing University.

589
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,880
Let's invite Zhou Siyue to get on the stage for his award.

590
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:48,739
Thank you.

591
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,320
Hi, everyone.

592
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,199
I'm Zhou Siyue from the scientific

593
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:05,699
research group of Huaqing University.

594
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:12,919
Test.

595
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:13,919
Test.

596
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:18,399
Siyue, use this one.

597
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:25,939
- Thank you. 
 - You are welcome.

598
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:36,079
Liu Xiaofeng.

599
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,420
Long time no see.

600
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,520
Yes, indeed.

601
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:44,159
You are representing the University of Science and Technology. Right?

602
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,099
Yes.

603
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:47,219
Why did you go to a Science and Technology University?

604
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,306
I remember you said you wanted to study economics.

605
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:52,306
You still remember?

606
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:57,071
Actually, I chose to study computer science because of you.

607
00:39:57,106 --> 00:39:59,379
Oh, no. I didn't mean that.

608
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:00,953
Don't get me wrong.

609
00:40:00,953 --> 00:40:02,892
I just am really thankful to you.

610
00:40:03,686 --> 00:40:05,379
I don't know if you remember

611
00:40:05,379 --> 00:40:06,980
that when it was close to NCEE,

612
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,079
I got extremely nervous.

613
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,380
 The pressure of the 12th grade is so overwhelming. 

614
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,719
 Actually, I feel a little lost. 

615
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,313
 Whether I can be admitted or not, 

616
00:40:28,313 --> 00:40:30,413
 I still am not sure what to do in the future 

617
00:40:30,413 --> 00:40:32,313
 or what kind of person I'll become. 

618
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:40,260
 In this world, 

619
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,619
 there are many hard-working people, 

620
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:46,760
 but not everyone can get what they want. 

621
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,672
 However, if you can't get what you want through hard work, 

622
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,100
 then why bother working so hard? 

623
00:40:57,946 --> 00:40:59,966
 To live without regrets. 

624
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:05,459
If it hadn't been for you, I wouldn't have been able to go to college.

625
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,000
Stop being so sentimental.

626
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,639
But I mean what I say.

627
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,819
At that time, I always thought you were unapproachable.

628
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:18,539
But ever since you started to hang around with Ding Xian,

629
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:21,220
you've become more amiable.

630
00:41:22,206 --> 00:41:24,906
Was I really that cold and distant before?

631
00:41:24,906 --> 00:41:25,906
No.

632
00:41:26,633 --> 00:41:28,406
How do I put this? I mean

633
00:41:28,406 --> 00:41:31,084
I thought that was the way you were.

634
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:35,732
How about now?

635
00:41:35,732 --> 00:41:37,253
Are you two together?

636
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,480
Not yet.

637
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,760
I'm still waiting for her.

638
00:41:45,466 --> 00:41:47,645
Waiting for her?

639
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,119
She's been waiting for me for years.

640
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:55,480
I should be patient with her.

641
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,919
But have you thought about this?

642
00:41:57,959 --> 00:42:02,379
An excellent girl like her must have a lot of admirers.

643
00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:08,379
You are right.

644
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,740
- I've got to go now. 
 - Wait.

645
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,859
Where are you going?

646
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:14,259
To find her.

647
00:42:16,324 --> 00:42:18,239
Hi, excuse me.

648
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,839
Could you tell me where Zhou Siyue is?

649
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,719
He's has things to do, so he left.

650
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:25,280
If you have something important,

651
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,840
I can take a message for you.

652
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,880
Here's the thing.

653
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,779
I want to talk to him about a project.

654
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:31,085
This is my name card.

655
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:33,312
Please help me give it to him.

656
00:42:33,312 --> 00:42:35,133
- Okay. 
 - Thanks.

657
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:46,919
- Xianxian. 
 - Senior Brother.

658
00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:48,819
Wait a sec.

659
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:51,600
- What's the matter? 
 - It's my first time wearing high heels.

660
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,345
I'm not used to it.

661
00:42:53,345 --> 00:42:54,845
It hurts my feet.

662
00:43:00,813 --> 00:43:03,299
You look stunning today.

663
00:43:03,299 --> 00:43:04,799
- Really? 
 - Yes.

664
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:06,799
Thanks.

665
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:13,079
This is a gift for you.

666
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,740
Senior Brother, you've helped me a lot.

667
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,779
Please don't give me any more gifts.

668
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:22,940
Besides, this is too expensive.

669
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,139
It's not.

670
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:26,479
Just consider it a gift for good luck.

671
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,699
Hope you can be hired tonight.

672
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,759
You are wearing such a lovely dress.

673
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:37,620
You should wear a nice necklace to go with it.

674
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,380
I can put it on myself.

675
00:43:46,439 --> 00:43:48,639
It fits you perfectly.

676
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:49,819
Thank you.

677
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:53,280
If I'm hired, I'll buy you dinner.

678
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:58,759
I wish you wouldn't be this polite to me.

679
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,820
Let's go.

680
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,780
Here.

681
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,840
Thank you.

682
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,359
Let's go in.

683
00:44:26,439 --> 00:44:28,439
Director Zhang.

684
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:30,899
Okay, I'll see you later.

685
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,340
Mr. Su, welcome.

686
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:38,739
This is...

687
00:44:38,739 --> 00:44:40,339
This is the artist I told you about.

688
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:41,980
Little Monster's Diary was drawn by her.

689
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,239
She's Ding Xian.

690
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:44,239
So young.

691
00:44:45,153 --> 00:44:46,552
Director Zhang, nice to meet you.

692
00:44:47,279 --> 00:44:51,080
First of all, I'm flattered that you like my drawing.

693
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,800
Hope we can have a pleasant collaboration.

694
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:58,120
About the comics, here's what I think.

695
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,940
I have some new ideas that I want to share with you first.

696
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,840
Sure. I'm all ears.

697
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,320
Here's my idea.

698
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,679
What if you personify the little monster?

699
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:12,479
Let it fall in love, and play video games.

700
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:15,959
Meanwhile, you can lengthen the story.

701
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,460
The readers nowadays all enjoy this kind of stuff.

702
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,920
By the way, about the contract,

703
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,560
if this junior of yours has no problem with it,

704
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,879
why don't we sign it today?

705
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,239
I'm sorry, Director Zhang.

706
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:31,340
I have to go to the ladies' room.

707
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:37,479
- Director Zhang, excuse me for a sec. 
 - Sure.

708
00:45:39,859 --> 00:45:41,359
Xianxian.

709
00:45:45,347 --> 00:45:46,747
Are you okay?

710
00:45:47,673 --> 00:45:49,139
I'm fine.

711
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:53,740
I just think it's not like what I thought it'd be.

712
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:59,099
Xianxian, people in this industry only care about maximizing profits,

713
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:01,479
which may make you feel a little uncomfortable.

714
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:05,779
But he doesn't even care about my idea

715
00:46:05,779 --> 00:46:08,500
and how I want to present my work.

716
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,659
Those are two different issues.

717
00:46:12,659 --> 00:46:17,260
Those comics you drew used to be for yourself. You didn't have to care about others' opinions.

718
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,320
But when it comes to commercial use,

719
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,360
you must consider the public's preference.

720
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,400
It's just the way it is.

721
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:39,870
