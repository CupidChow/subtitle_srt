1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,540

2
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:26,563
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,049
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:34,929
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:40,301
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,807
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:48,456
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:55,515
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:55,515 --> 00:01:02,911
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,441
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,275
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:14,388
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:17,641
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:23,367
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,955
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:28,307
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:35,564
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:35,564 --> 00:01:39,863

19
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:42,220

20
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,360
In the exam, our class did excellently.

21
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,350
There are a few students who have made huge progress.

22
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,580
Ding Xian.

23
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,300
You scored 538.

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,900
Not bad. Keep up the good work.

25
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,800
And Sun Jiacheng,

26
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,750
you scored 559.

27
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,500

28
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,140

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,650
Hello, everyone.

30
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,440
I'm Zhou Siyue from Class 3, Senior 3.

31
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,450

32
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,600
This may have happened to a lot of you.

33
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,280
You thought the classical Chinese text were too long...

34
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,370
and the math questions were hard.

35
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,860
We feel tired every day.

36
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,400
But we can never sleep over 6 hours.

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,150
A new gel pen would run out of ink in two days.

38
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,450
In days overtaxing my life like these,

39
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,320
I would ask myself a question:

40
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,890
Is everything we are doing worth the effort?

41
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,120
But it was on mundane and boring days like this,

42
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,430
we got to know a bunch of sweet and kind people.

43
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,350
We share the same target.

44
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,116
And we are working toward that target together.

45
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:20,096
We are fighting together.

46
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,030
In the vast space and limitless time,

47
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,820
even if we are destined to part ways,

48
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,950
watching the starry sky with you is the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

49
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,340
So, keep going,

50
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,190
and don't be afraid.

51
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,010
Days may look like they are repeating themselves,

52
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,810
but there will be a day when you suddenly understand the meaning of persistence.

53
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,470
Because I always believe in one word.

54
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,180
There is still glory on the other side.

55
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,900

56
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,710
Hey!

57
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,070
Why are you here?

58
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,510
Are you expecting someone else?

59
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,190
What do you think? Do you have any place you want to go after the exam?

60
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,010
I want to get drunk.

61
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,500
Sure.

62
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,640
I know several good places.

63
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,530
We can ask Song Ziqi and the others to join us.

64
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,920
That's okay.

65
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,140
I'd like to hang out with Shadi alone.

66
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,770
Girls have a lot to talk about.

67
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,220
Let's go.

68
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,900
Cheers.

69
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,580
Why would anyone drink like that?

70
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,620
What's wrong?

71
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,720
I don't know what's wrong with me.

72
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,480
My brain went blank during the exam.

73
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,320
I couldn't think of anything.

74
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,510
It's the same for everyone.

75
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,440
I was also like that. I left a lot of questions unanswered.

76
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,230
The exam is over now.

77
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,410
Stop thinking about all those things.

78
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,650
It's hopeless now.

79
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,840
It's okay.

80
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,280
I thought I could get close to Zhou Siyue.

81
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,570
I tried so hard to study.

82
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,340
But in the end, I still can't do it, Shadi.

83
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,560
Will I ever catch up with him again?

84
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,000
You idiot.

85
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,250
You are the one to talk.

86
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,590
You are an idiot, too.

87
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,660
You clearly have feelings for Song Ziqi.

88
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,860
I don't!

89
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,250
I just...

90
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,470
I just feel sad that we are about to part ways.

91
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,340
That's all.

92
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Yeah.

93
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,883
We are all going our separate ways.

94
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,030
Not just me and Zhou Siyue will be separated.

95
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,760
Me and you,

96
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,030
Song Ziqi, and You Keke.

97
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,830
We are all going our separate ways.

98
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,490
Why are you talking about that now?

99
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,240
I haven't thought about those things.

100
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,540
Let's forget that now.

101
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,490
Xianxian.

102
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,300
If we can start high school all over,

103
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,140
I will be your good friend on day one.

104
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,250
Me, too.

105
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,330
We will always be friends.

106
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,150
Don't forget me when you are at university.

107
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,910
You, too.

108
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,610
You are looking awful with the crying face again.

109
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,600
You look awful!

110
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,800
All right!

111
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,360
Let's sing.

112
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,040
Come on.

113
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,450
Shadi!

114
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,790
I really don't want to be separated from you.

115
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,140
Let's go back.

116
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,760
I need a minute.

117
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,890
Zhou Siyue.

118
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,770
Hey, hey, hey!

119
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,400
Zhou Siyue.

120
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,450
Ding Xian, you are hilarious.

121
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,990
You mistook the garbage can for Zhou Siyue.

122
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,000
He is Zhou Siyue.

123
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,760
Look. Zhou Siyue is over there.

124
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,060
You are lying.

125
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,250
Ding Xian.

126
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:46,722
Come here.

127
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:47,680
You two are ridiculous.

128
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,301
Siyue and I searched every store, and we still couldn't find you.

129
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,380
I'll take her back first.

130
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,970
Hey!

131
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,610
Why won't you talk to me?

132
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,650
I just don't want to.

133
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:06,400
We are not going to be deskmates or neighbors again.

134
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,240
Why would I care about you?

135
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,000
You are going to care about me.

136
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,480
I want you to care about me all the time.

137
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,083
It hurts!

138
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,854
I'm not going to care about you.

139
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:24,000
Slow down.

140
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,793
You...

141
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,660
I don't want to walk with you.

142
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,760
You are always walking so fast

143
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,150
and leaving me far behind.

144
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,130
I'll let you walk in front from now on, all right?

145
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:57,249
It doesn't matter who's behind,

146
00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:00,710
I will not be able to walk with you again.

147
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,800
Get up first, will you?

148
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,070
Come on.

149
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:17,439
Hop on.

150
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,842
Didn't we agree that we will face everything together?

151
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,470
Siyue.

152
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,260
Zhou Siyue.

153
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,423
I'm here.

154
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,067
I've always been thinking

155
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:52,560
about what we would look like when we grow up.

156
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,050
Would we be leading a simple and happy life

157
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,966
as we did in high school?

158
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,980
I think so.

159
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,990
You are lying.

160
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,600
When have people ever stayed the same after they are separated?

161
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,620
Are we going to become strangers one day?

162
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,000
Stop the nonsense. You are drunk.

163
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,890
I'm not drunk.

164
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:37,290
Zhou Siyue, have you heard a saying?

165
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,640
Don't worry when the cloud covers the moon.

166
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,440
You are brighter than the stars.

167
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:51,970
Your future is as bright as the stars.

168
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,980
You are silly.

169
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,780
Stars don't shine.

170
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,220
I don't care.

171
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:12,310
I said they do, and that's what they do.

172
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,070
Silly.

173
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,260
Open your mouth.

174
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,090
So? Will you drink again?

175
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,740
Song Ziqi,

176
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,310
what should we do?

177
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,910
After this vacation,

178
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,040
I will not see you again when school starts.

179
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,130
We've been together since we were young.

180
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,440
All these years have passed.

181
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,490
How are you going to live without me?

182
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:10,750
Hey, hey, hey! It's okay.

183
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,530
It's just that I can't bully you or make you suffer again.

184
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,200
I'm fine.

185
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,265
You just keep lying.

186
00:16:17,265 --> 00:16:19,610
You've been lying since we were young.

187
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,552
What did I do?

188
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:24,000
When we were in kindergarten,

189
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,669
I wet my pants once.

190
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:31,880
You told me to stand on the sports field so that my pants would dry faster.

191
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,727
And when we were in elementary school,

192
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:39,090
you told me that girls would also grow beards, and I should shave with a razor.

193
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,650
My mom chased after me to hit me for that.

194
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,540
The most outrageous one was before the senior high entrance examination.

195
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,250
You lied to me and said that the essential balm could lift my spirit.

196
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,650
You told me to put some on my eyelids.

197
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:55,817
Song Ziqi, if you hate me so much, just tell me.

198
00:16:55,817 --> 00:16:58,960
No. No, hear me out.

199
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,320
I... I just think you are interesting every time I see you.

200
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,570
I want to hoax you.

201
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,066
Are you a fool or what?

202
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:11,840
I've been indulging you for so long, can't you see that I like you?

203
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,230
So why are you always mean to me?

204
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,070
You are always hitting me,

205
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,140
making me do things, and treating me like I'm your errand boy.

206
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,460
How could I tell that you like me?

207
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,540
Stop changing the subject.

208
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,060
Just tell me,

209
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,110
do you like me or not?

210
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:54,794
Kong Shadi.

211
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,550
I've been following you around...

212
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,210
for all these years.

213
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,900
If you are not the one I like,

214
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,570
then who is?

215
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,930
So... So, we will be having a long-distance relationship.

216
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,630
That's okay.

217
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,540
Maybe in a long-distance relationship,

218
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,540
you will like me even more.

219
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,617
I'm serious.

220
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,960
Don't worry.

221
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,120
Even if we have a long-distance relationship,

222
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,230
I will never let you go.

223
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,710
Then we have a deal.

224
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,370
You have to call me every day,

225
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,400
and you have to answer my calls and my messages.

226
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,100
All right.

227
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,050
We are going to see each other every month.

228
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,390
All right.

229
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,680
You can't lie to me or say bad things about me.

230
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,750
- You have to care about me.
 - All right.

231
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,740
If I'm bullied, you have to come to me right away.

232
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,363
And for festivals, anniversaries, and birthdays, you will...

233
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:43,500
What are you doing?

234
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:08,490
Mom, you scared the hell out of me.

235
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,710
You brat!

236
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,890
It's already afternoon, and you are still sleeping.

237
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,330
You didn't answer my call yesterday.

238
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,940
You came home late, smelling like alcohol.

239
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,030
You are letting yourself go right after the exam.

240
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,370
How did I get back?

241
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,310
Siyue brought you back.

242
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,707
Get up now!

243
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,400
How did you do in the exam?

244
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,483
Have you estimated your score yet?

245
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:46,133
Not yet.

246
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,941
Mom, I'm going to freshen up.

247
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:21,550

248
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,200

249
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,530
Ding Xian, your teacher said that you would get into

250
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,950
a top university in Hangzhou.

251
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,990
Mom, I don't want to choose a university.

252
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,460
What did you say?

253
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,180
I said that I'm not going to choose a university.

254
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,210
I want to repeat the third year.

255
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,400
Instead of going to a top university,

256
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,200
you want to spend money and redo the third year.

257
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,190
Have you become a nerd?

258
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,130
I could have done better in the exam.

259
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,510
I can't let this go.

260
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,210
I won't agree with that.

261
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,200
I will ask your teacher to choose a university for you right now.

262
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,730
Don't even think about repeating the third year.

263
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,630
Mom, can you stop meddling?

264
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,760
This is my life, not yours.

265
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,030
Can you let me decide this time?

266
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,770
I can live with the consequences whether they are good or bad.

267
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,520
All right?

268
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Fine.

269
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,820
I will never care about anything you do from now on.

270
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,160
Don't worry.

271
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,850
I've packed everything.

272
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,590
We will be with you this afternoon.

273
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,560
We have to be by your side at a time like this.

274
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,930
All right. That's all.

275
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,750
What's going on, Mom? Are you going somewhere?

276
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,230
Siyue, come here and sit.

277
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,820
I need to talk to you about something.

278
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,050
What happened?

279
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:11,620
Siyue, we are going to Jiangling soon.

280
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,420
Is it because something happened to Dad?

281
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,010
I can't explain it in a few words.

282
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,880
All right, got it.

283
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,860
Mom, I need to go out shortly. I will be back soon.

284
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,520
Go.

285
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,290
I didn't do well in the exam.

286
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,580
I can't go to Jiangling.

287
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:15,590
So, where are you going?

288
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:18,530
I'm going to...

289
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,230
repeat the third year.

290
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,230
Repeat the third year?

291
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,230
You can wait for me in Huaqing.

292
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,390
Maybe if I outdo myself,

293
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,600
I will be joining you.

294
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,070
All right.

295
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,960
I have another thing to tell you.

296
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,930
I might be leaving soon.

297
00:26:07,353 --> 00:26:10,413
Are you coming back this summer?

298
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,480
I'm afraid that... I won't be able to come back.

299
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Fine.

300
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,290
I will miss you.

301
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,690
I have to go now.

302
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,433
I'm starting the third year all over again tomorrow.

303
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:48,333
Wait.

304
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,620
I have a parting gift for you.

305
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:12,280
Isn't this the robot called D2-T3 you showed me last time?

306
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,800
Not bad. You still remember that.

307
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,190
Why did you call it D2-T3?

308
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,240
It's a random name.

309
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,700
I'm going to give it a name.

310
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,170
All right. What do you want to call it?

311
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,410
April.

312
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,190
April?

313
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,760
 I will always remember

314
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,750
 the summer when I was 18

315
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,390
 that was excruciatingly hot and tough.

316
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:03,630
 Everything I knew was saying goodbye to me and leaving me.

317
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:08,890
 All I could do was face reality

318
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,490
 and say goodbye with a smile.

319
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,320
Xianxian, I would like to discuss something with you.

320
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,300
Director Wang from the senior year has always been the class adviser of honor classes.

321
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,610
They have a high university enrollment rate.

322
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,570
Your mom and I discussed it.

323
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:52,200
How about you repeat the third year in his class?

324
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,720
Great. I've also heard that Mr. Wang is excellent.

325
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,420
I might make more progress in his class.

326
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,320
All right. I should go now.

327
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,940
You should also head to school after breakfast.

328
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,480
Dad, I'm also done. Let's go together.

329
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,596
All right. Come. Let's go. I'll carry that for you.

330
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,095
Come on. We are leaving now.

331
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,440

332
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:27,480

333
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,430
All right. Guys, I'll make this short.

334
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,700
You all understand the pressure of the third year.

335
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,280
I'm not going to say big words here.

336
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,430
But I do have one request.

337
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:54,090
Carefully write down the university you desire

338
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:58,920
and start to work towards it today.

339
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,900
We have several students repeating the third year.

340
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,000
I hope they can face their past

341
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,130
and review themselves.

342
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,910
Make better choices this time.

343
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,660
 As the third year starts again,

344
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,210
 I feel like everyone is drifting away from me.

345
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,230
 They are all walking on the right path towards the future,

346
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:32,740
 and I'm the only one off track.

347
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:38,000
 I'm missing Zhou Siyue and everyone else.

348
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:42,740
 As shredded and obscure

349
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,290
 as the days are,

350
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,210
 I can never let myself relax for one second.

351
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,870
 I'm worried that once I stop,

352
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,120
 countless people will surpass me

353
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,440
 and make me a stepping stone.

354
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,850

355
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:08,870
Professor Ye, hello. I'm Zhou Zongtang's son.

356
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,190
You must be Siyue.

357
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,840
Old Zhou told me a lot about you. We are finally meeting today.

358
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,130
Yes. I've heard that you and my dad are good friends.

359
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,350
That's why I came unnoticed today.

360
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,200
Not at all.

361
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,090
Here is the thing, Professor Ye.

362
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:33,060
Do you know what happened to my dad?

363
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,220
Ding Xian, is Huaqing your target?

364
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,910
Yes.

365
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:52,380
Ding Xian, a year is not too long or too short.

366
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,470
If your target is Huaqing,

367
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,080
you will need to put in more effort than the others.

368
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
I know.

369
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,360
And I will.

370
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,090
- Hello.
 - Hello.

371
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,790
This is a letter for Zhou Zongtang. Please sign it.

372
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,690
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

373
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,060
Eat your food.

374
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,790
Is it for me?

375
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,900
Yes.

376
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:28,307

377
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,400
You guys eat. It's okay.

378
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,120
I need to make a phone call.

379
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,110
Mr. Wang. Sorry.

380
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,170
I've been troubling you with this.

381
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,090
 Zhou's thesis

382
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,680
 was reported for suspicion of plagiarism and fraud.

383
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,970
 He's under investigation now.

384
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,940
Siyue.

385
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,190
What are you thinking about?

386
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,790
Have some food.

387
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,130
You too.

388
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,710
 I've seen everything through now.

389
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,110
 There will be a day when the truth comes out.

390
00:33:26,026 --> 00:33:27,526
Dad.

391
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,180
What's happening?

392
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:34,850
I've been suffering from minor hypoglycemia.

393
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,060
A doctor has prescribed some medicine for me.

394
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,560
Don't worry.

395
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,660
Go back and rest.

396
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,770
Dad,

397
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,810
I went to see Professor Ye today.

398
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,500
I know...

399
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,780
that you are worried

400
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,700
that I will be affected in school.

401
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,920
But I'm not afraid.

402
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,380
I believe in you.

403
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,970
Sorry.

404
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,870
I've brought this on you and your mom.

405
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,300
We are a family.

406
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,300
We are supposed to share burdens.

407
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:33,050
Besides, there are so many professors in Huaqing,

408
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,530
people may not know you at all,

409
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,600
let alone me.

410
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,770
You haven't had anything yet, right?

411
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,690
I'll warm up the dishes.

412
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,790
- Hello?
 - Hello?

413
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:30,690
Have you got the result of the entrance examination today?

414
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,060
How did it go?

415
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,210
Not bad.

416
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,580
I got a high place on the rankings.

417
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,290
Why are you calling me all of a sudden?

418
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,370
I just want to tell you that...

419
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,110
I've sorted out everything here.

420
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,840
And I will report to school tomorrow.

421
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,070
 Don't worry about me.

422
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,600
 How about you?

423
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,220
 How are you doing in school?

424
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:04,980
Ding Xian?

425
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,780
What's wrong?

426
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:10,850
I'm fine.

427
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,230
My marks and ranking...

428
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,560
in this exam...

429
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,010
are both good.

430
00:36:19,371 --> 00:36:22,920
The teacher said that...

431
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,360
I might get into Huaqing.

432
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
 Oh, right!

433
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,120
 Can you take some photos for me

434
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,120
 when you arrive at Huaqing?

435
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,430
You are silly.

436
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,970
Of course, I can.

437
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,030
I want to know what Huaqing looks like.

438
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,110
You'll know when you get here.

439
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,350
I hope everything can go well.

440
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,060
Are you really okay?

441
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,060
I'm just a little tired.

442
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,200
I feel sleepy.

443
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,870
Then go to bed.

444
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,110
Everything will be fine.

445
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,560
Everything will be fine.

446
00:37:27,491 --> 00:37:29,091
Siyue.

447
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,020
Mom.

448
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,120
You are still up.

449
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,600
I just finished the laundry and I'm about to hang them on the balcony.

450
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,510
Why are you still up?

451
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,400
Why are you putting these away?

452
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,460
These are all useless objects.

453
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,980
I want to see if I can sell them.

454
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,080
Aren't these your treasures?

455
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,320
That's when I was young.

456
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,170
I'm all grown up now.

457
00:38:01,436 --> 00:38:03,136
Right, Mom.

458
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,130
I might need to go back to Shenhai

459
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,210
before school starts.

460
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,770
Ding Juncong!

461
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,230
Did you stay up all night playing games again?

462
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,590
It's a weekend.

463
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,020
What's wrong with playing games?

464
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,210
You are about to be in junior high soon.

465
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,500
You need to focus on studying.

466
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,050
If you could learn half as hard as your sister does,

467
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,290
I will never say anything about you.

468
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,390
My sis has become a nerd already.

469
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,390
Stop the nonsense.

470
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,120
Xianxian, did you stay up late studying again?

471
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,130
Yeah.

472
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,950
Mr. Wang told me that you have made

473
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,990
huge progress a few days ago.

474
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,190
You did really well in the exam.

475
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,670
But I have to warn you,

476
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,910
don't work too hard.

477
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,191
You need to relax occasionally so that you won't break.

478
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,460
Okay.

479
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,160
I understand.

480
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,550
I'm going back to my room now.

481
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,180
Is that all you are going to eat?

482
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,780
I'm full.

483
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,710
She can't keep this up.

484
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:15,120
Her spirit is getting worse.

485
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,180
I heard her talking in her dream last night.

486
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,140
She was reciting formulas in her dream.

487
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:21,840
There's nothing I can do about it.

488
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,000
Why don't you go talk to her?

489
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,400
I'm not saying anything.

490
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,800
I didn't want her to repeat the third year

491
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,710
because I didn't want her to be stuck in this.

492
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,120
What's the point of all this?

493
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,390
Enough. Stop talking.

494
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,390
It won't do anything now.

495
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,040
What should we do?

496
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,660
I don't know.

497
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,040
I know my sister

498
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,330
might listen to this one person.

499
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,930
Who is it?

500
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,361
Mom, I'm not hungry.

501
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:53,710
I'll skip lunch. Don't wait for me.

502
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,500
 Xianxian, it's me.

503
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,770
Senior Brother!

504
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,800
I thought you were in Jiangling right now.

505
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,150
I'm here to visit your parents

506
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,000
and check up on you by the way.

507
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,200
Come on, let's go take a walk.

508
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,500
Don't lock yourself in your room studying.

509
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,830
Did my parents ask you to come?

510
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,970
They are worried about you.

511
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,440
I'm fine.

512
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,450
Repeating the third year...

513
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,030
must be tough.

514
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,270
A lot of people are living a tougher life than I am.

515
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,550
This is nothing.

516
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,690
Senior Brother,

517
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,790
do you know that...

518
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:58,470
there's a girl in our class named Lin You?

519
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,870
She's repeating the third year for the third time.

520
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,320
Her target has always been Nanjing University.

521
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,470
But she's doing worse during each year.

522
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,390
I think she's the most painstaking

523
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,410
and hard-working student in our class.

524
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,430
But the harder she works, the more often she screws up.

525
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,950
She once had a meltdown right in our classroom

526
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,180
and tore up all the books and papers.

527
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,250
Repeating the third year...

528
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,080
is terrifying.

529
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,030
Xianxian,

530
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,000
is this what you are thinking about?

531
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Actually,

532
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,480
if you are tired,

533
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,630
if you want to take a break,

534
00:41:53,203 --> 00:41:54,520
no one will blame you.

535
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:01,870
Senior Brother,

536
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,670
I'm so tired.

537
00:42:06,646 --> 00:42:09,170
I'm really tired.

538
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:43,760

539
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:52,105
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

540
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:55,465
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

541
00:42:57,362 --> 00:43:01,648
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

542
00:43:01,648 --> 00:43:05,405
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

543
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:12,655
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

544
00:43:12,655 --> 00:43:15,993
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

545
00:43:17,249 --> 00:43:23,028
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

546
00:43:23,028 --> 00:43:26,105
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

547
00:43:27,102 --> 00:43:30,275
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

548
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,868
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

549
00:43:32,868 --> 00:43:36,565
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

550
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,738
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

551
00:43:40,738 --> 00:43:43,315
♫  After a long journey  ♫

552
00:43:43,315 --> 00:43:47,005
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

553
00:44:09,031 --> 00:44:11,971
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

554
00:44:11,971 --> 00:44:14,645
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

555
00:44:14,645 --> 00:44:18,688
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

556
00:44:19,851 --> 00:44:22,465
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

557
00:44:22,465 --> 00:44:25,005
♫  After a long journey  ♫

558
00:44:25,005 --> 00:44:28,808
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
