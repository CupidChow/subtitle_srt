1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,485
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,071
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:26,951
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:32,123
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,829
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,378
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:47,437
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:55,233
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:01,563
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,197
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,310
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,563
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:15,089
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,877
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,229
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:27,637
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:31,450

19
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,342

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,780
Out of this paragraph, the only thing that matters is this formula.

21
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,633
You just need to remember that.

22
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,900
If you keep noting down everything, you will soon be out of this honors class.

23
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,722
 You just merely passed the line.

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,100
You ranked 45 while I ranked 38. What gives you the right to judge me?

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,330
This is the first time someone said that your performance is poor.

26
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,700
Siyue, your deskmate is very intriguing.

27
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,565
Enough. Don't laugh at Ding Xian.

28
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,700
You are not from our junior high, so you may not know this.

29
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,353
Siyue has always been the top one in our school.

30
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:18,060
And he's also a contestant in the Academic Olympiad.

31
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,820
He was preparing for the robot contest during the exams, so he didn't prepare for it.

32
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,034
And he got full marks in mathematics.

33
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,320
Oh, right!

34
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,750
Siyue, I didn't quite get the question the teacher explained during the class.

35
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,421
Can you help me? This one.

36
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,710
Can you give us some space?

37
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,886
Xianxian.

38
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,124
I chased you across the schoolyard to finally find you.

39
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,589
What's up? Why do you look so upset?

40
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,170
Don't seniors need to attend class?

41
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,507
It's study hall, so it's fine.

42
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,800
Let's go.

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,840
I'll take you to a nice place.

44
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,450
This is my secret base.

45
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,750
And it can also be yours starting today.

46
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,369
Now you can talk to me.

47
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,466
It's nothing.

48
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:27,193
I just feel there's a huge gap between me and my classmates from this school.

49
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,673
That's close to my guess.

50
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,170
There's no surprise there.

51
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,140
Don't forget that I was here 2 years ahead of you.

52
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,750
I know how it feels...

53
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,780
at the beginning of the first year.

54
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,460
Did you feel the same?

55
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,730
Yes.

56
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,750
Not as sad as you are right now, looking for a space to cry.

57
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,160
But I can understand how you feel.

58
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,510
My situation was about the same when I just arrived in Shenhai.

59
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,990
I knew no one, and I didn't know this place.

60
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,600
I used to think that a school is just a place for study.

61
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,460
But Shenhai changed my understanding of the whole world.

62
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,670
And I learned that school is not just a place to study.

63
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,450
Things that are new to me

64
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:31,120
are just routine for my classmates from this school who grew up in the city.

65
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,440
Not only they have seen more than I have,

66
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,730
even my academic performance which has always been my strength was not an advantage here.

67
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,310
Even you would feel that.

68
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,160
To be honest, I envy those from this school.

69
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,900
They know more than I do, and they have good performance.

70
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,030
I can only say that...

71
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,870
they are from a different world.

72
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,210
You must not think like that.

73
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,690
There is a great distance between us and them.

74
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,290
But you can't let that feeling swallow you up.

75
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,679
You can always increase your knowledge and vision.

76
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,629
More importantly,

77
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,580
we are already here.

78
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,170
Siyue, can you explain this question to me again?

79
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,190
I'm still a little confused.

80
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,616
Just a second.

81
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:40,693
 Xianxian,

82
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:44,690
 promise me that you won't give up...

83
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,480
 here in Shenhai either.

84
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,900
It's okay. We can switch seats.

85
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,290
You can just sit here.

86
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,187
What are you doing right now?

87
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:06,800
I'm making room for you so that you can discuss questions.

88
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,480
It will be just a minute.

89
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,020
Don't come back if you switch seats.

90
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,766
I should go pack my things, too.

91
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,920
Thank you.

92
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,920
This Ding Juncong had to mess with his sister.

93
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,587
He hid his sister's school tag.

94
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:17,997
I looked for it for the whole day.

95
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,363
That boy...

96
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,813
How did Ding Xian do at school today?

97
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:27,413
I don't know.

98
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:29,950
I didn't get to talk to her for the whole day.

99
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,510
What's up? Why are you sighing?

100
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,273
Don't you feel that we are losing Xianxian?

101
00:08:41,273 --> 00:08:43,540
Kids grow up really fast.

102
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,179
I still remember her following us around when she was little.

103
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:50,239
Now that she's grown up, she won't hang out with us anymore.

104
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,683
You are worrying for nothing.

105
00:08:54,383 --> 00:08:56,980
She's a teenager now.

106
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,087
I would be damned if she could be close to her parents.

107
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:02,270
Just wait for a few years.

108
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,380
If you have time to sigh here, you might as well take care of her and her brother.

109
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,230
It's already okay if they have you.

110
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,450
Ding Juncong has been in his sister's room for a long time.

111
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,850
What is he doing?

112
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,020
Mom and Dad, I'm back.

113
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,220
Xianxian, you are back.

114
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,280
Have some fruit.

115
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,230
No, I'm okay.

116
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,212
What did I tell you? Was I wrong?

117
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,737
Ding Juncong.

118
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,780
What are you doing in my room? Did I give you my permission?

119
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,980
You didn't lock your door, so I let myself in.

120
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,380
- Did you look at my diary? 
 - No, I didn't.

121
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,436
- So, what are you doing with my dairy? 
 - I didn't look at it!

122
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:49,036
You didn't...

123
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,030
Ding Juncong!

124
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,690
Mom! My sister is attacking me again!

125
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,270
- Mom! What's going on? 
 - Have you lived too long already?

126
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,010
- What are you doing? 
 - Mom, look!

127
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,930
- Can't you use your notebook? 
 - Mom!

128
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,830
You had to use mine.

129
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,934
Enough.

130
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:05,370
It's just a notebook.

131
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,331
Shouldn't you be more reasonable than your little brother?

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,640
Besides, you could have finished one more exercise

133
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,020
with the time you spent on the dairy.

134
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,246
He didn't mean it.

135
00:10:17,246 --> 00:10:20,176
Why are you so angry?

136
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:22,280
I didn't let this get in the way of my studies.

137
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,180
He was the last one on the test, not me.

138
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,820
Why are you always lecturing me instead of him?

139
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,999
Am I not your daughter?

140
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,253
How could you say that to me?

141
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:36,796
How could you say that?

142
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,580
Do you think my life is easy?

143
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,480
I'm taking care of everything around the house all day long.

144
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,740
You are the elder one, can't you cut him some slack?

145
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,340
- Okay. Calm down. 
 - Why do you have to fight with him?

146
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,310
Enough. Let's all calm ourselves down.

147
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,690
Xiansian, don't be mad.

148
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,010
Go back to your room now.

149
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,650
Right, your mom found this!

150
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,900

151
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:09,400
 If I catch anyone without the school tag, she or he can go home right away.

152
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:31,049
Naughty!

153
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,470
Don't cry.

154
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,450
You mustn't cry!

155
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:14,815
Come in!

156
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,000
Siyue!

157
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,360
I bought some golden cakes from Moon Pavilion Restaurant this afternoon.

158
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,010
They are really delicious.

159
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,610
Bring some to Xianxian tomorrow.

160
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,890
What?

161
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,200
Xianxian just moved here and she's your classmate.

162
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,180
Try to take care of her more often.

163
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,885
Don't let a girl feel bad.

164
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:37,606
Okay. I know.

165
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,306
Don't stay up late.

166
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,470
Ding Wencheng, stop messing with your computer. Come on.

167
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,637
This school is different from the one back home.

168
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:57,150
They are using multimedia for teaching.

169
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,350
I have to figure it out.

170
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,387
So... the seniors will arrive earlier.

171
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:05,100
I have to go now.

172
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,900
Xianxian, I'm not going to wait for you.

173
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,510
Sister, sorry.

174
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,790
It was my fault.

175
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:34,850
I shouldn't have taken your dairy without your permission then burned it.

176
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,030
Sister, I know I was wrong.

177
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,420
Can you forgive me?

178
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,760
Sister, please.

179
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,836
Please forgive me.

180
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:47,812
If you won't forgive me, Mom will beat me up.

181
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,100
Did I say that?

182
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,490
See?

183
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,503
Then don't touch my stuff again.

184
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:02,623
All right. I promise!

185
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,026
Ding Xian, I got you a bowl of your favorite, Century Egg and Pork Congee.

186
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:16,095

187
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,300
Can you stop looking?

188
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,800
This is annoying.

189
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:39,393
Don't mind him. That's just how he's like.

190
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:42,790
My name's Liu Xiaofeng. Looking forward to knowing you better.

191
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:47,156
Ding Xian, are you close with Zhou Siyue?

192
00:14:47,156 --> 00:14:49,340
- No. 
 - Really?

193
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,376
Then why did he leave you something in your drawer before you came in?

194
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,820
This is yours.

195
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,910
My mom asked me to bring this to you.

196
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,863
I'm not taking anything from you.

197
00:15:08,863 --> 00:15:10,760
Those are golden cakes.

198
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,760
I've been wanting to have this for a long time.

199
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,150
All right, you should have it.

200
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,856
Siyue, your mom has such a keen eye for food.

201
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:21,340
Cut the nonsense. I can't believe that you said that you were not close.

202
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,596
I admire him so much.

203
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:24,350
He's the ace when it comes to the Academic Olympiad.

204
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,000
You feel very comfortable when you see him solving problems.

205
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,150
That's art.

206
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,329
I can't believe that I'm in the same class as my hero.

207
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:34,386
You are so annoying.

208
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:36,740
You just like to pick on nice people.

209
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,174
I have never seen you so cranky with Deng Wanwan when she was sitting here.

210
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,240
Watch out.

211
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,126
It's quite dusty.

212
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,466
Can you sharpen your pencil in the back of the classroom?

213
00:16:03,386 --> 00:16:05,506
Sorry.

214
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,950
He Xingwen is outrageous.

215
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,470
He has always been like this.

216
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,880
A wooden head who knows nothing but studying.

217
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,180
It must be bad luck for the Little Monster to sit next to him.

218
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,670
Am I right?

219
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,997
It's not like I know him well.

220
00:16:29,997 --> 00:16:31,845
How would I know?

221
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:34,930
You don't know him well but he knows you quite well.

222
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,330
Have you forgotten? When we were in junior high, you two used to fight for first place in mathematics.

223
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,010
There was one time, you got sick and only got second place in the exam.

224
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,978
He was so happy for a whole week.

225
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:44,790
Really?

226
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,390
Yeah.

227
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,300
You weren't in our class in junior high.

228
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,560
That day, Siyue's temperature reached 40, and he still took the exam.

229
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:10,000
Liu Xiaofeng, have we already received the math exercise for today?

230
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,940
Yes. You weren't here.

231
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,280
He Xingwen must have kept a copy for you.

232
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:21,807
He Xingwen, have you kept a copy of the exercise for me?

233
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,516
That's not my obligation.

234
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:26,896
Go ask the representative.

235
00:17:29,977 --> 00:17:32,550

236
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:45,033
So, do you have any copies of today's exercise?

237
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:48,570
I have returned the rest to the teacher.

238
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,657
What? Your deskmate didn't keep a copy for you?

239
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:54,007
It's okay. I'll go ask the teacher for a copy.

240
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,760
Little Monster is too pitiful for getting a deskmate like that.

241
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,536
What's wrong with our Siyue?

242
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:07,293
It has nothing to do with me.

243
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:08,950
How could you have nothing to do with this?

244
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:13,340
If she didn't insist on switching seats, would she be in this position?

245
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,663
If you sent out the exercises properly, would she have been bullied by He Xingwen?

246
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,199
Yeah! You are the one who failed to do your job.

247
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,882
Stop using me as a shield.

248
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:23,329
That's right.

249
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:24,852
You two...

250
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:27,143
Okay. I'll do better next time.

251
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:29,343
Next time?

252
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:38,656
Mr. Liu, do you still have any copies?

253
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,660
If only you had come earlier.

254
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,500
Class 6 needed some extra copies and they took the rest.

255
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,880
I think there is a copy machine in the office of teachers for seniors.

256
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,627
Take this one and make a copy.

257
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:55,022
Okay.

258
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:58,010
- Thank you, teacher. 
 - Go ahead.

259
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,364

260
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,610
We have sent so many gifts for Teacher's Day.

261
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,043
Didn't the new teacher receive any?

262
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:16,253
- Never mind. Let's go. 
 - All right.

263
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,143
- Hello, Mr. Ding. 
 - Hello.

264
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,730
Xianxian.

265
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,533
Dad.

266
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,460
What are you doing here?

267
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,580
Why don't we walk home together after school today?

268
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,350
Okay.

269
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:03,260
Xianxian, I know that you are a very sensitive person.

270
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:09,558
We should adapt to this new environment and new people together.

271
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:14,636
We are a father-daughter alliance. What do you think?

272
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,780
I'll go buy some chestnuts for you.

273
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,610
That used to be your favorite, right?

274
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,660
Wait for me.

275
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:49,020
 Dear Xian, this notebook is a gift for the new semester from dad.

276
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,790
 This is a new environment for us.

277
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,299
 You were already quite sensitive,

278
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:58,950
 so you must have a lot of thoughts,

279
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,454
 secrets, and feelings that have nowhere to go.

280
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:08,675
 You never talk about them, but I understand you and support you.

281
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:10,833
 We will work hard together.

282
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,016
 Never give up, Xianxian.

283
00:21:13,016 --> 00:21:19,413
 It turns out that just like me, Dad needs to work hard to adapt, too.

284
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,380
 Dad, I will be fighting alongside you.

285
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,052
Xianxian, here.

286
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:33,130
Thank you, Dad.

287
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,110
What is this?

288
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,740
Dad, happy Teacher's Day.

289
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:53,129
Thanks.

290
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,240
My daughter is becoming more and more caring.

291
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,940
I'll hold it for you.

292
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,220
Let's go.

293
00:22:06,313 --> 00:22:07,313
Let's go.

294
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,369
Old Ding? Xianxian?

295
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,070
Are you taking a walk?

296
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,470
- Auntie! 
 - And also picking Siyue up.

297
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,160
Look, he's right behind you.

298
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,760
- Siyue. 
 - Uncle Ding.

299
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,070
Is Zhou Zongtang not back yet?

300
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,920
I'm waiting to have a drink with him.

301
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,583
You two should cut it down.

302
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,190
You are no longer in your twenties. Health should come first.

303
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:51,803
Right, Xianxian.

304
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:55,100
How were the golden cakes I brought you?

305
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,040
They are delicious.

306
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,310
I ate them all.

307
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,230
Really? That's great.

308
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,117
I'll buy some for you another time.

309
00:23:03,117 --> 00:23:04,933
- Thank you, Auntie. 
 - Thank you.

310
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:06,470
That's okay.

311
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,830
Look how well they've been getting along.

312
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,190
Just like when you and Zhou were in school.

313
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,420
Tell me about it.

314
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,163
You are such a good liar.

315
00:23:14,163 --> 00:23:16,813
Aren't you afraid that your stomach will explode if you eat them all?

316
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,493
I thought you were tricking me.

317
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:20,653
Who could have known that it really came from your mom?

318
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,350
Why don't we let them hang out

319
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,940
before and after school?

320
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,426
Yeah.

321
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:31,160
They can go to school and come back from school together.

322
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,230
We will make them breakfast in turn.

323
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,950
- It's so convenient. 
 - That's great!

324
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,830
Why didn't I think of this earlier?

325
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,040
All right.

326
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,080
Siyue, you should stop riding your bike from now on.

327
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,920
Walk to school with Xianxian.

328
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,280
Is that okay, Siyue?

329
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,110
If you can walk with Xianxian before and after school,

330
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,940
I will have nothing to worry about. Is it okay for you?

331
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,347
Yes. Of course.

332
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,560
That's great.

333
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,590
You are also in the same class.

334
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,710
Do help each other.

335
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,106
That's for sure.

336
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:07,140
Ding Xian and I get along quite well in class now. It's very pleasant.

337
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,710
- Great. 
 - This is great.

338
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,960
Yes.

339
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,700
- Then that's settled. 
 - Okay.

340
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,840
- I'll prepare breakfast tomorrow. 
 - Okay.

341
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,960
Your acting skill is not bad either.

342
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,460
- Same to you. 
 - I'll do it the day after tomorrow.

343
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,380
- All right. 
 - See you!

344
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,368
Yes! See you!

345
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,510
Let me handle that.

346
00:25:03,183 --> 00:25:04,430
 Ding Xian,

347
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,310
 why didn't you tell me that Auntie Li got something for you?

348
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,430
 I will prepare something for you later.

349
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,500
 We need to return the favor.

350
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,110
Okay.

351
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,710
Got it.

352
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,400
Morning, Zhou.

353
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Morning.

354
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,380
Hey.

355
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,630
Anything you want to say,

356
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:46,579
Classmate Zhou Siyue?

357
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,109
Your breakfast.

358
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,850
Marinated egg again?

359
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:53,689
Do you think this is funny?

360
00:25:54,895 --> 00:25:57,190
I thought you liked marinated eggs.

361
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,899
I don't like them at all.

362
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:01,269
Throw them away if you don't.

363
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,740
Are you coming or not?

364
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,180
You can go first if you are in a hurry.

365
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,420
Hey.

366
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,937
If it weren't for our parents,

367
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:16,717
do you think I would want to wait for you?

368
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:24,870
Master Zhou, it's enough to put on a show in front of others.

369
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,542
Don't take this seriously.

370
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,700
Ding Xian, if you don't want to have that,

371
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,800
I can take care of it for you.

372
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,336
Here.

373
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:44,776
You are actually a good friend.

374
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:50,696
Master, you are working hard early in the morning.

375
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:53,040
And you are making a scene.

376
00:26:57,373 --> 00:26:58,873
Stand up!

377
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,592
Hello, Teacher.

378
00:27:03,592 --> 00:27:05,092
Sit down.

379
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:08,460
This is a study hall session.

380
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,540
I'm going to give you some exercises

381
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,460
and I have to go out for a meeting.

382
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,780
Come on. The three of you, send the copies to everyone.

383
00:27:20,163 --> 00:27:22,110
- Deng Wanwan. 
 - Yes.

384
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,180
You will be in charge of discipline.

385
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,130
Note down anyone who's talking.

386
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,710
I will punish them when I get back.

387
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,210
Okay.

388
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,010
Behave, all of you.

389
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,350
No one talks from now on.

390
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,370
I'm starting to write down names.

391
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,370
Liu Xiaofeng,

392
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,060
let me borrow your math notes.

393
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,180
What?

394
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,400
Notes! Let me borrow your math notes!

395
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,510
Deng Wanwan,

396
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,430
Ding Xian and Liu Xiaofeng have disturbed me.

397
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:08,350
I mean, He Xingwen,

398
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:11,033
Ding Xian is just asking for my notes.

399
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:13,773
It's not like we were chatting. How could we have disturbed you?

400
00:28:13,773 --> 00:28:14,773
Never mind.

401
00:28:19,673 --> 00:28:20,780
Look!

402
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,740
Their names are on the blackboard.

403
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,280
Mr. Liu,

404
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Ding Xian was just asking for my notes.

405
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,180
We weren't chatting.

406
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:04,786
Borrow notes?

407
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,710
Why didn't you do that before the class started?

408
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,710
Look at you.

409
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,000
You aren't focused on your studies at all.

410
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,660
You are borrowing notes and switching seats.

411
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,790
Do you think I can't see all the things you are doing?

412
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,560
Do you, Ding Xian?

413
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,730
Mr. Liu, it was my fault.

414
00:29:28,656 --> 00:29:31,940
Ding Xian, don't blame me for saying this.

415
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,640
You need to adjust your attitude.

416
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,660
Aunt Liu is lashing out!

417
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,030
- Look at you. 
 - Mr. Liu.

418
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,400
You have already...

419
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,590
I would like to report.

420
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,490
Song Ziqi was also talking during class.

421
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,070
Song Ziqi, you have become a badass now, have you?

422
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,770
Stand up!

423
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,163
Mr. Liu, not just me.

424
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,250
Kong Shadi and this classmate behind me were also talking.

425
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,806
And those two talked, too.

426
00:30:02,806 --> 00:30:04,636
And He Xingwen also talked.

427
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:09,389
Stand up, all of you.

428
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,753
You are quite honest now.

429
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,560
I do admire you.

430
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,820
Your schedule is tight enough, and you still have the time to have fun.

431
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,610
If you all have so much time,

432
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,577
stay behind after school and clean the classroom.

433
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,857
No one goes home before finishing up here.

434
00:30:32,923 --> 00:30:34,523
It's all your fault.

435
00:30:44,023 --> 00:30:45,423
What are you looking at?

436
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:47,506
Sorry.

437
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,221
You feel good, don't you?

438
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,920
Ding Xian, why are you such a bother?

439
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,783
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be cleaning here.

440
00:31:18,783 --> 00:31:22,120
Why is every day so miserable ever since you become my deskmate?

441
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,700
He Xingwen, don't push your luck.

442
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,400
What did Ding Xian do to you?

443
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,926
Why are you targeting her all the time?

444
00:31:27,926 --> 00:31:29,159
Why?

445
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,519
You are always speaking up for her.

446
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,700
Who is she to you?

447
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,560
He Xingwen, how can you say that?

448
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,230
You are not acting like a gentleman at all.

449
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,560
Do that again and Siyue will beat you up.

450
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,700
What does this have to do with me?

451
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,880
I'm kidding. Just kidding.

452
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,300
Let's see what happens next.

453
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,726
Mr. Ding.

454
00:31:55,726 --> 00:31:57,215
Mr. Liu, you dare done with class?

455
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,043
- Are you busy right now? 
 - No.

456
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:00,540
Can I talk with you?

457
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,710
Yes. Please say what you want.

458
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,280
I don't know if you know

459
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,760
that a student in Class 8, Grade 3

460
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,800
used to be the top one in the class.

461
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,640
Later, there was some conflict,

462
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,130
and that student's performance dropped sharply.

463
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,130
Really?

464
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,730
If you ask me,

465
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,400
performance is important,

466
00:32:20,053 --> 00:32:24,403
but relationships with classmates are also important.

467
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,850
Mr. Liu, did something happen to Xianxian?

468
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,710
I'll be straight with you.

469
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:36,960
A student told me that Ding Xian has problems with her classmates.

470
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,950
Let me help you.

471
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,120
Thank you.

472
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:53,590
It's okay. You stood up for me before.

473
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,900
I haven't thanked you for that.

474
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,660
But I have never met someone so unreasonable.

475
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,360
He deserves it.

476
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,430
Ding Xian, since He Xingwen is so annoying, why don't you switch your seats back?

477
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,030
Let's take a break.

478
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,070
No. Our class adviser just talked about this.

479
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,470
Moving back is impossible.

480
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,950
It's all Deng Wanwan's fault.

481
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,270
If she didn't take your seat, this wouldn't have happened.

482
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,730
Never mind. Let it go.

483
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,760
- Let's go. 
 - Let me.

484
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,510
Can you stop walking around with that thermos in your hand?

485
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,920
This is so annoying.

486
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,460
Your daughter is having problems with others at school,

487
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,506
and as her mother, you are not worried at all.

488
00:33:47,506 --> 00:33:49,268
She just needs to focus on her studies.

489
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:51,640
Why bother to think about connections?

490
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,060
You are prejudiced!

491
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:57,850
Why don't we go hang out in a game room this weekend?

492
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,550
Sure.

493
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,280
We can ask Deng Wanwan to come along.

494
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,910
She asked me out.

495
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,940
But I actually think that Deng Wanwan is not that annoying.

496
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,430
She's enthusiastic.

497
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:17,260
Unlike Little Monster, she's so insensitive.

498
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,620
And she can easily get angry, do you remember?

499
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,361
You are so annoying.

500
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,490
Am I hallucinating? I think I heard Little Monster talking.

501
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,400
Can you not speak softly?

502
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,710
Did you hear that?

503
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,510
She has become sensitive.

504
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,939
Xianxian.

505
00:34:50,946 --> 00:34:52,646
Dad.

506
00:34:54,073 --> 00:34:55,573
Here.

507
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,800
These are...

508
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,540
I thought you might be tired, so I bought you some snacks.

509
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,913
Have some.

510
00:35:05,913 --> 00:35:07,513
Thank you, Dad.

511
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,800
Look at the Olympics.

512
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,653
Our country is so strong now.

513
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:23,653
Dad,

514
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,889
wassn't the Olympics last year?

515
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,630
Last...

516
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,180
I just took something randomly.

517
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,574
And it's from last year.

518
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,610
Xianxian,

519
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:43,700
you have been reading current affairs and politics. Right?

520
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,006
Yes.

521
00:35:45,006 --> 00:35:47,040
Our teacher required us to watch the news more often.

522
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,910
- It can help us in exams. 
 - That's right.

523
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:54,640
Now that I'm here, I would like to tell you something.

524
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,710
Look. Now China's international status

525
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,290
is becoming more and more steady.

526
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:04,260
This year, we launched the first man-made circumlunar satellite.

527
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,610
Last year, we held the Olympics.

528
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,209
Do you know how many countries are giving us the thumbs up?

529
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:15,433
But we need to calm ourselves down and keep getting better.

530
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:18,226
Diplomacy.

531
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:22,053
We need to focus on diplomacy especially.

532
00:36:22,053 --> 00:36:24,023
Do you know why?

533
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,360
I'm going to put it in a simple way for you.

534
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,968
Let me give you a metaphor. Okay?

535
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:34,860
Consider the earth as your class.

536
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,560
And you are China.

537
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,610
Your classmates are the other countries.

538
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,910
China,

539
00:36:45,657 --> 00:36:46,980
you.

540
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:52,543
If China wants to develop in this class,

541
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,453
what does it need to do?

542
00:36:55,453 --> 00:36:56,953
It has to...

543
00:36:58,913 --> 00:37:02,679
be strong and independent so that it can be respected.

544
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:08,473
It's the same for a country, a nation, and one person.

545
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:11,840
You need to control your destiny at any point.

546
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,660
That's how a great country does things.

547
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,890
Our teacher said so.

548
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,913
That makes sense, too.

549
00:37:22,913 --> 00:37:26,446
Although, I think...

550
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:31,349
I think you should cut down on snacks.

551
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:37,009
Tomorrow, bring the snacks to your class and share them with your classmates.

552
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:40,820
And bring this box of chocolate to Zhou Siyue.

553
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,760
I'm not doing that.

554
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,787
Silly girl!

555
00:37:43,787 --> 00:37:45,587
You have to do it.

556
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:48,190
And stop eating that.

557
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,630
You will gain weight.

558
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,050
Focus on your studies.

559
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:06,230
Give them to my classmates.

560
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,690
Who should I give them to?

561
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,970
Uncle Ding.

562
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,600
- Siyue. 
 - Morning.

563
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,080
Siyue, just a second.

564
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
So...

565
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,005
Siyue, I'd like to ask you something.

566
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:33,680
Has anything unpleasant happened to Xianxian at school lately?

567
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,860
Did something happen, Uncle Ding?

568
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:41,360
I always feel like she's not happy when she gets home.

569
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,280
And she won't tell me anything whenever I ask.

570
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,780
I'm worried that something might have happened to her at school.

571
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,940
Okay, don't worry, Uncle Ding.

572
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,436
I'll keep an eye on her at school.

573
00:38:53,436 --> 00:38:55,220
All right. Thank you, Siyue.

574
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,560
Come to our place for a meal when you have time.

575
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,060
- Dad. 
 - Xianxian.

576
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,720
You two should head to school now. I have to go.

577
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,290
Aren't you going to school now? We are going to be late.

578
00:39:38,256 --> 00:39:39,656
Walk on the inside.

579
00:39:40,507 --> 00:39:42,207
Thank you.

580
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,530
Little Monster. Siyue.

581
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:50,210
Why are the two of you walking so closely?

582
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,550
We aren't.

583
00:39:54,293 --> 00:39:56,193
Why is she running?

584
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,150
Why did you bring all these snacks all of a sudden?

585
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,710
Because my dad insisted that I should pay attention to diplomacy.

586
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,610
He asked me to bring snacks to my classmates to bond with them.

587
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,670
Why aren't you sending them out to your classmates?

588
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,120
I don't know who I should give them to.

589
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,410
I thought about it and you are the closest friend I have.

590
00:40:22,263 --> 00:40:26,060
Xianxian, it takes time to get familiar with your classmates.

591
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:30,177
In time, you will find that everyone has a kind side.

592
00:40:31,644 --> 00:40:33,346
I believe in you.

593
00:40:33,346 --> 00:40:35,046
You can do this.

594
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,470
I can do this.

595
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,520
Okay, students. Dismiss.

596
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,420
It's free activity time.

597
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:51,857
Let me help you.

598
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,150
Thank you.

599
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,650
Why are you being polite?

600
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,360
Are girls all that simple?

601
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:01,633
Okay.

602
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,509
Let me show you something.

603
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,660
I don't know about the others,

604
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,690
but she sure has a knack for it.

605
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,850
You know her so well.

606
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,630
Do you have feelings for her?

607
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,600
I have feelings for you.

608
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,900
That's disgusting!

609
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,020
So, do you still want to cancel your marriage?

610
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,670
Can you stop talking?

611
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,430
You ranked 45 while I ranked 38. What gives you the right to say that to me?

612
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,600
Song Ziqi, what are you talking about?

613
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,390
You are looking for trouble, aren't you?

614
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,290
Hey.

615
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,740
Make my deskmate happy.

616
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,790
If you can do that, I'll give you three-shot handicap.

617
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:50,367
Little Monster, you are a generous person.

618
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:52,720
Please forgive me.

619
00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:59,120
Never mind. I'll let this go.

620
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,890
Siyue, let's play!

621
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:28,980

622
00:42:31,142 --> 00:42:36,480
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

623
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,492
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

624
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:45,975
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

625
00:42:45,975 --> 00:42:51,132
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

626
00:42:51,132 --> 00:42:57,082
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

627
00:42:57,082 --> 00:43:01,620
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

628
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:07,355
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

629
00:43:07,355 --> 00:43:11,629
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

630
00:43:11,629 --> 00:43:14,502
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

631
00:43:14,502 --> 00:43:17,195
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

632
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:22,192
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

633
00:43:22,192 --> 00:43:25,065
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

634
00:43:25,065 --> 00:43:27,642
♫  After a long journey  ♫

635
00:43:27,642 --> 00:43:32,032
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

636
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:56,398
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

637
00:43:56,398 --> 00:43:58,972
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

638
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:04,078
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

639
00:44:04,078 --> 00:44:06,792
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

640
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:09,432
♫  After a long journey  ♫

641
00:44:09,432 --> 00:44:14,535
