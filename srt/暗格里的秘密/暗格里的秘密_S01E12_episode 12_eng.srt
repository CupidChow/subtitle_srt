1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,730

2
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,444
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:23,030
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,910
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,082
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:36,788
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:40,437
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:47,496
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:55,040
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,892 --> 00:01:02,222
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:04,256
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,269
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:09,622
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,622 --> 00:01:15,148
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:17,936
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:20,288
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:27,471
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:31,350

19
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:34,329

20
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:43,630
Anyway, now I think it's great to have Ziqi, Shadi,

21
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,130
and you around.

22
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,580
You are wonderful as well.

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,600
So,

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,180
since you've made up your mind,

25
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,948
let's begin with a small target.

26
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,569
We'll work hard together.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
All right.

28
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,580
- Hello? 
  - Xianxian, you need to get back.

29
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,740
 Something happened back home.

30
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,010
No one knows if your grandma can get through this time.

31
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,071
I have to go back to take care of her.

32
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:24,890
Juncong is too young. I can't leave him behind.

33
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,280
Can you stay at home by yourself?

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,650
Yes.

35
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,080
Mom, don't worry.

36
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,780
Grandma will be fine.

37
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,660
Your dad has to live on the campus since he's teaching seniors.

38
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,610
You have to take care of yourself.

39
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,570
Don't get distracted by things like these.

40
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,930
School is starting soon. Focus on your studies.

41
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,390
Remember that.

42
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,290
Got it.

43
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,239
Oh, right!

44
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,840
- Daily expense... 
 - ...Is on the table.

45
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,340
I should remember to bring it.

46
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,340
Have some fruit daily.

47
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,650
And text you or call you.

48
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,860
Ask Auntie Li for help if anything happens.

49
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,160
I have remembered it all.

50
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:11,300
Jinyun, I need to trouble you again.

51
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,980
Don't say that.

52
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,800
The elder's health is the point right now.

53
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,570
Just go and don't worry about things here.

54
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,500
We will take good care of Xianxian.

55
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,270
Auntie, don't worry about her.

56
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,386
Then I'm going to leave.

57
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,170
Here, Xianxian.

58
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,570
Yours.

59
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,830
Things happened out of the blue.

60
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,510
I didn't prepare much.

61
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,120
Have some wontons first.

62
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,420
Xianxian,

63
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:10,430
or why don't I talk to your mom and let you stay at our place for now?

64
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,070
Siyue, what do you say?

65
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,690
Well... that depends on her.

66
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,540
Not yet, Auntie.

67
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,000
I can take care of myself.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,230
Fine.

69
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,500
If you ever need anything, come and talk to me.

70
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,010
Don't feel awkward asking.

71
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,684
And come to our place and dine with us.

72
00:05:38,684 --> 00:05:41,024
It would be more cheerful if we have more people at home.

73
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,250
Thank you, Auntie.

74
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,593
You guys enjoy it. I'll head out and buy some fruit.

75
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,190
Enjoy.

76
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,340
Don't forget your wallet again.

77
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,215
Got it.

78
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,120
I can't finish all that. You should have some more.

79
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,130
I want to ask you,

80
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:12,621
what if my grandma...

81
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,480
Don't say that.

82
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,830
What you should worry about is taking care of yourself so that your mom won't be worried.

83
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:26,160
When your grandma is healed, you will be able to meet her in a good condition.

84
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,690
How wonderful would that be?

85
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,660
Don't worry.

86
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,130
Your grandma will be fine.

87
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,779
Finish your food.

88
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,290
Auntie, I'd like to head back now.

89
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,300
Xianxian, stay here for a little longer.

90
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,497
It's okay, Auntie.

91
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:59,170
I've been staying here for a day now.

92
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,490
I've bothered you enough.

93
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,060
Pay more attention now that you are living by yourself.

94
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,970
Tell me if anything happens.

95
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,600
- Siyue, go walk Xianxian home. 
 - All right.

96
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,660
It's okay. My place is really close. I can walk out on my own.

97
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,820
Okay.

98
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,540
Be careful on your way home.

99
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,180
- Don't worry, Auntie. 
 - All right.

100
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,060
- See you, Auntie. 
 - See you.

101
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,860
Take care.

102
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:31,366
It would be great if my parents allowed you to stay at my place.

103
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:33,750
It's okay.

104
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,110
It's the same to talk to me on the phone at night.

105
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,970
 Aren't you afraid to stay at home by yourself?

106
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,033
 And what if...

107
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,450
Stop that. I didn't think this would matter.

108
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,940
But now that you've said it, I feel...

109
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,740
Shadi!

110
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,900
Stop talking for a second.

111
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,780
Get out. Someone is here, in the apartment. Go!

112
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,780
It's me.

113
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,790
That's some heavy strikes.

114
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,910
You...

115
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,050
How did you...

116
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,860
Your mom left a spare key in our place before she left.

117
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,500
I've been knocking forever but no one answered.

118
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,820
I was afraid.

119
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
I thought you were...

120
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,620
I'm just glad that everything is fine.

121
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,959
The security guard caught a thief scouting the area.

122
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,945
A thief?

123
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,130
Look at your door.

124
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,320
It's marked.

125
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:12,653
Hello?

126
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,660
She's fine. She's with me.

127
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,762
You guys go home now.

128
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,540
Who is that?

129
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,026
It's Song Ziqi.

130
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:25,930
Kong Shadi told him that you were in danger.

131
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,050
They were on their way here.

132
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,200
You scared the hell out of me.

133
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,540
It must be really troublesome for you.

134
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,180
How could that be troublesome?

135
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,780
You are acting like a stranger right now.

136
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,906
Thank you for taking care of Xianxian.

137
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:50,136
I'll be right on my way once things are done over here.

138
00:10:50,136 --> 00:10:51,900
Keep in touch.

139
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,340
All right. See you.

140
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,370
Here.

141
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:03,962
Auntie,

142
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:06,900
I might be bothering you for a while.

143
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,160
Don't say that. You are always too polite.

144
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,050
I'm glad that you are fine.

145
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,380
I can still sense the terror.

146
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,980
We told you to stay with us.

147
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,890
Oh, Siyue. Go help Xianxian pack her things and move here as soon as possible.

148
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,120
It's okay. I can pack my things on my own.

149
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,950
I'm glad that Xianxian is fine, and nothing really happened.

150
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,200
What did I tell you?

151
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,860
They live so closely. If anything happens,

152
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,066
Siyue will rush to her place right away.

153
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:45,050
I was worried about her.

154
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,930
Do you think everyone is careless like you are?

155
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,890
Fortunately, Siyue is considerate.

156
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,820
If anything happens to me, would you be there?

157
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,610
Have some conscience!

158
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,559
Have I ever been absent when anything happens to you?

159
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,880
Maybe not.

160
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,780
You should pay more attention to my good deeds.

161
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,670
You've done more bad things.

162
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,110
How am I supposed to remember all those things?

163
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,740
This is boring. Let's go.

164
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,940
Where are we going?

165
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,658
We are already out. It's still early.

166
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:17,360
You can't be considering going home.

167
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,117
There's a restaurant over there.

168
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:21,217
I'll take you for a meal.

169
00:12:21,217 --> 00:12:23,525
Never mind. I should pay for it.

170
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,010
You are treating me to a meal?

171
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,250
Am I hallucinating?

172
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,050
What?

173
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:36,750
Since you've taken a lot of bullets for me, this one is on me. Let's go.

174
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,080
Thank you, Shadi.

175
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,700

176
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:55,130

177
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,960

178
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,800

179
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,065
 My mom told me that my grandma looked so much better today.

180
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:29,340
 The doctor said that she would be out of ICU soon.

181
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,935
 Another thing is that I'm going to stay at Zhou Siyue's place tomorrow.

182
00:13:35,935 --> 00:13:41,200
 Is this the irresistible force of fate?

183
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,980
 The door of fate suddenly opened at the end of this summer.

184
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,630
Morning.

185
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,940
Have you packed everything?

186
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,190
You have just one case?

187
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,866
My place is close by.

188
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:26,570
I can always come back and pick up things.

189
00:14:29,157 --> 00:14:30,957
Let's go.

190
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:34,740
- Where are we going? 
 - Shopping.

191
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,910
This doesn't look bad.

192
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:46,050
And this is not bad either.

193
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,030
Let's get some juice.

194
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,423
And one instant noodle.

195
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:09,233
We need some shampoo.

196
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:12,359
One second.

197
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:18,470
Do you think I need to use anti-hair loss shampoo?

198
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,670
I still don't need it.

199
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,450
I have a lot of hair to lose.

200
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,490
I don't know which one you would prefer.

201
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,320
Let's buy a few types and try them.

202
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,950
Let's just take the most basic one.

203
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,210
We still need shower gel.

204
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,270
I have one at home. I can just bring it.

205
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:51,593
Okay.

206
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:53,470
You are pretty economical.

207
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,306
That's because you waste too much money.

208
00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:58,790
Let me lead the way. Give it to me. I'll handle it.

209
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,230
Hey.

210
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,480
I'll carry it.

211
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:08,153
Lead the way.

212
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:10,830
Let's head towards the stationery area.

213
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:15,073
We are in the stationery area now.

214
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:16,980
What are we buying?

215
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,860
Let's see. This is so cute.

216
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,000
It's childish.

217
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,440
It looks fancy, but it's expensive and hard to use.

218
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,110
When have you ever seen me using that?

219
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,380
This is amazing.

220
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,640
Are you a kid?

221
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,760
Even my brother is not using that anymore.

222
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,370
What does your brother know?

223
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,893
Here. One for each of us.

224
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:54,380
Fine.

225
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,522
Let it compensate for your childhood.

226
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:58,422
Come on.

227
00:16:58,422 --> 00:16:59,996
What else?

228
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:04,000
Ding Xian. Zhou Siyue.

229
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,830
Keke!

230
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,490
What are you two doing together?

231
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,010
This is my new errand boy.

232
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,090
Fine. Whatever you say.

233
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,559
What are you two doing together?

234
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:30,700
Wh-Why can't we hang out?

235
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,280
Let's put that aside.

236
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,340
She told me that you are so good at pool.

237
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,858
Why don't we have a go at it sometime?

238
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,550
Can you try to find out some worthy information?

239
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:45,653
What are you doing?

240
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:48,300
Don't interrupt when girls are talking.

241
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,210
What's going on with you two?

242
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,350
Nothing.

243
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,680
Stop lying and tell me the truth.

244
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,300
It's just that...

245
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,210
You are living with Zhou Siyue?

246
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,540
What?

247
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,750
 You didn't even tell me something so important!

248
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,540
 I had to hear it from Keke.

249
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,640
No. It's not like that.

250
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,260
I'm just staying at his place for a few days.

251
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,485
 Xianxian, can I come in?

252
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:23,130
Auntie, please come in.

253
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,490
 Xianxian, I got you a new towel.

254
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:29,880
Is this room serving you well?

255
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,700
It's a little hasty, so I just arranged it quickly.

256
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,330
Tell me if you need anything.

257
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,190
It's okay. I have everything here.

258
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,280
It makes me happy to see you.

259
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,370
You are nice and sensitive.

260
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,190
I have always wanted to have a daughter like you.

261
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,680
 I forgot to put away the photos.

262
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,580
This was taken when Siyue was young.

263
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,120
Auntie, isn't this in Keshan?

264
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,840
Yes. That's your place.

265
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,243
That's the first time Siyue ever went to Keshan.

266
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,730
There happened to be a flood.

267
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,490
His grandpa sent him to your place.

268
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,660
He cried for the whole day after he got back, saying that he was never going to Keshan again.

269
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,500
I think he was terrified by the flood.

270
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,520
This one is interesting.

271
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,340
That's a photo of Siyue dressed up like a girl when he was young.

272
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,180
- This photo... 
 - Mom!

273
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,998
Why did you take that photo out again?

274
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:30,286
How come you are everywhere?

275
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:32,530
I'm having a chat with Xianxian.

276
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:36,730
Xianxian, if he ever bothers you, tell me.

277
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,950
I'll make him pay.

278
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,090
All right.

279
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,040
But he's actually nice, Auntie.

280
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,710
Take a shower before going to bed.

281
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,950
Siyue, help Xianxian to unpack.

282
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,981
Thank you, Auntie.

283
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,260
You look unusual...

284
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,060
in that photo.

285
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,190
My mom was obsessed with giving me weird looks back then.

286
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,670
Who would remember stories from childhood?

287
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,910
Take a shower and sleep.

288
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,820
 Ding Xian! Hello?

289
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,340
 Hello, Ding Xian.

290
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,140
Hello?

291
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,860
And you are saying nothing happened! Now, you are taking a shower.

292
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,085
- No. It's not like that. 
  - I don't care.

293
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:40,833
The girls are having a meeting tomorrow. You have to be there. See you.

294
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,090
Why didn't you lock the door?

295
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:04,473
You should continue.

296
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,780
Where is the hairdryer?

297
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:14,149
Mom!

298
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,330
Where is the hairdryer?

299
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:21,060
 It's in... the cabinet under the sink.

300
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,350
 Look carefully.

301
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:58,303
Ding Xian.

302
00:21:59,176 --> 00:22:01,626
We are about to be late.

303
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,950
Are you still sleeping?

304
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:17,330
 The second set of national gymnastics for middle school students.

305
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,660
 The era is calling.

306
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,450
 Ready! Go!

307
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,916
What's your problem, Zhou Siyue?

308
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,516
Hurry up!

309
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:50,741
Why are you riding a bike today?

310
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:52,093
You are so slow.

311
00:22:52,093 --> 00:22:53,664
I don't want to be late.

312
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,380
It's not like I begged you to wait for me.

313
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,026
You could have gone if you were in a hurry.

314
00:22:58,026 --> 00:23:00,070
I have really spoiled you.

315
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,540
Hey.

316
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,740
If you don't want to be late, you can beg me to give you a ride.

317
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,210
I don't need that.

318
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,963
Sleepyhead!

319
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,515
Childish!

320
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,610

321
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,460
Morning, Shadi.

322
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,760
Morning.

323
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,783
I've seen this before.

324
00:23:34,783 --> 00:23:39,190
How's life with your dream guy in the next room?

325
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,180
What are you talking about? What dream guy?

326
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,540
He's a psycho!

327
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,940
You should know when to take a win.

328
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,711
You have to tell me everything today.

329
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,636
Living in the same apartment is not as nice as you imagined.

330
00:23:54,636 --> 00:23:55,838
Think about it.

331
00:23:55,838 --> 00:24:03,036
Would you like to see Song Ziqi at every corner every day?

332
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:05,016
Now that you mention it,

333
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:08,230
we did live together for a while when we were young.

334
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,620
Tell me about it.

335
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,420
Here's the story.

336
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,420
Song Ziqi has always liked to run away from home when he was young.

337
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,090
Back then, our families were close.

338
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,300
He liked to come and stay at our place. He'd sleep on the floor of my room.

339
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,780
And when he sleeps, he snores, grinds his teeth, and farts.

340
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,380
And that's not the most outrageous thing.

341
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,941
- You know what the most outrageous is? 
 - What?

342
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:32,210
Every time... I mean, every time!

343
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,300
After our nap in the middle of the day,

344
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,400
he was always on the bed and I was on the floor.

345
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,753
How could he do that?

346
00:24:41,753 --> 00:24:46,380
In comparison, my life is pretty good.

347
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,270

348
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:15,386
Thank you.

349
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,540
What else?

350
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,700
Didn't you talk about things during the night?

351
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,200
What would we say?

352
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,437
We were both exhausted.

353
00:25:29,437 --> 00:25:30,820
That's boring.

354
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,220
Boring.

355
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,940
Although, if we think about it, this is like "Full House."

356
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,562
There are still a lot of days ahead.

357
00:25:40,562 --> 00:25:43,500
You should cut down on teen dramas.

358
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,380
On the other hand, I think the shorter the distance,

359
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,660
the easier your illusion about each other vanishes.

360
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,010
Like you would know.

361
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,920
It's not like you've lived with anyone else.

362
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,320
You...

363
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,930
I'll let you do the talking.

364
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,180
I don't know what to say.

365
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,680
Anyway, I am happy.

366
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,260
What a fickle girl.

367
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,602
Master Zhou, how are things going?

368
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:26,746
A guy and a girl in the same house.

369
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,500
That's complete nonsense.

370
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,730
Where did the "in the same house" come from?

371
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,697
Was I wrong?

372
00:26:34,697 --> 00:26:36,710
Little Monster is at least

373
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,240
a young, beautiful, and neat girl.

374
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,330
A girl.

375
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,620
What about me? Why would I take him in?

376
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,920
A guy. And I had to pay for his family dispute.

377
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,796
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

378
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,830
When are you planning to go back this time?

379
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,013
Don't blame me for saying this. Your dad has outdone himself this time.

380
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:01,533
This is not the first time he has done this.

381
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:05,890
But it is a new record, right?

382
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,380
Think about it.

383
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,970
Even if your dad doesn't want to find you since he's angry,

384
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,477
your mom would inevitably feel a little worried. Right?

385
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,950
Come on, let's go play games.

386
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,959
My mom went to play Mahjong. Let's make do with this.

387
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,190
Do you usually have dinner by yourself?

388
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,410
It is joyous to have someone to dine with.

389
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,610
Not bad.

390
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,812
Really? Then you should cherish the time we have.

391
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,130
There's nothing to worry about.

392
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,490
I could always be a freeloader at your place.

393
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,545
In your dreams!

394
00:28:13,163 --> 00:28:15,143
It's a little salty, right?

395
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,390
My mom doesn't cook.

396
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,920
How about this?

397
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,594
Let's go have dinner outside.

398
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:25,250
No. I think it's nice.

399
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,872
Besides, home cooking is always the better choice.

400
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,680
Enjoy. And do the dishes later.

401
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,420
What?

402
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,090
I never charged you for the tutoring.

403
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,497
You should make it up to me.

404
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,818
All right. I'll do the dishes, Master Zhou.

405
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,853
You have prepared fruit, too.

406
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:11,137
If you are not watching TV, can I?

407
00:29:11,137 --> 00:29:12,910
Sure.

408
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,110
Where did you put the remote control?

409
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,100
Did you hide it?

410
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,830
Why would I hide it?

411
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,180
It's not here.

412
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,660
Stand up and let me see.

413
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,786
I didn't hide it. Don't touch me!

414
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:39,062
I saw it. You did hide it. It's here.

415
00:29:39,062 --> 00:29:41,553
You are still trying to talk your way out of this.

416
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:43,980
Have you finished your homework yet?

417
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,587
I have. Just let me watch it.

418
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:49,573
All right.

419
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,282
Come. If you can grab it, you get to watch it.

420
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,300
Zhou Siyue! Stop pushing me!

421
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,690
Even if I am pushing you, so what?

422
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,426
I've been fighting with my brother for the remote control at home for years. That counts for something.

423
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,328
You strike hard!

424
00:30:19,328 --> 00:30:23,277
It's because you always get to watch TV in peace.

425
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,316
Look at you.

426
00:30:31,316 --> 00:30:35,346
You are just like my brother when he can't get the remote control.

427
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,160
Hey.

428
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,660
Did you use the website I gave you last time?

429
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,360
I did.

430
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,200
And I like it a lot. Thank you.

431
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,940
I'm glad. My effort was not in vain.

432
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:13,413
If you need a computer, you can use mine. The password is six zeros.

433
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,540
Really?

434
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,100
You can have the remote control. Let me borrow your computer.

435
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,130
Don't stay up too late. We need to get up early tomorrow.

436
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,930
 Got it!

437
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:34,831

438
00:31:38,526 --> 00:31:40,380
I told you to sleep earlier.

439
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,420
Look at how you slept during classes.

440
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,020
I did go to sleep early.

441
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,140
 I was playing Mahjong with Zheng's wife.

442
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,994
 He said that Zheng was at home, tutoring his son.

443
00:31:49,994 --> 00:31:52,160
 Zhou Zongtang, you lied to me.

444
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,809
 Can you knock it off?

445
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:55,570
 The kids are about to get back.

446
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,640
 I said it a lot of times, and you just won't believe it.

447
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,080
 Zheng was there.

448
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,830
 He left after a phone call.

449
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,780
 Jiang was there with me the whole time. You can ask him about it.

450
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,280
 Don't treat me like I'm clueless. Jiang is on your side.

451
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,152
 He lied for you before.

452
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:08,960
 I don't trust him.

453
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,950
 Zhou Zongtang, tell me the truth.

454
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,640
 Do you have another woman out there?

455
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,000
 What are you talking about? I can't do this with you.

456
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,630
Xianxian is here.

457
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,940
Why didn't you say that you were home?

458
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,491
You didn't tell me you were back either.

459
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:30,840
You must be hungry now.

460
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,070
Jinyun, the kids are back.

461
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,910
I'm going to cook now.

462
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,300
Siyue and Xianxian are back. I'll go help your dad.

463
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,240
Come in!

464
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,293
Do you have another question?

465
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:34,090
I'll go help you after I finish this.

466
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,896
It's okay. You should focus on what you are doing.

467
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,060
You are preparing for the Academic Olympiad, right?

468
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,530
I just wanted to check up on you.

469
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,080
My room is a bit messy.

470
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,740
Sit.

471
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,140
Have you read all these books?

472
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:20,660
I just want to tell you

473
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,260
that I will never tell another soul about what I heard today.

474
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,052
I promise. I swear.

475
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,646
All couples fight.

476
00:34:31,646 --> 00:34:34,276
Don't be sad.

477
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,080
What?

478
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,570
Did you just realize that my family is not as harmonious as you thought,

479
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,993
so you feel things are fair now?

480
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:49,466
No.

481
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:51,166
Really?

482
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,203
Maybe a little.

483
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:04,436
But I'm not gloating.

484
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,295
It's okay.

485
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,190
My mom doesn't work.

486
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,560
So, she's all focused on my dad.

487
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,580
You know that my dad is busy at work.

488
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,160
He never had the time to stay with my mom.

489
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,693
That's why my mom is always suspicious and making scenes.

490
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:29,909
I'm used to it.

491
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,738
Besides, look at my mom.

492
00:35:37,738 --> 00:35:40,220
She grew up in a well-off family.

493
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,960
That's why she thinks everyone is doing everything for her sake.

494
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,500
She never holds a grudge.

495
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:52,155
She will forget a lot of things in a few days.

496
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:58,390
But I do remember all the things

497
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,760
that my mom has gone through.

498
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,280
What?

499
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,970
Did you just realize that I'm also not as nice as you thought?

500
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,728
No. Why would I think that?

501
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,040
Stop lying to me.

502
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,256
I think you are great.

503
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,207
We are just 17.

504
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:37,059
There will be a lot of trouble and confusion.

505
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,390
No one is perfect.

506
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,040
So, don't pressure yourself.

507
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,000
My dad and I are different.

508
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:01,080
I will never let people around me feel bad.

509
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:19,019
You drink it. Sleep tight afterward.

510
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,803
 When Shadi and Keke asked me that day,

511
00:37:45,803 --> 00:37:48,563
 I didn't know the answer.

512
00:37:48,563 --> 00:37:50,870
 But I think,

513
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:55,560
 for me, maybe there is no fantasy or disillusionment.

514
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,020
 Sometimes he's sweet

515
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,766
 and sometimes annoying.

516
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,260
 He can be vulnerable occasionally.

517
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,820
 All of those things about him just makes me happy.

518
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:13,500
 Because right now, he's real, both in my heart

519
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,560
 and in front of me.

520
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,870
 He won't disappear.

521
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,920
What are you smiling about?

522
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,582
We have been getting along pretty well lately.

523
00:38:30,582 --> 00:38:33,736
And I know a lot of his secrets.

524
00:38:33,736 --> 00:38:36,680
What secrets? Let me hear them.

525
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,570
I can't. I promised to keep those secrets for him.

526
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,780
You are such a spoilsport.

527
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,580
But I would never have guessed

528
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,090
that Master Zhou who has always been perfect

529
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,560
would have something that you can use.

530
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,450
Have you heard about what happened to He Xingwen?

531
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,660
I think his dad had an accident at the construction site.

532
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,460
Stand up!

533
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,660
Hello, Teacher.

534
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,360
Please take a seat.

535
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:34,150
Some of you may have heard that there has been an accident in He Xingwen's home.

536
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,660
Although this is a donation of your own will,

537
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,780
I still hope you would lend a helping hand

538
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,742
so that He Xingwen and his family can get through this hard time.

539
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,413
I do sympathize with him.

540
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:02,415
But I'm also angry when I think about what he did.

541
00:40:02,415 --> 00:40:04,330
He's so bad.

542
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,640
I feel like I'm helping evil

543
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,500
when helping him.

544
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,080
That's silly. You can't use being evil in this situation.

545
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,660
I don't like him either.

546
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,960
But we can't mix things together.

547
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,820
We should still help him.

548
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,180
I'm still mad.

549
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,900
He reported Ding Xian before.

550
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,100
And he got us punished for talking last time.

551
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,898
Maybe he's responsible for what happened to Siyue last time.

552
00:40:27,898 --> 00:40:30,935
Cut the "maybe." It was him.

553
00:40:30,935 --> 00:40:34,160
Mr. Liu talked to him later. We all know about that.

554
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,710
Did you know?

555
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,300
It doesn't matter.

556
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,240
The money is not for him.

557
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,180
It's for his grandparents.

558
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,730
If they lost their son, and find out that their grandson is having a hard time,

559
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,867
they would be really sad.

560
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,270
Did you donate all your pocket money?

561
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,100
Just doing what I can.

562
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,940
If something like this ever happened to me,

563
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,290
I would want people to help me.

564
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,253
That's a lot.

565
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:35,860
It doesn't matter how much, this is just a gesture.

566
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,579
Let's go.

567
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,820
Thank you.

568
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,380
Another thing.

569
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,130
Sorry.

570
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,280
Come on! Just ask me if you are having trouble learning.

571
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,130
Don't spend the whole day struggling by yourself.

572
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,540
Things will only get harder.

573
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,090
I can't keep relying on you all the time.

574
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,530
I need to pull my own weight.

575
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,368
Nice. If you can think like that,

576
00:42:25,368 --> 00:42:27,800
I'm glad as your master.

577
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,300
Oh, right. Would you be recommended

578
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,710
to go to Huaqing after the Academic Olympiad?

579
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,450
If I can get first place this time,

580
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,090
and with the other certificates I got before,

581
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,216
it might happen.

582
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,660
What?

583
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,560
Nothing.

584
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,566
I just envy you.

585
00:43:00,566 --> 00:43:02,800
If you are recommended to Huaqing,

586
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,543
you would be joining your dad in Jiangling.

587
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:09,422
Jiangling is grand and busy.

588
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,905
I would like to see it, too.

589
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,340
Ding Xian, why don't you also...

590
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,020
What?

591
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:30,110
Why don't you also go to a university in Jiangling?

592
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:47,840

593
00:43:49,811 --> 00:43:55,201
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

594
00:43:55,201 --> 00:43:58,861
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

595
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:04,644
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

596
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:09,901
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

597
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:15,751
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

598
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:20,389
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

599
00:44:20,389 --> 00:44:26,124
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

600
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:30,301
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

601
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:33,271
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

602
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:35,964
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

603
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:41,161
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

604
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:43,834
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

605
00:44:43,834 --> 00:44:46,311
♫  After a long journey  ♫

606
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:51,201
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

607
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:15,067
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

608
00:45:15,067 --> 00:45:17,741
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

609
00:45:17,741 --> 00:45:22,784
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

610
00:45:22,784 --> 00:45:25,561
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

611
00:45:25,561 --> 00:45:28,101
♫  After a long journey  ♫

612
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:33,090
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
