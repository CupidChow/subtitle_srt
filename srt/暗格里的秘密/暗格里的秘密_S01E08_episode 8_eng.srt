1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,010

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,285
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:23,064
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:26,944
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:32,016
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,822
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,822 --> 00:00:40,471
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:47,530
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:54,426
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,923 --> 00:01:01,356
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:04,190
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,303
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:09,656
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:14,682
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,870
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,222
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,222 --> 00:01:27,566
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:31,814

19
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:34,214

20
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:37,117
Things are clear to me now.

21
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:38,777
Our daughter is not little anymore.

22
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:41,077
She gets to make her own choices.

23
00:01:41,077 --> 00:01:43,207
There's nothing I can do about that.

24
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:47,747
But there's still something I can do about you.

25
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,307
I don't care.

26
00:01:51,217 --> 00:01:54,837
I don't care what you have to do, transfer her to a liberal arts class!

27
00:01:55,397 --> 00:01:57,097
If you fail to do that,

28
00:01:57,097 --> 00:02:00,077
you are doing all the laundry and cooking yourself starting tomorrow.

29
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:01,947
I'm not doing anything for you.

30
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:03,947
You...

31
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:15,647
Xian.

32
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:20,627
Your teacher did a home visit and gave us this.

33
00:02:22,787 --> 00:02:24,627
How could your mom not be mad?

34
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:27,247
Xian,

35
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,847
do you know why your mom is acting like that?

36
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:33,116
She thinks you've grown up and you no longer need her.

37
00:02:33,116 --> 00:02:35,297
But she doesn't know how to express herself.

38
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:37,017
That's why she's acting like that.

39
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:38,537
You should understand your mom.

40
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,016
And I also need to say something.

41
00:02:42,016 --> 00:02:45,147
Why did you turn in the form of intent behind our backs?

42
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:50,598
Dad, that's my fault.

43
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:53,767
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

44
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,377
Can you talk to mom

45
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:58,867
so that I won't be transferred to a liberal arts class?

46
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:01,607
My life in the current class is nice.

47
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:05,577
And I don't want to be separated from my friends.

48
00:03:06,457 --> 00:03:11,477
Okay. I'll talk to your mom for you.

49
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:15,017
But my power is limited.

50
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:16,767
I can only give you one month.

51
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:20,147
If you can get good results in the next monthly test,

52
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:23,867
then maybe we can work something out.

53
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:25,567
Agreed?

54
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,220

55
00:04:10,227 --> 00:04:14,427
Therefore, the staff arrangement of the liberal arts and sciences departments is temporarily like this.

56
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:17,577
And, of course, this is not final.

57
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:20,007
If any of you feel like transferring

58
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:23,757
to a liberal arts class after a while, come talk to me.

59
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:26,317
We'll arrange that as soon as possible.

60
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:30,067
I'm not going to talk about the questions in the placement test.

61
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:32,877
You will get the answers later.

62
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:38,044
Analyze the ones you got wrong and deliver it by Friday.

63
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,767
Okay. Let's get back to the lesson.

64
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:47,627
 I can only give you one month.

65
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:50,967
 If you can get good results in the next monthly test,

66
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:54,787
 then maybe we can work something out.

67
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,287
 Agreed?

68
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:05,983
What are you thinking about?

69
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:10,357
I'm thinking...

70
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:16,347
that things didn't change much after the placement.

71
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:18,907
That's because not many people chose liberal arts.

72
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,727
How can you say things didn't change?

73
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:23,533
Yang Chunzi, the goddess, is gone.

74
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:27,007
Do you feel so sorry about that?

75
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:30,167
Why don't you go with her?

76
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:33,217
It's too late.

77
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:36,727
Do you know what else is late?

78
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:38,327
What?

79
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,027
You can forget about this video game

80
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:44,057
- I promised to lend to you. 
 - Don't!

81
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:45,647
My Lady, please let me borrow it.

82
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:47,017
Go ask Yang Chunzi if she has a copy.

83
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:48,597
You can borrow it from her.

84
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,453
I'm not lending it to you.

85
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:52,347
Song Ziqi! Kong Shadi!

86
00:05:52,347 --> 00:05:53,957
Stand up.

87
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,127
It's all your fault.

88
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:02,297
Go stand in the back.

89
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:08,607
The rest of you, take out your math textbook...

90
00:06:09,257 --> 00:06:11,217
and turn to page 23.

91
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,700
Let's continue our lesson.

92
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:18,757
Today, we are going to talk about the division algorithm.

93
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:21,907
The division algorithm is a method

94
00:06:21,907 --> 00:06:24,357
documented in Euclid's original script.

95
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:26,917
There are no two same numbers.

96
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:30,407
If you keep deducting the small numbers from the bigger ones,

97
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:33,697
keep doing that if the former number has a remainder after the division

98
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:36,367
until the remainder is deduced to one unit.

99
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:44,627
Dad.

100
00:06:45,297 --> 00:06:47,720
- Xianxian. 
 - Why are you on this floor?

101
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,933
I thought you said that I had one month.

102
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,120
I'm here to print something.

103
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,700
The printer upstairs is broken. Don't worry.

104
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,547
Did you talk to Mom?

105
00:06:56,547 --> 00:06:58,357
Is she still mad?

106
00:06:58,907 --> 00:07:00,537
A little.

107
00:07:01,347 --> 00:07:03,604
Your mom has one condition.

108
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:06,974
You need to achieve 270 or above on the science comprehensive.

109
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:09,375
Is she trying to kill me?

110
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,157
Just let her have my life.

111
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:14,667
Silly girl, she gave you your life.

112
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:17,347
There's only so much I can do.

113
00:07:17,347 --> 00:07:18,937
I can only take you this far.

114
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:21,077
Break a leg.

115
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,990
Thank you, Dad.

116
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,836
How am I supposed to get 270?

117
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,367
Preparing for the contest and learning at the same time.

118
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:40,017
No common person can bear that.

119
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:43,107
Poor thing.

120
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:55,537
You are awake.

121
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:58,937
Did you stay up late to do exercises again?

122
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,207
Wouldn't you get too tired from that?

123
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:05,202
Can you get enough sleep?

124
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:08,107
It's okay.

125
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:10,567
I've taken a nap.

126
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,957
What happened?

127
00:08:24,347 --> 00:08:25,577
I would like to ask

128
00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:28,277
if there's any way that I can achieve more than 270

129
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:31,647
on the science comprehensive in one month?

130
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,757
You can dream about it.

131
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:47,787
You need to think less and do more exercises.

132
00:08:47,787 --> 00:08:50,497
With your current level, forget about 270.

133
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,657
It would be hard for you to get to 250.

134
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:56,457
You are 250.

135
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:06,007
I need to work hard starting now.

136
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:07,607
Fighting!

137
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:27,817
Here, Juncong.

138
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,227
Have some more meat.

139
00:09:29,227 --> 00:09:32,102
Boys need to have more meat when they are growing.

140
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:36,226
Mom,

141
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:39,310
why did you make so much delicious food?

142
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,067
For you two students.

143
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:45,456
Come on, the dishes will get cold.

144
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,880
Okay.

145
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,507
They are delicious.

146
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,730
Mom, thank you.

147
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,130
Have more food.

148
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:06,687
I've been cooking for more than a decade now,

149
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:08,997
and that's the only nice word I've heard.

150
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,367
Here, Juncong.

151
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,097
Have some more.

152
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:19,477
We are having a feast tonight.

153
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:23,033
Where's my...

154
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,657
I'm not so hungry.

155
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,369
You guys enjoy it.

156
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,927
I'll go read.

157
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:01,937
Tomorrow is the weekend.

158
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:05,167
I'll take you to buy a pair of glasses with a higher prescription.

159
00:11:05,876 --> 00:11:07,276
Thanks, Mom.

160
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:09,617
Do not slip.

161
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:11,957
We agreed on 270 for the science comprehensive.

162
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:13,977
Not even one point less.

163
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,350
Okay.

164
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,327
270.

165
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:22,507
Not even one point less.

166
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,940

167
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,357
Guys, quiet.

168
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:30,937
You have all gotten the physics weekly test results.

169
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:33,177
Mr. Yang asked all of you to do a wrong answer analysis within a week

170
00:11:33,177 --> 00:11:35,557
and bring it to his office.

171
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:37,947
Don't forget that.

172
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,760
What is it?

173
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,830
I'm hopeless.

174
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,017
Let me see.

175
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,180
You've got the formulas for this question wrong.

176
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,030
You shouldn't have lost points.

177
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,766
And this one.

178
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:26,207
You misunderstood the question.

179
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:28,787
The mass of the table tennis ball is the misleading factor.

180
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:31,667
And you shouldn't have been wrong about this, either.

181
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,227
This one.

182
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:37,867
This one is more ridiculous.

183
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,347
Most of it is right.

184
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:42,017
Why did you make a mistake on the math which is the simple part?

185
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:44,350
What were you thinking?

186
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:47,057
If I had done all the right things,

187
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,327
then I would have been the one who scored 90.

188
00:12:50,327 --> 00:12:53,072
You are looking for excuses when you made mistakes.

189
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,457
This one...

190
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,627
Xianxian.

191
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,197
Senior!

192
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,127
What are you doing here?

193
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:22,557
Don't you have classes at the university?

194
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:26,197
School hasn't started yet. I wanted to check on you.

195
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,877
Do you have a minute?

196
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,807
Your mom has such a high demand for you means she believes you have the potential.

197
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:51,007
So, you don't need to feel frustrated.

198
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:54,447
Because I also believe that you can do it.

199
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,094
I thought I could do it, too.

200
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:03,107
But the difference is obvious under comparison.

201
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,907
You can ask me any questions.

202
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,567
Didn't you choose liberal arts?

203
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:11,917
You are underestimating me.

204
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,447
I can at least tutor you.

205
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:21,627
I might be going through a little confidence crisis.

206
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,087
But thank you, Bocong.

207
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:26,477
Oh, right!

208
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:28,677
There's another reason that I came here.

209
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,597
I was going to take a photo with you at the graduation ceremony.

210
00:14:33,597 --> 00:14:36,847
But I didn't have the chance. You have to make it up to me today.

211
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:38,720
No problem.

212
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,123
Come.

213
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:00,489
You are already a university student in the blink of an eye.

214
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:03,947
Are we not going to see each other for a long time?

215
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:06,907
That's not a problem. I will be back for the holidays.

216
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,907
I need to get back to class.

217
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:14,417
The class adviser will be there soon.

218
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,584
Xianxian.

219
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,957
This is for you.

220
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,287
I hope you...

221
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:46,707
can always smile like that.

222
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,757
Of course.

223
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,970
Go back to class.

224
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,320
Okay.

225
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,297
Xian, I just remembered that...

226
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,900
Hey.

227
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,717
Who took that photo for you?

228
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,208
Senior Bocong took the photo just now.

229
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,328
Let me see.

230
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:28,668
Look at her smile when she turned around.

231
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:30,347
This Bocong really knows how to take photos.

232
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:32,697
Look!

233
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,717
I've written down why you made all the mistakes.

234
00:16:35,717 --> 00:16:38,187
Go back and take a look tonight.

235
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:40,497
And there are two sets of exercises.

236
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,957
Finish them tonight and return them to me tomorrow.

237
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,737
Two sets of exercises in one night?

238
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:50,767
You can skip them if you think they're hard.

239
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:53,707
You can still get into a university with 200 points in the science comprehensive.

240
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,507
I'm not refusing to do them.

241
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:58,427
Zhou Siyue.

242
00:16:58,427 --> 00:17:01,877
Why are you so cruel to Xian?

243
00:17:01,877 --> 00:17:03,806
You think this is cruel?

244
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,857
The NCEE is so much more ruthless.

245
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,087
I'm helping her.

246
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,687
Maybe you should focus on the Math Olympiad first.

247
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,310
Okay.

248
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,287
You will no longer be my problem.

249
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,983
Xianxian.

250
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,347
Why aren't you at school?

251
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:51,937
Morning, Auntie.

252
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,427
I'm waiting for Zhou Siyue.

253
00:17:53,427 --> 00:17:55,447
Is he coming?

254
00:17:55,447 --> 00:17:57,097
Didn't he tell you?

255
00:17:57,097 --> 00:18:01,957
He went to the training camp first thing in the morning with the Math Olympiad group.

256
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,727
I understand now.

257
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:08,387
I should leave now, Auntie.

258
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,147
Take care.

259
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:11,760
See you, Auntie.

260
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,210
See you.

261
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,497
 With its huge waves are gone all those heroes of bygone years.

262
00:18:20,497 --> 00:18:22,217
 West of the ancient fortress appears Red Cliff

263
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:26,307
 where General Zhou won his early fame when the three kingdoms were in flames.

264
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:30,017
 Rocks tower in the air and waves beat on the shore.

265
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:32,567
 Rolling up a thousand heaps of snow.

266
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,547
 After Zhou Siyue went to the Math Olympiad,

267
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,247
 I found days without a deskmate to be so strange.

268
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,117
 It's like he headed to a battlefield by himself.

269
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,387
 Maybe it's my illusion.

270
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,217
 After all,

271
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:02,517
 he should be familiar with the life of competitions.

272
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,827
 Who will pick the fallen flowers up now?

273
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:17,787
 Sitting along at the window, waiting for the day to darken.

274
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:23,077
 On the parasol tree leaves the fine rain drizzles as twilight grizzles.

275
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:27,587
 What can I do with grief, beyond belief?

276
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:34,537
 I always thought that he would head to a world that was more vast.

277
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,417
 By the light he shed,

278
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:40,737
 I caught a glimpse of that world.

279
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,607
 And I realized that I want to be in that world, too.

280
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:49,397
 I don't want to be left behind.

281
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,510
I heard that the shot put team has not been recruiting recently.

282
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,687
All right.

283
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,067
What are you doing?

284
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,700
What? You scared me!

285
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:31,720
Are you stalking someone?

286
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,990
Yeah.

287
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,217
I'm not stalking.

288
00:20:36,217 --> 00:20:38,537
You are denying it after being caught.

289
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,167
That Song Ziqi!

290
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,957
Not only did he not wait for me after school,

291
00:20:43,957 --> 00:20:45,567
but he's also walking with another girl.

292
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,067
I'm so pissed right now.

293
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,467
Are you jealous?

294
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,967
I'm not jealous!

295
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:54,777
I'm going home.

296
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,657
So,

297
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,020
do you have any solutions?

298
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,397
I don't have one yet,

299
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:18,023
but I'm a little hungry.

300
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,280
I understand. I'll make the arrangement.

301
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,080
Let's go.

302
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,667
Xianxian.

303
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,297
Shadi. Keke.

304
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,180
Xianxian, why have you been working so hard?

305
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,127
The monthly test is coming. I have to be prepared.

306
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,267
When did you two become so close?

307
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,337
Hello. What would you like?

308
00:21:48,337 --> 00:21:49,584
Two lemonade.

309
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:51,084
All right.

310
00:21:56,777 --> 00:22:00,717
I thought you didn't care about Song Ziqi.

311
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:04,907
If the dog you raised since childhood ran away with someone else, wouldn't you be anxious?

312
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:09,157
If I'm mad, Song Ziqi can't have any peace either.

313
00:22:09,157 --> 00:22:11,237
I have a solution.

314
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:14,397
You can go hang out with someone else and piss him off.

315
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:20,889
Throw a party and invite everyone in front of him but leave him out.

316
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:22,467
See how he would react.

317
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,907
That's a good idea.

318
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,757
My birthday is coming up.

319
00:22:25,757 --> 00:22:28,217
I'm going to throw a birthday party this weekend.

320
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:30,557
You have to come.

321
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:35,807
When did you two become so close?

322
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:38,827
Your friends are my friends.

323
00:22:38,827 --> 00:22:40,300
Are you coming or not?

324
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,977
Of course. I will come.

325
00:22:42,977 --> 00:22:44,930
Lemonade is here.

326
00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:49,610
- Thank you. 
 - You are welcome.

327
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,357
What are you doing here?

328
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,620
You didn't even tell me.

329
00:22:58,217 --> 00:22:59,597
Let me take a sip. I'm so thirsty.

330
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:01,137
Go buy one yourself.

331
00:23:01,137 --> 00:23:02,937
Let me drink...

332
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,007
Song Ziqi!

333
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:10,387
What's wrong with taking a sip from your glass? You are so stingy right now.

334
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:15,707
Thank you.

335
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,536
Come on, let's go home.

336
00:23:17,536 --> 00:23:18,757
You can go home by yourself.

337
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:21,037
I'm leaving with Keke today.

338
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:26,507
Okay. I'm leaving now. See you.

339
00:23:41,297 --> 00:23:46,397
Do you think that was an indirect kiss?

340
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:57,057
Okay. I got it. Wait for me at the pool club.

341
00:23:57,057 --> 00:23:59,327
I can't talk any longer. See you.

342
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,917
Hello, Siyue. Aren't you at the training camp?

343
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:10,107
 Yes. Do me a favor. Keep an eye on Little Monster.

344
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:24,007
My classmates, I'm having a birthday party this weekend.

345
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:25,667
Why don't you all join us?

346
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:28,423
Sure. Who else will be there?

347
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:31,384
It's just me, Ding Xian,

348
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:33,687
and a girl from Class 10.

349
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:35,197
The three of us.

350
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:37,337
Why don't you all come?

351
00:24:37,337 --> 00:24:40,427
- Okay. 
 - All right. That's what they like.

352
00:24:40,427 --> 00:24:43,817
- Are you coming? 
 - Kong Shadi, what have you planned?

353
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,707
My birthday party...

354
00:24:45,707 --> 00:24:49,977
You know, karaoke, dinner, pool.

355
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:51,827
Whatever you like.

356
00:24:51,827 --> 00:24:55,307
You guys have fun and my dad will pay the bill.

357
00:24:56,157 --> 00:24:57,020
Awesome.

358
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,587
Really? Don't lie to us.

359
00:24:58,587 --> 00:24:59,987
Why would I do that?

360
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:01,477
I'll vouch for her.

361
00:25:01,477 --> 00:25:03,917
The one she had last year was bigger than this one.

362
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,917
It was fun, to be honest.

363
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:07,387
Count me in, then.

364
00:25:07,387 --> 00:25:08,947
Okay. You are in.

365
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:11,517
Who else wants to come? Come talk to me after the class.

366
00:25:11,517 --> 00:25:12,787
Come talk to me. Come and talk to me after the class!

367
00:25:12,787 --> 00:25:14,707
Come and talk to me after the class!

368
00:25:15,587 --> 00:25:21,237
My Queen, are you having a huge birthday party?

369
00:25:21,237 --> 00:25:23,507
You've made some big moves.

370
00:25:23,507 --> 00:25:27,467
Do you know that the monthly test is right after the National Day holiday?

371
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:30,257
Can you get full marks or what?

372
00:25:30,257 --> 00:25:32,057
Can you?

373
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:33,263
No.

374
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:35,453
Then watch your behaviors.

375
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:37,560
Get back to your homework!

376
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,017
You are awake.

377
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:09,337
Coming!

378
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:10,977
Xianxian.

379
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,600
Shadi. Keke. Come in.

380
00:26:16,187 --> 00:26:18,077
No need to change your shoes.

381
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,636
I was just mopping the floor.

382
00:26:19,636 --> 00:26:21,836
- Okay. 
 - Come inside.

383
00:26:22,687 --> 00:26:24,787
You guys have a seat.

384
00:26:25,587 --> 00:26:27,330
Are you alone at home?

385
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,630
Yes. My mom took my brother out

386
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,830
and my dad went back to Keshan.

387
00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:35,420
What brought you here?

388
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,120
To ask you to come to my birthday party.

389
00:26:38,737 --> 00:26:42,707
When Mr. Liu scolded you last time, didn't you say you wouldn't do the party?

390
00:26:42,707 --> 00:26:46,753
Don't mention it. That twat, Song Ziqi, didn't react at all.

391
00:26:46,753 --> 00:26:50,997
But the three of us can still hang out.

392
00:26:52,847 --> 00:26:56,600
But I have a lot of homework to finish.

393
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,977
Are you crazy?

394
00:26:57,977 --> 00:27:00,933
This is my birthday, Ding Xian.

395
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:05,197
Yeah. You could bring your homework along if you have to.

396
00:27:07,347 --> 00:27:11,226
Okay. So, let's go.

397
00:27:11,226 --> 00:27:17,031
Ding Xian, is that what you are wearing for her birthday?

398
00:27:17,031 --> 00:27:20,077
What's wrong with what I'm wearing?

399
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,587
I knew it.

400
00:27:23,587 --> 00:27:27,197
Fortunately, I prepared something. Here. Put it on.

401
00:27:27,197 --> 00:27:29,607
What's this?

402
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:32,617
Why would I be wearing it

403
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:33,977
if it's your birthday?

404
00:27:33,977 --> 00:27:36,217
No one would look at me even if I wear it.

405
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:39,457
Why don't you try it on?

406
00:27:39,503 --> 00:27:41,303
Just a second.

407
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:47,592
What is it now? What's the deal with your bowl cut?

408
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:52,013
Don't even mention it. What else could be the matter?

409
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:56,197
All right. I'll handle it for you.

410
00:27:56,197 --> 00:27:57,597
Let's go.

411
00:27:57,597 --> 00:27:58,447
How are you going to handle it?

412
00:27:58,447 --> 00:28:00,577
Fix your bowl cut.

413
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:02,867
Would it be...

414
00:28:16,776 --> 00:28:19,886
I'm going back if you two keep being so lame.

415
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:24,717
This is the most boring birthday I've ever had.

416
00:28:24,717 --> 00:28:28,577
I'm so miserable!

417
00:28:28,577 --> 00:28:32,227
Why don't I go shopping with you?

418
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:33,337
Boring.

419
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,097
How about the amusement park?

420
00:28:35,097 --> 00:28:37,297
Also boring.

421
00:28:38,547 --> 00:28:40,807
- So, what do you want? 
 - I want a crowd.

422
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:42,497
I want to party.

423
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:47,007
I want him to be here with me.

424
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:55,197
I knew you would be here.

425
00:28:57,217 --> 00:28:58,497
Aren't you having a birthday party?

426
00:28:58,497 --> 00:28:59,667
Where are the others?

427
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,890
The birthday party is canceled.

428
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,420
What?

429
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,336
I thought you were not coming.

430
00:29:05,336 --> 00:29:09,827
Why would I do that? I have been here for all your birthdays.

431
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,000
This is your gift.

432
00:29:12,547 --> 00:29:14,907
Don't ask me anything again this year.

433
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,300
What happened, My Lady?

434
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,000
She wants a crowd, she wants to party.

435
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,707
And she wants everyone to be here with her.

436
00:29:28,707 --> 00:29:30,617
That's it?

437
00:29:30,617 --> 00:29:32,307
Come on, let's go sing karaoke.

438
00:29:32,307 --> 00:29:35,827
I'll contact our classmates and invite more people.

439
00:29:35,827 --> 00:29:38,687
Really? All right!

440
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:41,287
Xianxian, let's go together.

441
00:29:41,287 --> 00:29:45,607
You guys should go. I need to finish the exercises.

442
00:29:45,607 --> 00:29:50,257
This is my birthday. I want you to be there with me.

443
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:52,587
I can't sing anyway.

444
00:29:52,587 --> 00:29:54,707
I would be a liability there.

445
00:29:54,707 --> 00:29:57,427
I'll make it up to you after the monthly test.

446
00:29:57,427 --> 00:29:59,327
I swear.

447
00:29:59,327 --> 00:30:03,147
Just let her go home. Or her family would be worried.

448
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:07,337
All right. Be careful on the way home.

449
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:08,857
- We are going to leave now. 
 - Okay.

450
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:10,126
See you.

451
00:30:10,126 --> 00:30:11,926
See you.

452
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:23,487
 Zhou Siyue, the monthly test is coming.

453
00:30:24,307 --> 00:30:30,897
 My parents might transfer me to a liberal arts class if I can't do well.

454
00:30:31,587 --> 00:30:34,117
 I'm so nervous.

455
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:47,317
- I want two. 
 - Okay.

456
00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:53,377
Here. Take them.

457
00:30:53,377 --> 00:30:54,547
Thank you.

458
00:30:54,547 --> 00:30:56,047
Let's go.

459
00:30:56,617 --> 00:30:58,337
Hello. I want a bottle of water.

460
00:30:58,337 --> 00:30:59,837
All right.

461
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,137
Here's the money. Take it.

462
00:31:02,137 --> 00:31:04,237
Okay. Thanks.

463
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,547
Hello, what would you like?

464
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:07,867
- A bottle of water, please. 
 - All right.

465
00:31:18,497 --> 00:31:22,407
- Here's your cell phone. 
 - You! Thief! Don't run!

466
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:35,737
Hello. What is it?

467
00:31:35,737 --> 00:31:38,837
 Siyue, Ding Xian was followed.

468
00:31:38,837 --> 00:31:40,700
Where is she?

469
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,260
 I'll get over there now. You should call someone.

470
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,006
Thief! Give me back my cell phone!

471
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:46,950
And if I won't?

472
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,477
Bro, there you are.

473
00:31:50,967 --> 00:31:52,867
It's you!

474
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,720
Hey!

475
00:31:56,344 --> 00:31:57,626
Stop there!

476
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:59,237
Come back!

477
00:31:59,237 --> 00:32:00,237
Come down now!

478
00:32:00,977 --> 00:32:02,608
Stop running! Get back!

479
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:05,427
Hold there! Get back!

480
00:32:12,427 --> 00:32:14,427
Song Ziqi, come here! We got a problem!

481
00:32:23,157 --> 00:32:25,517
 Open the door! Open the door and come out!

482
00:32:25,517 --> 00:32:27,067
 Open up and show yourself!

483
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:28,467
 Open the door now!

484
00:32:28,467 --> 00:32:29,857
 Open the door!

485
00:32:29,857 --> 00:32:31,257
 Open it and come out!

486
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,217
 Come out now!

487
00:32:33,907 --> 00:32:35,137
 Do you think this will be over if you keep hiding there?

488
00:32:35,137 --> 00:32:37,137
 Open the door now! Come out!

489
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:39,097
 Open the door!

490
00:32:40,737 --> 00:32:42,237
Open the door!

491
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,520
Hey!

492
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:49,137
What are you doing?

493
00:32:51,087 --> 00:32:53,257
You are the guy from last time!

494
00:32:53,857 --> 00:32:57,307
Listen. This has nothing to do with you.

495
00:32:57,307 --> 00:32:58,807
Leave now!

496
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:01,377
And if I don't?

497
00:33:14,607 --> 00:33:16,427
What are you doing?

498
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,007
You want to get rough here?

499
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:24,377
 Go to hell!

500
00:33:25,187 --> 00:33:26,327
 You want a fight!

501
00:33:26,327 --> 00:33:27,827
 Go to hell!

502
00:33:29,827 --> 00:33:31,257
 You think you are tough?

503
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:35,847
 Brat!

504
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:39,967
Siyue!

505
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:45,830
Are you okay?

506
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,150
Hey!  It's another one.

507
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:55,047
This is boring.

508
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,107
Siyue!

509
00:34:18,947 --> 00:34:20,347
- What are you doing? 
 - Who are you?

510
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:23,007
Leave if you don't want to die.

511
00:34:23,617 --> 00:34:24,720
Let's go.

512
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
Let's go, come on.

513
00:34:26,894 --> 00:34:28,394
Ding Xian.

514
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:44,707
Xianxian, are you all right?

515
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,377
I was so worried!

516
00:34:49,617 --> 00:34:51,317
I'll walk her home.

517
00:34:52,377 --> 00:34:53,913
 We should also leave. They might call in more people.

518
00:34:53,913 --> 00:34:54,913
Let's go.

519
00:34:57,297 --> 00:34:58,637
Come on!

520
00:34:59,137 --> 00:35:01,267
No. We haven't celebrated my birthday yet.

521
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:05,067
I'll go celebrate your birthday with you. Let's go sing karaoke. Come on.

522
00:35:27,577 --> 00:35:28,577
Okay.

523
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:30,467
Go inside.

524
00:35:32,187 --> 00:35:34,187
Are you hurt?

525
00:35:34,187 --> 00:35:35,187
No.

526
00:35:35,957 --> 00:35:37,787
How is that possible?

527
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:40,097
Don't worry.

528
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:42,907
They will never look for you again.

529
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:46,197
How did you find me?

530
00:35:46,197 --> 00:35:51,547
Jiang Chen accidentally saw someone following you, so he called me.

531
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,677
Did you see the text I sent you?

532
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:01,007
Yes.

533
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:03,387
You just...

534
00:36:04,097 --> 00:36:05,617
try to relax.

535
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:07,767
Don't get yourself stressed out.

536
00:36:09,027 --> 00:36:12,017
I did well in the last weekly math test.

537
00:36:12,577 --> 00:36:15,777
I think the monthly test won't be a problem.

538
00:36:16,947 --> 00:36:20,577
It seems that you are doing well without me.

539
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:22,277
Of course.

540
00:36:23,637 --> 00:36:25,437
No.

541
00:36:27,057 --> 00:36:30,967
I would do better if you were here.

542
00:36:34,297 --> 00:36:35,797
Okay.

543
00:36:36,817 --> 00:36:37,817
Go home.

544
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:40,377
All right.

545
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:51,457
Zhou Siyue, you will do a good job...

546
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:56,047
and I will stay in the science class.

547
00:36:57,187 --> 00:36:58,587
Break a leg.

548
00:36:59,577 --> 00:37:01,177
Break a leg.

549
00:37:03,857 --> 00:37:05,157
I'm leaving now.

550
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,920

551
00:37:48,907 --> 00:37:51,863
Mom, you scared the hell out of me.

552
00:37:51,863 --> 00:37:53,817
You finally remembered to come home!

553
00:37:53,817 --> 00:37:54,817
I...

554
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:57,987
Whose clothes are you wearing?

555
00:38:00,297 --> 00:38:02,027
They are from a classmate.

556
00:38:02,027 --> 00:38:06,337
It's her birthday, so we went out together.

557
00:38:06,337 --> 00:38:07,747
Fine.

558
00:38:07,747 --> 00:38:09,427
The monthly test is coming.

559
00:38:09,427 --> 00:38:10,747
If you can't do well...

560
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:11,847
I know.

561
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:14,707
Mom, I will keep learning.

562
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,330
♫  Can I spend the night?  ♫

563
00:38:42,337 --> 00:38:43,237
 Hello?

564
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,060
Are you back?

565
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,700
Yes.

566
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:51,347
I'm in my dorm.

567
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:56,957
Were you scolded after you went back?

568
00:38:58,427 --> 00:39:00,490
How is that possible?

569
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,520
The teachers never caught me.

570
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,290
♫  It's been a long day since you're gone  ♫

571
00:39:05,297 --> 00:39:06,697
That's great.

572
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:11,307
I'm relieved that you are fine.

573
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:17,990
♫  I am not the one who doesn't wanna fall in love 
  that we could have  ♫

574
00:39:18,777 --> 00:39:20,690
 Didn't you say that you would be studying?

575
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:25,810
♫  I'm just the one who doesn't want to give you nothing 
 but this glime  ♫

576
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,900
♫  You got to stay in the light all right  ♫

577
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,990
♫  I'm gonna be another side  ♫

578
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:36,257
 Leaving the camp without reporting could get you disqualified.

579
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:37,847
 Do you understand that?

580
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:39,507
 Where did you go? Are you telling me or not?

581
00:39:40,427 --> 00:39:43,807
 If you won't tell me, go run 10 laps and think about what you've done.

582
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,060
♫  You got to stay in the light all right  ♫

583

♫  I'm going to be another side  ♫

♫  It has been a long day  ♫

585
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,390
♫  A long day haven't heard from you  ♫

586
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:00,190
♫  And I've been waiting too  ♫

587
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:21,750

588

♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

589
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,442
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

590
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,225
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

591
00:40:39,225 --> 00:40:43,482
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

592
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:50,332
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

593
00:40:50,332 --> 00:40:54,070
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

594
00:40:54,926 --> 00:41:00,705
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

595

♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

596
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:07,952
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

597
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:10,545
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

598
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:15,758
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

599
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:18,415
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

605
00:41:57,528 --> 00:42:00,142
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

606
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,682
♫  After a long journey  ♫
