â™«  For whom will the summer slow down  â™«

3
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:23,044
â™«  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  â™«

4
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:26,908
â™«  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  â™«

5
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:32,096
â™«  For whom will the movie change its story  â™«

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,702
â™«  A sudden storm, blurred vision  â™«

7
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:40,451
â™«  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  â™«

00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:47,510
â™«  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  â™«

00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:54,406
â™«  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  â™«

10
00:00:55,803 --> 00:01:01,336
â™«  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  â™«

00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:04,270
â™«  In the sleepless winter night  â™«

â™«  A season to say goodbye  â™«

00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:14,962
â™«  We will keep on going like this  â™«

15
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:17,950
â™«  The secret of the answer  â™«

16
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,302
â™«  An insoluble question  â™«

17
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:27,747
â™«  All comes down to a simple thank you  â™«

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,300
   

19
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:34,345
   

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,480
Is it here?

21
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,252
 Are you sure you got rid of them? 

22
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:43,719
I think I heard Song Ziqi's voice.

23
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,819
 This thing is not a joke. 

24
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,600
 If she shows up at the door, I'll be dead, I'm telling you. Seriously. 

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,800
 Listen! I haven't slept well for days. 

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,060
 I have nightmares every night. 

27
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,580
It should be here.

28
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,699
 Zhou Siyue. 

29
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:59,476
 Song Ziqi, open the door. 

30
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:02,385
 Song Ziqi, open the door. 

31
00:02:02,385 --> 00:02:03,980
I know you are inside.

32
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,940
 Don't hide in there and remain quiet. 

33
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,440
 Song Ziqi! 

34
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:10,899
 Open the door! 

35
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:14,919
Don't you talk.

36
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,460
Song Ziqi!

37
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,479
Song Ziqi, come out!

38
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:21,104
I know you are here!

39
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:22,725
Come out!

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,720
I know you are suspended. So what?

41
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,440
Do you have to hide here and stay discouraged?

42
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,020
Don't hide anymore. Get out of the bathroom.

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,039
Hi.

44
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,019
You are such a jerk.

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,919
- Don't be like this. 
 - Don't stop me.

46
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,720
Shadi, calm down.

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,119
You two get out.

48
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,880
I want to talk to him alone.

49
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
Wait... But...

50
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,079
You...

51
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:26,456
How about I take you back to school?

52
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,829
My purse is still inside.

53
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,638
I'd better wait outside.

54
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,513
Could you go easy on me? If you injure me, I can't be a pilot anymore.

55
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,326
You still want to be a pilot?

56
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:56,686
You won't play hide and seek anymore?

57
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:58,706
You won't escape from reality anymore?

58
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,579
You didn't answer your phone,

59
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:03,279
and your QQ has been off-line.

60
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,000
You only sent me a message and told me not to find you ever.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,199
Song Ziqi, who do you think you are? Why did you do that to me?

62
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,899
- Sorry. I'm sorry. 
 - Will an apology help?

63
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,500
You were just suspended.

64
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,660
What's the big deal? Do you have to avoid me like the plague?

65
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,919
- Calm down. Please Calm down. 
 - I can't.

66
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,059
Can you just man up?

67
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:29,440
You said you wanted to be with me.

68
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:32,979
Then you said you wanted to be a pilot.

69
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:35,639
So, you insisted on keeping a long-distance relationship with me.

70
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:39,239
And now, something went wrong,

71
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,419
and all you do is hide and avoid the problem.

72
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:43,200
Song Ziqi, are you still a man?

73
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,000
Enough!

74
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,660
Ding Xian,

75
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,019
actually, I...

76
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:06,719
Sweet potato.

77
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,340
Sir, one sweet potato, please.

78
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,780
Two for 10 yuan.

79
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,580
Okay.

80
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,340
I didn't bring my purse.

81
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,840
No money?

82
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,259
Young man, your girlfriend doesn't have money.

83
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,959
Come here and pay.

84
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:37,879
Song Ziqi,

85
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:40,360
I missed you so much.

86
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,279
Go back. Just go back.

87
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,940
I've already missed my flight.

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,400
Then catch the next one.

89
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:54,220
Are you kidding me?

90
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:57,459
Be good. Just go back.

91
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,519
I won't.

92
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,319
I can't let you keep hiding like this.

93
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:06,399
What? Are you here to rescue me?

94
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:09,499
I...

95
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,199
I'm here to ask you for money.

96
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,880
What money?

97
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,340
100 yuan for a kiss.

98
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,820
Think about how many times you kissed me before.

99
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,459
Hold on.

100
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,279
Is this enough?

101
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:27,780
If not, you can take the card, too.

102
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,520
Take it. It's all yours.

103
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,340
You are such a jerk!

104
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:47,999
Thank you.

105
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,840
I'll pay you back later.

106
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:53,439
You don't have to.

107
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,059
Shadi!

108
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,419
Did you guys see Shadi?

109
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:21,859
- Isn't she inside? 
 - No. She just rushed out. Didn't you see her?

110
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,359
No.

111
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,519
Give her a call.

112
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,340
She... She won't answer.

113
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,700
What are you doing?

114
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,119
Shadi!

115
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,438
Sorry, I was wrong.

116
00:08:15,438 --> 00:08:17,200
I... I wasn't thinking straight. I wasn't myself.

117
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,239
Sorry, Shadi.

118
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:20,200
- Song Ziqi, let go of me. 
 - No. No, I won't.

119
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,679
I won't.

120
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:23,859
You ran away without saying anything.

121
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,660
If something happened to you...

122
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,179
I...

123
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:33,079
You... You what?

124
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:36,059
I... I don't know.

125
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,380
 If Ding Xian really left me, 

126
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:59,019
 I think I'd be so scared. 

127
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,919
Let me.

128
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,279
We are buddies. You don't have to.

129
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:16,399
I'm leaving. Don't cry alone in the basement.

130
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,520
When something needs to be said, it is best to say it as soon as possible.

131
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,820
I know.

132
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,520
Xianxian, I'll miss you.

133
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,805
I'll miss you, too.

134
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:37,606
Why don't you stay for a few more days?

135
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:38,873
I can't.

136
00:09:38,873 --> 00:09:41,540
Song Ziqi will run away again if I stay longer.

137
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,760
Besides,

138
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,297
I need to get him back and let him apologize to his parents.

139
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:46,300
Yeah.

140
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,000
He won't do it again, I think.

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,300
Don't worry.

142
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:51,393
Then you two...

143
00:09:51,393 --> 00:09:52,919
Hey, Zhou Siyue!

144
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,159
If you dare to hurt Xianxian, even just a little bit,

145
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,220
I'll be back and come for you.

146
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,540
No worries.

147
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,760
I won't let her get away.

148
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,360
Good to know.

149
00:10:02,898 --> 00:10:05,980
Hey, come here for a sec.

150
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,180
What?

151
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,672
So, we are good now. Right?

152
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,780
You wish.

153
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,479
Do you know how long I've been looking for you?

154
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:17,199
You must make it up to me twice as much.

155
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,080
Then we are leaving.

156
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,399
- Be safe. 
 - Bye-bye.

157
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,799
Don't cry.

158
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,000
- Off you go. 
 - Bye.

159
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,600
Take care.

160
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:42,493
Let me take you back to school.

161
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,680
It's not necessary. I can go back myself.

162
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:29,599
I'm leaving first.

163
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,100
   

164
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:34,079
Don't come here all the time if you're busy studying.

165
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,380
I'm doing well, and so is your mom.

166
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:39,673
I can manage.

167
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:42,299
By the way,

168
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,454
Ding Xian was also admitted to Huaqing.

169
00:12:51,193 --> 00:12:52,938
I like that kid.

170
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:57,700
Something about her is very special.

171
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,260
I held you back.

172
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:10,839
I didn't mean that.

173
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:16,679
I just think it's not the right time yet.

174
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:19,420
What do you mean, "not the right time"?

175
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:22,668
When is the right time?

176
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:29,460
When I was young,

177
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,719
I got a teaching job in Jiangling

178
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,640
and I wanted to bring your mom along.

179
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,379
But since your mom got used to living a stable life,

180
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:45,439
she didn't want to move around with me.

181
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:51,640
I didn't want our family to be separated by a long distance.

182
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:57,579
She was very stubborn, she wouldn't agree whatsoever.

183
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,360
So, I had to let it go.

184
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,740
In the meanwhile, we argued many times because of this matter.

185
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:14,780
At first, I thought she couldn't make it on her own

186
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,592
raising you in Shenhai alone,

187
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:19,259
and she'd come to find me sooner or later.

188
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:24,539
In retrospect, I realize I underestimated her.

189
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,370
Not only did she raise you,

190
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:31,860
but she also raised you to be such an excellent young man.

191
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:39,119
I have no idea how much she's been through and suffered over the years.

192
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,380
Until the accident this time,

193
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:51,485
I finally realized that your mom has always been a capable woman.

194
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:54,086
In order to take care of me,

195
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:56,699
she finally changed her mind

196
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:00,680
and came to Jiangling to look after me,

197
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,340
and she's never complained once.

198
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:09,520
Every time when I see her fall asleep out of exhaustion,

199
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:17,499
I can't help thinking why I must've come to Jiangling to be a professor back then,

200
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:20,479
and why...

201
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,780
Why did I keep her waiting for so long?

202
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,000
Let's get inside.

203
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,459
There's a draft here.

204
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,600
You'll catch a cold.

205
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:53,660
I believe that my son will be successful no matter where he is.

206
00:15:53,660 --> 00:16:00,179
But I don't want you to find that you are all by yourself one day

207
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,919
despite all the achievements you've made.

208
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,040
It's your own business.

209
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,220
Don't use me and your mother as excuses.

210
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,819
We are very well.

211
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:16,439
You don't have to worry about us.

212
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,500
Now, go back if there's nothing else.

213
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:05,520
Bro, you finally admit it.

214
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,760
I knew it. You have feelings for Ding Xian.

215
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,259
Enough.

216
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:12,660
Will you help me or not?

217
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,580
Of course, I'll help you.

218
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,021
I'm good at chasing girls the best.

219
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,920
 Hello, guys. 

220
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,012
 We'll be a love-chasing league from now on. 

221
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,700
Then I'll be "Love."

222
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,459
 Then I'll be "Chasing." 

223
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,838
- And you will be "League." 
  - And you will be "League." 

224
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,920
I must be crazy to ask you two for help. Hurry then.

225
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,420
Be patient.

226
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:46,319
I've found out that the Anime &amp; Comics Club will go

227
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,180
to Huaicheng for a Comic-Con during the New Year's holiday.

228
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:54,139
And there's an amusement park in Huaicheng.

229
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,239
An amusement park is a good idea.

230
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:59,739
Look. You can hold her hand when you are on the roller coaster.

231
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:03,250
 Go to the haunted house. She'll jump into your arms when she's scared. 

232
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:05,752
Last time when I took Kong Shadi there,

233
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,698
she screamed and jumped right into my...

234
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:10,137
What are you talking about?

235
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:12,885
 I've got to go now. 

236
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:19,019
Bro,

237
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,399
are you still going to chase your love?

238
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,799
Yes.

239
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:31,353
Come in.

240
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,959
Mr. Su, the exhibit items of the science expo for the opening

241
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,339
of the Huaicheng Robot Contest are ready.

242
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:40,039
Please have a look.

243
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,119
Have you booked the plane ticket to Huaicheng?

244
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:50,700
Yes. It will be tomorrow at 9:00 p.m.

245
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,119
Change it to a morning flight.

246
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,719
Okay.

247
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,340
 Thanks. 

248
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,339
- Get in. 
 - Okay.

249
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:08,040
Sorry, Lou Feng.

250
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,219
Ji Hang has some other things to do, so we asked you to come to help.

251
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:13,579
It's okay. I'm free, anyway.

252
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:15,218
I'll just take it as a free trip.

253
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:18,125
All right. Then I'll get on the bus now. Hurry up.

254
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:22,198
Morning, Lou Feng.

255
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:25,939
Do you know why the president of the Anime &amp; Comics Club

256
00:19:25,939 --> 00:19:27,320
can make it this time?

257
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
He has other things to do, I guess.

258
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,979
Are you stupid?

259
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:34,535
Can't you see that he's into Xing Lufei?

260
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,159
Based on my source, this Ji Hang

261
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,640
has liked Xing Lufei for years,

262
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,020
but unluckily for him, he had to watch her

263
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,520
fall in love with someone else over and over again.

264
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,400
He confessed his feelings for her some time ago.

265
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,880
- Guess what happened. 
 - What happened?

266
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,460
Xing Lufei said,

267
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,360
"I've always seen you as my friend."

268
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,959
- Junior Sister, morning. 
 - Morning, Senior Yuan Fang.

269
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:09,380
- Morning, Sister. 
 - Xianxian.

270
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Do you need my help?

271
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,000
No.

272
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:20,852
I want it, too.

273
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,552
Here you go.

274
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,559
Xing Lufei is really something.

275
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,359
Hasn't she been going after Zhou Siyue?

276
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,480
You've got to be careful.

277
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:39,112
Speaking of the devil.

278
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,139
What are you doing here?

279
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,480
There are only five members on the robot team.

280
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,499
It's okay.

281
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:54,019
I've got Professor Ye's permission.

282
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:56,920
I thought you wouldn't come today.

283
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,640
Zhou Siyue, how did you know I was going to Huaicheng?

284
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,800
Come on. You think he's here for you?

285
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,559
He's here because of...

286
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,160
Xing Lufei is truly obsessed with Zhou Siyue.

287
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,079
Let's go.

288
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,400
Zhou Siyue, would you like an apple?

289
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,800
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

290
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,560
You can save it for tonight, then.

291
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,260
Take it.

292
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:30,960
Lufei, have you heard of an old saying?

293
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,599
What saying?

294
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,599
Apples should be eaten in the morning.

295
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,379
It goes, "Golden apples in the morning,

296
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:40,959
silver apples in the afternoon,

297
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:44,640
and poisonous apples at night."

298
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,979
That's an overstatement.

299
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:50,959
It's true. The elders in our village all like eating apples at night.

300
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,359
And then...

301
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,800
And then what?

302
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:59,319
And then they died.

303
00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:01,719
That's nonsense.

304
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,439
All right, stop talking.

305
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:05,139
Aren't you guys sleepy?

306
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:06,939
Get some sleep.

307
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:24,579
We are here.

308
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,760
I'm getting hungry.

309
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,139
Let's go.

310
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:33,040
Instant noodles with an egg, no more bad luck.

311
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,440
It's a beautiful day today.

312
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,560
I want a spicy chicken sandwich.

313
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,606
Good idea.

314
00:22:39,606 --> 00:22:41,006
Xianxian.

315
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,199
Who is it? Why does he call you Xianxian?

316
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:46,520
He was a senior schoolmate in my high school.

317
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,599
- Senior Brother. 
 - Brother Bocong, you arrived so early.

318
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,139
The rooms for the members of your club have been arranged ahead of time.

319
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,799
You may check in directly.

320
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,499
Okay.

321
00:22:56,499 --> 00:23:00,300
Xianxian, Brother Bocong is handsome and rich.

322
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,000
And he cares so much about you.

323
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,400
You've got to seize the chance.

324
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,100
I'm going in now.

325
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,040
- Are you tired? 
 - I'm fine.

326
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
I can do it...

327
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:13,280
Senior Brother,

328
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,980
you are also here.

329
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,145
It's been a while.

330
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,660
Looks like your business scope has expanded.

331
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,900
You even need to receive the guests now.

332
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:24,999
I'm here to welcome Xianxian.

333
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:29,859
By the way, the Robot Design Competition you take part in is sponsored by Red Horse.

334
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,160
Red Horse seems to be like this always,

335
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,635
getting involved in everything.

336
00:23:36,612 --> 00:23:39,378
That takes strength and ability to do it, though.

337
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:42,159
I wish you good luck in the contest.

338
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:44,479
I don't think you have to worry about that.

339
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:47,405
Yuan Fang!

340
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:48,292
Hurry up.

341
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:50,139
- Coming. 
 - Xianxian, have you eaten yet?

342
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:51,426
I know.

343
00:23:51,426 --> 00:23:53,185
Not yet.

344
00:23:54,573 --> 00:23:57,773
It's so shameless for him to keep harassing her.

345
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:00,499
What are you talking about?

346
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:03,018
Sorry about that.

347
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:05,533
I've arrived. I'll talk to you later then.

348
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:09,560
Are you Mr. Su of Red Horse Tech?

349
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,612
You are...

350
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:14,392
Senior Brother, I can carry my own suitcase.

351
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:16,989
You guys talk. I'm going in.

352
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,385
Come on.

353
00:24:18,385 --> 00:24:20,764
- Sir... 
 - Excuse me for a moment.

354
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,860
Xianxian.

355
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,920
Would you like to have dinner with me?

356
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,666
Maybe some other time.

357
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,940
I've got a deadline for my drawing.

358
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,259
All right. Then I'll let the front desk order dinner for you.

359
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:35,439
By the way, my room number is 902.

360
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,780
Let me know if you need any help.

361
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,019
- Okay. 
 - Get some rest.

362
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:42,300
- Senior Brother, bye. 
 - Bye.

363
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:44,719
He even told you his room number.

364
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:46,280
Are you sure he's only your senior schoolmate?

365
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,319
He is.

366
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,860
Mr. Su, nice to meet you.

367
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,260
You, too.

368
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:53,719
I've heard that Red Horse Tech is the sponsor of the contest.

369
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:55,680
I've been hoping to meet with you.

370
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,722
I didn't expect to see you here.

371
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,459
This is my name card.

372
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,640
Excuse me, but I'm a little busy right now. I'll talk to you another time. Okay?

373
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,540
Sure.

374
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,812
Are you Zhou Siyue from the scientific research group of Huaqing?

375
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:17,580
Yes, I am.

376
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,880
Nice to meet you. Professor Ye just called me

377
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,831
and asked me to talk to you about the preparation for the contest.

378
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:23,434
Okay. No problem.

379
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,199
May I have your phone number? So, I can reach you later. Is that okay?

380
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:28,999
Sure.

381
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,060
Looks like handsome guys are always treated specially.

382
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:42,119
Finished?

383
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,379
- This is my number. 
 - Okay, thanks.

384
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,920
Get some good rest.

385
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,119
- Bye. 
 - Hi.

386
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,719
I'm Yuan Fang.

387
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,920
What are you doing?

388
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,840
It's full.

389
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,340
It's not.

390
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,660
Now it is.

391
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,860
What's your plan for tomorrow?

392
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,360
I want to take you to a place.

393
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,340
What are you trying to do?

394
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,179
I want to date you.

395
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,800
I don't have time tomorrow.

396
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:06,819
Not now, not ever.

397
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,119
All right.

398
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,160
Then tell me where you want to go tomorrow.

399
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,139
I'll go find you.

400
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:30,699
Could you stop following me?

401
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,500
You really hate talking to me that much?

402
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,645
There's nothing for us to talk about.

403
00:27:43,273 --> 00:27:45,832
Zhou Siyue, don't act so childishly.

404
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,100
Give me a chance to explain.

405
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:04,064
Actually, I heard what you said to Su Bocong that day.

406
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:10,680
When I learned that you studied that hard

407
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,399
when you repeated the 12th grade, and that you did it for me,

408
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,620
I hesitated.

409
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,379
I thought you'd start your own life

410
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:23,899
if I pushed you away.

411
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,180
I thought I did that for your own good.

412
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:29,957
So I made all these reckless decisions.

413
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:37,232
Actually, I've been questioning myself recently.

414
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,279
I was afraid of meeting you.

415
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,940
I was afraid that you'd be disappointed in me

416
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,810
when you saw me like that.

417
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,099
Because I was no longer my old self.

418
00:28:55,099 --> 00:29:01,320
I was no longer the guy who could inspire you.

419
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:06,639
So, I chose to run away.

420
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,260
But then,

421
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:13,520
you came to Huaqing,

422
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,539
and you appeared in my life again.

423
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,659
I couldn't help caring about you.

424
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,280
And I couldn't help thinking about our future.

425
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,300
But it's not a future

426
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,020
where you have to sacrifice what you like for the sake of me.

427
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,785
Actually, I only wanted you to understand that.

428
00:29:42,785 --> 00:29:45,786
Not like now, ignoring me.

429
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,079
Is that all?

430
00:29:52,472 --> 00:29:54,172
Yes.

431
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:02,200
I have thought about all the things you just said.

432
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,139
Because of your father's condition, you didn't want me to be affected.

433
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,954
I understand that.

434
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,097
But I've never been afraid of anything.

435
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,940
If you want to go abroad and be away from me,

436
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,700
I'll do everything I can to make our long-distance relationship work to ease your mind.

437
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,932
As for others' opinions,

438
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:22,792
I don't care at all.

439
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,300
I've been going after you for one simple reason only,

440
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,800
which is I like you.

441
00:30:32,662 --> 00:30:34,822
But now I understand...

442
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:38,764
that a true relationship is based on equality.

443
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:44,179
I don't need you to tell me what to do and what not to do.

444
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,490
â™«   That him, this him, I hear the rain go drip-drop   â™«

445
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:49,799
Zhou Siyue,

446
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:55,439
have you ever thought about what true love is?

447
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,259
â™«  Hide in my room on a cloudy day  â™«

448
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:04,860
Zhou Siyue, there you are. Let me tell you something.

449
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,820
â™«  Slouch in the chair, messy hair, miss him  â™«

450
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,020
Ding Xian?

451
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,190
â™«  Like clouds glide softly in the sky  â™«

452
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:16,940
What are you guys doing here?

453
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,739
Hold on.

454
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:21,239
Zhou Siyue,

455
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,130
are you really into Ding Xian?

456
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,330
â™«  The dream he loves sparkles like a star  â™«

457
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,139
I am.

458
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,939
Why?

459
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:41,539
â™«  He's the only one who stays in the dream  â™«

460
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:45,520
Bro, you failed.

461
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,239
Ding Xian rejected you right in your face.

462
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,459
Then our plan will fall apart.

463
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,540
Do you have Ding Xian's roommate's number?

464
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,559
Lou Feng?

465
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,260
What's in it for me?

466
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:19,580
You are in Professor Ye's scientific research group. Right?

467
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,839
 There's a course taught by Professor Ye, 

468
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,639
 and I'm having a hard time signing up for it. 

469
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:26,940
Don't go too far.

470
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,540
 I'm just an intern member. 

471
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,040
I'll help you.

472
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,880
 Since Zhou Siyue will help me, 

473
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,119
 I promise I'll get it done. 

474
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,000
Feng, who were you talking to on the phone?

475
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:48,959
A former classmate.

476
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:51,000
The preparation for the Comic-Con is the day after tomorrow. Right?

477
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,760
Let's go out and have some fun tomorrow.

478
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,500
Sure.

479
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,199
Where?

480
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,790
Leave it to me.

481
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,770
   

482
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,580
Where are you, Lou Feng?

483
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:18,559
Okay. Hurry up.

484
00:33:26,188 --> 00:33:27,844
You're doing pretty well.

485
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,599
You bribed my roommate, didn't you?

486
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:35,299
It seems that everybody wants to help me.

487
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,660
Hey.

488
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:42,700
I've got the tickets.

489
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,680
Are you sure you don't want to go in?

490
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,580
If not, we'd come a long way here for nothing.

491
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,729
The tickets aren't cheap.

492
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,059
Fine.

493
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,400
But let me make it clear.

494
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,220
It's just for fun.

495
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,519
And we are only hanging out as friends.

496
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,419
You are the boss.

497
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,000
Let's see where we should go first.

498
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,960
 Bro, how is it going? 

499
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:27,339
 We are in. But I don't know where to go. 

500
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:34,059
 Take her to the haunted house. 

501
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:39,579
 That's right. Take her there. 

502
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:45,380
 But I don't see a haunted house here. 

503
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,120
Hi. May I please add your WeChat?

504
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:54,059
Sorry, but I already have a girlfriend.

505
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,160
Why did you walk so fast?

506
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,560
If you don't like this place,

507
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,959
I can walk around myself.

508
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:07,400
Of course, I like this place.

509
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,060
Then, what do you want to play?

510
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,460
Wow!

511
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,170
What a huge maze!

512
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,976
Are we in a children's theme park?

513
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:46,479
It's no wonder I don't see any haunted houses.

514
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:49,439
What did you say?

515
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,179
Not a theme park for children.

516
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:55,839
Both adults and children can play this.

517
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,940
Are you afraid of going into a maze?

518
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,000
How could I be afraid of that?

519
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,319
Shall we compete then?

520
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,719
See who can get out of the maze first.

521
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,239
If I come out first,

522
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:13,023
you must promise me that you won't ignore me anymore.

523
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,600
All right.

524
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,800
Then what if I come out first?

525
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,720
In that case, I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

526
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,372
Okay. It's a deal.

527
00:36:23,372 --> 00:36:24,872
Deal.

528
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,519
Left or right?

529
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,559
Why are you smiling?

530
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,080
You are just like the way you were.

531
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,939
Haven't changed a bit.

532
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:58,100
I'm warning you.

533
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,360
Don't touch me.

534
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:04,080
I'll go that way. Don't follow me.

535
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:21,539
Have I just been here before?

536
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,979
Zhou Siyue.

537
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,260
Ding Xian.

538
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,100
I'm here.

539
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:38,599
Don't be afraid.

540
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:40,879
I'm not.

541
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,180
I was worried that you'd get lost.

542
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,300
Let's go. Lead the way.

543
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:54,319
This way.

544
00:38:03,171 --> 00:38:06,279
The air outside is much fresher.

545
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,470
You see? I won.

546
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:11,080
What are you talking about?

547
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,120
I came out first.

548
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:18,479
Fine. But it's because I let you win.

549
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,660
You let me win?

550
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,040
Just admit that I won.

551
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,467
What? You are reluctant to admit it?

552
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,360
A little.

553
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,220
Then let's compete again.

554
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,220
Sure. Bring it on.

555
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:49,016
â™«  Turns out time can be so magical  â™«

556
00:38:49,016 --> 00:38:52,796
â™«  Looking forward to seeing you  â™«

557
00:38:54,313 --> 00:38:58,250
â™«  Wishing time could stop at this moment  â™«

558
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,090
â™«  Nothing can take away our love  â™«

559
00:39:03,754 --> 00:39:09,613
â™«  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  â™«

560
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,806
â™«  Lean on your shoulder  â™«

561
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:19,952
â™«  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  â™«

562
00:39:19,952 --> 00:39:23,015
â™«  Reminding me of the love you gave me  â™«

563
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:27,450
â™«  I want to go somewhere far away with you  â™«

564
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,850
â™«  Finding each other's sea  â™«

565
00:39:29,853 --> 00:39:34,920
â™«  Let the light of love heal the pain  â™«

566
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,360
â™«  Make a wish under the starry sky  â™«

567
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:37,960
Thank you.

568
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,360
â™«  After a long journey  â™«

569
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,720
â™«  Our dreams have come true  â™«

570
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,560
Here.

571
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,820
Thanks.

572
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:55,139
You are welcome.

573
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,439
What are you looking at?

574
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:10,959
When I was little, my parents brought me to an amusement park.

575
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:12,860
I wanted a balloon,

576
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,180
but my mom wouldn't buy it for me.

577
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,720
However, she bought one for my younger brother.

578
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,620
By the way,

579
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:33,260
I won the maze game.

580
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,500
I haven't punished you yet.

581
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,079
What do you want me to do?

582
00:40:42,379 --> 00:40:43,539
What?

583
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:45,580
I want you to play a mascot for me.

584
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,380
I, Zhou Siyue,

585
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,039
play a mascot for you?

586
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:55,319
Are you kidding me?

587
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,699
I'm sorry.

588
00:42:18,399 --> 00:42:20,220
Why are you sorry?

589
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:25,879
I was going to give you all the balloons.

590
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,879
But now there's only one left.

591
00:42:30,879 --> 00:42:33,100
Actually, one is enough.

592
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,820
What?

593
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:39,699
Nothing.

594
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:45,400
So, do you want to play something else?

595
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,759
Did you get wet?

596
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,100
No.

597
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,339
Wait here for me.

598
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,880
A cup of hot cocoa and a package of napkins, please.

599
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,459
Keep the change.

600
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,020
Thank you.

601
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,600
Your hair is wet.

602
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,120
I can dry it myself.

603
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,920
Don't move.

604
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,639
Why are your ears so red?

605
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,100
You are burning.

606
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:16,979
And your hands are freezing cold.

607
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,699
I think this is our second time getting caught in the rain together.

608
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:36,439
Do you remember when the first time was?

609
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,500
I do.

610
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,960
When we were in 10th grade.

611
00:44:44,293 --> 00:44:47,433
We went to watch the movie "2012".

612
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,400
We almost bumped into Mr. Liu.

613
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:56,539
Then...

614
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:02,780
was it you who set off the end-of-the-world fireworks?

615
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,680
â™«  Another day that's gone  â™«

616
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,660
â™«  I hope you know, you know  â™«

617
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,080
â™«  It's been a long day  â™«

618
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,680
Thank you.

619
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,120
â™«  Would you hear me...  â™«

620
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:23,779
The end-of-the-world fireworks gave me the motivation to apply for Huaqing again.

621
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:34,680
â™«  I'm just the one who doesn't want to give you nothing but this cloud  â™«

622
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,720
â™«  You got to stay in the light, all right  â™«

623
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,690
â™«  I'm going to be another side  â™«

624
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:44,070
â™«  It has been a long day  â™«

625
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:48,270
â™«  A long day, I haven't heard from you  â™«

626
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:51,580
â™«  And I've been waiting too  â™«
