â™«  For whom will the summer slow down  â™«

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,002
â™«  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  â™«

4
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:26,866
â™«  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  â™«

5
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:32,454
â™«  For whom will the movie change its story  â™«

6
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:36,760
â™«  A sudden storm, blurred vision  â™«

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,409
â™«  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  â™«

8
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:47,468
â™«  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  â™«

9
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:55,864
â™«  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  â™«

10
00:00:55,864 --> 00:01:01,580
â™«  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  â™«

11
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:04,228
â™«  In the sleepless winter night  â™«

12
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:06,341
â™«  A season to say goodbye  â™«

13
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:09,694
â™«  I try my best to be brave  â™«

14
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:15,320
â™«  We will keep on going like this  â™«

15
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:17,808
â™«  The secret of the answer  â™«

16
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:20,260
â™«  An insoluble question  â™«

17
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:27,688
â™«  All comes down to a simple thank you  â™«

18
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:31,740
   

19
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,227
   

20
00:01:37,524 --> 00:01:39,024
Come here.

21
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,621
Isn't it the planetarium you brought me to on my birthday that year?

22
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:52,979
Why are we here?

23
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,050
To take a walk and cheer you up.

24
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:01,093
Zhou Siyue, how can taking a walk be a solution?

25
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:06,100
Although I've decided to be with you no matter what happens,

26
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,740
I still feel depressed.

27
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,732
Here, have a seat.

28
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,139
Why aren't you worried at all?

29
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,173
So, they canceled our betrothal. Big deal? We can get engaged again.

30
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:33,089
It won't be as simple as you think.

31
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:36,700
What if your mom still disagrees?

32
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:44,687
Your shoelace is untied.

33
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,659
- I'll... 
 - Let me.

34
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,639
How can I let you do such a menial job?

35
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:28,073
Let's get engaged again. Are you willing?

36
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,589
This ring looks a little crude,

37
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,559
but I promise I'll give you a real wedding ring in the future.

38
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:48,519
If you want to put the blame on anyone, just blame me for my impatience.

39
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:51,470
I can't wait any longer.

40
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:58,560
â™«  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  â™«

41
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,578
â™«  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  â™«

42
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:08,978
Ding Xian, if there's one reason in this world

43
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:12,606
that may stop us from being together,

44
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,800
I'll find hundreds and thousands of reasons

45
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,640
why we must be together.

46
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,230
â™«  We will keep on going like this  â™«

47
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:31,320
I want to be with you every second for the rest of my life.

48
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,970
â™«  All comes down to a simple... â™«

49
00:04:34,972 --> 00:04:37,350
Will you say yes?

50
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,200
â™« thank you â™«

51
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,260
Let me put it on for you.

52
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,280
â™«  For whom will the autumn give up on its journey  â™«

53
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,570
â™«  The rustle of leaves cheers me up  â™«

54
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,359
I can't believe it.

55
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,240
I know.

56
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,340
I thought you were testing me.

57
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,486
Why didn't you just tell me directly?

58
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:17,022
I had no idea they were already together.

59
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:21,600
I've been worried about if our situation would burden your family.

60
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,426
Am I that snobbish to you?

61
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:29,027
As a parent, I'm so glad to see they are happy together.

62
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:31,653
I thought you didn't like my daughter Xianxian,

63
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:34,373
and that you wanted your son to find a better one.

64
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:37,100
How could you say something like that?

65
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't you know how well I treated Xianxian for all these years?

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,058
- I know. 
 - I care about her even more than you do.

67
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:44,319
All right, I hear you. It's all a misunderstanding.

68
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,119
Looks like in the future we'll be...

69
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:49,319
In-laws.

70
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,339
Hurry and pack. We'll need to go to school later.

71
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:09,540
Let's stay here a little longer. No rush.

72
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:17,226
Come here.

73
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,940
Don't you think your room has changed since I started borrowing your place

74
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,102
as a painting studio once in a while?

75
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,420
Look at the paintings on the wall.

76
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,979
Don't you think they make your place homier?

77
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,220
Not my place.

78
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,139
This is our place.

79
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,365
Cut it out.

80
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:59,079
You said no rush, didn't you?

81
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,020
Then let's spend the night here.

82
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,440
Boss, are you busy?

83
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,259
Is the orange sweet?

84
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,360
Let me have a taste.

85
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,038
No way.

86
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,559
It's from Sister-in-law, right?

87
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,257
Now that you are in love, I find you've become...

88
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,119
more caring and focused.

89
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,182
It's the power of love.

90
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,680
Watch what you say.

91
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,595
By the way, Professor Ye wants to see you.

92
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:10,320
I think it's still about the matter from last time.

93
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,120
Have you thought it over?

94
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,299
All right.

95
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,920
   

96
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:38,220
Hi, pretty lady.

97
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:44,719
Would you like to have dinner with me?

98
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,499
Would you?

99
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,760
This lady seems to be in a bad mood.

100
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:07,800
Nothing can't be solved by a nice dinner.

101
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:19,193
What's wrong?

102
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:22,139
Come on. Let's go have dinner.

103
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:24,180
I'm hungry.

104
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
What's the matter?

105
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,959
Don't give me that face.

106
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,420
Professor Ye has told me everything.

107
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:48,040
Let me ask you. Why did you decline the opportunity of studying abroad?

108
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:52,380
That's why you are upset?

109
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,880
Are you still worried about the long-distance relationship thing?

110
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,440
I just want to spend as much time as I can with you. What's wrong with that?

111
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,979
If I go to a place that's far away, I would be worried about you leaving you alone here.

112
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:09,013
Zhou Siyue, I'm not a three-year-old girl.

113
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:11,365
It really upsets me.

114
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,019
Don't let me be an excuse to stop you from going forward.

115
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:19,380
- I... 
 - Don't say anything.

116
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,400
Let me talk.

117
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,260
This is the reason why you've been working so hard.

118
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,839
If in ten or twenty years we broke up,

119
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,759
you'd hate me when you thought about today.

120
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,244
Bullshit!

121
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:43,799
How could the relationship between the two of us break down?

122
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,499
I said "if."

123
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:47,499
No ifs.

124
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:54,500
Zhou Siyue, I only want the best for you.

125
00:10:56,062 --> 00:11:00,279
Hearing you say that, makes me more reluctant to leave.

126
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,059
Don't worry about me.

127
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:05,912
I promise I'll take good care of myself,

128
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,139
and I'll be there for you.

129
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,880
You must be there for me, too.

130
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,800
Okay. I promise.

131
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:21,319
Deal.

132
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,200
Deal.

133
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:43,719
Stop it.

134
00:11:49,513 --> 00:11:51,413
Here, this is for you.

135
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,880
Where did you get this?

136
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,359
I saw it when I was shopping, so I bought it for you.

137
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,579
Wait.

138
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:03,480
Guess again.

139
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,119
Is this a dinosaur or a crocodile?

140
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:12,381
A crocodile.

141
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:16,420
Fine. I guessed wrong again.

142
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,120
It's okay.

143
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,839
This time, it's whatever you say it is.

144
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:29,385
Hold this.

145
00:12:29,385 --> 00:12:30,985
Why?

146
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,140
- Go stand over there. 
 - Why?

147
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,499
Hurry. Just go. Stand over there.

148
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:40,619
Hurry up.

149
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:43,199
- For what? 
 - Just go. Come on.

150
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:46,302
Stand still. Right there.

151
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:51,846
I'll draw a portrait for you and your "son."

152
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:53,900
Hold it closer.

153
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,239
- Like this? 
 - Yes. You guys look so alike.

154
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,300
My big bro.

155
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,360
My younger bro.

156
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,308
- We finally meet. 
 - We finally meet.

157
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:13,719
Are you guys turning your online dating into offline?

158
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,919
What are you talking about?

159
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,279
This is a meeting between two net friends. What "turning online dating into offline"?

160
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,218
Since when did you two become close friends?

161
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:20,718
Since a second ago.

162
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:25,819
But seriously, would you have been able to win Xiancian over this fast without our help?

163
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:27,519
That's right.

164
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:31,240
Then I should thank you guys.

165
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,793
Here.

166
00:13:32,793 --> 00:13:34,106
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

167
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,006
Cheers.

168
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,302
- Xianxian. 
 - Sister.

169
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:46,200
We should call you sister-in-law now.

170
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,380
Sister-in-law?

171
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,541
- Give me. 
 - You know what?

172
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:54,940
When Siyue went after you, we helped him come up with many good ideas.

173
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,745
Is that so? What kind of ideas?

174
00:13:57,745 --> 00:13:59,420
That we can't tell you.

175
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,619
It's my treat today. Let's drink.

176
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:03,180
Okay. Come on.

177
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,000
- Sister-in-law, would you like to join us? 
 - I'll cut some fruit for you guys.

178
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,723
What a good wife.

179
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:08,839
Here, to our sister-in-law.

180
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:11,650
- Here, cheers. 
 - Cheers.

181
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,900
I've got a headache.

182
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,740
You drank too much.

183
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,459
Don't... Don't touch me.

184
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,159
Don't touch me!

185
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:28,853
Zhou Siyue,

186
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,140
when you are abroad, remember to keep in touch with me.

187
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,646
I know you too well.

188
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:40,045
You keep everything to yourself.

189
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,346
You won't tell me anything.

190
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:46,086
You... You don't get it.

191
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,359
Do you know how many years we've been friends?

192
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,480
Do you know what we went through together in high school?

193
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,819
Do you know how many times he has helped me?

194
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,759
Do you know?

195
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,459
You... You don't.

196
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:14,449
You don't know.

197
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:20,579
â™«  It's been a long day, haven't talked 
 Would you believe it? 

198
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,579
It's okay.

199
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:25,538
Let's go. Be careful.

200
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:32,498
â™«  I hope your not alone, it's been a long day  â™«

201
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,418
Take care of him.

202
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:39,890
â™«  Would you hear me... Would you hear me now?  â™«

203
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:47,930
â™«  I'm not the one who doesn't want to fall in love that we could have  â™«

204
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,690
â™«  I'm just the one who doesn't want to give you nothing but this glime  â™«

205
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,738
I...

206
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,058
don't care what others say about you.

207
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:07,919
You will become the Zhou Siyue you want to be.

208
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,010
â™«  You got to stay in the light, all right  â™«

209
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,470
Take it easy.

210
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,880
â™«  I'm going to be another side, it has been a long day  â™«

211
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,000
â™«  A long day, I haven't heard from you  â™«

212
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,820
â™«  And I've been waiting too  â™«

213
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:05,119
I don't want to leave.

214
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:07,658
But you have to.

215
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:11,439
Come on, you've promised.

216
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:17,479
Then let me hold you a little longer.

217
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:19,944
I'll have to leave tomorrow.

218
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:33,938
Do you know?  When I was little,

219
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:37,898
my parents rarely saw each other.

220
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:40,919
And they argued as soon as they met.

221
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,539
So, I thought they didn't love each other.

222
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:48,398
But later...

223
00:17:49,178 --> 00:17:53,639
I realized that it was not because they didn't love each other,

224
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:58,799
but because they loved each other so much that they could trust one another deeply...

225
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,385
and make their love last.

226
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:06,659
So can we.

227
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:11,304
Please wait for me to come back.

228
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,878
I will.

229
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:20,639
â™«  Hands are held tight. Can you feel it?  â™«

230
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:23,510
Okay. It's a deal.

231
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,330
â™«  How close am I to the furthest happiness?  â™«

232
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,400
â™«  It may take a lifetime to reach it  â™«

233
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,970
â™«  Your name has long been engraved in my heart  â™«

234
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:57,490
â™«  Later those misses and encounters  â™«

235
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,118
 He left? 

236
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,530
â™«  at every intersection  â™«

237
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:09,100
 He took off already. 

238
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,730
â™«  It always takes time to decipher, 
 I'll continue flying towards you  â™«

239
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,479
 Be strong. Your long-distance relationship has officially started. 

240
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,158
 It's a long way to go. 

241
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,518
 I'll be there in a few days to keep you company. 

242
00:19:37,058 --> 00:19:40,019
 I can't take it anymore. It's too hot. 

243
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:42,618
 Then why are you still leaning against my arm? 

244
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,658
 I'll turn the AC on. 

245
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:49,218
 Don't waste electricity. 

246
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:52,018
 The electricity bill for this month has already gone over budget. 

247
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:55,639
 You've got a lower body temperature. I'll lean against you. 

248
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:58,418
 All right, whatever you say. 

249
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:03,699
 It's too hot. 

250
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,198
 I don't like summer. 

251
00:20:07,198 --> 00:20:10,458
 I will definitely not give birth in summer. 

252
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,050
 Hey. 

253
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:16,258
 That's a long-distance view you've got. 

254
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:23,599
 I was just saying. I didn't say I was going to have a baby with you. 

255
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
 Then with whom? 

256
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,118
 I didn't say I'd have a baby for sure. I meant if I'd have a baby. 

257
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,620
 Hey. 

258
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:43,119
 But, seriously speaking, if you could pick a season, 

259
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,258
 which season would it be? 

260
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:53,418
 Spring, I guess. 

261
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,759
 I also like spring. 

262
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:04,038
 You said you also liked spring, because spring is like me. 

263
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:08,979
 I started to like spring after I met you, in fact. 

264
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,599
 Because April has the best scenery. Don't you think? c

265
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:23,999
 You are the April of this world, as well as my Zhou Siyue. 

266
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:38,141
   

267
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,140
â™«  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  â™«

268
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,518
â™«  Seeing your smile  â™«

269
00:21:56,518 --> 00:21:58,278
Happy Birthday!

270
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:00,998
 Am I the first one who blows out the candles with you? 

271
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:02,700
Childish.

272
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,890
â™«  You make me smile unknowingly  â™«

273
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:13,710
â™«  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  â™«

274
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,830
â™«  Lean on your shoulder  â™«

275
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,458
 What wish did you make? 

276
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,598
To see you sooner.

277
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:22,439
We will see each other soon.

278
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:24,170
Hang in there.

279
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:28,410
â™«  Reminding me of the love you gave me  â™«

280
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,320
   

281
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,120
â™«  Finding each other's sea  â™«

282
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,940
â™«  Let the light of love heal the pain  â™«

283
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,900
â™«  Make a wish under the starry sky  â™«

284
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,370
â™«  After a long journey  â™«

285
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:49,250
â™«  Our dreams have come true  â™«

286
00:22:53,722 --> 00:22:57,456
   

287
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:02,553
What's wrong?

288
00:23:02,553 --> 00:23:05,799
He still hasn't replied to you?

289
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:07,059
I don't know what he's been busy with.

290
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:09,878
And now, let's welcome the year 2013

291
00:23:09,878 --> 00:23:11,518
outstanding graduate student representative Ding Xian,

292
00:23:11,518 --> 00:23:16,379
from class two of the Computer Science Department to give us a speech.

293
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:19,058
Hold it for me. I'll go up to the stage.

294
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:29,759
Hi, everyone. I'm Ding Xian.

295
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:40,299
It's such an honor to be here with you sharing each other's excitement and achievements.

296
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:46,938
Four years ago, full of dreams and hopes, I entered the beautiful campus of Huaqing University.

297
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:50,438
During the four years, we've had laughter,

298
00:23:50,438 --> 00:23:54,699
tears and confusion.

299
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:59,298
Everyone and everything that we encountered here

300
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:02,819
will come together in bits and pieces

301
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:07,378
and become the best memories of our youth.

302
00:24:08,518 --> 00:24:12,199
 Happy graduation! 

303
00:24:14,939 --> 00:24:17,338
 We graduated! 

304
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:22,058
 We graduated! 

305
00:24:25,118 --> 00:24:28,138
 - We graduated! 
 - We graduated! 

306
00:24:28,138 --> 00:24:30,220
 Happy graduation! 

307
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,310
 Hey! Come here! 

308
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,519
 What are you doing? 

309
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,939
Lou Feng, put the camera down.

310
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:36,878
Stop it.

311
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:38,378
Yeah. Stop filming.

312
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:39,819
Let me. Let me do it.

313
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:43,159
Give me a chance. Hurry. Stand there and let me film you guys.

314
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:44,139
Film us?

315
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:46,258
The lighting is not good. Go to the other side.

316
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:47,765
Lighting's not good?

317
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:49,971
- It's backlighting this way. And now? 
 - It's good. Now it's good.

318
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:51,878
Your hair. Toss your hair.

319
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:53,998
It looks nice.

320
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:56,638
Anything you want to say at the final moment of graduation?

321
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:58,919
Me. I want to find a boyfriend.

322
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,146
I want to try all the delicious food in the world.

323
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:03,246
Forget about food.

324
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:21,399
Happy graduation!

325
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:23,938
How come you came back early?

326
00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:26,319
I'm not going to watch your PDA.

327
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,200
You've made a wish. Of course, I had to come back early.

328
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:35,419
You didn't even bring me back a gift.

329
00:25:35,998 --> 00:25:37,412
I did.

330
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:38,820
Where is it?

331
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:44,510
â™«  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  â™«

332
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,380
â™«  In the sleepless winter night  â™«

333
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,390
â™«  A season to say goodbye  â™«

334
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,470
â™«  I try my best to be brave  â™«

335
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:59,030
â™«  We will keep on going like this  â™«

336
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,138
What are you filming? Did you get it?

337
00:26:01,138 --> 00:26:02,339
I'm on it.

338
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:03,458
How's my hair?

339
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,670
Not bad.

340
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:12,300
â™«  All comes down to a simple thank you  â™«

341
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,618
What are you doing?

342
00:26:13,618 --> 00:26:14,919
Embarrassing!

343
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:17,038
- I've got goosebumps. 
 - Stop filming.

344
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:18,599
No, I won't stop.

345
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,299
Don't.

346
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:25,299
Rock, paper, scissors.

347
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:29,378
It doesn't count. Again.

348
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:33,418
Rock, paper, scissors.

349
00:26:34,578 --> 00:26:37,338
One last time.

350
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:40,979
Last time, okay? Whoever loses has to do the dishes.

351
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:44,779
Rock, paper, scissors.

352
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:53,321
I just moved in today, and I have to do the dishes.

353
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,358
You don't have to do it.

354
00:26:56,358 --> 00:27:00,299
Go get my passport.

355
00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:03,739
Yes, sir!

356
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:06,419
I need to mail it to my mom tomorrow.

357
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,979
On the cabinet over there.

358
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:14,298
In here?

359
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,330
   

360
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:47,270
You still have these.

361
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,419
There's one more box. Open it.

362
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:19,018
Ding Xian, if you hadn't...

363
00:29:20,298 --> 00:29:23,138
showed up in my life,

364
00:29:27,258 --> 00:29:30,519
I wouldn't have become who I am today.

365
00:29:37,138 --> 00:29:40,839
Do you know? When I first met you in high school,

366
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:45,638
I was thinking how come there was

367
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:48,930
such a stubborn girl in this world.

368
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:52,318
A girl who didn't talk much,

369
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,879
wouldn't accept others' help,

370
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:59,259
and focused only on her own things.

371
00:30:01,018 --> 00:30:04,058
But what's amazing about you is

372
00:30:04,058 --> 00:30:07,618
that whatever you wanted to do,

373
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:10,619
you could always get it done.

374
00:30:15,178 --> 00:30:20,438
I don't know why, but I fell in love with the way you are.

375
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:28,945
And I love you so, so much.

376
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:34,239
Sorry...

377
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:42,843
that I didn't keep my promise before,

378
00:30:44,638 --> 00:30:48,198
and that I had you suffer, Ding Xian.

379
00:30:49,778 --> 00:30:55,019
But trust me, I will make it up to you.

380
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:15,219
There's a solution to every equation,

381
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:19,738
but there's no solution to love.

382
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:23,398
If I have to give an answer,

383
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:28,530
you are, and always will be, my one and only answer.

384
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,730
â™«  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  â™«

385
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,350
â™«  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  â™«

386
00:31:35,358 --> 00:31:37,258
Ding Xian,

387
00:31:38,658 --> 00:31:41,800
will... will you marry me?

388
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,300
â™«  A sudden storm, blurred vision  â™«

389
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,970
â™«  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  â™«

390
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:56,000
â™«  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  â™«

391
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,150
â™«  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  â™«

392
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:06,218
Actually, the one you gave me the first time is good enough.

393
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:08,178
No.

394
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:12,338
I promised I'd give you a new one.

395
00:32:12,338 --> 00:32:15,638
I must keep my word.

396
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,129
You've put it on,

397
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:22,439
but you haven't answered me yet.

398
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:25,019
I've put it on,

399
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:28,818
and I'm wearing two.

400
00:32:28,818 --> 00:32:31,199
Isn't that obvious enough?

401
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,118
I don't care. I want to hear you say it.

402
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,878
You want to hear it, but I don't want to say it.

403
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:40,899
Just grant me this wish. Okay?

404
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:49,140
I'll marry you.

405
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:55,399
I will, no matter how many times you ask.

406
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:57,580
â™«  In the sleepless winter night  â™«

407
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,600
â™«  A season to say goodbye  â™«

408
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,880
â™«  I try my best to be brave  â™«

409
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,740
â™«  We will keep on going like this  â™«

410
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,290
â™«  The secret of the answer  â™«

411
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,390
â™«  An insoluble question  â™«

412
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:23,100
â™«  All comes down to a simple thank you  â™«

413
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,050
   

414
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,710
   

415
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,410
   

416
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,200
   

417
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,539
Mr. Liu.

418
00:33:36,578 --> 00:33:38,719
- Mr. Liu. Mr. Liu. 
 - Mr. Liu.

419
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:42,699
Welcome back. We are back to pay you a visit.

420
00:33:42,699 --> 00:33:44,699
And you claimed that there was nothing going on between you two.

421
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:48,819
I just knew that my guess was right.

422
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:53,959
By the way, wasn't there a girl from the art class who hung out with you guys all the time?

423
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,659
She couldn't make it?

424
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,298
She's expecting. She's been married for two years now.

425
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:00,118
Good for her.

426
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:02,057
When will you two get married?

427
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:05,228
Mr. Liu, they'll hold their wedding next month.

428
00:34:05,228 --> 00:34:07,638
Have you prepared a cash gift for them?

429
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:10,598
Enough about them. What about you two?

430
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:13,999
I'll try my best to get things done in three years.

431
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:16,439
Don't worry about me.

432
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:20,899
I'm so glad to see you've all grown up and become successful.

433
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:23,798
Siyue, you'll give a speech later. Right?

434
00:34:23,798 --> 00:34:27,119
Yes. I think it's about time.

435
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,838
Then go ahead and get ready.

436
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:30,579
Okay. See you later, Mr. Liu.

437
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:32,779
See you later.

438
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:37,219
Oh, Ding Xian. Could you stay for a little while? I have something to talk about with you.

439
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,818
Sure.

440
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:41,598
What is it, Mr. Liu?

441
00:34:41,598 --> 00:34:47,158
Although this kid is now an honorary alumni and a rising high-tech expert,

442
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:50,619
you may not know one thing about him back then.

443
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:53,218
 You'll choose liberal arts? 

444
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:56,658
 Zhou Siyue, you must be kidding. 

445
00:34:57,538 --> 00:34:59,539
 Mr. Liu, I'm not. 

446
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:01,919
 Choosing science or liberal arts must be taken seriously. 

447
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:04,519
 Because it'll determine your future. 

448
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,678
 You've got to think carefully. 

449
00:35:06,678 --> 00:35:11,038
 I understand. Science is my interest, so I won't give it up. 

450
00:35:11,038 --> 00:35:12,939
 But learning liberal arts is also important. 

451
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:18,619
 That's not the point. You are literally wasting your gift. 

452
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:21,239
 But I may also be gifted in liberal arts. Who knows? 

453
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,679
 You... 

454
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:26,239
 Zhou Siyue, are you out of your mind? 

455
00:35:27,078 --> 00:35:28,978
 Excuse me. 

456
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:34,959
 Mr. Liu, this is my subjects application form. 

457
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:37,498
 Okay. Put it there. 

458
00:35:40,698 --> 00:35:46,598
 Zhou Siyue, I honestly suggest you consider choosing science. 

459
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,099
 Yes. Mr. Liu, you are right. 

460
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:55,738
 Science is the better choice for me. 

461
00:35:55,738 --> 00:36:00,798
So, I figure this kid insisted on choosing liberal arts back then because of you. Right?

462
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:05,978
I've seen through your little secret.

463
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:08,199
All right, off you go now.

464
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:15,859
What did Mr. Liu say to you?

465
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:20,139
I won't tell you. Ask him yourself if you want to know.

466
00:36:22,058 --> 00:36:25,340
You are smiling, yet you won't tell me.

467
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,239
Something's not right.

468
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:31,758
Xianxian.

469
00:36:33,078 --> 00:36:35,378
Senior Brother.

470
00:36:35,398 --> 00:36:37,198
How have you been doing?

471
00:36:37,198 --> 00:36:38,818
I'm doing fine.

472
00:36:38,818 --> 00:36:41,059
Long time no see.

473
00:36:44,638 --> 00:36:46,538
Long time no see.

474
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:50,139
You guys go ahead and wait for me in the hall.

475
00:36:51,638 --> 00:36:54,919
It's okay. Let the men settle their own things.

476
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:56,991
Come on.

477
00:37:17,192 --> 00:37:19,638
I didn't know you played basketball.

478
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:23,259
There's a lot about me that you don't know.

479
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:31,438
Let's play a round.

480
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:32,965
Sure.

481
00:37:42,638 --> 00:37:46,519
I heard Ding Xian gave you an invitation.

482
00:37:50,078 --> 00:37:53,198
Don't worry. I won't be there.

483
00:37:53,878 --> 00:37:56,878
I think I'll already be abroad by then.

484
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:04,498
I don't mind you coming.

485
00:38:05,558 --> 00:38:08,758
It's not like you can take her away from me or anything.

486
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:11,759
You never know.

487
00:38:20,738 --> 00:38:26,299
Anyway, I should thank you for helping Ding Xian so much.

488
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:28,819
But she won't need your help anymore.

489
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:50,738
You know what?

490
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,870
If you don't want to give that speech,

491
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:55,318
I can replace you to do that at any time.

492
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,819
No worries.

493
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:03,178
I won't give you that chance.

494
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:07,125
I'm leaving.

495
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:30,459
 Treat her well. 

496
00:40:07,092 --> 00:40:08,892
Let's go.

497
00:40:08,892 --> 00:40:11,099
Where were you guys?

498
00:40:14,598 --> 00:40:16,999
Had a little heart-to-heart.

499
00:40:17,711 --> 00:40:20,452
Won't Senior Brother come for the speech?

500
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:23,619
You care about him so much. Why don't you...

501
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:27,139
What are you talking about?

502
00:40:28,498 --> 00:40:33,079
All right. He said it'd be boring. He's not coming.

503
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:34,858
That's more like it.

504
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:42,178
Where are Song Ziqi and Kong Shadi?

505
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:44,191
They have things to do. They left.

506
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,510
Have things to do?

507
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:49,799
Never mind. Let them be. Come on.

508
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:04,378
It feels so familiar.

509
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:09,360
For a second, I felt like I was back in my senior year of high school.

510
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,830
   

511
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:16,339
Many people may think that I had a smooth ride.

512
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,899
But in fact, I'm no different from you.

513
00:41:18,899 --> 00:41:25,379
There was once a time when I was at a great loss.

514
00:41:25,379 --> 00:41:31,619
But I was lucky that I met someone...

515
00:41:32,398 --> 00:41:37,298
who was adorable and kind.

516
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:42,299
She once said to me that a strong person

517
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,738
would carry on with his dreams

518
00:41:45,738 --> 00:41:49,458
no matter what kind of difficulties await.

519
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:57,079
I've had my setbacks, and I hit rock bottom before.

520
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:59,025
But every time I was down,

521
00:41:59,025 --> 00:42:04,264
she'd come to me with a smiley face, saying,

522
00:42:04,264 --> 00:42:09,119
"Zhou Siyue, I believe in you."

523
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:19,439
Actually, she got it wrong.

524
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:24,199
Today, I want to tell her that she's actually

525
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:27,738
the one whom I've been looking up to

526
00:42:27,738 --> 00:42:30,479
and believing in.

527
00:42:32,638 --> 00:42:34,379
Ding Xian,

528
00:42:37,899 --> 00:42:39,758
thank you!

529
00:42:52,598 --> 00:42:54,939
Where are we going?

530
00:42:56,919 --> 00:42:58,678
You'll see.

531
00:42:58,678 --> 00:43:01,280
Tell me. You are being so mysterious.

532
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,900
   

533
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:23,219
It's locked.

534
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:25,719
Nothing can stop your hubby.

535
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:28,559
We aren't married yet. Don't talk like that.

536
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,858
Come on.

537
00:43:40,512 --> 00:43:45,031
It looks exactly like before.

538
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,279
Feels like nothing has changed.

539
00:44:41,158 --> 00:44:44,999
Who carved the character "morning" here?

540
00:44:46,878 --> 00:44:50,138
It looks a little weird.

541
00:44:54,512 --> 00:44:57,465
Was it carved by you?

542
00:44:57,465 --> 00:45:00,279
 Stop copying notes for Ding Xian. 

543
00:45:00,279 --> 00:45:03,078
 It's almost done. Two more minutes. 

544
00:45:08,592 --> 00:45:12,199
 What's this? Is it "Ding"? 

545
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:13,939
 What? 

546
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:19,038
 That's the character "morning." 

547
00:45:23,698 --> 00:45:26,498
 It's "morning." 

548
00:45:28,078 --> 00:45:31,438
 Why is there a hook? 

549
00:45:33,285 --> 00:45:34,885
 Is there? 

550
00:45:34,885 --> 00:45:36,519
 Yes. 

551
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:46,999
Ding Xian, you've told me your secret.

552
00:45:46,999 --> 00:45:49,698
Do you want to know mine?

553
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,454
   

554
00:46:29,859 --> 00:46:32,259
I already knew.

555
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,550
I knew it all the time.

556
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:43,110

562

564

â™«  All comes down to a simple thank you  â™«

572
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,439
 Why did you take my book? 

573
00:48:43,332 --> 00:48:45,385
Why are you smiling?

574
00:48:48,517 --> 00:48:50,317
Let's go.
