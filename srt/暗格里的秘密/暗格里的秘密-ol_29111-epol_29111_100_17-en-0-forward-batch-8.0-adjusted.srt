00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,660

2
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:26,586
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,072
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,936
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:40,324
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:44,830
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,479
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:55,538
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:55,538 --> 00:01:03,034
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:09,464
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:12,298
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:14,311
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:17,664
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:17,664 --> 00:01:22,990
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:25,978
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:28,330
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:35,521
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:39,429

19
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:42,361

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,660
This is our Anime &amp; Comics Club.

21
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,620
And this is the pictorial of our club.

22
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,799
I'll let you take care of the contestant selection.

23
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:02,560
I trust your judgment very much.

24
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:06,519
President,

25
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:09,279
this is the pictorial you asked me to draw last week.

26
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,100
Good timing, Ding Xian. Let me introduce her to you.

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,599
This is the Chief Editor of Dream Journey Press,

28
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,880
as well as the organizer of the competition this time.

29
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,480
This is Ding Xian.

30
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,839
Very nice.

31
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,520
Are you a freshman?

32
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:29,099
Have you ever participated in any competitions organized by other presses?

33
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,139
No.

34
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:33,560
Drawing is only my hobby.

35
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,540
Looks like your president is right.

36
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,679
This girl is truly talented.

37
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,459
I'm glad to see that you've got gifted members like her.

38
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,859
Then I'll leave the competition preparation to you.

39
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,780
I'll see you.

40
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,280
Okay. Take care.

41
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,840
So, do you want to take part in the competition?

42
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,459
President, I've got things to do.

43
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,459
I have to go.

44
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,010
Hey.

45
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,806
How did you know I like this?

46
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:34,306
It's on the shop.

47
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:40,070
I hope the coffee won't keep you up the whole night like before.

48
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,680
You've been working on the paper for two days.

49
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,559
You still haven't finished?

50
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,660
Stop it if you can't finish.

51
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:54,479
You don't allow me to join the scientific research group anyway.

52
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,519
Why do you care?

53
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,439
The shop is closing. Go back early.

54
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,659
Let me walk you back.

55
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,720
I thought you weren't going back to school.

56
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,559
I need to get up early and go to the lab tomorrow morning.

57
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,579
It'll save me some time.

58
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,490
I see.

59
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:33,759
What are you smirking about?

60
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,999
Nothing.

61
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,240
Don't move.

62
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,000
Hey! Hey!

63
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,440
Who is this?

64
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,720
Isn't it Mr. Zhou, Zhou Siyue?

65
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,459
What brings you back to the dorm today?

66
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,619
I must make sure that stalker won't reappear anymore.

67
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:51,579
Stalker?

68
00:06:55,739 --> 00:07:00,320
Just tell me directly that you sent Ding Xian to her dorm.

69
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,279
Didn't you?

70
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,830
Tell me. We are good buddies.

71
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,370

72
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:14,640
Morning.

73
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,139
Morning, bro.

74
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,519
Spending the night in the dorm sure makes a difference for you.

75
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:26,562

76
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,360
Hey! Let me have a look.

77
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,340
Circuits and Electronics: Data Integration of Analog and Digital Electronics.

78
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,806
We learned this in our freshman year. Why are you working on this?

79
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:41,545
To go over it.

80
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:47,720
You've almost finished it.

81
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:53,840
If any student who joins our group this year happens to see this,

82
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,199
it'll be like winning the lottery.

83
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:59,859
Don't tell me you are going to bribe a junior girl with it.

84
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:01,859
Tell me the truth, and I'll let you borrow it.

85
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:03,659
No.

86
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:06,159
I'll finish it myself if I want to do that.

87
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:07,122
- Then give it back.
 - Wait.

88
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:11,120
Now... Now that you've done it, just do me a favor and lend it to me.

89
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,459
What's in it for me?

90
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,720
Look.

91
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,740
If I succeed, I'll do everything you ask me to do.

92
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,359
You know what? I know a girl who's Ding Xian's roommate.

93
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:28,859
She's very pretty.

94
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,559
Fine, you can borrow it.

95
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,920
Treat me to something nice if you succeed.

96
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,339
You bet.

97
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:39,640
I'm leaving.

98
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,740
But you just got here.

99
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,519
I'll go back and sleep a bit more.

100
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,480
Bye-bye.

101
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,499
Trust me.

102
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:49,899
This material will be very helpful to you.

103
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:51,099
Thank you.

104
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,860
Shall we add each other's WeChat?

105
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,000
If you have any questions, you can ask me.

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,239
Say, don't you think

107
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:00,859
this Yuan Fang is quite insensitive?

108
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:03,000
Ban Jiayu acts so cold.

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,899
Apparently, she has no feelings for him.

110
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:08,220
Yet he still keeps hitting on her.

111
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,840
What's that?

112
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,679
Test material Yuan Fang gave to me.

113
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,467
Look. Why do you guys

114
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,912
want to join the scientific research group?

115
00:09:21,912 --> 00:09:23,840
It's tiring and hard to pass the test.

116
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
But now we've got the "cheat sheet."

117
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
Let me see.

118
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:34,660
Ding Xian.

119
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,327
Would you like me to make a copy for you?

120
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,847
Sure. I really need it.

121
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,200
 Before answering the questions,

122
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,119
 you need to make sure to read the question carefully and correctly.

123
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,719
 Take this problem for example.

124
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,373
 To prove...

125
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,200
 Apparently, you didn't read it carefully.

126
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
 You didn't even notice the wrong character.

127
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,822
 Who would waste time looking for the wrong characters on the paper?

128
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,260
 I would.

129
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,859
- Excuse me.
 - Yes?

130
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:24,440
Could you tell me how this self-ordering app works?

131
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,960
Can you teach me?

132
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,466
Pick the items you want, and check them on your phone.

133
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:31,799
And then press "order".

134
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,179
You can fetch your food at the counter later according to the number assigned.

135
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:39,479
But there's no introduction to the food on the page.

136
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:43,100
Could you please recommend some of your specialties?

137
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,760
You can refer to the recommendations on the menu before placing your order.

138
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,040
Then, may I please add your WeChat?

139
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,679
I'll come to your shop often in the future.

140
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:56,872
This is the QR code of the shop.

141
00:10:56,872 --> 00:11:01,139
If you need a reservation, you can scan the code.

142
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:02,739
Sorry.

143
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,679
Let's go.

144
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,239
- What are you doing?
 - Hurry.

145
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,859
Aren't you busy?

146
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,639
But I still need to eat, right?

147
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,679
Don't you have a test coming up?

148
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,380
Still have time to come here?

149
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,840
Don't worry.

150
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,180
I accidentally got a "secret weapon."

151
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,980
I'm sure I can pass.

152
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:57,279
It's not that easy to join the scientific research group led by Professor Ye.

153
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:02,000
I thought I didn't have a chance either.

154
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,719
But after browsing through this material,

155
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,599
I find myself enlightened a lot.

156
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:09,660
And I suddenly understood quite a few knowledge points.

157
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,278
Look.

158
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,459
There is a table of contents and conclusions, as well as examples of wrong answers.

159
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,319
The owner is very meticulous.

160
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:19,159
Speaking of which,

161
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:23,901
this person is so much like you when it comes to the quirk of picking the wrong characters.

162
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:31,639
You wish.

163
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,999
 Is it really my illusion?

164
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:53,240
Stop thinking about those pointless things.

165
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:56,739
Ding Xian,

166
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,419
is it too late for me to convince you to give it up?

167
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,799
It's good that you realized that.

168
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:09,059
Then, I wish you good luck.

169
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,320
Thank you.

170
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:18,199
Why don't you bring me a bowl of noodles? I'm hungry, too.

171
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:21,939
I'm a guest here today.

172
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,940
I want it, too.

173
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,220

174
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,130

175
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,430

176
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,060

177
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,919
Let me tell you. I inquired about it yesterday.

178
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,440
The results will come out today.

179
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,060
Ban Jiayu, I'm sure you'll pass.

180
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,280
I dare not check it.

181
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,440
I'll check it for you.

182
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,239
- Okay, you do it.
 - All right.

183
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,700
I don't see it.

184
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,119
Then stop looking.

185
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,252
Aren't you worried?

186
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:21,080
I didn't think I'd make it anyway. I'll figure out something else then.

187
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,220
Wait. It's just a choice.

188
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,520
Ding Xian,

189
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,619
you are in!

190
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:29,760
Look, she's in!

191
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Look!

192
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,110

193
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:36,719
I told you you'd make it!

194
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:39,600
I'm in! I'm in!

195
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:51,919
Siyue, the girl named Ding Xian...

196
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,859
really passed the test.

197
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,759
Is she your junior?

198
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:59,200
No.

199
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,640
She was my classmate in high school. But she repeated a year.

200
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,119
I didn't expect she'd get such high marks.

201
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,659
I'm a little surprised.

202
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,619
And her way of solving problems is similar to yours.

203
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,926
I'm not surprised that she passed the test. She's always been a top student.

204
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,023
Zhou Siyue! Zhou Siyue! I passed the te...

205
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,839
Speaking of the devil.

206
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,980
I'm sorry, Professor Ye. I didn't know you were here.

207
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,760
I saw your paper.

208
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,280
You did very well.

209
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,159
But there will be an assessment period for the new members.

210
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,439
You need to prepare for it.

211
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:46,980
I will. Thank you, Professor Ye.

212
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,160
You guys talk.

213
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:07,479
So great.

214
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:09,640
I'm one step closer to going abroad with you.

215
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,520
The following assessment will be harder.

216
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,300
If your project doesn't pass,

217
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,000
you won't be recruited to the core experiment team.

218
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,320
Don't always say discouraging things.

219
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,580
Ding Xian.

220
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,059
Are you sure this is what you want?

221
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,799
Doing experiments, writing programs,

222
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,619
and collecting data every day?

223
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,559
You'll get bored of it.

224
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:42,000
If you like it, I'll like it, too.

225
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,640
All right, I'll get out of your hair now. See you.

226
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,640
I ordered fried chicken.

227
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,307
But I fetched it.

228
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:11,980
Want it?

229
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,179
Then apologize to me.

230
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:15,599
Call me dad if you want it.

231
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,860
- Dad.
 - I'm sorry.

232
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:26,240
You can have it.

233
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,400
Here you go.

234
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,839
Disgusting.

235
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,030
- Hey.
 - What?

236
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,119
I have something to tell you.

237
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,599
Ding Xian has joined the scientific research group.

238
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,420
That's good. She'll be closer to you.

239
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:52,479
Nothing good about it.

240
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,160
Think about it.

241
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,000
Ding Xian repeated a year in high school.

242
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,400
She studied so hard because of me.

243
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,679
She entered Huaqing University for me.

244
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,739
And she joined the scientific research group also for me.

245
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:06,139
It's not her interest at all.

246
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,500
Just like Kong Shadi.

247
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,499
If Kong Shadi

248
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:14,959
gave up on the things she likes for your sake, would you let her?

249
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,740
That's why I left her.

250
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:26,400
But even so, I still think you can't help showing your care.

251
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:29,640
I won't.

252
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,440
I don't believe you.

253
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,160

254
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,760
In the next three months,

255
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,599
we'll do a project assessment each month.

256
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,439
Only those who pass all assessments can stay.

257
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:48,439
Dong Zhengfei will help you familiarize yourselves with the lab in the first week.

258
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:53,180
Starting next week, every student must hand in their project.

259
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:01,580
Without further ado, Dong Zhengfei, they are yours.

260
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,859
Okay.

261
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:04,459
Please follow me.

262
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:09,176
The lab is open 24 hours a day.

263
00:19:09,176 --> 00:19:13,219
Professor Ye's classes are from 6:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.

264
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,780
You can manage the rest of the time yourselves.

265
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,800
But if you really want to join the scientific research group,

266
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,520
you need to sacrifice all the time for your hobbies

267
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,859
and immerse yourselves in the lab

268
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,979
to prepare every experiment well.

269
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,800
Please take a seat.

270
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,319
Scientific research can be quite boring.

271
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,599
And because of that,

272
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,839
it takes full concentration when you are at it.

273
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,780
If you don't have the passion for it,

274
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,679
I suggest you give up early.

275
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,719
 I can do it.

276
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:47,580
 I'm sure I'll become a member of the group.

277
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,245
Why have you been flustered?

278
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:02,439
Lou Feng, do you have anything to eat?

279
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:03,779
Yes.

280
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:04,779
Hurry.

281
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,040
Take one more.

282
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,739
I can't. I'm late. See you later.

283
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:10,900
- Have another.
 - I'm running out of time.

284
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,471
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

285
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:20,717
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

286
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:28,521
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

287
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:32,070
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

288
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,800
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

289
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:42,492
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

290
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,800
Sorry, I'm late.

291
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,300
Again? Go ahead.

292
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,940
I'm sorry.

293
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,640
Today's assignment... Let me see...

294
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,559
Love can be exhausting.

295
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:02,559
Keep your spirits up, guys.

296
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,000
Professor.

297
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,800
Have you handed in your report?

298
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,820
Almost done. Please give me five more minutes.

299
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,339
Why should I give you more time?

300
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:18,179
Everybody has handed in theirs.

301
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,699
Is that your attitude to do scientific research?

302
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:22,820
Don't you have a sense of time?

303
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,580
I'm sorry.

304
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:46,319
Time to go back.

305
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,139
I can't.

306
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:54,982
I haven't found the bug in this program.

307
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,759
You'll wear yourself out sooner or later.

308
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:24,560
You are much busier than me.

309
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,780
How come you don't feel tired?

310
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,039
You should ask yourself

311
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,940
why you make yourself this tired.

312
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,560
Run the following program...

313
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,680
You've got to be kidding me, Ding Xian.

314
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,319
Are you going to live in the library?

315
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,060
Professor Ye said...

316
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,979
if I can solve this problem,

317
00:22:56,979 --> 00:23:01,212
I can skip the three-month assessment period and become a member directly.

318
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:05,187
Then... what will happen if you fail?

319
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,960
Pack my stuff and leave.

320
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,379
Professor Ye,

321
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:12,839
you are giving her a hard time on purpose.

322
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:16,319
She's the one who's hard on herself.

323
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,980
This problem is difficult even for upperclassmen.

324
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,079
What's going on?

325
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:28,726
The code is wrong.

326
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,920
Siyue,

327
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,079
not just her, you also must figure out what you need to do.

328
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,659
It won't happen again.

329
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,219
What are you looking at?

330
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,719
Guys, help me think of an idea.

331
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:58,719
How can I start a conversation with him?

332
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,959
Go and ask him how to solve this problem.

333
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:06,159
Good idea.

334
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,939
Well,

335
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,400
here's a problem. I wonder if you have time to help me solve it.

336
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,380
Sure. Let me see.

337
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,492
You are only a freshman,

338
00:24:26,492 --> 00:24:29,079
and your professor already assigned you such a difficult problem.

339
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:31,640
This is a problem given to Ding Xian by Professor Ye.

340
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,260
Ding Xian can't stay in the scientific research group unless she has this problem solved.

341
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,580
I'm impressed she's quite diligent.

342
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,239
It's all because of her high school classmate Zhou Siyue.

343
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,119
She stays up late studying every day.

344
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,400
She's dog-tired.

345
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,560
She works this hard because she wants to become a member and go abroad with him.

346
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:51,479
Is she that confident?

347
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:53,479
You know what?

348
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:56,800
- In order to join the group—
 - It takes some time to solve this problem.

349
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,520
It's okay.

350
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,619
Can I add your WeChat?

351
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:01,599
Please send the answer to me when you have it solved.

352
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,199
Okay.

353
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:14,000
There's only one candidate for the overseas exchange every year.

354
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,180
Has Professor Ye really decided to let Zhou Siyue go?

355
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,799
How was it?

356
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,140
I got his WeChat.

357
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,660
I mean the problem.

358
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,520
He doesn't know how to solve it.

359
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,000
This problem is that hard?

360
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:31,899
Is Professor Ye deliberately making it difficult for you?

361
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,659
See you.

362
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,520
Bro, I'm leaving, too.

363
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,119
Bye-bye.

364
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,819
Bye-bye.

365
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,020
Zhou Siyue.

366
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,527
I really don't know how to solve

367
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:19,040
the problem Professor Ye gave me.

368
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,740
I won't help you.

369
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,439
Please.

370
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:27,939
No way.

371
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,040
Help me.

372
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,800
Only this one time.

373
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,160
Cut it out.

374
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,880
Please. Once only.

375
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,179
Have you done the experimental demonstration?

376
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,059
Not yet.

377
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,680
Then write down the codes according to the thoughts in your mind.

378
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:04,140
Without referring to the book?

379
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,119
No matter how much you read,

380
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,760
you can never find the true problems if you don't practice.

381
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,840
Write the codes down first.

382
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,860
What are you doing instead of working on the problem?

383
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:41,479
I couldn't help.

384
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:43,079
Sorry.

385
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,760
How do you like my drawing?

386
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:57,819
Better than solving the problem.

387
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,119
Really?

388
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,059
It's not as good as the one I drew before.

389
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:04,959
Before?

390
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,760
 What did you draw?

391
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,160
 It's a secret.

392
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,600
 Suit yourself.

393
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:27,699
You said it was a secret.

394
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,400
How could you tell me that?

395
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:35,823
Anyway, everybody knows that I like you and I like drawing.

396
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,699
Ding Xian.

397
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:04,059
I only hope..

398
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:08,701
that you can choose the things that you really like.

399
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:18,079
I will.

400
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,740
So, stop talking to me. I'll get back to my problem now.

401
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,059
No talking.

402
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:49,300
Mr. Zhou.

403
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,700
Done?

404
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,119
Are you sure?

405
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,020
Zero point.

406
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,639
Why?

407
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,120
What about the bugs in information security?

408
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,641
You didn't even notice such obvious information bugs.

409
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,800
If this task was assigned by a tech company,

410
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,960
you'd be sued by now.

411
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,460
But you asked me to write it down this way.

412
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,959
So, we've found the problems.

413
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:35,039
Do it again.

414
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,859
Zhou Siyue,

415
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,839
I feel like we are back in high school again.

416
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:51,160
Back then after the division of Arts and Sciences, you taught me math.

417
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,640
And now you are acting just as...

418
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,000
As what?

419
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,880
As mean as before.

420
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,620
You are also the same.

421
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,700
Still haven't made any progress.

422
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,119
With your current level,

423
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,500
you should consider changing your major.

424
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,619
Please go easy on me.

425
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,580
This is only my freshman year.

426
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,580
No one cares whether you are a freshman or not.

427
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,599
They only know that you are a student of Huaqing University.

428
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,099
Besides,

429
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,959
it's your own idea to join the scientific research group.

430
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,920
If you fail to pass the assessment,

431
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,640
I won't be surprised.

432
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,379
Professor Ye is very strict.

433
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,792
And I think...

434
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,959
there's no need for you to join the group.

435
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:59,419
Zhou Siyue, don't you underestimate me.

436
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:03,959
Plus, I have you, a computer guru.

437
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,860
I'm sure I can pass.

438
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,650
Hey.

439
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:18,020
What are you doing?

440
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,580
I need your help, and this is how you react?

441
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:23,658
Wait for me.

442
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:27,640
Our university is holding a welcome party for freshmen.

443
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,839
- Would you like to go with me?
 - No.

444
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,239
Classmate Zhou Siyue, you can't go on like this.

445
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:35,199
You used to enjoy activities like this, didn't you?

446
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:37,420
How come you seldom talk to people now?

447
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:45,080
One should focus on one thing at a time so that he can live his life with no regrets.

448
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:48,539
So boring.

449
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,800
Fine.

450
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,800
I'll learn from you, and I won't go either.

451
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,620
I'm going back to the lab.

452
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,400
Focus on one thing at a time, and live with no regrets.

453
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:27,899
Ding Xian!

454
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,060
Ding Xian!

455
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,519
Ding Xian?

456
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,799
Where are you?

457
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,540
Ding Xian!

458
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:48,646
Are you all right?

459
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,680
What are you doing hiding in the dark?

460
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,560
You are too timid.

461
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,159
Who's timid?

462
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:17,279
Don't talk nonsense.

463
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,820
I thought you left. Why are you back?

464
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,959
The power turned off.

465
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:28,879
What if the data went missing?

466
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:31,059
Of course, I need to come back and check.

467
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:32,459
I'm leaving.

468
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,342
Didn't you say you wouldn't help her after she joined the scientific research group?

469
00:36:40,342 --> 00:36:41,922
So, what are you doing now?

470
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:44,480
I couldn't help.

471
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:47,600
Like I said, you are sharp-tongued but soft-hearted.

472
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,200
Eat your dinner.

473
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:52,320
What about you?

474
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,440
I'm not hungry.

475
00:36:56,539 --> 00:36:59,619
Food is like fuel. You'll lose your energy without it.

476
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:03,366
You work and study hard every day. And you always stay up late doing experiments.

477
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:06,120
You need to take good care of yourself. Got it?

478
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,500
How can you get energy if you don't eat?

479
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,520
You are like my mother.

480
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,659
Come on, my son. Eat something.

481
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,239
Come here. Come on.

482
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,759
The pork shoulder is good

483
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,559
Is something wrong with your head?

484
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:43,659
What do you mean?

485
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,479
Your chopsticks.

486
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:46,679
They are upside down.

487
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,190

488
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,320
Professor Ye,

489
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,999
did I pass?

490
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,199
Very well.

491
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:06,399
But someone else solved it in the same way.

492
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:08,300
You must know who it is.

493
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,800
Professor Ye,

494
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,479
I admit that I asked Zhou Siyue for help.

495
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:18,679
But I...

496
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:20,960
You know Zhou Siyue better than I do.

497
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,199
He's very passionate about scientific research,

498
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,879
and he has the power to affect the people around him.

499
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,700
But he's one whom others want...

500
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,580
to keep up with yet can never catch up.

501
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,040
Ding Xian, you are a clever girl.

502
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,600
You should know what to do.

503
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,700
Chocolate! I'll have one.

504
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,840
Not this time.

505
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,479
This is a gift for someone else.

506
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:57,459
I'll buy some for you next time.

507
00:38:57,459 --> 00:38:59,579
A gift?

508
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,279
Are you drawing this robot for Zhou Siyue?

509
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:08,360
What's wrong with this Zhou Siyue?

510
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,080
What do you mean?

511
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,360
You've pursued him for a long time.

512
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,080
If you two are really as close as you claim,

513
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,460
he should have expressed his feelings for you by now.

514
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:26,600
I didn't ask him to be my boyfriend.

515
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,860
Then why are you chasing him?

516
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:33,320
Don't get me wrong.

517
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,600
I'm just concerned about seeing you

518
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,879
going after him this hard.

519
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:42,620
I think being happy is the most important thing. As long as you won't regret it.

520
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,520
Now, I'll go wash up. Try to go to bed early.

521
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,480
- Goodnight.
 - Goodnight.

522
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,880
 You like Zhou Siyue, which is none of my business.

523
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:58,420
 But, Ding Xian,

524
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,059
 I don't think you have a passion for scientific research.

525
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:06,060
 I don't know how much you know about the prospect of this major.

526
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,639
 Neither do I know what your plan is for the future.

527
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:17,059
 But I hope you can think carefully before deciding to do scientific research.

528
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:22,899
 Figure out what your choice would be if Zhou Siyue wasn't here.

529
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,860

530
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,620
Ding Xian.

531
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,039
Senior.

532
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,839
Did you pass the test Professor Ye gave you?

533
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,099
I think so.

534
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:52,300
Then, will you go abroad?

535
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:56,279
I'm working on it.

536
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,260
I do believe that you are a smart girl.

537
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,399
Why are you wasting your time on something like this?

538
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:09,699
What do you mean?

539
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,980
You follow Zhou Siyue around every day.

540
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:18,239
I do admire you for giving up so much for the person you like.

541
00:41:18,272 --> 00:41:20,033
But I don't think...

542
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,460
it's worth it.

543
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:24,879
Senior,

544
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:29,101
whether it's worth it or not is not measured by the effort paid.

545
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,579
Certainly, Zhou Siyue has great scientific research capabilities.

546
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:36,452
For him, you are even willing to do the things that you don't like.

547
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:40,419
But he will never give up on the things that he likes for anybody.

548
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:46,280
Things like going abroad. He won't give that up for you.

549
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,133
Doesn't matter.

550
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:51,293
I don't need him to do anything for me.

551
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,560
Then what if I tell you he's the one who told Professor Ye

552
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,620
that you aren't suitable for scientific research?

553
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,080
It's not important either.

554
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,200
Ding Xian.

555
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:20,239
Ding Xian.

556
00:42:22,819 --> 00:42:25,059
Sorry, President. I didn't hear you.

557
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:27,719
I said, thank you for your help today.

558
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,179
You are welcome.

559
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:14,159
Hello?

560
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,579
 Hello? Zhou Siyue.

561
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:16,979
 Where are you?

562
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,879
What's up?

563
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:24,139
I knew you'd be here.

564
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:26,760
Something went wrong again with the program.

565
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,840
Could you help me check it?

566
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,340
Thank you.

567
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,866
What have you been busy with?

568
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:39,087
You never reply to my messages.

569
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:41,480
Doing experiments.

570
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:44,479
But you can't always stay in the lab.

571
00:43:44,479 --> 00:43:45,500
How boring.

572
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,320
Why don't you join our Anime &amp; Comics Club?

573
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,720
It's really fun.

574
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:54,299
By the way, we just received a drawing competition invitation.

575
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,139
A drawing competition?

576
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:59,900
Yes. The winner will be signed by the press directly.

577
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:02,120
Did Ding Xian sign up for it?

578
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,399
Her?

579
00:44:03,399 --> 00:44:05,760
I do think she's quite talented.

580
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,919
If she signed up for it,

581
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:08,840
she might be able to win a prize.

582
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,959
But she refused.

583
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:11,959
She said she didn't have time.

584
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:16,700
I have no idea what could possibly keep a freshman like her so busy.

585
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,840
I've helped you revise it.

586
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,340
It looks good now.

587
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,080
But if you modify the program on purpose again,

588
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,760
I will not help you anymore.

589
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,459
So, you noticed, huh?

590
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,700
All right. If there's nothing else, you can leave now.

591
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,600
Okay. I'll take you out for dinner.

592
00:44:54,879 --> 00:44:56,399
Why did you touch my stuff?

593
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:58,600
Calm down.

594
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,159
It's just a piece of chocolate.

595
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:01,980
A piece of chocolate?

596
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,840
This is a gift someone gave me.

597
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,080
Why are you yelling?

598
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,719
How was I supposed to know it was a gift?

599
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,212
I'll buy you one exactly like this, then.

600
00:45:10,212 --> 00:45:11,760
So petty.

601
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,160
Thanks.

602
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:25,300
Have you finished the props?

603
00:45:26,499 --> 00:45:29,580
Almost, President. Give me a little more time.

604
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,800
Ding Xian, are you okay?

605
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,579
Are you feeling unwell or something?

606
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:36,099
Do you need a rest?

607
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:37,139
No. I'm fine.

608
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:40,020
I'll finish it in time for tomorrow's rehearsal.

609
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,620
Okay.

610
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:47,919
President, is Xing Lufei here yet?

611
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:49,320
They are asking for costumes again.

612
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
Hold on.

613
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:52,479
I'll call her.

614
00:45:52,479 --> 00:45:53,919
Okay.

615
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:56,339
What's the hurry? Here I am.

616
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,040
Great.

617
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,679
Are the costumes ready?

618
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,879
Almost ready. We only need two more.

619
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:04,639
Take a look at the chart.

620
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,040
See how far you are behind the schedule.

621
00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:17,619
Lufei, where did you get the chocolate?

622
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:19,540
Zhou Siyue gave it to me.

623
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:35,860

624
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:42,595
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

625
00:46:43,443 --> 00:46:47,055
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫
