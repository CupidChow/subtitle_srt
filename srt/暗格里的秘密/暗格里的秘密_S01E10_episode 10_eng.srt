00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,710

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,566
♫  For whom will the summer slow down  ♫

3
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,052
♫  Loud cicadas chirp complicated feelings  ♫

4
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:26,932
♫  I wonder what kind of scenery awaits us  ♫

5
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:32,404
♫  For whom will the movie change its story  ♫

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,810
♫  A sudden storm, blurred vision  ♫

7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,459
♫  I wonder if it's going to be a starry night  ♫

8
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:47,518
♫  As the last spark from the fireworks fade  ♫

9
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:55,914
♫  It reminds me something's better to be said earlier than later  ♫

10
00:00:55,914 --> 00:01:01,440
♫  Just like that I've never stopped loving you  ♫

11
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:04,278
♫  In the sleepless winter night  ♫

12
00:01:04,278 --> 00:01:06,391
♫  A season to say goodbye  ♫

13
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:09,644
♫  I try my best to be brave  ♫

14
00:01:09,644 --> 00:01:15,270
♫  We will keep on going like this  ♫

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,958
♫  The secret of the answer  ♫

16
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,310
♫  An insoluble question  ♫

17
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,647
♫  All comes down to a simple thank you  ♫

18
00:01:27,647 --> 00:01:31,421

19
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:34,440

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,720
Finish your food.

21
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,990
I'll walk you home afterward.

22
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,660
I don't want to go back.

23
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,240
Can you let me stay here for one night?

24
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,680
In your dreams.

25
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,453
You are going back no matter what.

26
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,185
Petty!

27
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,215
Great. You are all grown up now.

28
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:15,295
You've learned to run away from home.

29
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,155
Auntie,

30
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,295
I saw Ding Xian downstairs, so I took her to have dinner.

31
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:33,105
And now I have brought her back here.

32
00:02:33,105 --> 00:02:35,215
Thank you so much, Siyue.

33
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:38,235
That's okay, Auntie. It's my pleasure.

34
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:42,345
Siyue, Xian has been weird lately.

35
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:45,788
I just want to ask you if Xian is close

36
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:49,294
to any of the boys in your school.

37
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,855
She never mentioned that to me.

38
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:57,415
I might be worrying for nothing.

39
00:02:57,415 --> 00:03:00,895
Xian has been quite rebellious lately.

40
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:02,551
She has been hiding a lot of things.

41
00:03:02,551 --> 00:03:04,961
She left me no choice.

42
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,784
But I actually think Ding Xian does listen to you.

43
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:13,185
That's why, Auntie, you don't have to worry.

44
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:16,377
All right. I shouldn't keep you any longer. Go home.

45
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:18,025
Thank you for walking Xian back.

46
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:19,825
It's my pleasure.

47
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,717
- I will get going now. 
 - Okay.

48
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,291
Let me ask you.

49
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,221
What did you do to my little girl this time?

50
00:03:44,221 --> 00:03:46,658
I was worried about her,

51
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,961
so I read her diary.

52
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:51,105
I didn't say anything.

53
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,555
You are always defending her.

54
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:53,974
I'm defending her?

55
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:56,475
You are violating her privacy. Do you understand?

56
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:58,525
This is wrong!

57
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,481
Go. Go calm her down.

58
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:02,365
No. I'm not going.

59
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:03,985
I'm mad, too.

60
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:05,915
You...

61
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:08,415
You are so stubborn.

62
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,765
 It is said that...

63
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:43,655
 when one starts to face losing things

64
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:47,375
 and accepts the cruelty of reality,

65
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,425
 that's when his youth begins to fade.

66
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,480

67
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,845
Sorry, Mr. Liu. I didn't do well in the exam.

68
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:46,295
You shouldn't be apologizing to me.

69
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:49,065
This is your academic performance.

70
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,310
You do know how to answer these questions.

71
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,780
How did you get them wrong?

72
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,390
All right. Go back and think about it yourself.

73
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,310
Switch seats with someone and focus on learning.

74
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,640
Come on! Did you really mess up in the exam?

75
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,530
I was too nervous that I didn't do well.

76
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,500
Let's switch seats, then.

77
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,940
What's going on?

78
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,810
I'm sitting here.

79
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,640
Okay.

80
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,720
It's fine.

81
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,120
Pass them along.

82
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,463
This set of exercises contains classic questions from the past years.

83
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:24,760
Go back and finish it.

84
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,400
We'll be explaining it tomorrow.

85
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,320
Don't try to fool anyone.

86
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,593
Answer one more question and you may get one more point.

87
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:35,540
You guys watch your safety on your way home.

88
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,873
Let your parents pick you up if they can.

89
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:41,285
And for those whose parents can't come, find someone to go home together with.

90
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:42,875
Class is over now.

91
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,802
Siyue,

92
00:07:55,802 --> 00:07:59,222
have you heard of the Devious Dragon of Shenhai High?

93
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:01,939
My friend's brother was robbed a few days ago.

94
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,759
He's even targeting children.

95
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,253
How awful is that?

96
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,640
Don't go. Wait for me.

97
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,718
Aren't you going to chase him?

98
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,795
I don't know what to say to him.

99
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:26,374
It's okay. Just tell him the truth.

100
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:29,931
I'm worried that he will go talk to Mr. Liu if he knows.

101
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:33,099
Are you going to keep being awkward like this?

102
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,653
That's why you have to help me figure out a good excuse to switch seats.

103
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,453
That's easy.

104
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:47,999
Tell him that you can't see the blackboard clearly.

105
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:51,893
My mom just got me a new pair of glasses.

106
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:54,626
Then tell him that you don't want to affect his learning process.

107
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:59,300
In terms of that, Song Ziqi has a worse influence.

108
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,860
If none of those work, tell him that you want to sit with Kong Shadi.

109
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,713
He wouldn't believe an excuse like that.

110
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,043
I ran out of solutions.

111
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,433
Hey.

112
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:17,233
Zhou Siyue.

113
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,870
What?

114
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,893
I'm saying that Zhou Siyue is here.

115
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,343
Didn't he leave earlier?

116
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,040
What a small world!

117
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,585
He can't see me!

118
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,805
You've ordered a lot.

119
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:37,963
Don't order any food. Let's just join them. Come on.

120
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,325
Sit down.

121
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,506
I just remembered that I have an art class.

122
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,586
I'm going to leave now.

123
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:11,540
Liar! You have no class.

124
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,113
I can't stay here.

125
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,093
I'm leaving, see you.

126
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,393
What happened between the two of you?

127
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,480
Nothing.

128
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,923
That's good.

129
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:43,423
That's great.

130
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,503
Let's eat.

131
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,293
Hey.

132
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,879
Why are you walking so fast?

133
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,523
Didn't our teacher say that we need to head back home as soon as possible after school?

134
00:11:10,523 --> 00:11:14,232
What if we encounter the Devious Dragon?

135
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,380
Don't you have anything to say to me?

136
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:25,063
Why did you switch seats?

137
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:29,893
 I wasn't at my best this time.

138
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:32,523
 I will do better next time.

139
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:34,973
 Can I not switch seats?

140
00:11:35,953 --> 00:11:37,553
 Sure.

141
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:39,781
 Ask Zhou Siyue to come and talk to me.

142
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,953
 He has helped you so many times, he can do it again.

143
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:01,473
Never mind.

144
00:12:02,163 --> 00:12:03,963
Let's go home.

145
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:34,745
 Why would a girl distance herself from someone out of blue?

146
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:37,348
 Because you got under her skin.

147
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:39,586
 Who is it?

148
00:12:40,982 --> 00:12:43,343
 But I have no clue what I did wrong.

149
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:48,013
 Girls don't need a reason to be mad.

150
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:50,053
 Just look at Kong Shadi.

151
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:52,993
 Who is it?

152
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:55,322
 So, what should I do?

153
00:12:56,085 --> 00:12:59,122
 It's easy to make a girl happy. Send her a gift.

154
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,223
Who are they talking about?

155
00:13:15,013 --> 00:13:17,803
He hasn't talked to me for a whole day.

156
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:20,353
You didn't talk to him either.

157
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,720
I never had the chance.

158
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,150
Hey, hey.

159
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,803
If you don't go talk to him now,

160
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:30,244
someone else is going to snatch him away.

161
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:36,313
Yang Chunzi! Why is she so close to Siyue again?

162
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,630
Didn't you hear?

163
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,653
The guy she usually hangs out with has gone abroad.

164
00:13:40,683 --> 00:13:42,923
She's trying to get close to Siyue again.

165
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,893
- She's switching her heart all the time. 
 - Enough.

166
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:47,533
Stop speaking up for someone else.

167
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,433
Ding Xian hasn't said anything yet.

168
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:53,623
It seems like things didn't change so much for him after I switched seats.

169
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:56,519
I thought myself too important.

170
00:13:57,093 --> 00:13:58,846
That's cynical.

171
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:00,286
Talk to her.

172
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:02,186
One-track mind.

173
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:11,029
Song Ziqi, why are you drinking my milk tea?

174
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:12,545
Tastes awful. You can have it back.

175
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:14,175
Did I beg you to drink?

176
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,850
Hey.

177
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,819
What happened to Ding Xian? Has she lost her soul?

178
00:14:25,413 --> 00:14:27,313
Is this necessary?

179
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:30,730
You should stop now.

180
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:35,593
Can you hear what they are saying?

181
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,940
Check it with your stupid eyes.

182
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,960
What are they talking about?

183
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,855
Three skewers of fish balls. No room for negotiation.

184
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:44,600
You are taking advantage of someone else's misery.

185
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,716
Four skewers. I'm paying.

186
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:48,416
Deal.

187
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,283
"Have you selected the play yet?"

188
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:57,657
They want to watch a play together?

189
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,451
"I've booked it."

190
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:03,440
I'll send it to you on the computer.

191
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,119
And he said that they were not friends. Liar!

192
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:08,162
All guys are the same.

193
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:13,563
I also feel that Siyue is a little off.

194
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:16,063
We were discussing this in the group of three yesterday.

195
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:20,629
Zhou Siyue, this is what you call not close.

196
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,109
Why would you be watching a play together if you are not close?

197
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:25,731
I'll try harder academically.

198
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:28,069
I will never talk to you again!

199
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,650
Hey.

200
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:46,693
Why are you so mad?

201
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:53,720
I heard that Riverside Theater has a new play recently.

202
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,969
It's called "Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land," and it's pretty good.

203
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:01,493
Do you like plays?

204
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,993
I just learned about it casually.

205
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:09,044
Don't you like plays?

206
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:12,699
I've never watched a play before.

207
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:17,013
But...

208
00:16:18,123 --> 00:16:21,012
it's not impossible to understand.

209
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:25,086
I knew it.

210
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,649
Want to ask me out?

211
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:35,680
I'm back.

212
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,088
Xian, there you are.

213
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:39,520
Come on, get ready. We are going to Siyue's place.

214
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,312
Uncle Zhou and Auntie are back from a business trip.

215
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:45,492
I'm not going. You guys go ahead.

216
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:47,243
You will have nothing to eat if you don't go.

217
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:49,829
I'm not hungry.

218
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:03,556
Mom, you look great with makeup.

219
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:07,513
You are beautiful already, and that makeup really makes your face stand out.

220
00:17:08,552 --> 00:17:10,443
Tell me. What do you need?

221
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:12,843
Um...

222
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,702
Pocket money...

223
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,705
Here. Take it.

224
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:26,823
Mom, can I have a little more?

225
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,680
Ding Juncong!

226
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,300
How many times have I given you pocket money this month?

227
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,481
Five yuan it is. You are not getting even one more cent.

228
00:17:41,123 --> 00:17:42,407
Ding Wencheng, come on!

229
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:43,813
 Coming!

230
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:46,348
Let's go, Ding Juncong.

231
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:48,349
I know. I'll be there later.

232
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:49,749
Hurry up.

233
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:55,983
Sis, you look great today.

234
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:58,053
I have no money.

235
00:17:58,053 --> 00:17:59,313
Mom was right.

236
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:02,193
You should change your habit of spending pocket money without control.

237
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:05,356
I didn't spend money without control. I'm going to...

238
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,911
Never mind. You wouldn't understand anyway.

239
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:14,882
What do I need to understand? You are trying to talk your way out of this.

240
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,022
Oh, right! Why didn't you bring Xian here?

241
00:18:23,022 --> 00:18:26,358
Xian didn't do well in the recent monthly test. She's studying at home.

242
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:27,592
We are so worried.

243
00:18:27,592 --> 00:18:30,572
It's common to not be at one's best in tests.

244
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:33,102
Everyone will make mistakes.

245
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:35,970
Unlike Siyue, our Xian is not that smart.

246
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,464
It takes time for her to learn.

247
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,704
Look. He's familiar with technology, too.

248
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:44,102
Besides, Xian has grown stubborn.

249
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:46,132
She insisted on studying science.

250
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,631
Her performance dropped,

251
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:51,635
and she will be lucky if she could get into a basic public university.

252
00:18:51,635 --> 00:18:55,024
As for renowned universities, she can forget about it.

253
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:58,014
Auntie,

254
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:01,495
actually, that's how Ding Xian is.

255
00:19:01,495 --> 00:19:04,672
If she's onto something, she will stick through with it.

256
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:09,302
That's why she will get into a renowned school even if it's hard.

257
00:19:09,312 --> 00:19:11,512
Don't worry, Auntie.

258
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:16,362
Xianxian is a child with a bright future.

259
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:17,882
You should relax.

260
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:19,498
Yes.

261
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,205
Ding Xian.

262
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,121
I have some news.

263
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:30,181
Do you want to hear it?

264
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:32,825
I'm not in the mood for girls' gossip. See you.

265
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:35,605
It's about Zhou Siyue and Yang Chunzi.

266
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,612
It doesn't hurt to hear about it.

267
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,017
In junior high, they attended math competitions together.

268
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:47,080
People started to talk gradually,

269
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,467
and Zhou Siyue distanced himself

270
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:52,045
from Yang Chunzi to avoid rumors.

271
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:53,607
It doesn't matter.

272
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:56,679
Whatever happens to him and Yang Chunzi,

273
00:19:57,347 --> 00:20:00,247
I will focus on learning, so stop mentioning Zhou Siyue.

274
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:02,087
And don't distract me.

275
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,480
Oh, no. This is bad.

276
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,520
Another lost soul.

277
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,600
Siyue, over here.

278
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,907
I got it wrong again.

279
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:40,657
Song Ziqi, do you have an eraser?

280
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,646
I forgot to bring it.

281
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:55,592
Thank you.

282
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:56,992
You are welcome.

283
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,277
Do you guys have plans this weekend?

284
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:08,392
Yeah, to play.

285
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,237
A new game room has opened.

286
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:12,757
It's such a fun place. Let's go check it out together.

287
00:21:13,757 --> 00:21:15,477
What happened to your eyes?

288
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:20,397
Xianxian, how about you?

289
00:21:20,397 --> 00:21:21,833
I might stay at home and study.

290
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,953
I don't know if my mom will let me go out.

291
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:26,164
Siyue, how about you?

292
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,640
I'll think about it.

293
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:36,462
- Song Ziqi, come with me. 
 - What is it?

294
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,462
Now!

295
00:21:44,217 --> 00:21:46,640
Kong Shadi, what do you want?

296
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,177
- I can't stand this anymore. 
 - I can't stand this either. What did I do to you?

297
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:52,187
Not you. The two of them.

298
00:21:58,707 --> 00:22:00,753
They haven't been right, indeed.

299
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,430
They can't keep being like this.

300
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,476
Think about it.

301
00:22:03,476 --> 00:22:08,152
If they don't make up, the two of us will keep suffering.

302
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:11,097
I agree.

303
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:13,157
So, what should we do?

304
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:14,757
How about this?

305
00:22:14,757 --> 00:22:19,079
Let's ask them out this weekend and let them spend some time alone.

306
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:22,289
I'll deal with Ding Xian and you are handling Siyue.

307
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:24,300
Why? Why can't we switch?

308
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,910
I don't care. If you can't do this right, don't come and see me again.

309
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:31,017
Kong Shadi!

310
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,507
We are brothers, and you are selling me out for Ding Xian.

311
00:22:34,507 --> 00:22:38,023
Who are you calling a brother? Idiot!

312
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,777
What else could we be?

313
00:22:39,777 --> 00:22:41,697
Think about it yourself.

314
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:52,167
Kong Shadi, are you having some ideas about me?

315
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:54,944
Don't flatter yourself.

316
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:57,687
Disgusting.

317
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:07,553
Xianxian!

318
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:10,573
Shadi.

319
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:12,637
What are you doing this weekend? Let's hang out.

320
00:23:12,637 --> 00:23:15,377
This weekend. My mother forbids me to go out.

321
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:19,417
Come on, we haven't hung out for a long time now!

322
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:24,018
Besides, let me show you.

323
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:28,347
Where did you get the ticket?

324
00:23:28,347 --> 00:23:32,176
My dad's office gave him these. He's not going anyway. We should go.

325
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:38,323
Forget it. My mom will never agree to let me go.

326
00:23:38,323 --> 00:23:40,486
Why don't you go with Song Ziqi?

327
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,596
No, I want to go with you.

328
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:44,616
You figure something out.

329
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:46,889
Come on!

330
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:49,002
Remember to dress up nicely.

331
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,599
- What are you doing? 
 - How did it go?

332
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,627
You have nothing to worry about when I'm on it.

333
00:23:58,627 --> 00:24:01,557
- Are you sure it's done? 
 - Of course.

334
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,987
- Why are you here? 
 - Is it just the two of you?

335
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:06,987
Where is Siyue?

336
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,004
Is he still mad at me?

337
00:24:09,004 --> 00:24:11,427
Don't flatter yourself.

338
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,217
What are you doing here?

339
00:24:14,217 --> 00:24:17,837
This is an urgent request. I need money.

340
00:24:17,837 --> 00:24:20,893
Did your dad deduct your pocket money again?

341
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:24,667
I'll pay it back to the two of you once I get my red envelope this year.

342
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:25,959
Double it.

343
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:28,717
Shadi, you are the best.

344
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,589
Here.

345
00:24:35,347 --> 00:24:37,247
I...

346
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:41,767
I...

347
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,017
I don't have much. Don't spend it all at once.

348
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:50,547
I saw a big bill there.

349
00:24:50,547 --> 00:24:52,289
That's not true.

350
00:24:55,571 --> 00:24:57,903
Is this a robbery?

351
00:24:57,903 --> 00:25:01,497
Who are you? You dare to rob my friend.

352
00:25:01,497 --> 00:25:02,640
I'm not robbing him.

353
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,000
Don't try to talk your way out of this.

354
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,116
You are the Worm of Shenhai High School who likes to rob people around here. Right?

355
00:25:08,116 --> 00:25:10,566
It's the Devious Dragon!

356
00:25:10,566 --> 00:25:11,987
You are so familiar with that name.

357
00:25:11,987 --> 00:25:13,893
There's no denying it. I'm calling the police now.

358
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:16,027
Don't! Keke, he's one of us.

359
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:18,896
Let me introduce you. This is my friend, Jiang Chen.

360
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:20,239
He's the big boss in 18th High School.

361
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,739
Who is she?

362
00:25:22,393 --> 00:25:24,776
The school babe of Shenhai High School, You Keke.

363
00:25:24,776 --> 00:25:27,477
Oh, I've heard about you.

364
00:25:27,477 --> 00:25:30,377
You were hanging out with some boys from our school.

365
00:25:30,377 --> 00:25:31,747
That's nonsense.

366
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:34,416
There's no nice guy in your school.

367
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:36,777
Isn't the Devious Dragon from your school?

368
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:38,382
What if that's not true?

369
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:39,547
That would be impossible.

370
00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:40,947
All right.

371
00:25:40,947 --> 00:25:42,707
Let's flush him out.

372
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:47,540
I will let you know that guys from 18th High School have nothing to hide.

373
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,756
- Sure. We'll see. 
 - Let's go.

374
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:52,856
As you wish.

375
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:56,687
Why do I feel we're a little redundant here?

376
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:04,327
Are you still studying the stupid zodiac signs?

377
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:05,687
Don't say that.

378
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:07,827
This is accurate.

379
00:26:07,827 --> 00:26:11,673
Only girls would believe that. It's a sham.

380
00:26:11,673 --> 00:26:14,677
If you don't believe it, I'll do a fortune telling for you.

381
00:26:14,677 --> 00:26:16,613
You will know if it's accurate or not.

382
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:18,310
Sure. Go ahead.

383
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,590
I'd love to see what you can come up with.

384
00:26:25,347 --> 00:26:26,607
Um...

385
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:28,507
What?

386
00:26:28,507 --> 00:26:30,839
What's your zodiac sign?

387
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:36,433
Girl, we've been friends forever, and you are asking me about my zodiac sign now?

388
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:39,157
Why would I care about things like that?

389
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,226
Just give it to me. I'll check it myself.

390
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,826
Aquarius, can you remember that?

391
00:26:45,826 --> 00:26:47,447
Aquarius, here.

392
00:26:47,447 --> 00:26:51,087
Aquarius should stay inside as much as possible

393
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:56,057
to avoid losing money or injury.

394
00:26:56,057 --> 00:26:57,567
That's bullshit!

395
00:26:57,567 --> 00:26:59,017
This is bad for you, Song Ziqi.

396
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:03,297
Losing money, getting injured...

397
00:27:03,297 --> 00:27:05,097
Shut up!

398
00:27:10,757 --> 00:27:12,457
Ding Wencheng.

399
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:13,867
Wake up.

400
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,467
What is it?

401
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:17,657
Here.

402
00:27:17,657 --> 00:27:18,988
What?

403
00:27:18,988 --> 00:27:20,856
Movie tickets.

404
00:27:21,927 --> 00:27:24,320
This is rare.

405
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,278
The last time we ever watched a movie together was more than a decade ago.

406
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,809
How did it come to you to buy movie tickets?

407
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:30,509
It's not for you.

408
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:33,520
Give it to Xianxian and ask her to go with a classmate.

409
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,697
And bring her the clothes while you are at it.

410
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:42,046
Have you thought it through?

411
00:27:42,046 --> 00:27:45,770
You should deal with your own mess and leave me out of it.

412
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:49,020
How could you do this? Why is it so hard to make you do things?

413
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,057
Look. You are the one who should do this.

414
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:55,500
If I gave these to Xianxian, should I say they are from you or me?

415
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:58,977
I'll do it myself.

416
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,017
Mom.

417
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,750
What's up?

418
00:28:15,462 --> 00:28:17,362
Are you heading out?

419
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,306
Shadi asked me to watch a concert with her.

420
00:28:20,306 --> 00:28:24,651
I tried to refuse her, but I can't.

421
00:28:25,346 --> 00:28:26,897
Um...

422
00:28:26,897 --> 00:28:30,572
Mom, can I go?

423
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:32,276
Yes. Go.

424
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:34,176
Thanks, Mom.

425
00:28:36,626 --> 00:28:38,673
Is that what you are wearing to the concert?

426
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:41,103
I haven't decided yet.

427
00:28:41,857 --> 00:28:43,857
Um...

428
00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:47,467
I got you an outfit.

429
00:28:49,663 --> 00:28:51,163
Take it.

430
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:53,846
Mom.

431
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:58,246
Did I do something wrong?

432
00:28:58,276 --> 00:28:59,540
Silly girl!

433
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,353
Can't I do something nice for you?

434
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:02,953
Take it!

435
00:29:15,257 --> 00:29:17,157
500!

436
00:29:19,537 --> 00:29:20,867
300!

437
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:22,437
Mom, they are too expensive.

438
00:29:22,437 --> 00:29:24,155
You should return them.

439
00:29:24,155 --> 00:29:26,622
Just wear it.

440
00:29:28,207 --> 00:29:31,296
Have fun, and don't come back too late.

441
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:33,666
Remember to answer my call.

442
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:38,217
Thanks, Mom.

443
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,083
You scared me!

444
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,583
What is it?

445
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:08,757
Is this what you are wearing?

446
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:11,294
What's wrong with what I'm wearing? The point is not to be spotted.

447
00:30:11,294 --> 00:30:13,294
Understood?

448
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:15,256
Doesn't this look nice?

449
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:23,637
Hello, Shadi. Where are you?

450
00:30:23,637 --> 00:30:25,357
I'm on my way. I'll be there in a minute.

451
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,367
I have to go, see you.

452
00:30:29,013 --> 00:30:31,663
She's in a hurry to hang up.

453
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,177
Why isn't Zhou Siyue here?

454
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:34,777
I don't know. I told him.

455
00:30:34,777 --> 00:30:37,067
Zhou Siyue!

456
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,017
What are you doing?

457
00:30:48,017 --> 00:30:51,137
I... If I don't do this, he might spot me.

458
00:31:07,017 --> 00:31:09,377
What are you doing here?

459
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:13,053
I'm here for the concert.

460
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,236
They are going inside.

461
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,947
How did you get Zhou Siyue here?

462
00:31:26,947 --> 00:31:30,360
It's easy. I just said that Ding Xian was coming, and there he is.

463
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,160
Am I good or what?

464
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:34,958
Okay. It's done.

465
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,658
Let's go!

466
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:38,727
Why are we going?

467
00:31:38,727 --> 00:31:41,807
My dad got me four tickets.

468
00:31:43,997 --> 00:31:45,887
Thanks to your dad.

469
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:47,627
That's okay.

470
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:49,473
Let's go.

471
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,980

472
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,427
 You are pushing me.

473
00:32:11,253 --> 00:32:12,772
What happened?

474
00:32:13,313 --> 00:32:15,924
Nothing. I twisted my ankle.

475
00:32:16,657 --> 00:32:18,947
Let's go sit down.

476
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,357
Let me see.

477
00:32:25,357 --> 00:32:26,757
Is this the one hurting?

478
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:30,467
It's okay. I'll be fine after a little rest.

479
00:32:44,057 --> 00:32:46,170
I realized that...

480
00:32:47,086 --> 00:32:50,067
you don't like to ask for help.

481
00:32:53,777 --> 00:32:57,277
I've always been like this.

482
00:32:58,474 --> 00:33:02,610
I don't know how to say no to people, and I feel bad about troubling people.

483
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:06,173
Many times, I worry too much,

484
00:33:06,173 --> 00:33:11,993
and I can’t say anything every time the words come to my lips.

485
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:18,807
You don't have to worry.

486
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:25,347
Aren't we friends?

487
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:34,047
Friends should help each other and share each other's burdens.

488
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:38,613
But I'm always troubling you.

489
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:44,167
No one in the world can do everything perfectly.

490
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:47,137
Besides, I have never thought of you as trouble.

491
00:33:56,247 --> 00:34:01,867
Can you tell me what's going on with you now?

492
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:09,267
Actually, Mr. Liu talked to me a while ago

493
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:12,747
and said that someone told him that we were too close.

494
00:34:12,747 --> 00:34:14,507
He asked me to switch seats.

495
00:34:14,507 --> 00:34:18,047
And I promised him that I would improve my performance in the monthly test

496
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:20,087
in exchange for not switching seats.

497
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:25,833
But... I didn't do well.

498
00:34:26,377 --> 00:34:29,337
And you are making up excuses...

499
00:34:30,657 --> 00:34:33,677
for something so trivial?

500
00:34:33,677 --> 00:34:35,267
No, I'm not.

501
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:40,786
Mr. Liu said you were always helping me when I was in trouble.

502
00:34:40,786 --> 00:34:45,707
I didn't want to get you involved in my mess again.

503
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:49,087
I'm glad that you are not mad at me.

504
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,386
What? Mad at you?

505
00:34:51,386 --> 00:34:53,486
Nothing.

506
00:34:53,486 --> 00:34:57,953
Anyway, you just need to focus on the target

507
00:34:57,953 --> 00:35:00,420
and leave everything else to me.

508
00:35:00,977 --> 00:35:04,647
Starting tomorrow, I will be tutoring you alone.

509
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:07,127
I'll see if you can have a bad performance again.

510
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:24,733
What are you doing?

511
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:27,007
Look at my disguise.

512
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:28,997
It's genius!

513
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,267
I really have a problem.

514
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:37,317
Instead of having fun on a weekend, I'm waiting for the blackmailer here with you.

515
00:35:37,317 --> 00:35:40,033
And the weather is so cold. I'm leaving now.

516
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:41,933
Go ahead.

517
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:45,556
You won't even try to keep me here?

518
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:49,417
I think you were right. You should go.

519
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:51,260
I'll wait here.

520
00:35:52,857 --> 00:35:54,867
Did no one ask you out?

521
00:35:54,867 --> 00:35:56,717
Who would dare to ask me out?

522
00:35:56,717 --> 00:36:00,180
Right, who would dare?

523
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:02,700
You are so smart.

524
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,267
We wouldn't even have gotteb a cab if it weren't for you.

525
00:36:05,267 --> 00:36:06,420
Of course.

526
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,267
I checked the fortune of today before I came out.

527
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:13,217
It advised us to take a walk today.

528
00:36:13,217 --> 00:36:15,706
We might have an adventure.

529
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,177
That's a coincidence.

530
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,067
It also says that I will be injured.

531
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:22,287
It's almost the end of the week and nothing happened to me.

532
00:36:23,037 --> 00:36:25,447
We've been waiting forever and no one turned out.

533
00:36:25,447 --> 00:36:27,477
Is your bro reliable?

534
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,507
Or we...

535
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:31,923
What are you doing?

536
00:36:32,507 --> 00:36:34,607
Someone is coming.

537
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:44,436
Has the temperature dropped at night? It's so cold.

538
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:47,037
He's coming!

539
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:49,980
Why don't you get warm in my arms?

540
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,997
What are you doing? That sounds disgusting.

541
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:54,540
- Where are you going? 
 - To use the bathroom.

542
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,460
Don't follow me, you pervert.

543
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,677
That bastard! And he's a horny dragon.

544
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:03,239
Wait here. I'll go check him out.

545
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:05,539
Call the police if things are not right.

546
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,367
Pervert? Am I a pervert?

547
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:15,537
I think this coat is quite handsome.

548
00:37:15,537 --> 00:37:17,777
Devious Dragon of Shenhai High!

549
00:37:22,027 --> 00:37:24,247
Are you sure you don't want me to carry you?

550
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:27,899
My ankle is better now.

551
00:37:29,577 --> 00:37:32,817
 Devious Dragon of Shenhai High! Let me see how devious you are.

552
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:36,827
That sounds familiar.

553
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:39,807
I think it's Jiang Chen.

554
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:42,936
Wait here. I'll go check it out.

555
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,747
There you are. It's the Devious Dragon of Shenhai High.

556
00:37:53,747 --> 00:37:55,647
I'll beat him up.

557
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,460
- Don't. 
 - You are the Devious Dragon of Shenhai High, right?

558
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,960
- What are you doing? 
 - That's the Devious Dragon of Shenhai High, hit him!

559
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,980
The Devious Dragon of Shenhai High?

560
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,517
Beat the daylight out of him! Come on!

561
00:38:14,517 --> 00:38:17,087
- Devious Dragon of Shenhai High! 
 - Hit him!

562
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,587
Kong Shadi.

563
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,787
He knows my name, too!

564
00:38:20,787 --> 00:38:21,947
Hit him!

565
00:38:21,947 --> 00:38:23,677
Kong Shadi!

566
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:25,197
How stupid are you? It's me.

567
00:38:25,197 --> 00:38:26,800
Kong Shadi.

568
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,517
No. Hold a second.

569
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:31,849
Why does he sound so familiar?

570
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:33,949
Who is it?

571
00:38:42,307 --> 00:38:47,512
I did get injured today.

572
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,047
What happened today was all Jiang Chen's fault.

573
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:07,417
He said something about the Devious Dragon of Shenhai High when I arrived.

574
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:08,823
Apologize!

575
00:39:08,823 --> 00:39:09,733
How about some food?

576
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:11,733
Stay away from me!

577
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,263
Stay away from me!

578
00:39:17,263 --> 00:39:19,426
You are being stingy right now.

579
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,710
Why don't I beat you up and see how you feel?

580
00:39:24,507 --> 00:39:26,393
All right! Fine!

581
00:39:26,393 --> 00:39:32,219
I admit that what happened today was because of both of us.

582
00:39:33,363 --> 00:39:35,445
Okay. Cry it out.

583
00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:37,265
You'll feel better afterward.

584
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,100
This is for you. It works well.

585
00:39:52,337 --> 00:39:56,837
Ding Xian, forget about the two of them.

586
00:39:56,837 --> 00:39:59,717
Even you have become worse now.

587
00:39:59,717 --> 00:40:02,127
I got hurt, too.

588
00:40:02,127 --> 00:40:04,706
Can you compare yourself with me?

589
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:08,249
I'm hurt both mentally and physically.

590
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:11,249
But I'm not crying.

591
00:40:16,137 --> 00:40:17,337
You should know when to take a win.

592
00:40:17,337 --> 00:40:18,937
It hurt!

593
00:40:18,937 --> 00:40:20,967
Shut up!

594
00:40:23,227 --> 00:40:26,883
Let me go! I don't have any money.

595
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:29,897
That sounds like my brother!

596
00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:31,697
Let me go!

597
00:40:31,697 --> 00:40:32,872
It is him!

598
00:40:32,872 --> 00:40:34,972
Wait here.

599
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,390
Hurry up!

600
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,810
Pay up!

601
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,667
Are you the Devious Dragon of Shenhai High?

602
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,747
Who is it?

603
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,819
It's a misunderstanding.

604
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:50,097
A misunderstanding?

605
00:40:50,097 --> 00:40:52,493
You... Look at my face!

606
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:54,733
It's because of you!

607
00:40:58,927 --> 00:41:01,467
Should you be crying?

608
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,640
Why didn't you say that you were being blackmailed?

609
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,200
Are you stupid or what?

610
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,617
I wanted to tell you,

611
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:13,337
but you were so mean that day.

612
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,040
That's because you are always ridiculous.

613
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,707
You spend your money without control and you like to talk back.

614
00:41:18,707 --> 00:41:19,973
That's why...

615
00:41:19,973 --> 00:41:23,033
That's why it doesn't matter if I said anything or not.

616
00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:29,137
Your brother and you are alike.

617
00:41:31,043 --> 00:41:32,617
Little brother.

618
00:41:32,617 --> 00:41:35,407
I know you are on my sister's side.

619
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:39,217
Aren't you on her side?

620
00:41:39,217 --> 00:41:41,293
Not at all. She hates me so much.

621
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:43,613
She's always mean to me.

622
00:41:43,613 --> 00:41:45,467
How could she be so mean?

623
00:41:45,467 --> 00:41:47,167
Right?

624
00:41:47,717 --> 00:41:49,217
See?

625
00:41:49,217 --> 00:41:52,787
Your sis twisted her ankle and she went to look for you.

626
00:41:52,787 --> 00:41:55,237
After she found you, she was so aggressive.

627
00:41:55,237 --> 00:41:56,850
Fortunately, I stopped her.

628
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,954
How could she be so mean?

629
00:41:58,954 --> 00:42:01,667
You don't know my sister at all.

630
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:05,507
We are almost home. Hurry up.

631
00:42:05,507 --> 00:42:07,897
You can go up now.

632
00:42:07,897 --> 00:42:10,097
I'm going to leave now.

633
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:12,467
You guys talk.

634
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,605
Your brother...

635
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:25,167
is quite nice.

636
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,800
So, I... I'm going back, too.

637
00:42:32,493 --> 00:42:34,193
Just a second.

638
00:42:53,857 --> 00:42:56,147
What is this?

639
00:42:56,147 --> 00:42:57,880
A gift for you.

640
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,920
Painting tools.

641
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,820
Painting tools.

642
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,820
Painting tools?

643
00:43:04,507 --> 00:43:06,847
No need to thank me.

644
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,000
So, is this why you were talking to Yang Chunzi last time?

645
00:43:13,587 --> 00:43:15,787
She has a family residing overseas.

646
00:43:15,787 --> 00:43:18,267
That's why I asked her to order this for me.

647
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:24,747
What is it?

648
00:43:24,747 --> 00:43:29,056
I think I've misunderstood you.

649
00:43:29,056 --> 00:43:32,956
Misunderstood? What is that about?

650
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:39,009
You are keeping silent again!

651
00:43:44,337 --> 00:43:46,037
Okay.

652
00:43:46,547 --> 00:43:48,347
I'm going home.

653
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:52,077
Thank you.

654
00:43:55,172 --> 00:43:57,465

655
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:17,410

656
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:25,228
♫  The night breeze sweeps over your hair  ♫

657
00:44:25,228 --> 00:44:28,840
♫  Seeing your smile  ♫

658
00:44:30,437 --> 00:44:34,723
♫  It makes me want to jump in your arms  ♫

659
00:44:34,723 --> 00:44:39,980
♫  You make me smile unknowingly  ♫

660
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:45,830
♫  That wonderful taste is the chemistry of love  ♫

661
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:50,368
♫  Lean on your shoulder  ♫

662
00:44:50,368 --> 00:44:56,103
♫  My longing for you has left a beam of light in my heart  ♫

663
00:44:56,103 --> 00:45:00,480
♫  Reminding me of the love you gave me  ♫

664
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,350
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

665
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:06,043
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

666
00:45:06,043 --> 00:45:11,040
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

667
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,913
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

668
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:16,390
♫  After a long journey  ♫

669
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:21,480
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫

670
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:45,146
♫  I want to go somewhere far away with you  ♫

671
00:45:45,146 --> 00:45:47,820
♫  Finding each other's sea  ♫

672
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:52,963
♫  Let the light of love heal the pain  ♫

673
00:45:52,963 --> 00:45:55,640
♫  Make a wish under the starry sky  ♫

674
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,180
♫  After a long journey  ♫

675
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:02,700
♫  Our dreams have come true  ♫
