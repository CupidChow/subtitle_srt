It will be all over.

185
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,990
I've never wished so sincerely

186
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,100
for your dream to come true.

187
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,140

go get

191

the photos and newspaper about me at your home,

192
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,400
and the script that I didn't finish signing that day.

193
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,040
Bring them all.

194
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,540
Why?

195
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,810
I do things with beginnings and ends.

196
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,260
I will definitely sign that to you.

197
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,060
No need.

198
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,610
You don't deserve to write that.

199
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,510
Don't make these fake things.

200
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,920
And this watch.

201
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,090
I know you've been coveting it for a long time.

202
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,690
I'm leaving soon.

203
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,040
I'll leave it to you.

204
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,500
I can't take advantage of you for nothing.

205
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,290
I didn't know

206
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,150
you're a bit like an educated man.

207
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,240
You're not moved.

208
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,690
Well,

209
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,580
it is pragmatic.

210
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,050
I deserve it.

211
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,840
As for the signature,

212
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,540
forget it.

213
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,360
After a man dies,

214
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,910
how much will the autograph be worth?

215
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,020
Ignorant.

216
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,610
When I was taught by Mr. Mei

217
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,200
in Tianchan Palace

218
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,660
and he gave me his autograph.

219
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,470
After that, many people wanted to buy it at a high price,

220
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,850
but I refused them one by one.

221
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,820
I, Xiang Qinyu never owe money,

222
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,100
let alone a woman's money.

I'll go out and print some photos now.

It's a deal.

Why aren't you working hard?

Hang in there.

You will be a rich woman.

241

Get back to work.

242
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,340
I have to hang in there until then.

Always...

245

It costs a lot of electricity.

Mom.

247

Mom.

251
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,870
The woman took off her clothes in the bathroom.

252
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,770
Pull the curtain.

Suddenly,

254
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,380
something appeared on the white shower curtain.

255
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,260
You scared me.

256
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,180
Why did you turn off my light?

257
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,380
Are you afraid of the dark?

258
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,110
What are you doing up late every night?

259
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:26,980
It's liver-bursting (working hard).

260
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,050
Why are you cooking at night?

261
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,130
What liver?

262
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,180
Pork liver.

263
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,060
I mean

264
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,460
I stay up late to write.

265
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,220
What's so shameful about that?

266

Roses waiting to bloom.

267

Naked.

268
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,030
Maybe...

269
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,170
Do you know the Golden Lotus?

270
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,280
The forbidden book?

271
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,320
Artists in any era

272
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,190
need to take the risk

273
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,710
of not being understood by the world

274
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,880
to expose the depravity of humanity.

275
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,120
But you're not frivolous anymore.

276
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,300
This is art creation.

277
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,430
You're a rogue.

278
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,470
You're misunderstanding the text.

279
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,130
This is art

280
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,500
here.

281
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,180
OK.

282
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:26,930
Go on.

283
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,310
But keep it down.

284
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,390
Also.

285
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,550
Don't touch my lamp.

286
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,810
Wait.

287
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,180
Sleeping with the light on

288
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,660
might cause nightmares.

289
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,180
Done.

290
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,260
Orange lamp of brand granny Bingxin.

291
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,090
What are you doing?

292
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,300
Eating oranges.

293
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,170
What are you doing now?

294
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,340
This is

295
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,560
called orange lamp.

296
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,260
Once upon a time, there was a granny Bingxin,

297
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,160
who wrote an article

298
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,440
about a kind and strong

299
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,360
farm girl

300
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,760
longing for growth in adversity.

301
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,380
Now,

302
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,830
this orange lamp

303
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:31,890
and this

304
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,470
long-passed story

305
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,420
have been passed down to you.

306
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,960
What do you think?

307
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,180
When I met Ms. Bingxin,

308
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,290
you hadn't been in the circle of life yet.

309
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,630
Good night.

310
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,470
By the way,

311
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,510
if you want to continue working

312
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,110
with your liver.

313
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,390
When you do it,

314
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:56,770
be quiet.

315
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,260
Yu.

316
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,780
although

317
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,150
the real you

318
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,260
are not gentle

319
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,900
at all

320
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,970
and you spend a lot of money

321
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,660
and always

322
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,130
say bad words to me.

323
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,580
Don't worry.

324
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,620
Even if you don't have moral quality,

325
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,680
you still have face.

326
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,830
For the sake of your look,

327
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,790
you can be regarded

328
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,030
as my idol.

329
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,490
Of course,

330
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,840
for the sake that

331
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,880
you left me those signatures,

332
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:19,500
I wish you

333
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,880
a safe journey.

334
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:22,940
Now,

335
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,080
you're leaving.

336
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,530
As your only fan,

337
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,380
I represent

338
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,340
the immature me

339
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,150
who liked you in the childhood

340
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,100
to prepare a gift for you.

341
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:40,920
Take it back.

342
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,370
Make orange lamps.

343
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,460
I hope it

344
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,280
not only can light up your dark night,

345
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,340
but also guide you

346
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,230
when necessary

347
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,500
to the future,

348
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:50,850
to the light.

349
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,820
My life

350
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,280
needs no lead from others.

351
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:00,960
It's coming.

352
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,320
I'm leaving.

353
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,090
Take care.

354
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,540
Jin Ayin.

355
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,410
Take care.

356
00:19:42,810 --> 00:20:13,430
[Dangerous action Do not imitate.]

357
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,670
Xiang Qinyu.

358
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,000
in order to make your signature more valuable,

359
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,620
you must fight for Oscar.

360
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:20,770
Stop!

361
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,160
Yu.

362
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,290
Yu, are you still there?

363
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:37,760
Who?

364
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,300
Who is calling me?

365
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,820
Yu.

366
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,070
He really left.

367
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,440
I should have

368
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,740
let him leave a building for me

369
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,140
in Shanghai.

370
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,080
I regret it.

371
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,950
Why are you still here?

372
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,980
Open the door!

373
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,250
Open the door!

374
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,040
Ms. Wu

375
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,450
Young lady.

376
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,210
What are you doing?

377
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,280
Are you going to blow up the house?

378
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,570
Are you rebelling？

379
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,330
There was a fire just now, right?

380
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,070
No.

381
00:23:59,210 --> 00:23:59,770
It was struck by lightning.

382
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,910
It has nothing to do with me.

383
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,020
Struck by lightning?

384
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,100
Why is the lamp flashing randomly?

385
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,630
What's going on?

386
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,890
What's going on?

387
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,490
He...

388
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,300
He...

389
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,080
Who is he?

390
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,360
This was salvaged by our men.

391
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,900
On the night of the incident,

392
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,200
we rushed to the scene immediately

393
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,570
after receiving the call.

394
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,160
The rescue ship has been searching for

395
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,400
over 72 hours.

396
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,380
And we haven't found Chi Yu yet.

397
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,270
You should be prepared.

398
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,320
Well,

399
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,250
we can't just lose him.

400
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,020
On the night of the incident,

401
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,260
the CCTV was broken.

402
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,510
So Chi Yu was the only one

403
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,460
who was shot to walk out of the villa.

404
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,150
But if the citizen's report is true,

405
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,950
Chi Yu must have been attacked and murdered.

406
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,510
We'll do our best

407
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,200
and find the murderer.

408
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,300
If there's any new news,

409
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,340
I'll contact you immediately.

410
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:18,880
Also,

411
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,980
do you know Li Longda?

412
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,100
I'll give you two days.

413
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,890
Either you let him go,

414
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,270
or you go with him.

415
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,410
When you go in,

416
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,600
give this letter

417
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,150
to them.

418
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,260
I've written down

419
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,900
your situation sincerely in it.

420
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,930
After they read this letter,

421
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,310
they will definitely

422
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,090
help you.

423
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,750
Maybe

424
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,610
they will find someone more professional

425
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,180
to help you find a way home.

426
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,640
It's much more reliable

427
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,950
than you do research on you own in my house.

428
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,820
I, Jin Ayin,

429
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,370
will pray for you every day

430
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,180
and sincerely wish

431
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,060
you can go back soon

432
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,090
and have a good fame in history.

433
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:02,610
Alright.

434
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,100
I got it.

435
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,340
Go back.

436
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:11,710
Well...

437
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,780
Don't worry.

438
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,290
The police

439
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,760
will help you.

440
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,680
Xiang Qinyu.

441
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:50,650
If you are in heaven,

442
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,560
don't blame me.

443
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,210
I really can't stand it.

444
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,470
All deities

445
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,290
from south

446
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,490
and north,

447
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,860
please take him back safely.

448
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,280
Ayin,

449
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,050
I got you a job.

450
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,750
The on-site scriptwriter of The Legend of Xiang Qinyu.

451
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,830
Isn't he the one

452
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,340
you've been nagging with me?

453
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,840
Sir, turn around.

454
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,470
Turn around.

455
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,690
Where is he?

456
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,490
Someone is jumping off the building.

457
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,420
Looking from the back, he's tall and handsome.

458
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,100
Let's go and have a look.

459
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,660
A tall and handsome guy.

460
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,200
You said someone is going to jump off the building.

461
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,760
Look, it's live streaming.

462
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:50,570
Where am I?

463
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,670
Over there.

464
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,580
Dude,

465
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,850
come over if you need anything.

466
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,130
Don't be impulsive.

467
00:28:59,340 --> 00:28:59,940
Think about your family,

468
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,660
and your friends.

469
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,860
The police is coming.

470
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,090
Let's talk here.

471
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,410
What is it that he cannot solve?

472
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,080
Xiang Qinyu.

473
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,700
Move!

474
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,540
Move!

475
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,360
Yu.

476
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,390
Yu.

477
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,900
Calm down.

478
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,600
Stop shooting.

479
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,060
Stop shooting.

480
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,340
I'll hit you if you keep shooting.

481
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,560
Go away!

482
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:39,740
Go away!

483
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,660
Why is she so fierce?

484
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,340
Yu.

485
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,180
Calm down.

486
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,380
Listen to me.

487
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,540
It's all my fault.

488
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,310
I shouldn't have blamed you

489
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,940
when you blow off the house.

490
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,100
I shouldn't have just left you.

491
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,020
Calm down.

492
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,370
Come here, Yu.

493
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,900
Why are you apologizing?

494
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,560
I'm the one who messed up your house.

495
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,660
I was wrong.

496
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,140
Since the misunderstanding has been cleared up.

497
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,730
Jin Ayin,

498
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,050
Go back early.

499
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,320
You have a home.

500
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,070
I'm going back too.

501
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,550
No, Yu.

502
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:35,500
Yu.

503
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,900
Calm down.

504
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,080
Since the lightning method doesn't work,

505
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,530
we can think of other ways.

506
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,460
This is my way.

507
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,130
What kind of stupid way is this?

508
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,740
Since I came here

509
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,710
because I was in danger,

510
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,730
maybe I can go back

511
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,640
once I'm in a similar situation again.

512
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,220
Well, Yu,

513
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,310
isn't this a suicide?

514
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,020
If you jumped from here,

515
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,850
and you didn't go back,

516
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,820
you would die.

517
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,510
It's not worth a try.

518
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,170
I'd rather give it a try

519
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,540
than have regrets staying here.

520
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,220
As a man,

521
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,210
even if I fall to death,

522
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,210
I lived the life.

523
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,010
Wait, Yu.

524
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,400
Yu.

525
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,610
Don't you care about appearance the most normally?

526
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,330
If you fall from here,

527
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,940
you'll fall into pieces.

528
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,710
You will...

529
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:28,570
You will...

530
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,720
You will be very ugly.

531
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,530
I'll drink DDVP then.

532
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,830
No, Yu.

533
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,300
Are the instant noodles here not good

534
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,530
or the TV here not good?

535
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,070
Why do you have to go back?

536
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,820
You won't understand.

537
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,380
In order to film The Legend of Huangpu,

538
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,760
I sold all my property.

539
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,420
I even gave Mengsheng to others.

540
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,890
I always thought I would become a legend

541
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,500
after the shooting of it.

542
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,950
And it will be a good story.

543
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,160
But now I'm a joke.

544
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,950
So I must go back.

545
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,080
I want to find the murderer.

546
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,700
At least I need to know

547
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,550
why this is happening.

548
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,230
But here,

549
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,910
no one remembers me

550
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,410
except you.

551
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:44,890
Wait, Yu.

552
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,110
No, no.

553
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,040
Someone remembers you.

554
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:47,800
Listen.

555
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:48,940
Ayin.

556
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,640
I got you a job.

557
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,670
It's custom-made for you.

558
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,380
The on-site scriptwriter of The Legend of Xiang Qinyu.

559
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,680
Surprised?

560
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,080
Isn't he the one

561
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,540
you've been nagging with me?

562
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,530
When I heard that,

563
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,510
I thought it should be you.

564
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,230
I must recommend you.

565
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,590
Think about it quickly.

566
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,420
Did you hear that?

567
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,770
The Legend of Xiang Qinyu.

568
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,520
Someone wants to film your story.

569
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,290
It's not that no one remembers you here.

570
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,710
You want to film The Legend of Huangpu

571
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,800
because you want people to remember you, right?

572
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,680
You just want people to know you, right?

573
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,930
I can help you.

574
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,860
We'll go to the interview together.

575
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,280
I believe with your help,

576
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,120
we can let people in this era

577
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,910
know the real Xiang Qinyu.

578
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,610
Someone really wants to film my story?

579
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,900
Of course, Yu.

580
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,990
My friend is the planner of this movie.

581
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,340
She won't lie to me.

582
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,340
Besides,

583
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,870
the one I like is the best in the world.

584
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,030
It is worth everyone's attention.

585
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,610
You just want to know who the murderer is, right?

586
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,770
If you jump from here,

587
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,239
there will be nothing left.

588
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,510
Since God sent you here,

589
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,170
it has its purpose.

590
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,610
Maybe

591
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,179
besides fulfilling your dream,

592
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:21,560
you can also find out the truth.

593
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,380
Yu,

594
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,120
trust me.

595
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,219
I will be with you.

596
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,790
Let's finish everything together,

597
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:51,639
OK?

598
00:34:59,260 --> 00:34:59,900
Happy cooperation.

599
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:02,930
Happy cooperation.

600
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:32,590
Let's begin.

601
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:38,990
Chinese University.

602
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,780
Literature Department.

603
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,400
Film University.

604
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,360
Drama major.

605
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,170
Ding Shan Wenyi Picture.

606
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,970
Slitan.

607
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,040
Back from overseas?

608
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,080
Hainan.

609
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,120
Next,

610
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,410
please introduce

611
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,620
what you've written.

612
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,320
I've serialized three novels

613
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,790
in Jianghe Literature.

614
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,250
One of them was adapted into a web drama.

615
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,340
I followed the mentors

616
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,720
and participated the whole process of

617
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,840
Not Wonderful and Don't Be Happy.

618
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,040
Okay.

619
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,320
You are all young and promising.

620
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,470
But what we need to do this time

621
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,440
is a person forgotten by history.

622
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,190
The Legend of Xiang Qinyu.

623
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,690
Do you know why?

624
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,630
Because...

625
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,640
I've investigated.

626
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,390
This person used to be a disciple of Wen Zhen.

627
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,100
You want to make a kungfu film?

628
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:41,700
No.

629
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,070
I've checked, too.

630
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,220
He was in action movies before.

631
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,620
I think the director wants to

632
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,400
show the history of movies then from his perspective.

633
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,220
If I want to study movie history,

634
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,460
I won't choose him.

635
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,530
Xiang Qinyu,

636
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,540
as a pioneer of action movies,

637
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,830
died mysteriously

638
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,120
at a high time.

639
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,820
What did he go through

640
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,460
and why he went down?

641
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,110
Do you know all of these?

642
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,090
I know.

643
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:19,870
I know.

644
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,080
I've watched The Legend of Huangpu.

645
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,500
The Legend of Huangpu?

646
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,720
Yes, I watched it.

647
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,290
My dad used to be a projectionist in the cinema.

648
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,840
It was a coincidence for him

649
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,060
to get a small piece of film from the old market.

650
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,880
Although it was only a few minutes,

651
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,270
I'm sure that's

652
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,470
a movie Xiang Qinyu would devote all his efforts

653
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,520
to making.

654
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,490
It seems that

655
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,090
you know Xiang Qinyu well.

656
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,580
Although I didn't graduate from a prestigious university

657
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,710
or from a related major,

658
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,580
I've always liked Xiang Qinyu.

659
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,700
I know everything

660
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,570
about him.

661
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,620
Little girl,

662
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,620
bragging will hurt yourself.

663
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,560
You can ask whatever you want.

664
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,590
I'll give you the first question.

665
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,290
Why did Xiang Qinyu become an actor?

666
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,210
Money.

667
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:40,940
Because of money.

668
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,190
Yes.

669
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,820
Xiang Qinyu did this for a living.

670
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,520
If it's not for the money,

671
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,980
who would do such a life risking job?

672
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,970
You two.

673
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,280
Promote Chinese kungfu.

674
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,130
Movies are his only love.

675
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:03,720
So,

676
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,450
the second question is

677
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,630
did he say

678
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:08,930
what he likes to do most

679
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,070
in his life?

680
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,950
He likes

681
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,010
reading.

682
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:16,860
No.

683
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,820
Smoking, drinking and having a perm.

684
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,200
You must have heard too many crosstalk.

685
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,720
He's not very famous.

686
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,780
How would I know?

687
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,790
My goodness.

688
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,860
My goodness.

689
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,370
What are you talking about?

690
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,420
I mean...

691
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,590
I mean he likes...

692
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,130
Look in the mirror.

693
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,830
Looking in the mirror.

694
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,720
Stop fooling me.

695
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,590
I'm just kidding.

696
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,970
Just kidding.

697
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,330
One last question.

698
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,140
Why didn't

699
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,840
he get married?

700
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,030
Because...

701
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,040
Because...

702
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,780
Because he...

703
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,340
Because...

704
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,920
He doesn't like women.

705
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,820
He doesn't like women.

706
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:45,160
[You and I didn't have any bonds and everything happens because I spent money.]

707
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:50,160
[Sweet On]

708
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,160
[See You Again]

709
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,150
[Exclusive Post-credits Scene]

710
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,620
It's like frictions

711
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,770
generate electricity.

712
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,150
They have the same nature.

713
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,370
A kite

714
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,190
collected the electricity in the air.

715
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,540
How to get back?
