is to have a wedding night.

00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,050
So,

173
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,210
you insisted on coming to the aquarium.

174
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,780
I've made up my mind.

175
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,370
We'll go wherever we can take photos.

176
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,500
In this way...

177
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,510
In this way, after you leave,

178
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,210
these photos

179
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,730
can prove

180
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,260
that you existed.

181
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,510
I want the whole world to know

182
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,700
you were here.

183
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,700
Let's go.

184
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,780
Later when that hot air balloon stops,

185
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,530
just follow me.

186
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,460
Your posture must be cool.

187
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,380
Act quickly.

188
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,280
Three seconds at most.

189
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,480
You must climb up.

190
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,610
Do you hear me?

191
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,540
Yes.

192
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,530
It's coming.

193
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,670
Why did you take my stuff?

194
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,100
Xiang Qinyu!

195
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,070
Xiang Qinyu!

196
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,230
Xiang Qinyu!

197
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,150
Wait. Someone hasn't come up yet.

198
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,950
Xiang Qinyu!

199
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,490
Xiang Qinyu, where are you?

200
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,190
Xiang Qinyu!

201
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,580
Xiang Qinyu!

202
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,900
Xiang Qin Yu, where are you?

203
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Xiang Qinyu!

204
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,340
Come out! Xiang Qinyu!

205
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,220
Xiang Qinyu!

206
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,030
Xiang Qin Yu, where are you?

207
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,650
Xiang Qinyu!

208
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,480
Xiang Qinyu!

209
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,110
Xiang Qinyu!

210
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,530
Xiang Qinyu!

211
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,730
Just now I saw

212
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,010
this product being sold next to me,

213
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:12,960
so I went to buy it.

214
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,700
The balloon had been activated when I came back.

215
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,700
I'm sorry.

216
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,670
I'm glad you're back.

217
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,600
Alright.

218
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,120
Stop crying.

219
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,070
What are you doing?

220
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,440
Try using the machine.

221
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,810
Stop crying.

222
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,980
You look ugly when you cry.

223
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,260
Annoying.

224
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,020
Are you still crying?

225
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,510
If you still cry, I'll continue taking photos of you.

226
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,740
Don't cry then.

227
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,020
Don't cry.

228
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,740
Let's take photos of fish.

229
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,600
Try it.

230
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,030
Come on.

231
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,670
What are you doing?

232
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,650
I'm thinking

233
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,980
if I fall asleep,

234
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,020
will you suddenly disappear

235
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,380
without saying anything just like today?

236
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,770
That day,

237
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,240
I wasn't joking.

238
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,690
This one

239
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,470
is specially used to tie piglets.

240
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,150
Aren't you afraid of the darkness?

241
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,580
With you around,

242
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,970
I'm not afraid of anything.

243
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,590
What a sweet tongue.

244
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,350
I was talking to the Little Orange Light.

245
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,200
Jin Ayin.

246
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,400
We've promised

247
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,830
we will keep smiling until the last day.

248
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,690
Xiang Qinyu.

249
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,190
What is this?

250
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,500
These

251
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,710
are the things you should take

252
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,290
when you go back.

253
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,780
Let me see.

254
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,930
Not now.

255
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,460
Fine.

256
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,430
Give it back to me. You can't see it.

257
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,940
Give it back! Don't do this!

258
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,900
Give it back!

259
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,880
What's going on?

260
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,700
Take them when you go back.

261
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,120
Maybe

262
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,220
my works

263
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,100
can

264
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,800
affect the development of Chinese film history.

265
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,120
Then what about this?

266
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,780
What?

267
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,700
Is it not delicious?

268
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,860
What about this?

269
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,080
Since

270
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,670
you could come here for the first time,

271
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,990
there will be a second and a third time.

272
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,500
Take it when you go back.

273
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,050
It might be useful.

274
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,900
Anyway, from now on,

275
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,420
this bag

276
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,740
has to stay with you.

277
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,900
Make sure nothing goes wrong with it.

278
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,260
No.

279
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,660
No.

280
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,140
Alright.

281
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,180
Satisfied?

282
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,880
Don't lose it.

283
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,520
All this time,

284
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,220
I've had no idea what time means

285
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,500
to me.

286
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,380
When I was a child,

287
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,300
in that dark room,

288
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,650
I spent countless days and nights there,

289
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,250
and time seemed to pass slowly.

290
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,430
What's wrong?

291
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,390
Nothing.

292
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,250
After I grew up,

293
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,380
no matter what I do,

294
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,290
time seems to stop and go from time to time.

295
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,690
Xiang Qinyu.

296
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,370
I'm here.

297
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,380
Xiang Qinyu.

298
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:44,430
I'm here.

299
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,420
Let's eat.

300
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,070
Sit down. I'll go.

301
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,540
I'll go...

302
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,730
to the toilet.

303
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,470
Where are you going?

304
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,500
Wait.

305
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,860
I'm going, too.

306
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,560
Don't worry.

307
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,460
Before I disappear,

308
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,910
I will shout,

309
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,320
"Jin Ayin!"

310
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,120
"Help me, Jin Ayin!"

311
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,710
So no matter how far you are,

312
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,740
when you hear me scream for help,

313
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,500
come to me immediately.

314
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:06,820
Got it?

315
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,690
Don't worry.

316
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,190
Later,

317
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,680
I'll take you to a place.

318
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,540
Have we arrived?

319
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,340
Almost there.

320
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,180
We've arrived.

321
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:10,870
We've arrived.

322
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,900
Where is this?

323
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,040
It's for you.

324
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,730
It's for me?

325
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,500
If one day

326
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,310
I become a millionaire,

327
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,620
I'll buy an apartment

328
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,430
in that tall building over there.

329
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,990
Every day when I come home and push the door open,

330
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,830
I can smell

331
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,020
the fragrance of gardenia.

332
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,280
How come it's so expensive to buy an apartment now?

333
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,660
So,

334
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,090
I can only fulfill half of your wish for the time being.

335
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,860
The most...

336
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,410
The most important thing is that

337
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,410
there must be

338
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,780
a big floor-to-ceiling window.

339
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:55,760
In this way,

340
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,830
when I open the curtains,

341
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,310
I can see

342
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,560
the brightest TV tower in the center of the city.

343
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,670
Actually, I bought this apartment a long time ago.

344
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,040
But luckily,

345
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,380
before I leave,

346
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,220
it's ready.

347
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,700
After I leave,

348
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,570
just move in.

349
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,070
Move to a different environment,

350
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,930
and start a new life.

351
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:13,760
Promise me.

352
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,210
Don't be afraid.

353
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,470
Don't be too sad.

354
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,820
Xiang Qinyu.

355
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,310
After you go back,

356
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,430
you must live well.

357
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,200
When you're alone,

358
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,800
don't do anything dangerous.

359
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,130
Stay healthy.

360
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,930
The longer you live, the better.

361
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,030
We will definitely meet again.

362
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,020
Right?

363
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,000
I promise you.

364
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,390
I will live well,

365
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:22,890
and then come to see you.

366
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,920
You must be sleepy.

367
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,030
How could you fall asleep like that?

368
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,470
Why didn't you wake me up?

369
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,090
You...

370
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,870
decorated that apartment so well.

371
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,020
So,

372
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,660
you started to do those things

373
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,850
secretly for me long ago, right?

374
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,980
You started to have a crush on me long ago, right?

375
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,060
Yes.

376
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,330
It's so ugly.

377
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,800
Don't move.

378
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,180
Just because it's ugly,

379
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,730
it's necessary to cover it up more.

380
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,420
What do you know?

381
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,070
I'm such a cute person.

382
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,350
Everybody likes me.

383
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,330
Don't move.

384
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,460
How about this?

385
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,890
I'll buy you a cup of coffee

386
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,700
to warm your body,

387
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,040
and help you refresh yourself.

388
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,670
Xiang Qinyu.

389
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,200
Don't worry.

390
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,300
I'll be right back.

391
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,890
Sir, your coffee.

392
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,950
Cash?

393
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,520
Wait a moment.

394
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,300
Sir, your change.

395
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,739
I've thought for countless times

396
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,210
about how we'll get separated,

397
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,260
and envisaged lots of words

398
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,800
which I'm going to say to Jin Ayin.

399
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,870
But when this moment really comes,

400
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,940
I find that I still don't want her

401
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,440
to see me disappear with her own eyes.

402
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,240
The sadder the scene is,

403
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,320
to her,

404
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,350
the harder it'll be to forget me.

405
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
I'm sorry, Ayin.

406
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,160
I think once again, I have to give up

407
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,230
letting you stand by my side.

408
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,870
Help!

409
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,820
Help!

410
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,570
Jin Ayin.

411
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,100
I like you.

00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,420
