176
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,000
Are you okay? I'll go with you.

177
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,530
No, I'm fine.

178
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,740
When our project starts,

179
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,940
I will invite you all.

180
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,520
Ms. Mu is extraordinary.

181
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,450
Thank you.

182
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,920
Old pervert.

183
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,160
Mumu.

184
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,340
It's you again.

185
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,100
Anything else?

186
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,600
I think

187
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,170
I might not have expressed my story.

188
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,860
Can you hear me out?

189
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,260
Sorry, I have something to do.

190
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,580
Two minutes.

191
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,710
Just two minutes.

192
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,860
I used to be a ghostwriter.

193
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,430
I always write

194
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,290
what others asked me to write.

195
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,020
I thought

196
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,660
I had no interest in writing.

197
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,570
What are you trying to say?

198
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,190
What I want to say is

199
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,780
I'm very sincere about

200
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,310
what I wrote this time.

201
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,680
I'm confident.

202
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,250
Someone once told me

203
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,740
"I don't compete with others for anything,

204
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,150
but if something belongs to me,

205
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,580
I'll never give in."

206
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,410
Only when I believe in myself

207
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,490
can others believe me.

208
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,600
When necessary,

209
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,830
we should stick to it

210
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,020
and fight for it.

211
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,890
Every week,

212
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,880
I heard the same thing from screenwriters.

213
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,060
But

214
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,820
I like one sentence you just said.

215
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,180
If I have time,

216
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,970
I'll read your story again.

217
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,590
Thank you, Mumu.

218
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,290
Also,

219
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,390
keep it a secret.

220
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:03,920
Yu,

221
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,070
you have to learn to take care of yourself.

222
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,750
You can't stay up late.

223
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,550
Go home when you have time.

224
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,770
I'll cook something delicious for you.

225
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,380
Well,

226
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,340
I'll stay with Li Longda for a few days.

227
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,030
Okay.

228
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,250
As long as you are happy and safe,

229
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,180
whatever you want.

230
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,510
Your dad may be stubborn,

231
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,590
but he cares about you.

232
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,350
We got this from the police.

233
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,240
I was afraid there might be something important here,

234
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,610
so I brought it to you.

235
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:44,880
Also,

236
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,380
this watch

237
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,900
is for you.

238
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,820
Young people nowadays

239
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,910
wear this.

240
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,300
It has positioning function.

241
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,630
You must wear it

242
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,340
so that we can know where you are.

243
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,990
And I will be relieved.

244
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,250
I'm leaving.

245
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,620
Come home when you have time.

246
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,190
Come home.

247
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,020
Li Longda.

248
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,510
I'll wait for you at the door.

249
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,910
Isn't this Chi Yu?

250
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,700
The tailor makes the man.

251
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,660
You're a superstar now.

252
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,520
It's really different.

253
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,390
Ayin, where are you going?

254
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,140
Let me give you a ride.

255
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,900
Sure.

256
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,340
Let's go.

257
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,740
No, thanks.

258
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,300
I'll go back by myself.

259
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,420
Drive.

260
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,380
Go.

261
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,760
We're leaving.

262
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,540
Bye.

263
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,740
Ayin.

264
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,030
What happened?

265
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,860
Tell me now.

266
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,090
He suddenly changed his attitude

267
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,270
and swiped your card secretly.

268
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,430
He even spoke ill of you.

269
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,400
That's weird.

270
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,020
I was wondering why the atmosphere wasn't right.

271
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,060
It's totally different from

272
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,650
when I met Chi Yu at your house.

273
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,210
Exactly.

274
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,500
When he walked into the meeting room,

275
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,510
I was shocked.

276
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,930
Look at you.

277
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,130
You look like you've lost your soul.

278
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,760
Do you think

279
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,510
there is any misunderstanding?

280
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,220
Because

281
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,380
he apologized to me

282
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:18,860
and

283
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,510
gave me this tie clip back.

284
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:22,940
He must

285
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,640
have some reasons.

286
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,000
He is bullying you.

287
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,420
Why are you still defending him?

288
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,200
Don't look.

289
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,170
Da Ye.

290
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,260
I feel bad.

291
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,610
I know you feel bad.

292
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,000
But you have to listen to me.

293
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,810
There're so many men.

294
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,550
We'll find a new one.

295
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,510
People who make you sad and cry

296
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,820
are not good.

297
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,250
Giving you up is his loss.

298
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,350
He was blind.

299
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,900
No matter how good love is, it's not as good as money.

300
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,380
As long as it affects your earning speed,

301
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,990
it's not a good thing.

302
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,230
You're right.

303
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,390
Addiction to love

304
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,950
affects my career.

305
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,860
From tomorrow onwards,

306
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,010
I will burn myself.

307
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:38,990
No.

308
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,470
I want to exhaust myself.

309
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,220
That's my last orange.

310
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,630
I also want to make it into a small orange lamp.

311
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,020
Hello, everyone.

312
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,280
I'm

313
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:21,730
Chi Yu.

314
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,140
I want to say something to someone who's waiting for me.

315
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,610
You'll look forward to seeing me again.

316
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,700
Chi Yu.

317
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,360
[Nan Sheng Martial Arts Center]

318
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,430
You guys

319
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,460
have to force your wrists.

320
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,650
Did you see that?

321
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:50,690
Look carefully.

322
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,610
A martial arts practitioner

323
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,740
can enter the film industry

324
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,550
and achieve something.

325
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,070
I'm proud of you.

326
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,250
It's just

327
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,060
your senior fellow apprentice

328
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,380
is too reckless.

329
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,030
I'm afraid it'll cause you trouble

330
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,860
if he performs with you.

331
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,910
Senior fellow apprentice wants to achieve his career

332
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,860
so that you can agree to his marriage with junior sister apprentice.

333
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,160
What's going on?

334
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,090
Can you do it?

335
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:26,600
Look.

336
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,960
He's out at such a young age.

337
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,560
He was beaten all day

338
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,660
just for a few coins.

339
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,230
It's just like when you left home

340
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,500
and first came to my sect.

341
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,820
Give me the sword.

342
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,460
Try it.

343
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,370
Your shoulders are loose.

344
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,680
Straighten your right shoulder.

345
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,180
The sword is light.

346

You have to avoid the solid

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,720
and dodge with your body.

348
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,500
Try again.

349
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,140
What's your name?

350
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,190
Husheng.

351
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,150
Di husheng.

352
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,780
Follow me tomorrow.

353
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,100
There's a water play.

354
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,440
Two services for one job.

355
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,490
Thank you, Yu.

356
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,380
Stop.

357
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,220
Not bad.

358
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,160
Mr. Di.

359
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,900
Thank you.

360
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,980
OK. Change the scene. Get ready.

361
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,560
Hurry up.

362
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,460
It's amazing.

363
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,490
It's really amazing

364
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,540
to see the old scenes

365
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,030
in the play.

366
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,130
Yes.

367
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,850
If it weren't for Yu,

368
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,500
I wouldn't have had such achievements.

369
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,180
You were the one who worked hard.

370
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,900
Xiang Qinyu

371
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,420
tumbled

372
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,410
and jumped into the lake.

373
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,990
Junior sister apprentice said...

374
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,500
This move...

375
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,830
What is this move called?

376
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,020
I want to ask you. too.

377
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,680
Mr. Chi, where in the world did you learn the stance?

378
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,350
You're so good.

379
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,090
Tell me.

380
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,780
Chi Yu.

381
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,400
Chi Yu, you were amazing!

382
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,980
With a whoosh and a wow...

383
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,400
When did you practice?

384
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,950
-A big boy has grown into a big man.
- You're too kind.

385
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,740
Let's go. I'll take you there to rest.

386
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,560
I bought you a new chair.

387
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,710
Try to see if it is comfortable.

388
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,170
Thank you.

389
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:02,850
Xiaoxiao.

390
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,900
Bring me the fruits.

391
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,420
Okay.

392
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,050
Try it.

393
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,710
You can adjust it.

394
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,460
It's quite comfortable.

395
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:15,770
Not bad, right?

396
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:16,870
Not bad.

397
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:23,910
Said

398
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,520
"Xiang Qinyu.

399
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,900
You are ungrateful

400
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,360
and heartless."

401
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,400
So Chi Yu has become the leading man?

402
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,310
What about Li Longda?

403
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,460
The supporting actor.

404
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,460
He's the senior fellow apprentice.

405
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,430
The male lead becomes the supporting actor.

406
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,500
Phoenix becomes crow.

407
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,220
That's fate.

408
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,230
Money is not

409
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,800
as effective as brain.

410
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,280
I'm 26 years old this year.

411
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,310
I spent my family money to buy roles.

412
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,540
But even so,

413
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,530
I've never played the leading actor.

414
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,550
Maybe I'm really stupid.

415
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,110
Don't listen to them.

416
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,940
As the saying goes,

417
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,680
there are only insignificant characters,

418
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,060
but no insignificant actors.

419
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,750
Many people are good at acting.

420
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,140
But not everyone can be the leading actor.

421
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,200
Look at me.

422
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,920
I'm just a screenwriter.

423
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,330
I have to change

424
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,360
according to others' requirements.

425
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,410
But

426
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,820
it can't affect my passion of writing.

427
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,410
Don't worry.

428
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,420
You have me.

429
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,830
I'll work hard on your role

430
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,420
and make you the supporting actor more dazzling.

431
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,060
As long as we work hard together,

432
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:54,570
Together...

433
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,010
Hang it up.

434
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,770
It doesn't look good hanging up.

435
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,520
Come on.

436
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,610
It happens when the supporting actor

437
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,110
is more attractive

438
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,370
It is not uncommon for things

439
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,390
to be more appealing to fans.

440
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:08,980
OK.

441
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,850
Can you do it?

442
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,580
Of course I can.

443
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,860
This little boy plays very well.

444
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,000
Longda.

445
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,590
Go back to work.

446
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,070
I'm inspired.

447
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,220
I need to work on my script.

448
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,460
Ayin.

449
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,680
Wait!

450
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,120
Hello, Biao.

451
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,420
Take all the things in my car down.

452
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,580
Yes, all of them.

453
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,850
What do you think?

454
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,450
This will be your workplace from now on.

455
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,210
Thanks. Thanks.

456
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,740
Have some tea.

457
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,690
After that,

458
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,610
do something big.

459
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,660
Longda.

460
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,510
This...

461
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,890
This is where actors rest.

462
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,900
It's inappropriate for me to sit here.

463
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,010
What's so inappropriate about that? I'm leaving now.

464
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:35,990
Wait.

465
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,140
Sit down.

466
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,780
Sit down.

467
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,980
Sit down.

468
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,860
Why not?

469
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,150
A good creator

470
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,220
should have such a good environment.

471
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,150
I write

472
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,300
your character.

473
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,570
That's my duty.

474
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,640
That's what I should do.

475
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,370
It's not because of this.

476
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,260
Not because of this?

477
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,310
You may not know me well.

478
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,990
I really can't afford to support you.

479
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:12,960
So you...

480
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,910
don't need to please me like this.

481
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,370
It's not because of this.

482
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,400
I just...

483
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,530
I just think you're nice.

484
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,620
You...

485
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,500
Don't praise me like that.

486
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,840
It's okay.

487
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,910
Come on, be quick.

488
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,620
Water.

489
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,260
Have some dragon fruit.

490
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,500
Eat more dragon fruit to replenish water.

491
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,200
Come on, eat another one.

492
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,880
I'll do it myself.

493
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,580
I'll do it myself.

494
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,220
It's almost done.

495
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,870
When did he

496
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,100
start paying attention to our screenwriter?

497
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,050
Are they together?

498
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,100
Impossible.

499
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,060
I mean, she...

500
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,800
she won't like him.

501
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,570
Not necessarily.

502
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,700
What kind of girl

503
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,310
can refuse a dandy like Li Longda?

504
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,610
Look at him.

505
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,670
What is a dandy?

506
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,100
Well,

507
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,610
the one who dates a lot girls

508
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,680
instead of one.

509
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,590
In our hometown,

510
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,540
it's called an unseemly rascal.

511
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:06,760
Ayin.

512
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,140
I'll take two days off this weekend.

513
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,250
If you're almost done,

514
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,170
I'll take you out to play.

515
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,350
I...

516
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,540
This museum

517
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,050
has a weekend market

518
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,460
and a wish-granting event.

519
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,080
Isn't it beautiful?

520
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,240
I'm not going.

521
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,500
Why?

522
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,580
Rich people have free time.

523
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,020
If I have time,

524
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,830
I'd rather make money.

525
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:30,900
No.

526
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,340
Let me tell you.

527
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,990
There are many interesting things inside.

528
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,550
I heard

529
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,900
making a wish there is especially efficacious.

530
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,480
As long as you put your wish up,

531
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,400
your wish will come true.

532
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,430
I...

533
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,060
Li Longda.

534
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,230
Get me a cup of coffee.

535
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,590
Biao!

536
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:56,830
Biao!

537
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,510
Coming.

538
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,090
Get him a drink.

539
00:27:59,280 --> 00:27:59,680
Okay.

540
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,600
I want coffee.

541
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,920
Get him some coffee.

542
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:07,760
Okay.

543
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,910
You go buy it for me.

544
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,030
Thank you.

545
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,170
You have hands and feet.

546
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,240
Buy coffee if you want.

547
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,580
It's okay.

548
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,550
Chi Yu wants coffee.

549
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,350
I'll buy it for him.

550
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:22,800
Chi Yu.

551
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,980
What are you doing here?

552
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,020
Come here.

553
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,820
What are you pulling me for?

554
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,100
-I have something to tell you.
-I have work to do.

555
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,130
Look at you

556
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,480
laughing like that.

557
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,950
Is that how you work?

558
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,510
What's it to you?

559
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,540
Didn't you say

560
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,900
you will play Chi Yu and the drama well

561
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,150
and you want me to stay away from you?

562
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,000
What's this about?

563
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,030
I told you to stay away from me.

564
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,530
But you have to figure it out yourself.

565
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,090
He is very scheming.

566
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,140
He's not a good person.

567
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,680
I think he's good.

568
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,380
At least others dare to be themselves.

569
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,340
What about you?

570
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,660
Chi Yu.

571
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,870
Jin Ayin, let me remind you.

572
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,980
A playboy like him

573
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,310
must have seduced many girls.

574
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,730
I'd love to.

575
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,290
Jin Ayin.

576
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,140
He is degrading you with material things.

577
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,110
to make you a soul-less woman.

578
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,200
Wait.

579
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,440
I don't like it when you say that.

580
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,480
It's none of your business whether I have a soul or not.

581
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,990
Who do you think you are?

582
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,870
Get back to work.

583
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,400
Calm down.

584
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,080
Come on.

585
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,040
Have some water.

586
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,920
Chi Yu didn't mean that.

587
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,860
Chi Yu.

588
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,060
Ayin took revenge for me because she cared about me.

589
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:57,690
Right?

590
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,350
Took revenge for you?

591
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,070
Why should she?

592
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,620
You...

593
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,020
You what?

594
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,810
I've put up with you for a long time.

595
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,820
You think everyone is easy to bully, right?

596
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,830
Wipe it.

597
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,400
Xixi.

598
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,180
These two

599
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,300
had internal strife.

600
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,320
You really don't know men.

601
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,810
Are you alright?

602
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,090
Ayin, don't be angry.

603
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,170
You're wet.

604
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,020
How about

605
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,060
get changed in my room?

606
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,780
Longda.

607
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,930
I'm sorry.

608
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,480
What are you sorry for?

609
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,620
It's not my first time meeting Chi Yu.

610
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,380
He's stubborn.

611
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,720
He has no bad intentions.

612
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,170
He's not.

613
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,180
A liar full of lies.

614
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,550
If you feel bad,

615
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,460
let's go to the ancient town in a few days.

616
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:29,960
Well,

617
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,440
go inside and get changed.

618
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,530
I have a new white T-shirt on that hanger.

619
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:34,880
I'll go

620
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,020
see the scene.

621
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,810
I'm so unlucky.

622
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,990

623
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500

624
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,320
I'm sorry.

625
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,200
It's here.

626

it's my baby's makeup...

629
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,860
So you...

630
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,220
