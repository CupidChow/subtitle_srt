Xiang Qinyu!

Jin Ayin.

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,530
Xiang Qinyu!

7
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,790
Why did this happen?

8
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,760
Mom!

9
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,329
Mom!

00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,740
Mom!

Xiang Qinyu.

15
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,060
I'm dead.

16
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,560
Right?

17
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:52,470
These are all illusions.

18
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,409
Is it different from what you think?

19
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,630
No.

20
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,590
Come with me.

21
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,170
Your life was over long ago

22
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,570
when you got shot.

23
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,760
You can't stay here.

24
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,180
Chi Yu, hang in there! Chi Yu!

25
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,780
Hurry! Come and help! Hurry!

26
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,620
Xiang Qinyu, don't go!

27
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,409
What's wrong?

28
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,060
Nothing.

29
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,710
Speaking of it,

30
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,420
I still owe you an apology.

31
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,760
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,860
It's okay.

33
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,700
For me,

34
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,870
it doesn't matter anymore.

35
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:00,900
I know.

36
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,010
But for me, this is

37
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,070
very important.

38
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,940
There's something

39
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,210
I haven't finished for her.

40
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,010
Didn't you say

41
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,590
it didn't matter anymore no matter how it was?

42
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,210
I thought

43
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,400
it was not too late.

44
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,470
Don't look back.

45
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,820
It's too late.

46
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,220
We can't turn back.

47
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,390
Not everyone

48
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,600
can have no regrets with his beloved one.

49
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,810
You're just one of the ordinary people in the world

50
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,220
who have no chance.

51
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,080
Come with me.

52
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,260
Go where we should go.

53
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,060
Xiang Qinyu!

54
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,910
Xiang Qinyu!

55
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,600
Xiang Qinyu!

56
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,530
Xiang Qinyu!

57
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,250
Ma Zehao!

58
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,030
Hurry! Catch him!

59
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,430
Xiang Qinyu!

60
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,420
Chi Yu, hang in there! Chi Yu!

61
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:38,960
Are you okay?

62
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,039
I'm sorry.

63
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,419
Let me take you to the hospital.

64
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,860
Why is he bleeding so much?

65
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,600
Taotao.

66
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,120
I'm here.

67
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,510
I'm sorry.

68
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:42,870
I'm sorry.

69
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,750
Taotao, don't be afraid.

70
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,380
Follow me.

71
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,250
Keep riding forward.

72
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,980
You're awake.

73
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,890
You're finally awake.

74
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,880
God said I owe you too much money

75
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,210
and asked me to come back to repay it.

76
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,200
You really scared me.

77
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,660
I can't breathe.

78
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,080
Doctor!

79
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,480
Why am I alright?

80
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,200
I don't know, either.

81
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,670
It's too late.

82
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,830
You can't stay here.

83
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,300
Xiang Qinyu, don't go!

84
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,480
This is

85
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,540
really a miracle.

86
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,660
It was such a big explosion.

87
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,650
He didn't even get burned.

88
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,570
So...

89
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,920
everything is over.

90
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:25,890
It's over.

91
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,420
The past

92
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,370
has become the past.

93
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,850
No matter what you owed before,

94
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:34,860
now,

95
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,680
everything has been paid off.

96
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,340
No.

97
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:43,970
You still have this.

98
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,560
Xiang Qinyu.

99
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,130
Since

100
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,240
you escaped from death this time,

101
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,540
does it mean

102
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,990
you don't have to leave anymore?

103
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,150
You don't have to leave anymore.

104
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,420
You really don't have to leave anymore, right?

105
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,680
Your life was over long ago

106
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,100
when you got shot.

107
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,610
You can't stay here.

108
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:29,990
I won't leave.

109
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,300
Come in.

110
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:13,700
Sit.

111
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,530
I've asked you to come because I want to tell you something.

112
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,480
I'm leaving the Jianghe Studios.

113
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,190
I've heard about it.

114
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,920
Because of me,

115
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,430
after I leave,

116
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,170
the project of Troublesome Old Idols

117
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,090
will be suspended.

118
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,120
And your contract with the Jianghe Studios

119
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,060
is also undergoing the process for breach of contract.

120
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,500
I'm sorry.

121
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,290
I understand.

122
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,280
But after I leave this company this time, I'll start my own business outside.

123
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,490
So if you want it,

124
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,460
you can come to me with your scripts.

125
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,030
This contract shows my promise to you.

126
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,180
The pay might not be as good as that of the Jianghe Studios.

127
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,790
[Screenwriter Agreement]

128
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,790
But I'll try my best to give you the best conditions.

129
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,950
You don't have to rush to give me the answer.

130
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:56,970
You can consider it.

131
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,000
Miss Mumu,

132
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,860
do you

133
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,770
help me

134
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,010
because of Jin Chuan?

135
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,430
I haven't personally told you

136
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,930
about the relationship between Jin Chuan and me.

137
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,170
I'm sorry.

138
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,900
But if there's a chance,

139
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,200
please tell him this for me.

140
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,130
I'm very grateful

141
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,570
for the memory he gave me.

142
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,750
I'll always keep it in my mind.

143
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,940
Can I

144
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,490
ask you in private

145
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,270
about the reason?

146
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,180
Everyone

147
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,840
has many experiences in their life,

148
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,280
and will meet all kinds of people.

149
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,230
I don't think

150
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,910
anyone's life

151
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,720
should stop because of

152
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,820
making compromises for others.

153
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,830
It's the same to Jin Chuan.

154
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,630
Even in the name of love,

155
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,180
I don't want him

156
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
to give up his life

157
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,140
for others.

158
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,760
So, similarly,

159
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,160
I've chosen you

160
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,650
because you're suitable.

161
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,500
It has nothing to do with Jin Chuan.

162
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,770
Thank you, Miss Mumu.

163
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,060
Then,

164
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,130
I have to go.

165
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,340
Think about it carefully.

166
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:26,920
Come in.

167
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,780
What is it?

168
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,350
It's Teng Xi.

169
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,790
She informed the company yesterday that she wanted to terminate the contract.

170
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,250
Did she tell you why?

171
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,970
She said she wanted to go out for a journey.

172
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,350
Who knows?

173
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,820
For the termination of her contract,

174
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,070
Teng Xi wrote several versions of the notice herself.

175
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,660
However, Mr. Wu is not here.

176
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,540
It's hard for us to make a decision.

177
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,500
So please read it,

178
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,110
and suggest which views are more suitable?

179
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,260
Give it to me.

180
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,570
Miss Mumu.

181
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,410
I'm sorry.

182
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,380
You're leaving,

183
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,870
but I still came to bother you.

184
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:07,970
It's okay.

185
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,370
Go back to work.

186
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:09,950
Let me read it.

187
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,480
[All rivers run into sea. When you come back, you're still the same young man.]

188
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:41,900
Thank you.

189
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,590
You're welcome.

190
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,560
Why did you suddenly decide to leave?

191
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,060
Because I hate you.

192
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,860
Good.

193
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,410
I also hate you

194
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,590
for being so emotional on your decision.

195
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,800
Choose the fourth version.

196
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,480
It suits your image.

197
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,900
Actually, I wrote it for you on purpose.

198
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,680
Do you think I care?

199
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:36,860
By the way,

200
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,210
I'm leaving Jianghe Studios.

201
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,520
I'll do projects myself.

202
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,670
If you come back a few years later,

203
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,820
and find that there's no movie for you,

204
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,070
you can come to me.

205
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,150
After all, for a not very famous star like you,

206
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,840
after you leave for a few years,

207
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,800
it's easy for you to be forgotten by the audience.

208
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,480
Okay.

209
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,150
But

210
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,860
you have to give me the highest pay.

211
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,350
Take good care of yourself after you leave.

212
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,100
Mumu.

213
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,510
Will you regret it?

214
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,580
Actually, I've always known that

215
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,520
I can't be as brave as you.

216
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,110
But for someone like me,

217
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,420
after I make a choice,

218
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,100
even if I might have regrets,

219
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,090
I will accept it.

220
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,430
♫When you first told me your name♫

221
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,250
♫I didn't hear a word you said♫

222
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,900
♫Bet it was written on my face♫

223
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,880
♫Should've known it was you I would love until the end♫

224
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,980
♫When you made it down the aisle♫

225
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,790
♫Every moment stole my breath♫

226
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:37,640
Mumu.

227
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,190
♫Bet you could see it in my smile♫

228
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:48,750
♫Should've known it was you I would love until the end♫

229
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:05,730
Are you ready?

230
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,370
What's the rush? It's still early.

231
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,260
I asked to meet at 2 p.m.

232
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,740
If you're late again,

233
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,460
I don't know what I'll do.

234
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,490
You're getting more and more presumptuous.

235
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,380
Alright. Hurry up.

236
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,350
How dare you hang up on me?

237
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,170
You're just one of the ordinary people in the world

238
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,680
who have no chance.

239
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,310
Your life was over long ago

240
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,860
when you got shot.

241
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,820
Come with me.

242
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,840
Let's go where we should go.

243
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,500
Sorry.

244
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,950
The number you dialed is not available.

245
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,200
No, Xiang Qinyu.

246
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,570
I thought after I met you,

247
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,000
no matter what strange things I encountered,

248
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,310
I wouldn't be surprised.

249
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,960
Maybe

250
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,010
I came back this time

251
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,790
just to let me finish the things

252
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,290
what I hadn't finished.

253
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,380
What about Ayin?

254
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,600
I can't tell her yet.

255
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,270
I'm here to ask you for help.

256
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,420
I won't help you.

257
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,030
If you have anything to say,

258
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,220
you should stay and tell her yourself.

259
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,740
When I go back,

260
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,870
I don't know whether I'll be alive or dead.

261
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,480
After I leave,

262
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,400
please visit Ayin often.

263
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,510
Ask her to forget about me,

264
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,460
and start a new life.

265
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,210
Jin Ayin is still the same.

266
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,230
She'll be fine as time goes by.

267
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,030
Longda.

268
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,850
You're the only one I can ask for help.

269
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,780
Take care. Bye.

270
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:36,890
Bye.

271
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,270
Ms. Jin, will your boyfriend still come here?

272
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,050
Our photographer will be off work soon.

273
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,190
Yes, he will come.

274
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,500
Okay.

275
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,100
I'll ask the photographer to wait a little longer.

276
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,420
But he can't wait too long.

277
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,210
Thank you.

278
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,070
How much time do you have?

279
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,060
I...

280
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,850
don't have the experience you've had.

281
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,550
I can't do what you did.

282
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:26,970
I don't even know

283
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,640
what is waiting for you.

284
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,740
But Xiang Qinyu,

285
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,200
do you really love her?

286
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,490
I wonder

287
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,430
whether it's because we're from different eras

288
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,940
that we think differently.

289
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,780
Do you think this is for her own good?

290
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,790
Why do you

291
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,060
always decide everything on your own?

292
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,750
Have you ever thought

293
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,820
that after you leave,

294
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,570
she will keep regretting it?

295
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,440
She'll regret not saying goodbye to you properly,

296
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,380
and not finishing the things she wants to do.

297
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,280
Do you think

298
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,940
she can start a new life like that?

299
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,270
Don't find excuses for your evasion.

300
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,180
If you want her to start a new life,

301
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,220
you should give her an ending where there is no regret.

302
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,130
I think, sometimes,

303
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,700
you don't understand her at all.

304
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,420
-You're still here? -Are you closing the shop?

305
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,080
It's beyond our working time now.

306
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,520
I haven't taken the photos yet.

307
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,070
Miss, what time is it now?

308
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,920
But it was not easy for me to arrange this.

309
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:02,710
Well,

310
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,230
if we can't take the photos today,

311
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,410
when can we do it?

312
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,170
There are too many reservations.

313
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,480
You can only reserve it again some time later.

314
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,230
I'm sorry. I'm off work.

315
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,720
Thank you.

316
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,260
Ayin.

317
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,380
What took you so long?

318
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,790
Why are you always late at the critical moment?

319
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,220
Why are you dressed like this?

320
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,340
I...

321
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,660
I forgot to close the window last night before I went to sleep.

322
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:19,920
I've caught a cold.

323
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,150
I feel cold so I wear more clothes.

324
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,450
Look. The traffic jam is so serious now.

325
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,170
I left home a bit late,

326
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,210
and I've been stuck in the traffic till now.

327
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,120
I should have taken the underground train.

328
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,480
Ayin!

329
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,460
Ayin, don't go!

330
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,300
No!

331
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,200
Ayin.

332
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,270
I'm sorry.

333
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,170
It won't happen again.

334
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,490
I promise.

335
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,060
Please forgive me.

336
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,020
Little Ayin.

337
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,390
Our reservation is full.

338
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,540
Sorry, madam.

339
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,630
I've asked five shops about it.

340
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,760
Look.

341
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,430
The photo you want.

342
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,210
I'll ask other shops about it.

343
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,190
I don't believe I can't make it.

344
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,100
I think, sometimes,

345
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,420
you don't understand Jin Ayin at all.

346
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,480
But I hope

347
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,699
you can tell her this yourself.

348
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,600
The earliest booking is next week, right?

349
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,370
Okay.

350
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,590
Wait a minute. I'll write it down.

351
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:42,760
Go ahead.

352
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,429
Okay. Thank you.

353
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,040
I advise you not to go too far.

354
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:42,760
Xiang Qinyu.

355
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,150
Are you going to leave without saying goodbye again?

356
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,110
Being with you is really tiring.

357
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,530
You would hide it from me

358
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,600
for a certain reason every time.

359
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,190
You thought you were protecting me.

360
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,330
Can you trust me for once

361
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,110
by not underestimating my determination?

362
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,380
I don't need your protection.

363
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,240
No matter what happens,

364
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,950
I just want to stand with you.

365
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,790
If leaving without saying goodbye

366
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,810
is the end you want...

367
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,740
Fine.

368
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,410
I accept it.

369
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,920
Leave.

370
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,070
I won't leave.

371
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:00,740
Ayin.

372
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,340
I'm sorry.

373
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,010
It's my fault.

374
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,230
At first, I thought I had to leave anyway,

375
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,540
so the later you know, the better.

376
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,590
♫Every frame and second in front of the camera♫

377
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,930
That's why I kept it from you.

378
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,220
Now I understand it.

379
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,080
♫I try to find your mark♫

380

experience it together.

384
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,120
♫It makes time and space reverse♫

385

Xiang Qinyu.

00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,960
Xiang Qinyu!

406
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,540
Xiang Qinyu!

407
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,150
Xiang Qinyu!

408
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,730
Xiang Qinyu.

409
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,350
Answer the phone.

410
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,130
Xiang Qinyu, answer the phone.

411
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,220
Xiang Qinyu!

412
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,370
What?

413
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,390
Sorry.

414
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,660
Xiang Qinyu!

415
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,730
I'm sorry.

416
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,660
Hello, Longda.

417
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,920
Did Xiang Qinyu contact you?

418
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:11,940
No.

419
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:12,840
What happened?

420
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,290
I'll contact you in a few days.

421
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,380
Didn't we promise

422
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,190
to face it together?

423
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,340
You still left me behind in the end.

424
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,460
Ayin?

425
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:03,970
Why are you here?

426
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,330
Did you see Chi Yu?

427
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,740
Chi Yu?

428
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,560
Did he bully you?

429
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,700
Why didn't

430
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,180
you just stick yourself to him?

431
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,610
He's missing for a while and it's as if the sky had collapsed.

432
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,070
I also wish that I could stick myself to him

433
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,650
so that he can't get rid of me.

434
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:31,660
Enough.

435
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,630
Stop disgusting me

436
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,320
who has been single all the time.

437
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:39,570
Ye.

438
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,490
Why do you think

439
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,770
in this world,

440
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,100
most of the things

441
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,530
do not go as we wish?

442
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,810
The things you like

443
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,930
would disappear.

444
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,560
The person you like

445
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,100
can't stay.

446
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,650
What are you talking about?

447
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,370
Nothing.

448
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,690
I just

449
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,630
suddenly thought of a plot of the Troublesome Old Idols.

450
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,410
Miss Mumu said

451
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,460
for the ending,

452
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,880
the male lead should go back to

453
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,130
the place where he used to live.

454
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,110
I think she's right.

455
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,440
But

456
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,240
will the people

457
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,140
he has met in the world

458
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,820
really want him to leave?

459
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,390
Haven't you changed the ending already?

460
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:52,130
Ayin,

461
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,630
why do I feel

462
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,700
you're weird today?

463
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,780
What you said is weird, too.

464
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,350
I don't know what you were talking about.

465
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,730
I just think that

466
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,790
much of the time,

467
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,290
even if we are ready,

468
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,000
it is

469
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,240
not as easy as

470
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:23,190
we've imagined to accept it.

471
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,370
But what can we do?

472
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,080
We can only

473
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,000
accept it with a smile.

474
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,060
Wangcai,

475
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:47,980
turn on the light.

476
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,620
Okay.

477
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,540
Why didn't you answer my call?

478
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,920
Where have you been?

479
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,460
Do you know I've been looking for you all day?

480
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,420
I thought you...

481
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,950
I'm sorry.

482
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:55,830
I was worried that I might wake you up,

483
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,310
so I didn't tell you.

484
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:11,940
From now on,

485
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,210
don't leave quietly like this again.

486
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,640
If you leave quietly again,

487
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,020
I'll tie you up.

488
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:30,320
Okay.

489
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,910
Where did you go today?

490
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,690
You'll know it tomorrow.

491
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,680
You even have a secret.

492
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:14,380
[The ending where you feel helpless is that you want to say something but then you hesitate.]
