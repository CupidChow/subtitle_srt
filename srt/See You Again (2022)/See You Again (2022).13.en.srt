00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:46,370
Pass!

00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,340
Pass, pass.

6
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:47,850
Pass!

7
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,050
The rear guard on the left, pass!

8
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:50,740
Pass!

9
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,630
You centre forward.

10
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,050
Run!

11
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,850
Nice shot! Yeah!

12
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,820
Yeah!

13
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,690
They are definitely going to win today. Cheers!

14
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,330
Sure.

15
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:08,620
Shush.

16
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,639
I think they will win.

17
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:10,620
Definitely.

18
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,280
Won't you drink some?

19
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:15,990
No.

20
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,820
I rode a motorcycle here.

21
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,100
So you plan to

22
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,840
dress like this

23
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,960
to watch the game at the scene?

24
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,110
Brother,

25
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,260
didn't your family teach you

26
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,140
not to judge women's clothing?

27
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,990
I mean

28
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,840
it's not convenient to wear high heels.

29
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,210
If

30
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,390
I meet a rude kid,

31
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,770
it's convenient to teach him a lesson

32
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,480
anytime and anywhere.

33
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,790
No, no, no.

34
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,200
It's my fault.

35
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,579
In order to apologize,

36
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,060
let me show you something.

37
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,920
What is this?

38
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,140
One time, I accidentally met the Bioluminescent Ocean.

39
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,380
It's a type of unicellular algae.

40
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,660
When it is stimulated by external force,

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,100
it will be luminescent.

42
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,930
So you're a tour guide.

43
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,020
The second half starts.

44
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,500
It started.

45
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:31,770
It started.

46
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,650
Where are they?

47
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,610
So many.

48
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,740
What are you waiting for? Search for it.

49
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,700
Be careful.

50
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,050
My candy.

51
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,260
-Why are we here to make wishes? -Watch out!

52
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,260
Because

53
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,800
I want you to see Peppa Pig.

54
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,060
Your balloon is over there.

55
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,070
I will find it myself.

56
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,560
Are you sure

57
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,020
you will be able to see it

58
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,060
with your height?

59
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,080
Come up.

60
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,030
♫Put your photos in my phone♫

61
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,980
♫They're full of traces of our love♫

62
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,370
♫Make the room covered with your scent♫

63
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,040
♫Time keeps running♫

64
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,640
♫You are the oxygen I live on♫

65
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,570
♫Along with the breath on which I miss you every time♫

66
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,250
♫You are the deep bottom of the sea♫

67
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,520
♫I'm swimming in your arms♫

68
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,650
♫I want one more second to get close to you♫

69
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,640
♫One more second to change your clock♫

70
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,880
♫To turn it upside down♫

71
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,260
If I go to a wrong place,

72
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,820
♫And to hug you again♫

73
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,340
and I can't make a wish due to it,

74
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,060
I'll blame this on you forever.

75
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,110
♫I want one more second of memories between you and me♫

76
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,060
What?

77
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,020
Let’s go.

78
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,080
♫With one more second, in this world, there will be no♫

79
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,130
♫More trouble♫

80
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,490
♫Every minute and second♫

81
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,490
-Nice shot. -This is nice. Nice pass.

82
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,240
No hurry.

83
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,430
Have I met you before?

84
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,940
If you want to hit on me,

85
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,910
this is a bit old-fashioned.

86
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,980
You do look familiar.

87
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:23,950
Tell me.

88
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,310
Why are there turtles

89
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,660
in the football pub?

90
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,100
Paul is in Europe.

91
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,110
And we have a turtle.

92
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,360
Because of such a boring reason,

93
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,550
it is trapped here.

94
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,310
Listen carefully.

95
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,700
It said

96
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,700
it's boring

97
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,130
to be here all the time.

98
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,500
You didn't drink, right?

99
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,760
You get drunk after you drink water?

100
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,260
Really.

101
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,940
We people are bored

102
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,400
staying in such cement boxes

103
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,030
every day.

104
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,970
If it knows

105
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,480
there are rivers and beaches,

106
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,820
it will go crazy.

107
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,510
So what?

108
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,860
A turtle needs to make a living, too.

109
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,840
Waiter.

110
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,430
Two more beers.

111
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,020
Cheers.

112
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,720
Waiter.

113
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,350
Waiter, open these two bottles for me.

114
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,050
I will take them.

115
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:24,620
Here.

116
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,140
Bro.

117
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,660
I ordered the beer first.

118
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,660
Lady first.

119
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:32,640
Thank you.

120
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:46,880
Be careful.

121
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,409
I'm really sorry, Miss.

122
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,360
I didn't mean it.

123
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,430
Guys, let's drink.

124
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,930
Let's drink.

125
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,190
Fill it up.

126
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,140
Fill it up.

127
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,560
Fill it up. Come on.

128
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,190
Come on.

129
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,800
Go!

130
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,980
-Fill it up. Drink it up. -You changed to white wine again today.

131
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,140
What are you doing?

132
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:04,900
Brother, are you okay?

133
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,020
What are you doing? Are you picking a fight?

134
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,380
What are you waiting for? Run!

135
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,870
After them!

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,640
Stop! Stop!

137
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,050
Don't let her run away.

138
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,590
Where's my car?

139
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,420
Designated driver.

140
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,700
What are you waiting for? Aboard.

141
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,220
Stop!

142
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,370
Stop!

143
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,610
You can't escape.

144
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,260
Hold tight.

145
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,299
Stop!

146
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,140
Didn't you say it's over there?

147
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,610
Why can't we find it?

148
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,500
I can't see clearly

149
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,990
since you are on my back.

150
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,860
How heavy are you?

151
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,310
Xiang Qinyu.

152
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,050
This is it.

153
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,120
What wish did you make?

154
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,250
You look so happy.

155
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,730
Don't try to trick me.

156
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,880
And you.

157
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,240
Since you're already here

158
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,700
and found the balloon for me.

159
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,740
Why don't you make a wish, too?

160
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,760
I can reluctantly

161
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,680
allow you

162
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,610
to tie your wish

163
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,060
together with mine

164
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,380
and get what we want together.

165
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,390
I grow up this big

166
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,270
because

167
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,740
I never trust anyone,

168
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,710
especially this one.

169
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,920
Then why did you follow me?

170
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,510
In return for finding the balloon for you,

171
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,370
I have a question.

172
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,610
You must answer me honestly.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,850
Do you

00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,620
It's a bit uneven here.

345
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,750
What did the teacher say?

346
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,300
Nothing.

347
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,390
That won't work. We're about to start.

348
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,740
We need to hurry up.

349
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,590
How about this?

350
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,000
Tell the actors

351
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,900
we will begin in five minutes.

352
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,890
It's almost time to invite him over.

353
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,230
Okay.

354
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,220
OK. Hurry up.

355
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,590
Everyone, hurry up.

356
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,740
Get ready to move.

357
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,780
Let's start.

358
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,860
Li.

359
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,770
Hao.

360
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,060
It's you.

361
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,490
Why do you come to the crew today?

362
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,140
It's a big scene today, right?

363
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,740
Those brothers are my men.

364
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,870
They can't handle it.

365
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,620
They can rest assured if I'm here.

366
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,300
Hao is really capable.

367
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,980
Why are you still here?

368
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,850
When I came up,

369
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,050
Tuotuo was looking for you.

370
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,300
It's urgent.

371
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,820
It's not something good.

372
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:09,810
Oh no.

373
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,230
I...

374
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,500
Did I do something wrong again?

375
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,100
I think so.

376
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,220
What are you waiting for? Go now.

377
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,540
All right.

378
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,230
Don't worry.

379
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,640
I'll check for you.

380
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,230
Thank you, Hao.

381
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,460
Attention, all units, get ready to shoot.

382
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:06,850
Bro,

383
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,810
adjust the wire coat.

384
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:14,520
Hao.

385
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,280
We'll pull you

386
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,260
when you are in the middle of the height later.

387
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,240
How's the preparation of the scene?

388
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,730
Okay, Director. It's almost done.

389
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,380
We can start filming now.

390
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,130
Okay.

391
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,340
Action.

392
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,400
Scene 51, Shot 1, Take 1.

393
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,330
[The Legend of Xiang Qinyu]

394
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,330
[Feng Yousan Wen]

395
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:44,900
Nice.

396
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,350
Chi Yu is getting better.

397
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,170
We are so lucky.

398
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:27,860
Okay.

399
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,420
Who are you?

400
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,520
Do they have lines now?

401
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,820
Isn't it a faraway view?

402
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,780
What are they talking about?

403
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,570
When you see the King of Hell,

404
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,890
ask him yourself.

405
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:19,930
Director.

406
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,830
this is not right.

407
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,410
It's you.

408
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,590
Go to hell!

409
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,670
Xiang Qinyu.

410
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:31,960
Chi Yu.

411
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,170
Chi Yu.

412
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,400
Chi Yu.

413
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,070
As I fell into the water and got injured,

414
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,890
many things have been delayed.

415
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,990
I'm sorry.

416
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,660
I'm completely recovered now.

417
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,180
I won't let you down.

418
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,140
I want to say something to the person who's waiting for me.

419
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:49,270
You must be looking forward to seeing me again.

420
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,140
Tonight,

421
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:27,380
the point is...

422
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,210
Yes, drink.

423
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,050
The money you earned.

424
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,810
We have to drink it all.

425
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,700
Thank you. Thank you.

426
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,590
Thank you.

427
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,470
I've never seen this girl in the makeup team.

428
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,070
Let's have supper together after work.

429
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,120
Take it.

430
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:18,980
Don't forget

431
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,830
the moustache.

432
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,870
This one doesn't have eyebrows. You have to fix it.

433
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,430
-What is he wearing today in here? -Tuotuo.

434
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,660
I'm leaving.

435
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,150
Okay.

436
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,240
I...

437
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,370
Hao,

438
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,980
why are you back?

439
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:32,290
Well...

440
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,460
I saw our press conference is popular yesterday.

441
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,770
I wanted to come back and play with my brothers.

442
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,140
No.

443
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,220
Well...

444
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,060
You were the one who caused trouble, right?

445
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,500
You can't just come back

446
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,280
in such a big group as you wish.

447
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,180
Most importantly,

448
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,090
after all, you provoked the current leading actor, right?

449
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,930
I acted on impulse.

450
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,460
He was wearing a mask.

451
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,980
How would I know he was the future leading actor?

452
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,120
The industry is not doing well.

453
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,940
Well...

454
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,290
No.

455
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,170
Yu.

456
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,250
The preparation of next scene.

457
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,220
Who is this?

458
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,350
This is the martial artist

459
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,540
who fought against you.

460
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,540
He said he wanted to come back.

461
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,090
No.

462
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,300
Yu, right?

463
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,830
I'm sorry.

464
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,410
Please forgive me.

465
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,610
I'm here to apologize to you.

466
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,420
I'm not the one who you should apologize to.

467
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,980
You should apologize to

468
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,770
the screenwriter Jin Ayin who you insulted.

469
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,780
I didn't know

470
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,540
your relationship with the screenwriter.

471
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,170
I'll apologize to her now.

472
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,100
To be honest,

473
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,930
if I didn't owe money

474
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,960
and lenders are after me,

475
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,940
I won't be here in your way.

476
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,070
Yu.

477
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,610
Please let me make some money.

478
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,020
No.

479
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,360
I won't let you come back

480
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,750
because you're not good enough.

481
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,490
From what I know about Xiang Qinyu,

482
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,310
the person who can fight against him

483
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,980
shouldn't be some amateur like you.

484
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,880
Yu, please.

485
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:18,780
Hao.

486
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,980
We haven't met for a long time.

487
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,600
It's such a coincidence to meet you here.

488
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,540
I heard about you in the crew in the past.

489
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,320
You like working with your brothers

490
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,560
and are a good man of brotherhood.

491
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,590
I know you.

492
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,910
You know that pretty girl, right?

493
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,340
If it is half month ago, I really won't eat this.

494
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,190
If it weren't for that bastard Chi Yu,

495
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,620
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

496
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:49,670
Hao, I...

497
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,100
I know you have many connections.

498
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,610
Please guide me.

499
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,070
Because

500
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,770
I don't earn enough money by fixing computers.

501
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,890
My dad is in hospital now. I need money urgently.

502
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:00,990
But I...

503
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,990
I don't want much.

504
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,220
As long as

505
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,330
I can get enough for my dad's hospital fee this month.

506
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,270
You will do anything?

507
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,680
Yes, whatever you want.

508
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,050
I'll do whatever you say.

509
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,320
Because I majored in computer

510
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,210
and Internet technology.

511
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,110
I know how to fix computers

512
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,400
and high-tech stuff.

513
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,850
