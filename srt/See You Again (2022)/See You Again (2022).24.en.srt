00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,730
Hello, Ye.

5
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,730
You know a lot of people.

6
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,450
I want you to do me a favor.

7
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,200
Master,

8
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,329
you really have everything here.

9
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,400
It doesn't matter what I have here.

10
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,860
What matters is

11
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,040
how I can help you.

12
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,900
Yes, yes, yes.

13
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,579
I have a problem.

14
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,310
Well,

15
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,700
if I tell you, you might not believe it.

16
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,910
If you hear it,

17
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,850
you might think it's a bit absurd.

18
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,579
There's a reason for everything that happens.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,370
In this world,

20
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,990
there's nothing that is impossible.

21
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,690
I'll tell you then.

22
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,970
I have a friend

23
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,240
who comes from 1936.

24
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,810
He comes from 1936.

25
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,380
He may go back soon.

26
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,770
Now his body

27
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,240
disappears from time to time.

28
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:28,750
Well,

29
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,780
he can't even catch anything when he disappears.

30
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,090
So I want to ask you

31
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,500
if you have any way

32
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,820
to make him stay.

33
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,700
Master.

34
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,790
You...

35
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,690
You don't believe me?

36
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,700
It's not like that.

37
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,400
It's a small matter.

38
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,780
So,

39
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,980
you know what to do?

40
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,280
I wonder whether

41
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,130
you've heard of this saying.

42
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:07,980
Borrow someone else's life.

43
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,500
The secret of the universe is that it all depends on human effort.

44
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,490
It all depends on human effort!

45
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,670
We absorb the essence of the earth.

46

We can travel through the ancient times to the current era.

47

That master you met just now is unexpected.

48
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,830
I'm sure it'll work this time.

49
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,130
We can definitely create the future we want

50

A pathetic sense of justice.

174
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,510
How about this?

175
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,700
Let's make a deal.

176
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,960
From now on,

177
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,930
I will observe

178
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,760
Jin Ayin's every move closely.

179
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,230
Of course, it's also the same to Chi Yu's parents.

180
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,780
Even if you send me to prison,

181
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,410
I can't guarantee

182
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,240
whether something bad would happen to them one day.

183
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,670
Of course, my condition is simple.

184
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,150
Taotao...

185
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,050
Taotao can't wake up anymore.

186
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,620
Now I just want to take her

187
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,070
back to where she belongs.

188
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,580
If I can protect my Taotao,

189
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,270
you can ensure the safety of your Jin Ayin.

190
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,330
How can you guarantee it?

191
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,450
You don't trust me?

192
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,920
Do you have any other choice?

193
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,790
Xiang Qinyu.

194
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,860
I hope you can keep your promise.

195
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,950
Don't hurt anyone.

196
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,600
If anything wrong happens to them...

197
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,820
Wangcai,

198
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,460
turn on the light.

199
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,100
Okay.

200
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,380
Why didn't you turn on the light?

201
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,220
You scared me.

202
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,950
What's wrong?

203
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,630
Today,

204
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,590
I got a cake for no reason.

205
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,850
Did you send it to me?

206
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:43,840
No.

207
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,090
How could you accept someone else's gift casually?

208
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,110
Why did you throw it away?

209
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,260
I...

210
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,080
I'll buy you a bigger one.

211
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,780
Where did you go today?

212
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,740
I went shopping with Jian Ye.

213
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,560
I called her early in the morning,

214
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,660
and asked her to go shopping.

215
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,830
On my way back,

216
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,640
I bought you a pack of candy.

217
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:17,830
Look.

218
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,950
You said you didn't like candy.

219
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,090
The candy I bought previously are almost eaten up by you.

220
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:42,820
Taotao.

221
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,810
You must be bored after staying here for so long.

222
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,960
I'll take you out of here now.

223
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,180
Ma.

224
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,620
Ms. Zhang.

225
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,240
Have you made up your mind?

226
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:55,730
Yes.

227
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,170
I've made up my mind.

228
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,980
I'll take Tao away from here.

229
00:14:59,420 --> 00:14:59,910
Okay.

230
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,910
Be careful on the way.

231
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,700
Okay.

232
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,620
These are the CT scan

233
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,720
and X-ray reports she has got.

234
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,500
Take them.

235
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,830
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

236
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,260
You're welcome. Just go ahead.

237
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,670
Why are there so many policemen?

238
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,050
Don't you understand?

239
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,680
Let me tell you. You can see a big show here today.

240
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,580
You're lucky.

241
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,600
I heard that there were gunshots just now.

242
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,580
Hurry up! Get out of the way!

243
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,070
What happened?

244
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,890
Did you see the news?

245
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,260
This person is a murderer.

246
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,580
He has been on the run for many years.

247
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,640
He's finally arrested this time.

248
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,420
A great threat to the society has been removed.

249
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,960
Really?

250
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,780
It looks like

251
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,940
he will be sentenced severely.

252
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,340
He will surely be sentenced severely.

253
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,310
I heard that

254
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,560
when he was arrested,

255
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,920
he even hid a gun made by himself.

256
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,860
Why do you make it hurt so much?

257
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,110
Are you a newcomer?

258
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,370
For a wound like this, it does hurt a little.

259
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,510
You'll feel better after ice compress.

260
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,140
Take it.

261
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,700
Forget it.

262
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,590
Ask your head nurse to come.

263
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,110
Okay.

264
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,990
Why does it hurt so much?

265
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,840
Why are you so angry today?

266
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,770
Are you okay?

267
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,220
I'm fine.

268
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,990
I sprained my wrist during filming.

269
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,020
I mean...

270
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,040
Why are you so angry today?

271
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,830
We'll finish shooting the movie soon.

272
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,200
For this important scene,

273
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,150
I hired a personal trainer to practice my skills.

274
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,570
I practiced so hard day and night.

275
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,470
But I didn't expect that

276
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,730
Chi Yu and Jin Ayin had collaborated and changed the ending

277
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,730
after discussing with the director.

278
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,380
All my scenes have been deleted.

279
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,210
He said he wanted to adopt

280
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,660
the style of romance.

281
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,390
Well,

282
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,320
on what ground could he do it?

283
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,750
He has gone too far.

284
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,150
I was also foolish.

285
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,060
I shouldn't have told him the truth.

286
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,890
I wanted to make up for my mistake

287
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,140
so I helped him.

288
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,750
What now?

289
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,349
The truth?

290
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,710
What is the truth?

291
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,250
You...

292
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,460
You don't want to say it.

293
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,030
Well,

294
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,819
I just want to give you some advice.

295
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
It's okay if you don't want to say it.

296
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,410
Let me tell you.

297
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,610
Back then,

298
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,760
Chi Yu was missing for some time, wasn't he?

299
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,460
Actually,

300
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,300
on the day he went missing,

301
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,690
I was there, too.

302
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,300
I saw someone

303
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,110
try to kill him,

304
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,530
and push him into the water.

305
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,580
So,

306
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,910
did you see the culprit's face clearly?

307
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,410
I also don't know who he is.

308
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,050
I was so scared.

309
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,700
Besides,

310
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,340
it was too dark.

311
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,890
I didn't see who it was.

312
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,230
He was wearing a hat,

313
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,260
and half of his face was covered.

314
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,090
He also wore

315
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,830
a very weird pair of sneakers.

316
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,940
Anyway,

317
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,090
after that,

318
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,520
I've been feeling sorry for Chi Yu,

319
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,830
so I make a concession for him in everything.

320
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,320
I see.

321
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,550
So,

322
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,760
have you told Chi Yu

323
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,260
about this?

324
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,550
Don't mention it.

325
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,230
Of course I've told him.

326
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,660
I was being so incautious.

327
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,150
I told him everything when he tricked me.

328
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,540
But I really treat him as a friend.

329
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,790
I didn't expect that after he found out,

330
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,580
he's always against me.

331
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:53,650
By the way,

332
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,340
I also think

333
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,000
something is wrong.

334
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,190
I've run into you.

335
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,060
I also want to ask you.

336
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,540
Ma Zehao,

337
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,020
were you close to Chi Yu?

338
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:12,780
No.

339
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,300
I...

340
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,820
just think it's very strange.

341
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,260
So strange.

342
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,600
Strange?

343
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,360
Why do you say so?

344
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,270
I...

345
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,180
I've known Chi Yu for a long time.

346
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,110
I know I'm not as good as him.

347
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,840
I've been his foil since school.

348
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,100
But I really treat him as my buddy.

349
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,770
So I don't think it matters.

350
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,840
Besides, if Chi Yu had anything,

351
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,590
like the good things,

352
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,640
he would think of me.

353
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:46,910
However,

354
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,780
after he came back from his disappearance,

355
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,000
it seems everything has changed.

356
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,900
He's like a different person.

357
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,540
A different person? Do you know what I mean?

358
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,060
A different person?

359
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,050
Not to mention that he can't remember anything.

360
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,050
Even his

361
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,260
habits and taste for food

362
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,100
have all changed.

363
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,600
He's allergic to alcohol.

364
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,620
It seems his alcohol allergy

365
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,010
was suddenly cured.

366
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,020
Besides,

367
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,650
the most puzzling thing is...

368
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,600
What did you say?

369
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,950
Just now, under the cliff.

370
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,540
I think there was water in my ears.

371
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,340
I didn't hear anything.

372
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,920
Xiang Qinyu!

373
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,760
Xiang Qinyu, come back.

374
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,070
Xiang Qinyu?

375
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,370
Why did

376
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,140
Jin Ayin call him

377
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,740
Xiang Qinyu privately?

378
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,890
And she has done it more than once.

379
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,120
Xiang Qinyu?

380
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,220
Do you think after you killed someone

381
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,260
and left,

382
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,960
you can pretend nothing has happened?

383
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,970
But since you killed someone,

384
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,810
you have to pay the price.

385
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,780
He said he would let me off,

386
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,380
and you don't trust his words, either.

387
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,600
Right?

388
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,700
If we run away now,

389
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,290
we'll live in shadows forever,

390
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,040
just like the man downstairs who was sent here just now.

391
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,640
I will be arrested eventually.

392
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,010
I can't make you worry, feel sad

393
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,920
or suffer anymore.

394
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,970
I just want us to be together forever

395
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,110
without being disturbed by anybody.

396
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,020
We used to

397
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,300
trust others too easily.

398
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,300
So this time,

399
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,460
we must not be soft-hearted.

400
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,860
As long as the problems are not solved in time,

401
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,180
there will be endless trouble.

402
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,790
Endless trouble.

403
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,500
You're right.

404
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,250
So the best way

405
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,470
is to make them disappear.

406
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,940
I used to

407
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,560
trust bad people too easily.

408
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,620
So this time,

409
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,880
I can't take you away.

410
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,650
Maze,

411
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,750
don't worry.

412
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,420
I'll always be with you.

413
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,580
From the first time we met,

414
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,460
I knew we would be together forever.

415
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,680
Give me another chance.

416
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,070
This time...

417
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,340
This time, I will eliminate

418
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,610
all of them at one time.

419
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,360
I don't care who he is.

420
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,880
I will make him never reincarnate.

421
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:40,910
Jin Ayin.

422
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,610
You can't deny it if you lose again.

423
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:46,900
My goodness.

424
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,320
I got it on my clothes.

425
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,810
Get me a wet tissue.

426
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,460
So clumsy.

427
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,050
♫Put your photos in my phone♫

428
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,000
♫They're full of traces of our love♫

434
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,420
Why is

435
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,130
this chess piece in my sleeve?

436
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,390
♫You are the deep bottom of the sea♫

No, let me stick two pieces.

00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,340
This round is not over yet.

441
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,130
You have to admit defeat.

442

♫I want one more second to get close to you♫

443

It's all because you've cheated in the game.

444
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:19,980
I...

445
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,220
-Don't touch me. -Just admit defeat.

446

♫One more second to change your clock♫

447

Hello?

465
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,020
Jin,

466
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,920
I'm calling to

467
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,920
ask you

468
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,310
if you've finished revising the script.

469
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,620
Soon.

470
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,260
To be honest,

471
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,460
I've got inspiration, too.

472
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,290
This time,

473
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,950
I decide to operate it myself.

474
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:23,860
Okay, director.

475
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,620
I'll give it to you the day after tomorrow.

476
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,310
Bye.

477
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,100
What's wrong?

478
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,340
My phone

479
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,740
is powered off.

480
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,110
There won't be anyone else calling in.

481
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,770
So,

482
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,610
what's next?

483
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,170
Next...

484
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,430
Revise the script.

485
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,940
You don't want some?

486
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:20,590
By the way,

487
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,180
I forgot you were going to give me a surprise.

488
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,270
Chi Yu

489
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,650
has already died.

490
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,280
Are you kidding me?

491
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,660
Did I hear it wrong

492
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,120
or did you say it wrong?

493
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:49,610
What is this?

494
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,790
Chi Yu and Xiang Qinyu.

495
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

496
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,220
The Chi Yui you know,

497
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,370
the Chi Yu you hate,

498
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,920
is not called Chi Yu.

499
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,360
His name is Xiang Qinyu.

500
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,200
Are you drunk before you drink the wine?

501
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,740
Chi Yu looks like Xiang Qinyu.

502
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,090
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been the leading actor.

503
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,070
I've known him for so long.

504
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,990
I know him best.

505
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,660
Don't you also think think he has changed?

506
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,500
What are you talking about?

507
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,000
I have proof to show that he's not Chi Yu.

508
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,060
How is that possible?

509
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,530
This man named Xiang Qinyu

510
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,960
killed the real Chi Yu
