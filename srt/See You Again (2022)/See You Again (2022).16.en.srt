The lion in the painting and the fish in water

live in the forest

and in the sea respectively.

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,660
But they met in the city like this.

00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,700
Little Turtle?

00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,000

♫I am sure I wanna live it with you♫

running is useless.

But I'm really sorry.

I can compensate you.

He is

32
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:06,910

36
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,350
Thank you.

37
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,180
I'm not thirsty.

38
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,810
Of course you are not.

39
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:32,950
Ayin,

40
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,920
your brother

41

has artistic talent.

42
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,130
Very gifted.

43
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,250
It's just two sheep, right?

44
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,980
Yes.

45
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,550
It's just two sheep.

46
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,070
Do you understand art?

47
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,260
Let's look at this painting.

48
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,460
In this painting,

49
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,230
he didn't use exaggerated things

50
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,180
to draw attention.

51
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,070
Instead, he blurred the reflection in the water.

52
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,240
This simple composition

53
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,320
shows purity.

54
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,830
It seems that he led us

55
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,400
into the spiritual world of the two sheep.

56
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,610
I'll buy this painting.

57
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,029
Into the spiritual world of the sheep?

58
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,660
So what?

59
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,020
It doesn't matter what the sheep think.

60
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,310
As long as you know what Li Longda is thinking.

61
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,220
Just think of it as

62
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:29,940
his support for your brother's career.

63
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,040
You're fooling Longda again.

64
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,840
Longda.

65
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,150
I want one too.

66
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,430
Sure.

67
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,200
Buy another one.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,900
Let me introduce.

[Jin Chuan Free Photographer]

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,020
My name is Jin Chuan.

71
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,760
I can compensate you for the vase now.

72
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,870
You're already talking about money.

73
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,450
It seems that we are more than this.

74
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,560
What else?

75
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,700
Although we ran away last time,

76
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,550
my best friend

77
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,760
helped clean up the mess.

78
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,160
They were prisoned and offered compensation.

79
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,660
There was a hole on that fatty's head

80
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,740
because you hit him your heel.

81
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,990
They saw the doctor sew thirty stitches on his head

82
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,180
to fix it.

83
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,920
Impossible.

84
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,430
I remember I was using

85
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,890
the tip of my shoe, not the heel.

86
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,400
You drank so much that day.

87
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,130
Are you sure it's the tip of your shoe?

88
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,240
Do the math.

89
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,320
How much is it in total?

90
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,790
I'll pay you double.

91
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,290
Okay.

92
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,420
Let's friend each other on WeChat.

93
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,520
I have no money in WeChat.

94
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,080
I can only use cash

95
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,250
or credit cards.

96
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,490
Okay.

97
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,340
It's

98
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,620
RMB 860,000 in total.

99
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,030
How dare you accept it?

100
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,660
Don't think that we...

101
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,720
We what?

102
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,330
Show me the receipts of medical fees and the vase.

103
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,170
That's why we need to friend each other on WeChat.

104
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,060
I'll send you the photos once I get back.

105
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,390
I'll get you a new pair of shoes.

106
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,340
Otherwise, you'll sprain your ankle.

107
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:40,790
No need.

108
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:46,560
This will do it.

109
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,250
Now that you're here,

110
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,550
let me show you around.

111
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,580
These photos were taken

112
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,420
by me in recent years.

113
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,830
No need. I have things to do.

114
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,290
The proceeds of these photos

115
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,140
will be donated to rescue wild animals.

116
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,160
Do you like elephants?

117
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,530
I said no.

118
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,380
What about monkeys?

119
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,870
You like little turtles.

120
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,560
How old are you?

121
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,050
23.

122
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,650
I'll be 24 in a few months.

123
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,680
Are you still celebrating your birthday?

124
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,780
I don't even remember

125
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,740
the last time when I celebrated my birthday.

126
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,450
I'll accompany you

127
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,990
to celebrate your next birthday.

129
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,190
no matter what you want to do,

130
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,930
you've got the wrong person.

131
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,860
Just wait for me outside.

132
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,380
My brother drew it.

133
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,590
How is it?

134
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,020
Don't worry.

135
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,090
-He's awesome, right? -They won't recognize me.

136
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:04,860
Isn't it good?

137
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,140
Teng Xi.

138
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,180
Shush.

139
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,760
Sister,

140
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,680
have you seen Jin Chuan?

141
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,100
Jin Chuan?

142
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,650
He was here just now.

143
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,800
Right, where is he?

144
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,560
Is he hooking up with some girl?

145
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,789
Jin Chuan.

146
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,559
Miss Mumu.

147
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,000
Coming.

148
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,110
My little brother,

149
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,960
I took the risk of emptying my wallet

150
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,910
to support you.

151
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,140
Right, sister.

152
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,720
Today, the two men around you

153
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,940
also spent a lot of money.

154
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,370
We're afraid that no one wants to buy your paintings.

155
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,810
Really?

156
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,630
You're so nice to me.

157
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,300
Mr. Li Longda bought five paintings.

158
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,060
Chi Yu

159
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,830
bought two.

160
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,860
Miss Jin,

161
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,660
are you sure they did that for me?

162
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,760
Brother-in-law,

163
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,500
this has nothing to do with your sister.

164
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,370
I sincerely support your career.

165
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,310
We can go out together

166
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,310
when I don't have work.

167
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,530
I'll go there first.

168
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,150
Where did you get the money?

169
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,860
It's none of your business.

170
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,540
Did you receive the money that Chi Yu's dad gave you

171
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,690
at the hospital that day?

172
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,240
Give me the money you owe me.

173
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,920
I have no money left.

174
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,200
Which paintings did you buy?

175
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,940
That one.

176
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,450
That one is pretty.

177
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,000
And this.

178
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,250
Walking.

179
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,140
It's meaningful.

180
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,300
I like this too.

181
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,080
Haoran.

182
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,120
Here.

183
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,420
Today,

184
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,060
to thank

185
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,810
my brothers-in-law,

186
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,920
let's have a celebration party tonight.

187
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,300
Sure.

188
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,080
You can

189
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,700
only have one brother-in-law.

190
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,850
A celebration party?

191
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,280
Let's go.

192
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,360
Put it here.

193
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,870
This celebration party is in the wilderness.

194
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,540
Did you lose a lot of money?

195
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,450
What tasty food can there be?

196
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,200
I've prepared so much food.

197
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,900
We can cook on our own.

198
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,750
Stingy.

199
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,780
This is embarrassing.

200
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,600
I think it's quiet here.

201
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,550
Only you

202
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,760
can find such a good place.

203
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,330
Everyone is here. Come here.

204
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,650
Come here.

205
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,280
Come on.

206
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,500
As usual,

207
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
each of us draws a card.

208
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,100
Come on.

209
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,870
Everyone draws a card.

210
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,130
What?

211
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,240
Draw one.

212
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,560
Let me see what card I'll draw and who will be my teammate.

213
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,630
Let's show our cards.

214
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
I got the Queen too.

215
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,790
All right, let's assign the tasks.

216
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,900
We

217
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,290
move the things in the car first.

218
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,580
Jin Ayin and Longda,

219
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,670
you clean up the place where we eat first.

220
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,860
Okay.

221
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,150
As for our lucky guy,

222
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,210
you pitch the tent

223
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,570
on your own.

224
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,520
No.

225
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,170
My leg hasn't recovered yet.

226
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,100
I want to go with them.

227
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,350
If someone insists that his leg hurts

228
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,410
and he can't do anything,

229
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,380
he can just sit here

230
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,560
and enjoy it.

231
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,160
Alright.

232
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,470
Take care.

233
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,860
Hope we can have dinner as early as possible.

234
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:53,820
Let's go.

235
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,420
Let's go.

236
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,960
Your brother is just like you.

237
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,030
He's reasonable and adorable.

238
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,790
As long as people are poor,

239
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,510
they can think of multiple ways.

240
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,370
Ayin,

241
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,810
can I

242
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,020
ask you something?

243
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,180
Go ahead.

244
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,280
You and Chi Yu...

245
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,030
Are you...

246
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,930
Longda.

247
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,300
Unfold this chair.

248
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,920
Otherwise, they won't have a place to sit down.

249
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,730
Okay.

250
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,080
So much delicious food.

251
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,320
Jin Chuan,

252
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,930
why are you just standing here?

253
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,300
Let me help you.

254
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,770
It's okay. Let me do it.

255
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:07,900
Xi,

256
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,000
you helped me a lot this time.

257
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,080
Thank you.

258
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,490
Why are you being so distant?

259
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,610
If it weren't for you,

260
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,630
our small exhibition wouldn't have

261
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,170
attracted so many people.

262
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Back in the exhibition hall,

263
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,060
I saw that...

264
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,800
What?

265
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,520
Do you have someone you like?

266
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,160
Xi,

267
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,970
I know your feelings.

268
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,580
But what's between us

269
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,960
has nothing to do with anyone else.

270
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,890
It's just that a man like me

271
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,280
is not suitable for you.

272
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,450
It doesn't matter.

273
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,460
Because I'm suitable for you.

274
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,940
Xi.

275
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,710
I don't want to hear it.

276
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,090
Xi, don't.

277
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,190
I can't hear you.

278
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,640
Li Longda,

279
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,990
I have some drinks in my car.

280
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,940
Go get them with me.

281
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,640
I...

282
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,350
I'm not done yet.

283
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,100
Come with me now.

284
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,750
Why me?

285
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,730
What you need to do now is

286
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,110
to come with me.

287
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,050
Come one.

288
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,580
Well...

289
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,130
Well...

290
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,110
I...

291
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,040
Why are you standing there and looking at me?

292
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,420
Are you done?

293
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,740
What a fool.

294
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,730
You haven't finished your work yet.

295
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,190
You can ask if you don't know.

296
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,540
Don't pretend that you know.

297
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,560
Why are you here?

298
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,620
I'm afraid I have nowhere to sleep at night.

299
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,700
I'm here to help you.

300
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,110
This is easy.

301
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,640
Look. I've already finished.

302
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,030
Still pretending.

303
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,070
Let me check it.

304
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,090
Can I leave now?

305
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,450
If I don't go back,

306
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,290
I'll really become someone else's supporting role.

307
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,240
We're supporting roles.

308
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,440
Coming.

309
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,300
Here.

310
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,010
Wipe your hands.

311
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,089
Thank you.

312
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,250
Ma, what a savior.

313
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,410
You and your brother are really different.

314
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,240
You have the same family,

315
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,540
and the same living environment,

316
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,540
but you like different lifestyles.

317
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:45,670
Actually,

318
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,200
I don't know why either.

319
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,140
We were both raised by grandma.

320
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,850
How come he is a tall and handsome

321
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,940
cool guy,

322
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,780
but I'm

323
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,620
short

324
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,390
and poor?

325
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,690
Actually,

326
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,640
after our dad left,

327
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,100
Abao grew up a lot overnight.

328
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:11,950
Although

329
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,800
he is careless and casual

330
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,570
with his friends.

331
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,440
he

332
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,290
helped me and supported me

333
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,560
a lot.

334
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,100
Jin Ayin,

335
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,360
I like

336
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,780
the perseverance

337
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:36,950
you and your brother have.

338
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,330
Abao and I

339
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,810
both want to pick up grandma from the hometwon

340
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,080
to let her live in a building with elevators.

341
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,170
So

342
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,130
he would secretly transfer money to me

343
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,400
and let me save it as the money to buy a house.

344
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,270
Maybe our dream is far away,

345
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,680
but

346
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,790
I am now

347
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,920
a contract screenwriter of Jianghe Studios.

348
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,450
After I finish this script

349
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,510
and get the payment,

350
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,440
I'll start another project.

351
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,180
Plus the money I saved...

352
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,030
I'll pay back the money soon.

353
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,850
Because of you,

354
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,170
I lost the money for the toilet in my elevator house.

355
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,170
I really didn't know back then.

356
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,900
How about this?

357
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,790
You can pay back the money

358
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,350
with interests.

359
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,620
Give me

360
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,490
RMB 188,888.

361
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,790
Are you blackmailing me?

362
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,090
Well,

363
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,680
how about...

364
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,470
What?

365
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,570
Actually,

366
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,130
I know

367
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,130
You used my card

368
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,920
and my money

369
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,150
to keep me away from you.

370
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,150
But what I want to say is

371
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,880
no matter what we encounter,

372
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,100
we can face it together.

373
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,820
Two

374
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,400
is better than one, right?

375
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,260
Jin Ayin,

376
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,760
are you really

377
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,000
in love with me?

378
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,580
♫On that day♫

379
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,470
♫The wind gently crosses your face♫

380
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,840
Shameless.

381
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,690
I just want to keep an eye on you

382
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,930
♫I secretly wrote it down♫

383
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,260
to make you pay back the money as soon as possible.

384
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,480
♫The first chapter of my unlikely encounter with you♫

385
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,800
♫If one day♫

386
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,060
This is for you.

387
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,680
♫You'll wonder about me too♫

388
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,180
Don't be surprised.

389
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,940
I'm full of skills.

390
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,140
♫That's the sound of a heartbeat♫

391
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,080
♫A foretaste of what's to come♫

392
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,430
♫Maybe one day we'll meet♫

393
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,940
What's this?

394
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,580
It's a...

395
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,950
♫I'm ready♫

396
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,460

♫To take you to the future♫

398

399

my arm isn't this big.

400
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,670
♫To welcome this love♫

401
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,260
Give it back if you don't like it.

00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,600
♫When we meet again♫

403
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,260
I can take it home

404

and put it on Wangcai's head.

405
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,080
♫It'll be the most romantic scene♫

406
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,730
Do you like it?

407
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,720
♫At that moment♫

408
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,250
Yes.

409
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,980
♫My heart is engraved with♫

410
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,140
♫Your sweetest face♫

Honey,

412

look what I brought you.

413
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,560
Honey, what's wrong?

414
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,070
They seem to really like each other.

415
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,460
And I've been lying to myself.

416
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,840
Who?

417
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,270
Who?

418
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Your daughter-in-law

419
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,610
and Chi Yu.

420
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,580
I finally have a daughter-in-law,

421
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,170
but someone wants to take her away from me.

422
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,180
Look at me.

423
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,500
Let me ask you.

424
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,450
You can't live without her, right?

425
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,020
Do you really like her?

426
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,840
Absolutely.

427
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,590
Mom.

428
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,620
She's different from others.

429
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,670
I...

430
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,140
I've never seen

431
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,130
a perseverant girl like her.

432
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,010
Sometimes people told me to

433
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,140
stop being an actor

434
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,600
and to go home to do business.

435
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,810
I pretended not to care.

436
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,100
But actually,

437
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,390
I knew I'm not confident.

438
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,280
But Ayin is different.

439
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,330
She will stick with what she wants.

440
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,270
Also,

441
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
she's nice to me.

442
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,830
Very nice.

443
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,210
Gradually,

444
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,520
she is not only a special person,

445
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,280
but also

446
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,480
the one who makes me want to

447
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,920
become better for her.

448
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,380
She's the only one.

449
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,710
There was no one like her before,

450
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,880
and there will be no one like her in the future.

451
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,540
It looks like

452
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,460
I have to use the strategy I used to conquer your father

453
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,030
to help you.

454
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:27,650
Remember,

455
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,690
it's too early to give up now.

456
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,840
Playing cat and mouse will be in vain.

457
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,100
Pestering her will lead you to success.

458
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,490
Yeah!

459
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,100
Help!

460
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,400
Ayin!

461
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,490
Ayin!

462
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:07,870
Ayin!

463
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,860
Ayin, what's wrong?

464
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,450
What are you doing?

465
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,310
Longda, why are you here?

466
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,910
You're so nice.

467
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,070
I was just thinking about buying some flowers for decoration.

468
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,660
Thank you.

469
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:23,670
These flowers are...

470
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,420
I know.

471
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,260
They are for me.

472
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,620
I'm here for Ayin.

473
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,280
It's not convenient for us today.

474
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,170
Nothing inconvenient.

475
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:34,940
Come in.

476
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,900
Actually, today I want to ask you to...

477
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,110
It's not convenient to do anything today.

478
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:41,750
Well.

479
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,020
Let me in first.

480
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:43,810
Li Longda.

481
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,170
I kindly offer you a piece of advice.

482
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,900
A man who keeps pestering is a rascal

483
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,330
and a nuisance.

484
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,330
I am a nuisance.

485
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,330
I don't want it.

486
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,140
No need.

487
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:56,610
I...

488
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,360
It hurts.

489
00:24:59,490 --> 00:24:59,810
It hurts.

490
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,580
Chi Yu.

491
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,800
This isn't a fair competition.

492
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:06,750
It hurts.

493
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:07,530
It hurts.

494
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,440
It hurts.

495
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,190
Be gentle.

496
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,780
Why did you

497
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,090
do that to Longda?

498
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,270
I just wanted to.

499
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,660
Your neck is fine.

500
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,710
You need to pay attention to your waist.

501
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:22,870
From here,

502
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,560
Xuanshu, to Mingmen, and to Yaoyangguan.

503
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,230
If you keep sitting for a long time,

504
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,750
no one can save you.

505
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:40,890
Who is this?

506
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,770
Have you ever thought about

507
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,140
running a small bone setting store?

508
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:56,770
I'll help you

509
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,440
with it.

510
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,830
Why isn't the watch working?

511
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,540
Is it dead?

512
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,400
Charge it for me.

513
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,110
Asking me to do things for you again.

514
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,570
Why is Li Longda still here?

515
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,770
I'm looking for Jin Ayin.

516
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,900
Ze.

517
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,420
Thank you.

518
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:49,920
Have some water.

519
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,290
Don't pull a long face.

520
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,130
Ze.

521
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,750
You just came back to Shanghai?

522
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,430
Yes, I just arrived.

523
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,510
If you

524
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,300
hadn't transferred money to me yesterday,

525
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,300
I would have been trapped in Beijing today.

526
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,220
It's okay.

527
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,780
If you are on a business trip alone,

528
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,810
just pay attention to your wallet

529
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,060
and your own safety.

530
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,110
Okay.

531
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,150
Ze,

532
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,420
have some water.

533
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,320
Have some water.

534
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,920
Okay.

535
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,050
You come with me.

536
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,790
Help me hang my clothes.

537
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,730
Let's go.

538
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:01,790
Have some water.

539
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,480
Who is that man?

540
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:13,460
He...

541
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,430
He's hesitant when he talked and his eyes were wandering.

542
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,850
He didn't even tell me his name.

543
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,750
It's rude.

544
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,040
Keep your voice down.

545
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,630
He was my childhood friend.

546
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,560
His name is Ma Zehao.

547
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,430
He's in a special situation.

548
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,630
His father died in an accident when he was young.

549
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,360
He was alone

550
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,690
and often bullied.

551
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,980
So he is shy with strangers

552
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,670
and doesn't talk much.

553
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,330
Don't stare at him.

554
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,200
And this.

555
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,870
No more aggressive look.

556
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,190
Anyway, be nice.

557
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:48,770
Jin Ayin,

558
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,730
you've been so arrogant lately.

559
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,500
No, I'm not.

560
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,290
My friend is here.

561
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,360
Do me a favor.

562
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:16,770
Jin Ayin,

563
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,710
help me check it. Everything is gone.

564
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,520
Did you touch it again?

565
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,680
I don't know why either.

566
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,620
No.

567
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,660
You have to help me retrieve these things.

568
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,490
You activated the synchronization and sharing function.

569
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,420
Stop wandering around.

570
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,190
Go down.

571
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,180
Take out the trash.

572
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,960
I forgot to introduce myself.

573
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,440
My name is

574
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:05,890
Chi Yu.

575
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,220
Hello.

576
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,460
Nice to meet you.

577
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,100
Just call me Ze.

578
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,370
Ze.

579
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,370
Chi Yu got hurt when shooting,

580
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,220
so he's just living here temporarily.

581
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,880
By the way, Ayin,

582
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,490
I want to tell you

583
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,330
Taotao's parents are not in the hospital this week.

584
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,900
Really? That's great.

585
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,870
Indeed,

586
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,880
we haven't visited her for a long time.

587
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,860
You said it was inconvenient before.

588
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,070
Taotao?

589
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,760
Taotao is a friend of ours.

590
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,300
Yes.

591
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,650
But Taotao is sick

592
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,080
and has been hospitalized.

593
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,190
Have we

594
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,820
met before?

595
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:49,730
Really?

596
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,670
Ze just came back

597
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,690
from Beijing this morning.

598
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,220
How did you meet him?

599
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,490
Where?

600
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,450
Ridiculous.

601
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,580
I was in Beijing last month.

602
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,030
I just came back to Shanghai yesterday.

603
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,420
Ayin,

604
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,430
I'll pick you up first

605
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,570
when we visit Taotao this weekend.

606
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,730
Okay.

607
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,330
Well,

608
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,870
you two keep talking.

609
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,520
What have you been

610
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,860
busy with recently?

611
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,930
Working to make money.

612
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,410
Did you get burned?

613
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,150
Hurry. Go deal with it.

614
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,220
Hurry.

615
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,610
This...

616
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,930
How could this happen?

617
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,530
What should I do?

618
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,870
What should I do?

619
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,980
Jin Ayin, come and help!

620
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,370
Xiang Qinyu, did you do it on purpose?

621
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,270
I didn't mean it.

622
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,990
If the furniture gets damaged,

623
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,820
the landlord will be pissed off.

624
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,120
I'll go to the property management department.

625
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:24,820
You hold it here.

626
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:26,640
Hurry up.

627
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,510
Ayin, how about you use this blanket

628
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,510
to block the crack under the door?

629
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:30,750
Okay.

630
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,060
Don't remove your hands.

631
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,460
Ze,

632
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,910
keep an eye on it for me.

633
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,140
Don't let the water come out.

634
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,030
I'll be right back.

635
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:39,760
Okay.

636
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,390
Okay.

637
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:10,940
Chi Yu.

638
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,500
I should go.

639
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,280
What?

640
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,680
You

641
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,850
clean up yourself first.

642
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,870
I'll clean up myself too.

643
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,110
Ze,

644
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,160
why did you suddenly leave?

645
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,130
[Where there is light, there is shadow.]
