[Episode 26]

4
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,470
It's so serious.

5
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,180
Why didn't you go to the hospital to bandage it?

6
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,470
I'm fine.

7
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,600
Just a minor injury.

8
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,640
You call this a minor injury?

9
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,920
I've seen wolves in the wild.

10
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:45,970
My skin is thick.

11
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,250
Besides,

12
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,980
I might even enjoy the care of you.

13
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,040
Jin Chuan, can you promise me

14
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,020
no matter what you do in the future,

15
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,090
the bottom line is to protect yourself？

16
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,080
Don't let those who care about you worry about you anymore.

17
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,460
I saw

18
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,940
the message you left me.

19
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:28,060
Where have you been?

20
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,329
I had some problems at work

21
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,780
and I went to solve them.

22
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,260
Could it be

23
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,090
because of me and my sister?

24
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,010
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,230
I didn't mean to hide

26
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,540
the fact that Jin Ayin is my sister.

27
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,590
I was afraid

28
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,250
because of me,

29
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,590
you two would be influenced.

30
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,300
So in your heart,

31
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,400
I can't tell right from wrong?

32
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,220
No, that's not what I meant.

33
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,580
Don't be nervous.

34
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,750
It's really not because of that.

35
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,310
But

36
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,410
I want to talk to you

37
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,970
about us.

38
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,670
You really like drinking.

39
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,080
It can help me relax.

40
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,130
Drinking some is good for the mood.

41
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,470
Drinking too much is bad for your health.

42
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,210
You might be able to live to 100 years old if you don't drink.

43
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,590
What's the point of

44
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,650
living cautiously and being 100 years old?

45
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,260
That's what I like about you.

46
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:25,880
Straightforward?

47
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,860
That's because

48
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,150
since the first time I got the short end of the stick,

49
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,080
I knew that

50
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,580
as long as

51
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,140
you are capable,

52
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,610
you don't have to pretend.

53
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,860
Then why do you like me?

54
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,090
Just like the photo you took.

55
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,020
The fish in water and the lion in the painting

56
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,170
are from two completely different worlds.

57
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,990
But they met magically.

58
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,020
Maybe it can be

59
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,630
a wonderful journey.

60
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,200
But why can't they

61
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,550
have a happy ending?

62
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,940
This is why

63
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,550
I get angry because you stayed for me.

64
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,820
I know.

65
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,580
If it were another girl,

66
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,640
it would be

67
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,490
a happy thing.

68
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,570
But you really don't have to do this for me.

69
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,490
I don't need

70
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,030
a relationship in which two people sacrifice for each other.

71
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,780
Don't you want me to stay by your side?

72
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,860
But what I don't want more

73
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,740
is you changing yourself.

74
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,840
Do you want to hear

75
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,480
my old-fashioned first love story?

76
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,870
I don't tell everyone.

77
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,570
We were college classmates.

78
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,420
After graduation,

79
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,930
I came to Beijing with him.

80
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,420
When I really needed to work hard for myself,

81
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,740
I chose to

82
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,800
give him a warm home.

83
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,680
When he went out to work,

84
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,540
I stayed at home,

85
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,630
cleaning, cooking for him,

86
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,100
cleaning the floor, doing the laundry,

87
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,580
and preparing three meals a day.

88
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,940
My whole living space seemed to be home

89
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:41,880
and the grocery.

90
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,980
Until one day,

91
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,690
when I went grocery shopping,

92
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,830
I suddenly felt

93
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,020
I didn't want to live like this forever.

94
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,860
Then I threw the vegetables on the floor.

95
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,090
I told him at night

96
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,270
that I was leaving.

97
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,520
What's funny was

98
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,160
I didn't realize until then that

99
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,440
he was tired of it, too.

100
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,140
It's just a pity

101
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,200
to throw it away.

102
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,120
So do you understand now?

103
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,110
I don't let you stay for me

104
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,790
not only because you need to fulfill your dream,

105
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,020
but because...

106
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,250
Because I can't bear other people's lives.

107
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,470
If one day,

108
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,980
I have a better chance and need to leave,

109
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,620
I won't stay for you, either.

110
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,670
Or...

111
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,360
I'm a selfish woman from the beginning.

112
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:09,520
Chuan,

113
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,450
You can resent me,

114
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,740
or even hate me.

115
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,500
But if possible,

116
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,630
I really hope we can

117
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,620
learn something

118
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,940
from the circle of

119
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,540
owning temporarily but losing forever.

such a big thing happened?

00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,870
You disappeared on the day of the movie

173
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,900
and went to find some master for no reason.

174
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,030
I was waiting for you

175

to tell me what you have been doing lately?

176

But you,

you got into the hospital.

178
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,510
Thanks to Li Yongda's slip of the tongue on the set,

179
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,510
I found it out.

180

182
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,150
Don't talk nonsense.

What chance?

184
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,570
-I'll be angry if you keep talking. -I'm wrong.

-I'm sorry. -Stop right there.

Why is it here?

190
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,460
Did you win it back?

191
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,370
It's nothing.

192
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:37,260
Come on. Come on. Come on.

193
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:54,980
Look.

194
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,640
You really look like this dinosaur.

195
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,750
It looks like you.

196
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,220
Look at your short hands.

197
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,260
-It's so long. -Is it the same?

198
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,780
Your teeth are the same as its.

199
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,460
Look at your smile.

200

Look at your mouth.

201

-You look more alike when you smile. -Look at your smile.

202

-Look at the cheeks. -You’re just like it.

203
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,220
Look at the cheeks.

204
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,180
If I'm guilty,

your old-fashioned display of love.

208

Let's go to the hospital to see Taotao.

209

I'm sorry.

I... I don't know Ma is that kind of person.

214

It's okay.

215
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,300
I won't disturb you.

216
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,390
Well,

217

excuse me.

218
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,720
Can I have some of your time?

219
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,980
We want to know something.

220
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,020
Ma brought it here a few days ago.

221
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,050
Try it.

222
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,010
Every time he came,

223
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,630
he would bring different stuff for us nurses.

224
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,000
I said we could not accept it,

225
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,620
but I couldn't stop him.

226
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,150
We all know

227
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,400
he did this

228
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:38,870
for Taotao.

229
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,050
He came to see Taotao almost every day.

230
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,630
He

231
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,060
spent all his money

232
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,630
on the medical fees.

233
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,360
He believes that one day

234
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,810
she will wake up again.

235
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,580

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,400
that people cannot hold on because the patient is in hospital for too long.

237
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,830
But I've never seen

guarding someone no matter what.

240
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,750
Although Taotao has no family,

241
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,150
Ma treats her

242
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,960
really well.

243
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,310
I have other patients to take care of.

244
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,420
I'm leaving.

245
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,260
I'll pay for Taotao's fee.

246

No matter what Ze is like,

247
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,180
I'll take care of her.

Hello.

343
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,630
Yu.

344
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,030
Happy birthday.

345
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,520
Today is your birthday.

346
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,300
I...

347
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,430
I forgot.

348
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,440
Your mom said

349
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,140
you always spend your birthday

350
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,240
outside with your friends.

351
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,990
This year,

352
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,580
can we

353
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,700
spend your birthday

354
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,060
together as a family?

355
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:55,800
Okay.

356
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,610
OK.

357
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,210
Okay.

358
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,160
Well,

359
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,740
let's have dinner together tonight.

360
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,940
Sure.

361
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,000
See you tonight.

362
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,100
Do you think

363
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,450
they find out?

364
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,200
What?

365
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,260
I'm not their son.

366
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,000
No way.

367
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,240
I think their tone is weird.

368
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,250
I don't think so.

369
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,120
If they find out,

370
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,550
why would they celebrate your birthday?

371
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,820
But what if...

372
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,230
There's no what if.

373
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,180
Aren't you an actor?

374
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,940
You are experienced.

375
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,060
The supermarket is right ahead.

376
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,800
Let's go and see if there are any discounts.

377
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:52,890
Well...

378
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:53,740
How can four people

379
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,620
eat this much?

380
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,710
Didn't you say

381
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,830
70% off for shopping

382
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,430
equals to paying nothing?

383
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,510
This is too much.

384
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,810
It's the first time my girlfriend has got the chance to meet her parents-in-law.

385
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,680
It's good to prepare more.

386
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,100
This is courtesy.

387
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,230
Why are you blushing?

388
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:22,980
Let me see.

389
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,280
We are going to meet my parents soon.

390
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,640
Have you figured out how to introduce yourself?

391
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,910
Haven't I

392
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,950
met them before?

393
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,110
You're my girlfriend now.

394
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,070
What if they ask

395
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,370
how we met?

396
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,510
You can't say

397
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,210
I just appeared at your house, right?

398
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,110
Then how can I explain it?

399
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,950
Nonsense.

400
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,020
Teng Xi said

401
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,780
people making friends online

402
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,550
are

403
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,460
womanizers.

404
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,650
We're not like people like that.

405
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,670
Too vulgar.

406
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:16,680
How about this?

407
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,940
The plot can be regarded new

408
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,230
in my era.

409
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,470
Why don’t you change your career?

410
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,560
Jin Ayin,

411
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,630
if you are given another chance,

412
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,910
how do you want to start?

413
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,670
After thinking about it,

414
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,460
I still think

415
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,820
the way you came that day,

416
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,660
that I met you at my house,

417
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,850
is the best beginning.

418
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,710
A dark night,

419
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,990
when there were thunder and lightning,

420
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,540
you suddenly fell from the sky.

421
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,010
It's a bit thrilling,

422
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,330
but

423
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,550
no matter how romantic

424
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,820
our encounter becomes,

425
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,490
I think

426
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,620
it's not half as good as the reality.

427
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,050
Here you go again.

428
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,060
You pretended to kiss me

429
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,750
and you'll laugh at me when I'm ready.

430
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,410
I really want to this time...

431
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,300
You're playing hard to get.

432
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,840
I won't be fooled by you.

433
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:11,660
Ayin.

434
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,940
I really wanted to kiss you. I swear.

435
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,540
Go away, scumbag.

436
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,100
Go away.

437
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,050
Coming.

438
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,460
Auntie, Uncle.

439
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,220
You're here.

440
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,240
Come in.

441
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,570
Yu, happy birthday.

442
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,400
Thank you.

443
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,210
Uncle, Auntie,

444
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,920
Let's eat first.

445
00:30:59,170 --> 00:30:59,690
Have a seat.

446
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,690
Sit. Okay.

447
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,250
This house is quite nice.

448
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,870
Happy birthday to you.

449
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,430
Happy birthday to you.

450
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,980
Happy birthday to you.

451
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,050
Happy birthday to you.

452
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,860
-Happy birthday. -Happy birthday.

453
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,320
Yu, make a wish.

454
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,030
Well...

455
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,630
Thank you, Mom.

456
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,560
Thank you, Dad.

457
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,790
Blow out the candles.

458
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,200
They're a good match.

459
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,140
In the end,

460
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,800
they didn't ask me anything,

461
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,320
I was worried that I might act badly.

462
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:29,880
Alright.

463
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:30,990
Let me do it.

464
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,990
Go out and keep them company.

465
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,480
How cute.

466
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:41,760
Son,

467
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:45,140
this cat is really like Jin said that no one takes care of it?

468
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,030
Then I'll take it back to take care of it.

469
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,340
Don't worry.

470
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,100
I'm sure I will do it well.

471
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,770
Sure.

472
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,060
If I give it to you,

473
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,010
Ayin's friend and I can rest assured.

474
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,190
Kitty. Kitty.

475
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,220
I'm your owner now.

476
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,740
Look at me.

477
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,010
Honey. Honey.

478
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,040
Honey.

479
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,060
I...

480
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,230
I want to talk to our son.

481
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,980
You help Jin.

482
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,650
OK.

483
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,320
I'm leaving. Don't quarrel with each other.

484
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,960
Son, have a seat.

485
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,540
Jin, are you busy?

486
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,060
Auntie.

487
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,330
Here. Let me help you.

488
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,700
No, no.

489
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,870
-I can do it myself. -What else do you need to do?

490
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,780
-Have a seat. -Just sit and rest.

491
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,210
Sit.

492
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,250
Yu,

493
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,140
do you remember

494
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,660
when you were little,

495
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,180
there was a balcony like this in our old house?

496
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,610
One day,

497
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,210
you brought a box back,

498
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,130
saying it was a tent

499
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,520
and wanted to camp there.

500
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,310
That's the spot.

501
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,500
I got angry

502
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,050
and threw the box away.

503
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,290
You brat,

504
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,150
you just lied there for a night.

505
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,050
Your mother

506
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,889
forced me to buy you a real tent

507
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,909
the next day.

508
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,920
Thanks to that.

509
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,300
In that whole summer,

510
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,080
I never saw you sleep on your bed anymore.

511
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,659
Son,

512
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,690
since you were little,

513
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,960
I have been strict with you.

514
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,570
I know that

515
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:42,800
you are afraid of me.

516
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,900
But how many sons

517
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,810
aren't afraid of fathers in China?

518
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,510
Sometimes when I think about it,

519
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,260
I think your mother is right.

520
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,230
Why should I treat my son badly?

521
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,550
You've grown up day by day,

522
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,310
and I'm getting old

523
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,710
day by day.

524
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,050
Time

525
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,370
flies

526
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,130
when we are

527
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,200
still confronting each other day by day.

528
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:25,830
But

529
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,400
our stubbornness has its root.

530
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,220
When your grandpa was alive,

531
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,160
on one Mid-Autumn Festival,

532
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,710
he told me to take you back for dinner.

533
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,630
As a result.

534
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:41,880
I agreed.

535
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,120
But I forgot it because I was busy at school.

536
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,640
Your grandpa

537
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,780
scolded me for a whole month.

538
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,030
Do you remember?

539
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,340
I...

540
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:02,760
I remember it.

541
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,890
Actually, I haven't fully remembered

542
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,520
many things.

543
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,490
Today

544
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,060
is the happiest day for your mom

545
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,260
these days.

546
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,320
Thank you.

547
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,880
I

548
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,590
watched a TV series a while ago.

549
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,470
There is a line

550
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,060
that is very good.

551
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,570
The world

552
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,770
is an echo valley.

553
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,520
If you miss someone,

554
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,510
just shout out loud.

555
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,990
Sooner or later,

556
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,070
no matter how far he is from you,

557
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,510
he can still hear you.

558
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,120
You've grown to this big,

559
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,170
and I've never talked so much to you.

560
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,360
Why did I talk so much today?

561
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,170
Thank you.

562
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,410
All right.

563
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,700
Let's stop here.

564
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,090
We're leaving.

565
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,440
Honey,

566
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,640
let's go back.

567
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,340
It's still early.

568
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,250
Stay a bit longer.

569
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,200
-Come on. Have a seat. -Are you leaving or not?

570
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,100
If you don't leave, I'll leave first.

571
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,960
Okay.

572
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,880
Okay, wait.

573
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,030
Let's leave together.

574
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,150
Jin,

575
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,990
son,

576
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,370
we are leaving.

577
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,350
Come home when you have time.

578
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,920
I'll cook something delicious for you.

579
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,420
Thank you.

580
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,770
Bye.

581
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
Thank you. Please come again, Uncle.

582
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,880
Okay.

583
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,330
-Jin. -See you.

584
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,780
You should come to my house, too.

585
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,130
Son, take Jin to our house.

586
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,220
Well. Bye, Uncle and Auntie.

587
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,260
Take care.

588
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:05,820
Take care.

589
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:06,860
Bye.

590
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,510
Bye.

591
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,440
Jin Ayin.

592
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,070
I...

593
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,880
really envy Chi Yu.

594
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,940
Thank you, Mom.

595
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,310
Don't move.

596
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,260
Your hands are dirty.

597
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,120
Don't break it.

598
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,500
How is it?

599
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,200
Look, your Uncle Qian gave it to me.

600
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:53,990
Is it pretty?

601
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,410
Mom.

602
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,380
Today

603
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,010
is my birthday.

604
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,110
At that time, I thought

605
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,120
she finally remembered it once.

606
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:23,870
Even just once is good.

607
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,560
Did she come to you

608
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,320
after you became famous?

609
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,650
Didn't the book say

610
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,860
she had no children in her life?

611
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,420
She never accepted me.

612
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,860
Then, she's not as greedy

613
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,160
as you said.

614
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,340
If she really loved vanity,

615
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,430
she would want the whole world to know

616
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,370
you are her son.

617
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:56,620
That way,

618
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,620
she can make more money

619
00:40:58,850 --> 00:40:59,800
and become more famous.

620
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,580
In my opinion,

621
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,130
she just

622
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,130
wanted to make you think she's bad,

623
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,540
so that you wouldn't

624
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,250
have anything to do with her.

625
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,500
Sometimes,

626
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,390
we can't just listen to what others say,

627
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,960
but watch what they do.

628
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,740
Maybe

629
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,760
I'm the unqualified son.

630
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,740
Jin Ayin.

631
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,520
Thank you.

632
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:15,110
[The world is an echo valley.]

633
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:15,110

634
