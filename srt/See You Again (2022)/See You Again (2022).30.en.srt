174
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,620
It's lucky that the shooter girl noticed something wrong

175
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,620
and missed the target.

176
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,550
Otherwise,

177
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,650
something would have happened.

178
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,840
Fortunately,

179
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,750
you're lucky.

180
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,370
This time,

181
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,280
it's thrilling but the result is good.

182
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,180
Where is

183
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,590
that girl?

184
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,740
She...

185
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,380
She

186
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,730
is in the hands of the police.

187
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,350
Our director will definitely do you a favor

188
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,760
for your sake.

189
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,920
But that girl refused to leave herself.

190
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,020
She doesn't want to leave?

191
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,610
No.

192
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,230
We...

193
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,940
You stinky police.

194
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,680
You arrested me for no reason.

195
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:39,980
Cut the crap.

196
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,130
-And now you want to let me go? -Go away.

197
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,230
-Go! -No way.

198
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:42,730
Go.

199
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:43,850
Let go!

200
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,630
I told you

201
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,490
that gun is not mine,

202
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,820
but you didn't believe it.

203
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,260
If I hadn't been careful,

204
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,300
and shot him in the wrong direction,

205
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,200
Xiang

206
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,290
wouldn't be alive now.

207
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,480
Stop talking nonsense and go.

208
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,700
-Let go of me! -Let her go!

209
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,060
Go.

210
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,610
Let go!

211
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,450
Let go!

212
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,010
Go away.

213
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,460
Xiang Qinyu.

214
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,510
Are you alright?

215
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,510
I...

216
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,360
was just kidding.

217
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,160
Your name is...

218
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,010
Jinzi.

219
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,310
That means gold.

220
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,980
You saved me?

221
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,580
Yes.

222
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,370
When I got the gun,

223
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,700
I knew something was wrong.

224
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,440
Luckily, I was careful.

225
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,300
Otherwise, you would have...

226
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:54,730
Thank you.

227
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,140
You're welcome.

228
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,820
Well,

229
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,160
I...

230
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,220
I was prisoned here

231
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,180
because of you.

232
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,880
Do you think

233
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,660
you should

234
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,480
do something to pay me back?

235
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,540
Just one?

236
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,820
Why are you

237
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,150
so stingy as a big boss?

238
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,780
I'm your life saver.

239
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,200
I saved your life.

240
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,500
All to me?

241
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,640
Thank you.

242
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,110
Thank you.

243
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,700
I'm leaving.

244
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,960
I wish you a long life.

245
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,740
Bye.

246
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,140
Yu,

247
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,070
was it too much?

248
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,940
It's worth her whole year's salary.

249
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,390
This is

250
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,730
exactly like her.

251
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,140
Go in.

252
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,030
That money is mine.

253
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,870
He really doesn't take money seriously.

254
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,500
Come in, please.

255
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,450
Mr. Xiang is here.

256
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,200
The suspects

257
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,700
are all here.

258
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,630
Come on.

259
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,530
Raise your heads.

260
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,450
Stop pretending.

261
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,920
Little brat, raise your head.

262
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,290
It's him.

263
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:52,890
Handcuff him.

264
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,340
Yes.

265
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,940
Everyone,

266
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,360
there is no murderer here.

267
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,070
Mr. Xiang.

268
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,010
Look carefully.

269
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,030
How about

270
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,240
I ask them again carefully

271
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,980
and let them talk?

272
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,400
I'll let it go.

273
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,480
Let them go.

274
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,180
Yang Xiaoyun.

275
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,520
You did it for Yang Xiaoyun,

276
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,260
right?

277
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,160
[Tomb of the Late Sister Yang Xiaoyun]

278
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,320
If it weren't for you,

279
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,370
my sister would still be alive.

280
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,680
Xiaoyun shouldn't have died.

281
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,880
She's still so young.

282
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,970
Life should be the most precious to her.

283
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,150
She shouldn't have given up on herself so easily.

284
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:51,980
But now,

285
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,190
it's too late.

286
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,400
Leave.

287
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,190
Go.

288
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,800
Thank you.

289
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,830
These reporters

290
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,890
are talking nonsense.

291
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,860
Look.

292
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,030
Revenge.

293
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,220
What mistress?

294
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,220
What are they talking about?

295
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,640
They are slandering you.

296
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,030
So this is the reason

297
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,390
why people don't know my living status.

298
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,170
But don't worry.

299
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,370
Tomorrow.

300
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,030
I will let them send a statement.

301
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,240
Let's clarify this matter.

302
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,110
No need.

303
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,600
Go to the police station and the hospital.

304
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,450
From now on,

305
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,810
don't mention my issue again

306
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,680
to the outside world.

307
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,080
Only after I die,

308
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,610
Lin Hongzhi won't trouble you.

309
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,420
Have you decided

310
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,610
on the issue of Lin?

311
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,590
Give this

312
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,580
to Mr. Wang of the newspaper office.

313
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,210
This is Mr. Lin's personal scandal.

314
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,000
Make sure to make it public.

315
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,610
Yu,

316
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,770
aren't you afraid that Mr. Lin and the others...

317
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,630
Go.

318
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,220
What about the movie?

319
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,120
You don't want to film anymore?

320
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,470
No.

321
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,160
Okay.

322
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,180
By the way,

323
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,310
one more thing.

324
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,240
Do you remember Husheng?

325
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,180
That young man

326
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,870
has stayed downstairs for days and nights.

327
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,620
He just wanted to know if you're alive.

328
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:23,830
Do you want to meet him?

329
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,710
Where is he?

330
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:28,980
Just downstairs.

331
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,040
When I was little,

332
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,260
I went to the second-hand market with my dad

333
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,620
and got a small iron box.

334
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:25,730
In the iron box,

335
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,330
there was a clip of the Legend of Huangpu.

336
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,080
Your tie clip

337
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,800
was found inside, too.

338
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,400
Keep this

339
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,620
and put it in the box brought by Husheng.

340
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,720
She will get it in the future.

341
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:53,930
Who?

342
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,630
Yu.

343
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,430
That's your most precious thing.

344
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,500
Just keep it.

345
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,460
After I leave,

346
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,390
you can take Husheng to film.

347
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,330
Help him well.

348
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,430
Trust me.

349
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,010
He's great.

350
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,030
He'll make you rich.

351
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,230
What's wrong?

352
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:44,650
Yu,

353
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,650
after you woke up,

354
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,150
you seem to change.

355
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,050
Go now.

356
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,680
Give the letter to Mr. Wang.

357
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,220
Okay.

358
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,580
Extra! Extra!

359
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,140
Lin Hongzhi deceived a good woman

360
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,920
and forced her to be a prostitute to make profits.

361
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,500
Give me one.

362
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,230
Okay.

363
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,090
Give me a newspaper.

364
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,460
Here.

365
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,100
Mr. Lin.

366
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,370
Xiang Qinyu.

367
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,910
It must be Qinyu.

368
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,000
He did it.

369
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,590
Mr. Lin! Mr. Lin!

370
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,890
Mr. Lin, do you have anything to do

371
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,960
with Yang Xiaoyun's suicide?

372
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,780
Does it have anything to do with you?

373
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,440
It has nothing to do with me.

374
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,430
What do you think?

375
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,060
Alright.

376
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
The story

377
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,210
ends here.

378
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,700
What about Xiang Qinyu?

379
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,310
-Will he come back? -Give me a shock.

380
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,670
Will he

381
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,860
come back?

382
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,980
You can't do this.

383
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,440
Did you get someone to level up for you?

384
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,000
Come on!

385
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,500
Ayin.

386
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,950
So Xiang Qinyu

387
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,570
just disappeared in the end, right?

388
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,800
I think your story is not good.

389
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,740
So sad.

390
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,140
-Let's change one. -Yeah.

391
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,900
One more round.

392
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,120
Come on.

393
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,360
Hurry up.

394
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:38,990
Move your legs.

395
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:39,850
Yes, move it over.

396
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,290
Hurry up.

397
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,540
We're in a hurry.

398
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,580
Be careful. Don't break it.

399
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
You won't be able to afford it.

400
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,900
Even I can't afford it.

401
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,460
Hurry up.

402
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,300
Hurry up.

403
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,120
Move your legs.

404
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,500
Haven't you finished packing up?

405
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,260
Hurry up.

406
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,250
Put it in the car.

407
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,460
Go.

408
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,660
When can we finish moving all these things?

409
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,340
Hurry up.

410
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,440
Hurry up.

411
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,160
Tell me.

412
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,200
Hurry up, guys.

413
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,200
Come on.

414
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,860
Be careful.

415
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,340
You have to be careful, too.

416
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,720
This is valuable. I'm telling you.

417
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,260
Wait.

418
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,200
What did the doctor say?

419
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,320
Nothing serious.

420
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,340
That's good.

421
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:15,900
This time...

422
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,080
Will you come back

423
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,810
after you leave this time?

424
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,300
Yes.

425
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,750
But maybe many years later.

426
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,420
I want to see someone.

427
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,700
The Lin family has fallen.

428
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,910
What are you going to do next?

429
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,280
I don't know.

430
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,070
Apart from this,

431
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,540
I don't know anything else.

432
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,780
Don’t worry.

433
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,760
Mr. Lin is down.

434
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,700
Others will ask me to act.

435
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,340
It's good that you're gone.

436
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,290
You won't be troubled because of me anymore.

437
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,070
Alright.

438
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,700
You get ready for your move.

439
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,100
I'm leaving.

440
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,480
Let me take you away.

441
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,500
How about

442
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,410
you come with me?

443
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,900
I'll protect you from now on.

♫An open secret♫

469
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,550
The story is over,

470
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,740
but the people in the story are still there.

471
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,880
Maybe they are

472
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,590
everyone that passes me

473
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,860
on this road.

474
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,470
It's him and you.

475
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,110
Whether it's Yang Xiaoyun from 1936,

476
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,530
or Taotao from 2018.

477
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,460
Xiang Qinyu or Chi Yu.

478
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,770
Ze or myself.

479
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,480
What's different is appearance.

480
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,980
What's similar is life.

481
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,100
Each of us

482
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,060
has our own problems

483
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,140
to solve.

484
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,250
And the obstacles in life

485
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,070
can only be solved by ourselves.

486
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,100
Only in this way,

487
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,850
when we go back to normal days,

488
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,620
we can live without regrets and sadness.

489
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,929
The meaning of life

490
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,860
is never about success or fame,

491
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,190
but having feelings with people

492
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,570
and merging with the world.

493
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,440
I know.

494
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,170
No matter what era it is,

495
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,210
people will just rush forward.

496
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,420
Most people

497
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,699
will eventually be forgotten.

498
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,540
But your name,

499
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,850
and the courage you once gave me

500
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,340
are enough to prove that you've really been here.

501
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,830
As long as I remember,

502
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,510
you will never disappear,

503
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,210
and never have left.

504
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,290
Xiang Qinyu.

505
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,950
I will always remember it.

506
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,200
Because

507
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,410
I'm your last fan.

508
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,970
Before I leave,

509
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,490
I want to go to another place.

510
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:26,120
[Mengsheng Studios]

511
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,060
Tell me.

512
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,370
After Mr. Lin ran away,

513
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,840
what will happen to Mengsheng?

514
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,910
Just do your work.

515
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,360
Why do you care so much?

516
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,350
Without Mr. Lin,

517
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,730
there will be Mr. Wang and Mr. Zhang.

518
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,520
There will be people doing movies.

519
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:55,950
Let's go.

520
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,940
Luckily, you took a leave.

521
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,090
Otherwise, the trip would have failed again.

522
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,550
I promised to accompany you.

523
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,010
I won't break my promise no matter what.

524
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,590
Let's go watch a movie tonight.

525
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,910
Are you thinking about me?

526
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,570
I promised you.

527
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,310
So I don't want to break my promise.

528
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,120
I came here with you many times.

529
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,450
But it was not officially

530
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,520
to travel around here with you.

531
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,980
This is where I first filmed a movie.

532
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,350
Back then, I took my career as my life.

533
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,550
I would just jump off buildings.

534
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,540
That would be dangerous.

535
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:11,770
Luckily, you're fine.

536
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,370
Yes.

537
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,720
But now,

538
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,870
I will ask for wire

539
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,820
and protection measures.

540
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,500
Because I know

541
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,510
my Ayin will be worried.

542
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:01,690
Ayin.

543
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:02,550
It's done!

544
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,470
It's done, Jin Ayin.

545
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,910
Mumu read your script and said it was great.

546
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:09,260
It's Mumu.

547
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,860
The top producer of Jianghe,

548
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,360
Chen Mumu said it was good.

549
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,880
Reveal the death of the film historian

550
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,400
and clear his name.

551
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,600
You didn't make this up, did you?

552
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,790
Not bad.

553
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,860
You can even write a script in your dream.

554
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,450
Hello?

555
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,520
Ayin.

556
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,540
Are you listening?

557
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:37,360
Hello?

558
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:42,450
This isn't a dream.

559
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,120
What?

560
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:44,260
Hello?
