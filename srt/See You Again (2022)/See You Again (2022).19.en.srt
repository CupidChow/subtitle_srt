[Episode 19]

4
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,539
Chen Mumu, are you out of your mind?

5
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,390
How are you going to explain

6
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,580
in front of so many people?

7
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,130
You scared me.

8
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,100
Jin Abao,

9
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,920
let me ask you.

10
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,430
Do you know who she is?

11
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,440
Who?

12
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,850
Chen Mumu?

13
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,350
She's my boss.

14
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,320
No wonder she's here today.

15
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,210
I really don't know your relationship with her.

16
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,060
Do you want to make me get into trouble?

17
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,670
I'm warning you.

18
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,230
Stay away from her.

19
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,220
Do you know

20
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,930
how hard it was for me to sign the contract with her?

21
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,420
If she finds out about our relationship,

22
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,120
for someone like her who always separates work from private interests,

23
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,640
she'll fire me.

24
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,220
You always fool around.

25
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,180
Maybe you'll

26
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,460
quarrel with her and break up with her.

27
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,860
Then I'll be so miserable.

28
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,290
No.

29
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,950
I don't agree.

30
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,930
Don't worry.

31
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,170
She doesn't even like me.

32
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,920
Miss Mumu, you're still as good as ever.

33
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,070
How could you kiss such a young man?

34
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,230
Is he young?

35
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,790
It's true that he's clingy.

36
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,940
I'm warning you one last time.

37
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,260
Never...

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,840
Never let her know I'm your elder sister.

39
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:24,760
Otherwise,

40
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,430
I'll kill myself in front of you.

41
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,460
Let's go.

42
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,050
It was Teng Xi before.

43
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,160
Now it's Miss Mumu.

44
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,680
My brother-in-law is good.

45
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,840
It looks like I need to learn from him.

46
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:11,980
Longda,

47
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:12,940
well,

48
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,090
thank you for today.

49
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,870
I have something to do.

50
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,190
I have to go.

51
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:17,790
No.

52
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,180
Aren't you going to have dinner?

53
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,340
Forget it.

54
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,720
I have an appointment with Chi Yu.

55
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,060
I have to go now.

56
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,820
The important thing you said

57
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,060
is the appointment with Chi Yu.

58
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,130
Let me give you a ride.

59
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,420
I just want to give you a ride.

60
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,040
Just now...

61
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,030
Where's your car?

62
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,540
There are a lot of people today.

63
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,740
I parked it at the next street.

64
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,630
Let me walk with you there.

65
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,360
What's that?

66
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,420
Hello, sir. What would you like?

67
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,490
You can take a look.

68
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,940
This is a lipstick.

69
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,560
It's very nice.

70
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,180
I want this.

71
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,180
Ten yuan for one.

72
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,900
You can scan here and pay for it.

73
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,100
Done.

74
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,010
Thank you.

75
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,980
I don't need these things.

76
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,820
It's quite moisturizing.

77
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,290
It tastes sweet.

78
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,390
Smell it.

79
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,280
Does it smell like flowers?

80
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,390
I didn't expect girls' stuff

81
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,020
to be so sweet.

82
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,740
Okay. I won't bother you.

83
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,600
Let's call it a day.

84
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,380
Okay.

85
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,060
Have a good rest.

86
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,490
I'm leaving.

87
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,450
Bye. Bye.

88
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,660
Come on. Time to act.

89
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,340
Today's work is finished.

90
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,020
Today's work is finished.

91
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,590
Come on. The props.

92
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,060
Since childhood,

93
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,740
I've been longing for a dress like this.

94
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,080
Just wait for him here.

95
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,030
Actually,

96
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,800
you don't have to wait with me.

97
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,110
I'm worried about you being alone.

98
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,580
I'll leave when he comes.

99
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,090
Then...

100
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,040
Thank you.

101
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,210
When did you become so polite to me?

102
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,830
Chi Yu.

103
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:58,810
You...

104
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,430
have been caring about him all the time?

105
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,570
I do care about him.

106
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:07,940
Because...

107
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,500
Right.

108
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,300
Even if you want to push him away,

109
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,090
you have to wait until his memory recovers.

110
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,020
Otherwise,

111
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,030
it'll be so inhumane.

112
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,280
Longda.

113
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,980
It's late.

114
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:23,680
It's windy now.

115
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,620
Let me get you a piece of clothes.

116
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:25,990
Longda.

117
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,220
No need.

118
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,210
Thank you.

119
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,180
Sir, your flowers are ready.

120
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,070
The Baby's Breath is a type of dry flowers.

121
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,580
It's perfect to give it to a patient.

122
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,820
Let me wrap it up for you.

123
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,610
Okay. Thank you.

124
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,910
Hello, sir.

125
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,380
What kind of flower do you like?

126
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,460
What do you need?

127
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,150
Is there

128
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,530
something special?

129
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,450
Not roses.

130
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,300
Something special?

131
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,750
How about these Preserved Flowers?

132
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,230
They're made of Hydrangeas and Butterfly Orchids.

133
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,310
It means never to wither and never to leave.

134
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,740
It does look nice,

135
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,290
But it doesn't match

136
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,240
with her temperament.

137
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,880
I'll buy that one.

138
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,130
Cactus.

139
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,300
This is more like her.

140
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,080
Although it has thorns all over it,

141
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,480
it's quite cute.

142
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,320
Sir,

143
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,030
you have a special taste.

144
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,870
How long have you been with your girlfriend?

145
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,600
Come to think of it,

146
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,770
she has known me for about 20 years.

147
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,960
Twenty years?

148
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,920
Gosh.

149
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,930
You're childhood sweethearts, aren't you?

150
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,700
Sir, please wait a moment.

151
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,490
Let me wrap it up for you.

152
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,460
He's late.

153
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,670
Ayin,

154
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,370
I...

155
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,060
Ayin,

156
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,870
I thought about it for a long time.

157
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,250
I have something to tell you.

158
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,090
Longda,

159
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,260
I have something to tell you, too.

160
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,780
I know what you want to say.

161
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,930
But

162
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,870
could you not say it?

163
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,520
Don't worry about anything.

164
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,150
Just prepare for your confession in two days.

165
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:54,740
Yes.

166
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,860
Confession.

167
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,420
In fact,

168
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
I've been

169
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,850
glad to be friends with you.

170
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,600
In my mind,

171
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,450
you are the one

172
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,730
whom I would ask for help when I'm in trouble.

173
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,720
Of course,

174
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,790
if you have any difficulties,

175
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,770
I'm also willing to be

176
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,030
the one to protect you in the front.

177
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,190
-But... -Stop it.

178
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,780
I understand what you mean.

179
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,300
But I want to try again.

180
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:41,820
Jin Ayin.

181
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,230
Why is it so dirty?

182
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,490
What happened?

183
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,260
I got the dirt while shooting the drama.

184
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,650
It doesn't matter.

185
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,270
It was all your fault for being late.

186
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,800
I didn't eat the steak because of it.

187
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,720
Tell me.

188
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,630
How will you compensate me?

189
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,350
What's wrong?

190
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,930
Did Director Feng suddenly

191
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,470
add more scenes to you today?

192
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,120
Don't pull a long face.

193
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,260
I'm a tolerant woman.

194
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,150
I forgive you.

195
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,790
There are two chicken cutlets there.

196
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,150
Since

197
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,090
we didn't eat the steak,

198
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,540
let's make do with them.

199
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,420
Ayin,

200
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,220
I'm not feeling well.

201
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,780
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:37,970
What's wrong?

203
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,160
Did you get hurt during the shooting?

204
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,690
I'm fine.

205
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,830
What's wrong with you?

206
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,690
Are you jealous?

207
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:51,890
Because of Longda?

208
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,620
He merely

209
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,110
gave me a ride as he was worried that there were too many people.

210
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:01,600
I...

211
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,240
have had dinner.

212
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,010
You've had dinner?

213
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,580
But

214
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,850
we promised to have dinner together.

215
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,060
I...

216
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,720
I really don't feel well today.

217
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,690
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,830
Rest early.

219
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,000
Then tomorrow...

220
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,020
Tomorrow

221
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,710
let's have chicken cutlets.

222
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,030
Sure.

223
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,940
Can I park the car here?

224
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,030
Alright.

225
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,740
It's getting late.

226
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:14,700
Rest early.

227
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,770
Well,

228
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,740
I'm going back.

229
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:38,960
Wait.

230
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,640
Don't you have anything to say to me?

231
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,570
Yes.

232
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,880
In the future, when something like this happens,

233
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,790
don't make yourself suffer.

234
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,070
Besides,

235
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,970
you're not incompetent in love.

236
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,310
In my mind,

237
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,530
you are cuter than any other woman.

238
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,270
Do you understand?

239
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,240
Go back.

240
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,430
The little turtle is missing.

241
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,150
You...

242
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,150
You...

243
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,420
Would you like to go upstairs and help me look for it?

244
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,240
♫The moment I saw you♫

245
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,370
♫I had sensed danger♫

246
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,380
♫And that's what life is like♫

247
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,070
Sure.

248
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,150
♫It's so fierce that I can't resist it♫

249
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,320
♫I miss you madly♫

250
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,370
♫Can't you feel it?♫

251
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,060
♫When love comes♫

252
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,260
♫It might happen in the afternoon♫

253
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,920
♫On a Tuesday in September♫

254
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,450
♫Like the person whom you're with now♫

255
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,940
If you don't eat, I'll eat it myself.

256
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,550
Is he really jealous?

257
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,300
Yes.

258
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,070
He must be jealous.

259
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,080
Sorry.

260
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,730
The number you have dialed is not available.

261
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,440
This brat.

262
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,010
He didn't answer my call at the critical moment.

263
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,160
What does it mean?

264
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,210
The one who helps with the last push

265
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,550
looks more handsome.

266
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,130
Catch the chance.

267
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,660
There's ten minutes left,

268
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,810
and this day will be over.

269
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,560
[Don't miss a single buck. Do it now.]

270
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,900
Do it now.

271
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,320
Yes.

272
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,300
The timing.

273
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,220
Xiang Qinyu,

274
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,780
I have something to tell you.

275
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:44,810
Don't turn around.

276
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,090
I'm worried that I can't say it.

277
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,150
To me,

278
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,900
you are a cold,

279
00:21:59,360 --> 00:21:59,900
selfish

280
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,700
and self-righteous man.

281
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,900
Every time I quarreled with you,

282
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,260
and was bullied by you,

283
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,210
how I wished I could strangle you to death.

284
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,040
But

285
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,040
I think

286
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,810
it seems that

287
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,170
I've started to change.

288
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,950
I'm different from before.

289
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,140
I started to look forward to you being here

290
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,480
when I came home every day.

291
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,480
Every time I said good night,

292
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,860
I could get your response.

293
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,330
Those things made me happy

294
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,500
because

295
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,290
I could share them with you.

296
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,030
You said

297
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,950
after you found out about the truth,

298
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,010
you would go back.

299
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,690
I've thought about it carefully.

300
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,580
if you disappear one day,

301
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,730
I think I can accept it.

302
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,490
However,

303
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,660
I don't want that day to come.

304
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,820
I don't want to

305
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,780
be as alone as I

306
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,710
used to be.

307
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,920
Xiang Qinyu.

308
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,100
Can you stay here?

309
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,710
Can you

310
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,060
stay here for my sake?

311
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,650
Are you looking for me?

312
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,580
Jin Ayin,

313
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,200
you idiot!

314
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,420
Bye.

315
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,180
Thank you.

316
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,890
Are you looking for me?

317
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,860
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

318
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,490
It's not easy to see you.

319
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,630
Why do you always cover your face?

320
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,180
Since you don't want to take it off,

321
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,830
let me help you.

322
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,910
You want to kill people with such bad Kungfu skills?

323
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,230
Who is it?

324
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,340
What are you doing?

325
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,200
You run?

326
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,170
Four past

327
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,110
seven at night.

328
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,040
It's the time I came here.

329
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:00,930
Yu,

330
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,050
you saw it with your own eyes.

331
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:04,870
Your hand...

332
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,620
Did such a thing really happen?

333
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,460
It's true.

334
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,560
But...

335
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,420
Why?

336
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,180
I almost forgot

337
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,830
I don't belong here.

338
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,100
Even a lucky person

339
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,540
had a chance to survive,

340
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,540
he'll only go back to where he stared.

341
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,100
You mean

342
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,370
you will be back to the old times?

343
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,820
Back to

First,

on the basis of moral standards,

410
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,480
both parties voluntarily promise

411

not to lie to each other

if the two parties encounter a conflict that can't be defined,

Once a person is attracted to another person of different gender,

465
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,810
he or she will unconsciously focus all his or her

attention to every activity which this very person does.

467

At this stage,

it's mainly shown as unrequited love.

How do you explain it?

474

Pursuit of love

475
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,220
means

476
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,520

By the way,

In the past,

493
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,300

Where are you going?

500
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,280
Mr. Di wants to take me to meet someone.

501
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,560
Maybe he can help me find a way back.

502

00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:56,810
looking for someone.

515
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,930
So your friend works

516
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,080
nearby?

517
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,700
Not a friend exactly.

518
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:08,860
Have you come

519
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,270
to visit Taotao?

520
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,040
No.

521
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,340
Well,

522
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,980
Taotao's parents are here.

523
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,200
Normally, they don't allow others to visit her.

524
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,560
I happen to have a client nearby.

525
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,570
I came to adjust the software and equipment for him.

526
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,140
By the way,

527
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,680
I want to ask you something.

528
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,640
Have you seen this before?

529
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,840
This...

530
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,640
No.

531
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,040
Do you know where I can buy this?

532
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,540
For something like this,

533
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,840
you can find many on the Internet.

534
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,670
It doesn't seem special.

535
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,210
Does it have a special meaning to you?

536
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,980
Thank you, young men.

537
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,490
You're welcome.

538
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:16,920
Thank you.

539
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,130
Thank you.

540
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,560
Thank you, young men.

541
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,980
Thanks, young men.

542
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,940
Thank you.

543
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,740
You're welcome.

544
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:57,830
Thank you.

545
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:59,770
You're welcome.

546
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:00,970
Weren't you helping, too?

547
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,450
Then...

548
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,440
I have to go.

549
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,040
Okay.

550
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,810
See you later.

551
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,040
Chi Yu.

552
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,850
Ayin told me you are shooting a movie.

553
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,380
What is it?

554
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,980
The Legend of Xiang Qinyu.

555
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,580
What role do you play?

556
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,490
Xiang Qinyu.

557
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:29,900
Congratulations.

558
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,440
You're already the leading actor now.

559
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,680
You'll get the Golden Movie Award sooner or later as you wish.

560
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:36,500
By the way,

561
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:37,750
if you have the chance,

562
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,210
take me to the crew for a look.

563
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:43,750
Sure.

564
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,350
I'm leaving.

565
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:46,880
Bye.

566
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,810
Have you revised the script of Scene 46?

567
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,890
Come to the shooting site now.

568
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:33,620
Are you looking for me?

569
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,270
[People all say that you'll meet your love around the corner.]

570
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,270
[But maybe my life is a circle.]
