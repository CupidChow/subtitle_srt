4
00:01:58,729 --> 00:01:59,370
Yu.

5
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,870
Yu, are you okay?

6
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,150
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,220
I scared you.

8
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,480
It's okay.

9
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,040
It's my own problem.

10
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,600
Yu.

11
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,840
You haven't recovered yet?

12
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,340
Don't you remember me?

13
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,579
I'm Tuotuo.

14
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,060
Have you forgotten?

15
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:55,160
I wore a mask before.

16
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,320
And we

17
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,590
met in other teams before.

18
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,930
Yes.

19
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,660
Yu, I heard that

20
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,690
you had an accident recently,

21
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,870
and you lost part of your memory.

22
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,670
Yes.

23
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,380
No wonder there were so many misunderstandings before.

24
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,490
What are you here for?

25
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,740
We're ready for shooting.

26
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,540
Okay.

27
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,880
I'll be there after tidying here up.

28
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,870
Don't worry. I'll do it.

29
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,700
I'll get someone to do it.

30
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,460
Let's go.

31
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,430
Please.

32
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,220
I was so scared.

33
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,630
I almost got caught.

34
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,880
Where is it?

35
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,170
See if it's good.

36
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,210
Okay.

37
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,570
Done.

38
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,000
Hao.

39
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,620
I heard them say

40
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,210
Chi Yu did lose his memory.

41
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,020
Well...

42
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,800
Can you

43
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,890
give me the money?

44
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,290
Why did he choose here

45
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,940
instead of the exhibition center?

46
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:43,610
Here.

47
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,230
Be careful.

48
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:49,880
Here.

49
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,040
What is all this mess?

50
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,920
Still seem so unreliable.

51
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,900
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,870
It's okay.

53
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,450
Are you okay?

54
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,350
Why are you here?

55
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,130
Isn't there an exhibition?

56
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,130
I'm here for the exhibition.

57
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,320
What a coincidence.

58
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,880
It hasn't started yet.

59
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,570
That further proves that we are so destined

60
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,320
that we even meet here.

61
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,070
Are you following me?

62
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,720
No.

63
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,830
Absolutely not.

64
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,130
I'm here to bring you breakfast.

65
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,210
Sister.

66
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,460
Why are you here?

67
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,920
Why am I here?

68
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,400
Tell me why I'm here.

69
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,490
Sister?

70
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,860
You left without a word.

71
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,420
I only asked others to know that you're here.

72
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,210
I've been busy with the exhibition.

73
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,330
It's such a mess,

74
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,550
with only a few people working for this.

75
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,350
It's in our family genes

76
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,330
to be poor.

77
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,430
What a coincidence.

78
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,120
I happen to be the jinx

79
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,500
of this kind of family genes.

80
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,210
One, two, one.

81
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,550
One, two, one.

82
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,160
Halt.

83
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,280
Turn right.

84
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,570
Okay, get to work.

85
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,850
Okay, dismissed.

86
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,180
You're welcome.

87
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,180
Brother-in-law.

88
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,800
Come on, give me a hand.

89
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,900
My second brother-in-law

90
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,560
is much better than my first brother-in-law.

91
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,710
What are you talking about?

92
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,809
The first and second brother-in-law?

93
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,250
The first brother-in-law

94
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,169
is the one who hit me last time.

95
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,210
This is my

96
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,120
second brother-in-law.

97
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,290
They are not.

98
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,270
You should cherish them.

99
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,790
I can count with my fingers

100
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,450
the number of male around you.

101
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,640
This time,

102
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,530
you not only rarely attract men,

103
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,000
but two of them.

104
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,260
This is the only time.

105
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,170
Unprecedented and won't happen again.

106
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,720
Awesome.

107
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:09,860
Get lost!

108
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,250
Get back to work.

109
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,890
Wipe this spot till it's so bright that it reflects light.

110
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,630
Come on, this way up. Come on.

111
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,420
Guys.

112
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,890
Yes, higher.

113
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,380
You.

114
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,060
Okay.

115
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,570
Longda.

116
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,160
Fix that end too.

117
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,230
Yes.

118
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,780
Be careful when moving it.

119
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,430
Okay, it's fixed.

120
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,870
Throw it down.

121
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,300
Hold on.

122
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,920
Be careful.

123
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,350
Throw it.

124
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,190
Okay.

125
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,460
Haoran.

126
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Keep it steady for me.

127
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,110
Okay.

128
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,020
Okay?

129
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,320
Very good.

130
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:21,980
Okay.

131
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,890
You must go on that date now, right?

132
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,540
Do you think

133
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,610
people will really buy these photos?

134
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,850
Poverty limits your imagination.

135
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,790
Don't hit me.

136
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,420
After all,

137
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,230
I'm the head of the library now.

138
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,790
More like the idiot of the library.

139
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,320
You're quite different now.

140
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,390
You look

141
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,750
quite decent.

142
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,710
But

143
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,280
are you shooting people

144
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,560
or animals?

145
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,690
Why is there a human portrait here?

146
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,250
Don't you think

147
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,220
he resembles our dad?

148
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,540
When I took this photo,

149
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,620
his family died

150
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,410
because of an earthquake.

151
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,620
But even so,

152
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,180
this child could sleep well

153
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,810
because his dad was still there.

154
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,540
Do you remember

155
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,100
when we were little,

156
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,980
every time dad got his paycheck,

157
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,930
he would bring us home a pack of candies.

158
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,500
Yes, I do.

159
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,790
He gave the bigger half to you first every time.

160
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,540
Unconsciously,

161
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,510
18 years have passed.

162
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,190
How long has it been since you called mom?

163
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,730
I called her only

164
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,380
two months ago.

165
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,190
Two months ago?

166
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,590
Why didn't you say last year?

167
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,330
Tonight.

168
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,380
No.

169
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,230
Now. Call her now.

170
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:13,880
I'll watch you.

171
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,040
I won't.

172
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,310
I don't know what to say.

173
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,500
Just greet her.

174
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,510
Ask her

175
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,880
how she is doing recently.

176
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,810
It's awkward.

177
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,930
Why is it awkward talking to your own mother?

178
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:28,950
You don't understand.

179
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,960
Boys are different from girls.

180
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,880
When you have nothing to say

181
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,660
on the phone,

182
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,690
just play cute or play rascal.

183
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,850
But I can't.

184
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,740
Abao.

185
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,800
I know you can't understand her.

186
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,750
But our dad's last wish

187
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,910
is for our mom to be happy, right?

188
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,140
Just give her a call

189
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,890
and talk to her.

190
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:25,760
You know

191
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,660
if it weren't for mom,

192
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,850
I wouldn't have left grandma alone at home with no worries.

193
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,620
Grandma is old.

194
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:35,980
She needs someone to take care of her.

195
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,010
You're a man.

196
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,930
Stop dawdling.

197
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,230
I don't care.

198
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,500
I'll call mom tomorrow night.

199
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,870
Before that,

200
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,320
you must call her.

201
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,600
If you don't,

202
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,840
I'll teach you a lesson.

203
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,370
Besides,

204
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,610
call grandma as well.

205
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,360
I'm tired. I'm going home.

206
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,970
I'm not coming tomorrow. I have other things to do.

207
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,790
No need.

208
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,490
I'll finish it by myself tomorrow.

209
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,050
I'm going to watch football tomorrow night.

210
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,760
What a layabout.

211
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:14,530
By the way,

212
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,590
after you sell all these,

213
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,410
pay the workers Longda called in.

214
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,110
It's not family-sponsored?

215
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,020
Don't forget it.

216
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:29,930
I'll see you off.

217
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,750
Where is Ayin?

218
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:37,990
She left.

219
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:38,740
Left?

220
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,590
[THE EARTH IMAGE]

221
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,130
Ye, I've been here for quite a while.

222
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,100
Why aren't you coming down?

223
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,650
How can they show us a script of such quality?

224
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,260
If the next draft is still this bad,

225
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,720
terminate the contract immediately. I'll bear the loss.

226
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,120
Compared to money,

227
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,540
time is more precious.

228
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,770
Yes, got it, Miss Mumu.

229
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,810
Are you here to discuss your script?

230
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,100
Yes.

231
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,880
Come up with me.

232
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,770
I'll be frank.

233
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,859
I've read the whole story.

234
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,329
It's not as good as what Jian Ye described.

235
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,950
It's a creative story,

236
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,700
but the comedy points are too scattered.

237
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,160
And I'm not very satisfied with the characters either.

238
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,850
Miss Mumu,

239
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,500
actually I'm here today

240
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,920
not only for the script modification,

241
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,390
but also this.

242
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,820
[A Troublesome Old Idol]

243
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,150
This is the latest version.

244
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,420
I have modified

245
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,700
many parts.

246
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,860
And I straightened out

247
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,540
the whole story again.

248
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,940
I also replaced many clips

249
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,810
with more interesting content.

250
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,230
Also,

251
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,880
I have pictures and explanation

252
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,980
for any part that may cause misunderstanding.

253
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,230
Please take a look.

254
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,340
But the story in this script

255
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,420
has a compact rhythm.

256
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,900
The main idea is also clear.

257
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,900
It's small and easy to compress cost.

258
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,040
It's a good low-cost movie.

259
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,990
We can give it a try.

260
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,260
More importantly,

261
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,520
I see something more precious

262
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,520
in your story,

263
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,210
which is sincerity.

264
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,010
After all,

265
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,790
sense of responsibility is far more important than talent nowadays.

266
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,250
And the fact is

267
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,290
you are really sincere.

268
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,380
This is Jianghe's full-time screenwriter contract.

269
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,540
If you sign it,

270
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,630
every year,

271
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,180
you have to provide the company with a project

272
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,900
for three consecutive years.

273
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,960
And "A Troublesome Old Idol"

274
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,060
will be your first project.

275
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,710
I will push forward this project as soon as possible

276
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,910
and find a suitable leading creator.

277
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,490
For a long time to come,

278
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,860
I will keep asking you

279
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,820
and proposing various modifying suggestions to you.

280
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,170
I hope you can respond actively.

281
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,140
Don't forget

282
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,890

283
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,220
at the party.

284
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,950
Don't let me down.

285
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,820
Thank you, Miss Mumu.

286
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,750
Look forward to your joining in Jianghe Studios.

287
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,310
Thank you.

288
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,410
What's going on?

289
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,330
I just got downstairs and

290
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,110
heard that you and Miss Mumu came up together.

[Screenwriter Contract]

Don't forget about me when you get rich.

Come on.

296
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,970
Tell me about the details.

297
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,330
You have no idea

298
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,560
when she was reading the script with no reaction,

299
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,340
I was so nervous that I wanted to rush up

300
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,590
and shake her shoulder

301
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,150
and ask her

302
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,180
to say something.

303
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,950
Of course, I dared not.

304
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,890

Come with me to have some fun later.

I'll show you the fancy world.

Not today.

You are going to be a full-time screenwriter.

It's such a big deal.

313
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,040
Isn't it worth celebrating?

314
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,740
No.

The male lead and the supporting actor are both after you.

320
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,270
You didn't neglect either of them.

321
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,590
It seems that I was too naive

322
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:14,960
and underestimated you.

323
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,030
Stop.

324
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,150
Don't think too much.

00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,780
There's nothing between me and them.

Alright.

like a parrot.

346
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,590
Where are you going?

347
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,040
I'm going to

348
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,630
hang out with girls.

349
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,320
What did he mean by "hang out with girls"?

350
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,450
What does "hang out with girls" mean?

351
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,610
Hanging out with girls means

352
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,720
dating with someone and making her one's girlfriend.

353
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,520
No.

354
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,280
What does it have to do with me?

355
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,890
Anyone could do,

356
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,900
but not him.

357
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,070
Longda.

358
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,660
Why are you here so early?

359
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,670
Why did you come back from outside?

360
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:04,680
Why didn't you

361
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,680
ask me to drive you?

362
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,330
I just went out to run some errands.

363
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,170
Besides,

364
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,410
the bus is very convenient.

365
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:11,840
Well,

366
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:12,900
let's go.

367
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,220
Where are we going?

368
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,510
Why are you here?

369
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,530
Right.

370
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,390
Why did you run here?

371
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,540
I'm looking for Li Longda.

372
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,820
What do you want me for?

373
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,210
I checked the scenes we'll shoot tomorrow.

374
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,930
They're all important scenes

375
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,910
with loads of actions involved.

376
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,810
The one where you go to the cruise prom with your junior sister apprentice.

377
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,490
Come with me first.

378
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,860
I'll personally guide you.

379
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,570
Haven't they deleted the scene?

380
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,150
Yes, it has been deleted.

381
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,130
Deleted?

382
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:54,980
-Yes. -Yes.

383
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,960
Here's the thing.

384
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,940
I recalled some details about that day.

385
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,520
Very detailed.

386
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,530
If you don't go with me now,

387
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,490
I'll make it public.

388
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:15,970
Well...

389
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,340
Go ahead.

390
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,400
Let's see what's good for you if everyone knows.

391
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,540
Go. Just do it.

392
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,190
Go.

393
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,030
Come on, Ayin.

394
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,170
Let's get going already.

395
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,870
Otherwise, we will miss the market.

396
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,950
Let's go.

397
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,860
Li Longda.

398
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:34,910
I don't care.

399
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,580
I have to run the lines

400
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,160
with you today.

401
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,040
Longda, how about

402
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,810
you two get your work done first?

403
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,830
We'll meet another day.

404
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,390
Bye.

405
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,960
How about...

406
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,640
Well...

407
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,730
How about

408
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,550
do re mi fa?

409
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
There's no fa, just...

410
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,380
Let's go together.

411
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,340
He won't want to go.

412
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,570
Is this the place that you think is really fun

413
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,860
and makes wishes come true?

414
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,510
Yes.

415
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,350
It's already dark when we're here.

416
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,290
What do you know?

417
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,420
Look.

418
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,070
Jin Ayin is so happy.

419
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,150
And I didn't ask you to come in the first place.

420
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,690
Why do you have to like it?

421
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,340
Boring.

422
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,600
Ayin, what are you looking at?

423
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,530
Buy everything you like.

424
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,880
No need.

425
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,360
I'm just looking around.

426
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,110
Yeah.

427
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,880
Can't she buy it herself?

428
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,090
You're here to ruin our moods, aren't you?

429
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,200
Chi Yu.

430
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,790
Don't be angry.

431
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,420
We can buy something else if you don't like it, right?

432
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,480
There are more interesting things inside.

433
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,180
Let's go inside.

434
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,100
Let's go.

435
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,040
Wait.

436
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,170
Isn't she cute?

437
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,590
I like her more and more.

438
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,510
And I'll keep liking her.

439
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,610
Ayin, wait for me!

440
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:21,670
Jin Ayin.

441
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,610
It looks dirty.

442
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,750
Be careful of diarrhea.

443
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,580
Boss, one please.

444
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,150
Sugar painting.

445
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,330
Which one do you want?

446
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,040
Get whatever you like.

447
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,240
I want Sun Wukong.

448
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,540
Sun Wukong is the Monkey King.

449
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,400
He can make 72 metamorphoses.

450
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,020
Sun Wukong.

451
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,960
-Sun Wukong. Sun Wukong. -Come on.

452
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,100
Pigsy?

453
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,380
I like Pigsy.

454
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,710
He loves to eat and sleep. He's lucky.

455
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,430
I like him too.

456
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,150
He's not competitive.

457
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,360
And he's very popular.

458
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,190
Childish.

459
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,300
How much is it, boss?

460
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,160
40 yuan.

461
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:05,770
Just right.

462
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,710
There's one already painted over there.

463
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,380
Help yourself.

464
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:08,810
OK.

465
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,420
Thank you.

466
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,220
You're welcome.

467
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,340
Let's go.

468
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,970
Where should we go next?

469
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:31,700
Oh no.

470
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,570
How could I forget that?

471
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,680
[Miss Mumu. It's my friend's photography exhibition. Come if you have time.]

472
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,680
[Jian Ye]

473
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,720
All right, fans.

474
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,500
Now both teams are entering the field.

475
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,640
The game is about to begin.

476
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,460
This game today

477
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,770
is a real

478
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,060
Game Five Derby.

479
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,400
As we can see,

480
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,490
the fans of both sides

481
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,600
are very passionate today.

482
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,740
There are huge banners

483
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,010
on each side of the audience.

484
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,270
All right, the players are already in.

485
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,260
We can see that the players on Chenggang Football Team

486
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,470
are wearing traditional yellow suits today.

487
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,150
While the guest team Nan'an Football Team

488
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,490
is wearing blue today.

489
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,870
I believe this game tonight

490
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,020
will be very exciting.

491
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,740
Based on the list,

492
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,810
both sides have sent their best players.

493
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,420
Miss, you can't park your car here.

494
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,740
Are you the staff here?

495
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,910
Park it for me.

496
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:37,880
Where?

497
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,740
Up to you.

498
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,090
Pass it!

499
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,600
Hello.

500
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,430
Give me a beer

501
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,240
and a fruit plate.

502
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:00,900
Okay.

503
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,440
Thank you.

504
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,900
Defend!

505
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,020
Hurry up!

506
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,870
Stop him!

507
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:07,820
Stop him!

508
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,740
Stop him!

509
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,400
Nice shot!

510
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,710
Nice!

511
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,170
Nice shot!

512
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,800
There's still time. It's okay.

513
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,790
We can make it back.

514
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,600
Where is this girl from?

515
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,540
Is she looking for trouble?

516
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,530
Exactly.

517
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,520
She's holding the opponent's jersey and cheering here.

518
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,550
Looking for trouble.

519
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,300
Drink up! Drink up!

520
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:43,710
Ayin.

521
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,990
This is the wish balloon which can make really wishes come true

522
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,990
that I told you about.

523
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,170
Just hang the wish you make on the balloon.

524
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,550
Then go to the bridge over there

525
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,090
to find a balloon

526
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,760
with golden ink and feather in it.

527
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,100
Tie your balloon to that one

528
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,900
and put it in the balloon box when you come down the bridge.

529
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,200
The first one will get what he/she wants.

530
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,050
Let's try it too.

531
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:08,970
Chi Yu.

532
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,130
Let's do it.

533
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,420
Take it.

534
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:21,660
Don't break it.

535
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,810
Don't look at mine.

536
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,570
What are you doing?

537
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,420
The vendor said

538
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,270
it will bring good luck.

539
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,850
I'm not that balloon.

540
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,010
Gluttonous and lazy.

541
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,810
Ungrateful and amorous.

542
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,440
Okay, thank you.

543
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,230
Please give me the change.

544
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,470
Okay.

545
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,840
Here you go.

546
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,130
Yours.

547
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,580
Boss, how much?

548
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,660
50.

549
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,050
50.

550
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,680
This kid.

551
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,090
Whose child is this?

552
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,580
Ayin, wait for me here.

553
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,620
I have a T-shirt in my car.

554
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,380
I'll get it for you.

555
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,690
Why didn't you avoid him?

556
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,530
Take it.

557
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,040
Put it on.

558
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,500
Don't catch a cold.

559
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,389
♫Put your photos in my phone♫

560
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,340
♫They're full of traces of our love♫

561
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,699
♫Make the room covered with your scent♫

562
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,580
♫Time keeps running♫

563
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,030
♫You are the oxygen I live on♫

564
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,000
♫Along with the breath on which I miss you every time♫

565
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,840
What are you doing?

566
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,739
♫You are the deep bottom of the sea♫

567
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:48,000
♫I'm swimming in your arms♫

568
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:52,110
♫I want one more second to get close to you♫

569
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,790
This is my blessing.

570
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:55,080
♫One more second to change your clock♫

571
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,139
Of course you can't erase it.

572
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,230
♫To turn it upside down♫

573
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,170
♫And to hug you again♫

574
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,670
♫I want one more second of memories between you and me♫

575
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,390
What are you thinking?

576
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,660
♫With one more second, in this world, there will be no♫

577
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,700
♫More trouble♫

578
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,170
So dirty.

579
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,060
♫Every minute and second♫

580
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,230
Xiang Qinyu.

581
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,970
Watch your steps.

582
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,410
Don't keep attacking me.

583
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,930
Aren't you here to make a wish?

584
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,600
Hurry up. Don't waste time.

585
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,360
We have to wait for Longda.

586
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,140
When he comes back and realizes we are not here,

587
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,330
he will go look for us.

588
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,580
Hurry up.

589
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,320
I'm going to find the balloon with golden ink.

590
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,030
I want to be the first one to successfully make a wish.

591
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,020
Let's go.

592
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:16,460
[It's the words which I can't say out loud that complete me.]
