5
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,060
Thank you for your hard work these days.

6
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:29,640
Take care.

7
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,430
Thank you.

8
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,430
Thank you, Ms. Jin,

9
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,250
on behalf of those wild animals.

10
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,070
There's no need to say thank you.

11
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,050
It's better if you can pay me money.

12
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,560
This is one person's share.

13
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,980
If both of your guardians are here,

14
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,700
there will be more.

15
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,140
What does it have to do with them?

16
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,830
Why not?

17
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,000
Have you decided which one is my future brother-in-law?

18
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,010
What are you talking about?

19
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,390
Do you think it's fun?

20
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,770
Mind your own business

21
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,400
and hurt fewer women.

22
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:34,390
Jin Abao,

23
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,940
let me ask you a question.

24
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,260
If...

25
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,170
I mean if...

26
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,940
If someone

27
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,460
suddenly wants to kiss you...

28
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,190
Why are you laughing?

29
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,060
If someone suddenly wants to kiss you.

30
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,170
Although it was just a move,

31
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,660
I'm sure

32
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,710
he was going to kiss me.

33
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,340
What do you think he meant?

34
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,210
Was it my first or second brother-in-law?

35
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,460
A friend of mine.

36
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,120
Don't talk nonsense.

37
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,300
So your "friend"

38
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,570
didn't confess his love?

39
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,310
No.

40
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,560
You two are in love with each other.

41
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,420
Why don't you just

42
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,880
bring it into the open and tell each other already?

43
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,000
I told you it wasn't me.

44
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,690
Well,

45
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,210
this person

46
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,520
is different from ordinary people.

47
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,320
He's thinking like people in the last century.

48
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,800
He's very conservative.

49
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,370
To him,

50
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,000
love is very sacred.

51
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,550
I've checked it for you.

52
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,260
Tomorrow is

53
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,120
the 48th anniversary

54
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,570
of Benett Comet reaching its perihelion.

55
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,170
What comet?

56
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,080
Benett.

57
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,830
It's the perfect time and place.

58
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,540
What do you mean?

59
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,550
It doesn't matter.

60
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,810
What matters is

61
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,270
you need to use this excuse

62
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,850
to ask him out for dinner with you.

63
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,520
Why?

64
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,480
If you can ask him out

65
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
to celebrate such a stupid festival,

66
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,180
that means

67
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,590
he likes you too.

68
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,740
And then?

69
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,970
Then,

70
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,850
when you are having dinner together,

71
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,580
find a perfect timing.

72
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,640
Don't hesitate.

73
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,620
Just say it out.

74
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,130
Well...

75
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,000
Isn't that too fast?

76
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,310
My sister.

77
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,650
How old are you?

78
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,120
Stop dilly-dallying.

79
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,810
It'll be over if you don't take the initiative.

80
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,200
What do you mean?

81
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,850
Let me give you an example.

82
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,730
It's like you two are playing football.

83
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,650
The ball has reached your foot.

84
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,000
You are already in the penalty area.

85
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,580
If you hesitate,

86
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,540
you'll miss the perfect opportunity, right?

87
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,260
If you don't kick it,

88
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,610
someone else will steal the ball.

89
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,070
What if I miss this kick,

90
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,710
or hit the woodwork?

91
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
You won't regret it.

92
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,690
If you don't dare to try,

93
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,010
you'll regret it.

94
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,940
To be the one who kicks without hesitation

95
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,260
is much cooler.

96
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,770
When did you

97
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,000
like football?

98
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,470
I've always liked it.

99
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,659
I'm asking you about football.

100
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,700
Why are you so shy?

101
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,540
Don't talk nonsense.

102
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,030
Something is not right.

103
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,220
Are you in love?

104
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,659
No, stop gossiping.

105
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,180
Who is it?

106
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,110
Is it Teng Xi?

107
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,760
It must be Teng Xi, right?

108
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,840
Mind your own business.

109
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,670
You're really something, little brat.

110
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,250
What's going on?

111
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,430
Thunder.

112
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,120
Didn't the weather forecast say it wouldn't rain?

113
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,010
The weather forecast is not accurate.

114
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,430
It's normal in the rainy season.

115
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,770
I'm leaving.

116
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,500
Aren't you going to send me back?

117
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,840
The comet you talked about

118
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,250
is called Be-what?

119
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,300
Jin Abao.

120
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,930
Benett.

121
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,990
Perihelion.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,400
The 48th anniversary.

123
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,240
What are you looking at?

124
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,230
I'm... I'm thinking

125
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,720
why you are here.

126
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,790
It's going to rain.

127
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,150
You didn't bring an umbrella.

128
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,060
If you can ask him out

129
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,380
to celebrate such a stupid festival,

130
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,770
that means

131
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,290
he likes you too.

132
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:31,900
Xiang Qinyu.

133
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,760
Do you know that

134
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,330
tomorrow is the 48th anniversary

135
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,840
of Benett Comet

136
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,419
reaching its perihelion?

137
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,570
What?

138
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:43,880
It means

139
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,430
48 years ago, on the next day,

140
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,100
Benett Comet and the Sun

141
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,100
finally met after 1,000 years.

142
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,840
It's rare.

143
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,960
So?

144
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,350
So...

145
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,950
So...

146
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,140
Should we

147
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,730
celebrate it

148
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,750
together?

149
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,110
Why should we celebrate?

150
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,570
Everyone here is like this.

151
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,630
It's a sense of ritual.

152
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,350
It's flashy.

153
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,060
After all,

154
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,830
it's just two stars.

155
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,750
Every star has its own track.

156
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,840
Meeting is only for a moment.

157
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,950
When time is up,

158
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,600
they will return to their own places.

159
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,960
What's there to celebrate?

160
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,460
Then...

161
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,010
Are you leaving too?

162
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,290
After I'm done investigating this,

163
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,850
I'll go back as well.

164
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,060
Xiang Qinyu.

165
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,330
I have something to ask you.

166
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,640
One for each.

167
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,840
We're even now.

168
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,910
When did I ever do that to you?

169
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,930
You did.

170
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,630
You... You forgot about it.

171
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,670
Xiang Qinyu.

172
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,620
Do you want to

173
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,660

175
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,560
We can go have steak together.

Okay.

179

But I have a shooting tomorrow.

180
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,710
I can only make it in the evening.

181

Then we can have dinner.

182

Okay.

183

It's raining.

this is the result of the new projects' evaluation.

As you expected,

188
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,840
they all got Class A.

189
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,420
You can predict everything

190
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,920
just by looking at the project plans.

191
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,230
It's more accurate than the weather forecast.

192
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,840
If it rains this week,

193
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,990
I'll see you.

194

please

196
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,090
don't contact me ever again.

197
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,960
Do you dare to bet with me?

198
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,040
OK.

199
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,290
There's still hope if I take the bet.

200
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,810
Miss Mumu?

201
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,200
If I could predict everything,

202
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,800
maybe it wouldn't rain today.

203
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:03,960
Today?

204
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,200
It's nothing. Go back to work.

205
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,150
Okay.

it will rain today?

I didn't know.

210
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,260

211
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,350
wants to help me.

345
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:03,750
Okay.

346
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,910
One, two, three.

347
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,550
Alright.

348
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,060
Done.

349
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,220
Over there.

350
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,370
Scan.

351
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,650
Your photo.

352
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,580
Thank you.

353
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,180
Thank you for coming.

354
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,110
-Bye. -Bye.

355
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,390
Xi.

356
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,440
How much did you drink yesterday?

357
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,780
If you don't drink on weekends,

358
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,310
your life will become trash.

359
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,450
What's wrong with her?

360
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,620
She broke up.

361
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,450
Broke up?

362
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,590
With Jin Ayin's brother?

363
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,260
You young people

364
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,060
are treating love too casually.

365
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,380
Do you think everyone is like you?

366
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,400
You have feelings for Jin Ayin but you won't say it.

367
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,830
I think

368
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,930
you don't want to confess your love

369
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,420
because you don't want to be responsible.

370
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,760
Bad man.

371
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,970
Who says I don't want to be responsible?

372
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:30,990
I'm always

373
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,870
faithful and loyal.

374
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,570
And I'm never fickle.

375
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,200
To be honest,

376
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,560
I'll take her to dinner tonight.

377
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:38,950
Listen to that.

378
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,790
You already sound like

379
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,170
an experienced scumbag.

380
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,290
Scumbag?

381
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,340
What do you mean?

382
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,900
But Ayin said

383
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,780
I'm a "sugarcane man".

384
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,510
Do these two terms have similar meanings?

385
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,120
Xi, your turn.

386
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,960
Tell them to go faster. I'm in a hurry.

387
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,460
OK.

388
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,550
Thank you, Ye.

389
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,500
It's been a long time

390
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,180
since I made such unexpected wealth.

391
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,100
Come on. Only I can be so generous.

392
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,020
After you ordered three barbecue takeouts

393
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,550
and treated me badly at my place,

394
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,280
I still came to help you make money.

395
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,910
You not only earned some money for publicity,

396
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,460
but also gained extra income from passers-by.

397
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,560
It's all thanks to others,

398
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,400
but I'll keep the profit to myself.

399
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,560
Don't mind that.

400
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,640
We are sisters.

401
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,950
You won't split hairs with me.

402
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,920
People who work in literature are so sharp-tongued.

403
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,580
You too.

404
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,910
You must be a time management master.

405
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,670
You have someone at home that you treat like a baby.

406
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,290
Someone here treats you like a baby.

407
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,070
I think Li Longda is good.

408
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,950
He has a good reputation in the crew as well.

409
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,410
Also, he's rich.

410
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,210
Most importantly, he's handsome.

411
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,710
He must be top in male virtuousness.

412
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,180
Ye,

413
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,590
I have a question for you.

414
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,150
How can I make the person I reject

415
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,930
stay happy?

416
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,140
Kill me.

417
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,950
Even death is easier than your question.

418
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,210
Ayin.

419
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,550
Since you can't lose Chi Yu

420
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,810
or Li Longda,

421
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:45,870
why don't you accept them both?

422
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,360
It shows your responsibility.

423
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,350
You need to learn to care about the world

424
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,280
and make every boy happy.

425
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,630
How could you be a planner

426
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,130
with such hideous thoughts?

427
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,830
This is for you.

428
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,710
Watch a movie sometime.

429
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,470
Maybe in the movies,

430
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,800
you'll learn something

431
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,980
that can solve your confusion.

432
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,340
You worked so hard, brother-in-law.

433
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,680
Of course.

434
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,270
If I were a girl, I would have fallen in love with you.

435
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,310
Just kidding.

436
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,810
That's not impossible.

437
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,280
I can only do this much to help you.

438
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:37,730
Come on.

439
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,620
Longda.

440
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:44,840
This is your share.

441
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,030
No need.

442
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:47,980
I'm here to have fun.

443
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,660
He's too shy to ask for it.

444
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,860
He's shy but I'm not.

445
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,460
Give it to me.

446
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,650
Give it to him.

447
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,300
If you feel bad,

448
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,250
you can

449
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,310
treat me to a movie.

450
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,440
Well,

451
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,590
let's go together.

452
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,690
I won't bother you then.

453
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,260
I'm leaving.

454
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:20,780
Where are you going?

455
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,880
I'm going home to sleep.

456
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,890
You brat.

457
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,150
Jian Ye.

458
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,110
-Miss Mumu. -How's preparation going?

459
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:36,740
Yes.

460
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,010
Don't worry. I'll sit by myself.

461
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,330
I won't disturb you two.

462
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,160
This little brat.

463
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,000
Let's

464
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:51,970
go in first.

465
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,270
Do you want popcorn?

466
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:58,680
My treat.

467
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,030
Okay.

468
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,470
And some cola.

469
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,070
Did you check the bonus clips?

470
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,000
Yes.

471
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:10,640
No problem.

472
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,710
I won't be around this afternoon.

473
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,600
Contact me if you have any question.

474
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,810
Got it, Miss Mumu.

475
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,520
Mr. Wu is here.

476
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,820
The one next to him

477
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,420
is his new girlfriend.

478
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,940
I heard she's an actress who just graduated.

479
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,350
Look at her,

480
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,330
hen-pecking Mr. Wu.

481
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,700
Enough. So gossipy.

482
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,500
Go inside

483
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,990
and ask someone to play the bonus video.

484
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,020
I'll check if there's any problem.

485
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:41,580
Okay.

486
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,620
You must be Miss Mumu.

487
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,880
I heard about you from Jianzhou.

488
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,360
I even saw pictures of you two.

489
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,800
I didn't expect

490
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,530
you are so young.

491
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:10,900
Thank you.

492
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,710
Jian Ye, play the first bonus clip.

493
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,910
You said it has nothing to do with her?

494
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,770
If I hadn't followed you today,

495
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,630
I wouldn't have known

496
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,440
you work for her.

497
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,060
Why do you like such an old woman?

498
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,620
She's 10 years older than you.

499
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,560
Shu.

500
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,590
We're just colleagues.

501
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,230
Fast forward.

502
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,190
No, you can't leave.

503
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,260
Miss Mumu.

504
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,530
You broke up a long time ago,

505
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,900
and you still work together.

506
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,650
Miss Mumu, you are so beautiful.

507
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,480
He must be special to you.

508
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,540
Like the movie says,

509
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,910
I don't believe there's pure friendship

510
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,850
between men and women.

511
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,520
Sister.

512
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,170
I don't know if there's pure friendship

513
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,260
between men and women.

514
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,930
But I can confirm that

515
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,820
Mr. Wu and I

516
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,690
are barely

517
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,060
friends.

518
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,070
We don't have any interactions outside of work.

519
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,290
You can watch the movie carefully.

520
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
And you'll find that

521
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,470
it's the heroine that dumped the man.

522
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,330
Sometimes,

523
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,840
what others think is precious

524
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,450
may be nothing better than wood

525
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,170
in the eyes of the heroine.

526
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,890
No one likes to pick up trash.

527
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,780
I heard that you've

528
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,190
never had a boyfriend since you left Jianzhou.

529
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,910
I thought

530
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,040
you regretted it and couldn't get over it.

531
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,710
You haven't known each other for long, have you?

532
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,060
Don't worry.

533
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,310
From what I know about Wu Jianzhou,

534
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,430
someone who looks like

535
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,180
a blank paper, like you,

536
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,210
suits him better.

537
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,380
It's like raising a pet.

538
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,100
The taming process

539
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,270
makes him feel the pleasure of growing something

540
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,640
and satisfies his need of being relied on by the weak.

541
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,210
So, instead of suspecting him,

542
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,030
you should think about

543
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,520
how to be a trumpet creeper forever

544
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,360
and never grow up.

545
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,270
Otherwise, when he meets a better pet,

546
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,550
the old one

547
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,270
will be sent away.

548
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,480
Jian Ye, play the next clip.

549
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,480
I have nothing to say to you.

550
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,950
No, you can't leave.

551
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,120
I want you to resign.

552
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:42,790
Otherwise,

553
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,930
I'll let the whole company know

554
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,130
that woman is pestering you.

555
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,460
Miss Mumu, you must have misunderstood me.

556
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,340
What's wrong?

557
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,960
Jianzhou.

558
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,960
Don't blame Miss Mumu.

559
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,510
I just wanted to be friends with her.

560
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,750
However, it turns out that

561
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,650
she hates me so much.

562
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,240
Take a seat.

563
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:04,430
I'll handle it.

564
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,550
Jianzhou.

565
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,060
You're an adult.

566
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,310
Why are you bullying a little girl?

567
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:14,550
Wu Jianzhou.

568
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,450
I think compared to your little girlfriend,

569
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,490
you are more like a naive little boy.

570
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,100
Don't think you can be more unruly

571
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,220
with President Gao's support.

572
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,540
Even if your overstepping report is approved,

573
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,660
it doesn't meet the procedures.

574
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,900
If you come to me for this,

575
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,270
don't do that.

576
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,420
I'm busy.

577
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,310
What are you looking at?

578
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,390
Do your own work, okay?

579
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,160
I

580
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,520
just want to remind you that

581
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,190
I stopped you from making "A Troublesome Old Idol"

582
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,560
for your own good.

583
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,450
All these years,

584
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,870
you've taken so many big steps.

585
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,830
Every project had high risks.

586
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,140
Do you really think you won't lose?

587
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,590
I believe in my professional judgment.

588
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,540
Jian Ye, next one.

589
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,550
I know.

590
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,130
For you,

591
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,310
career is everything.

592
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,530
You treat your relationship

593
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,680
like your work.

594
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,030
Stubborn

595
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:27,750
and independent.

596
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,420
You said you are incompetent in love.

597
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,200
But I never regretted.

598
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,850
After all,

599
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,800
this is just a job.

600
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,190
Why are you so aggressive?

601
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,490
I've been wondering

602
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,670
if your life equals work.

603
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,870
You were like this when we were together.

604
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,940
You haven't changed a bit.

605
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,980
Stubborn,

606
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,830
and indifferent.

607
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,730
You have to be better in everything

608
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,620
than everybody.

609
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,760
This is what you call "genetic incompetence in love"

610
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,500
in your movie, right?

611
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,090
I'm not picking on you.

612
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,690
I sincerely want you to be better.

613
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,760
Don't be

614
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,300
so domineering.

615
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,450
Men

616
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,900
don't like aggressive women.

617
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,010
Besides,

618
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,710
you're in your 30s.

619
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,210
First of all,

620
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,120
you are in no position to judge whether I'm incompetent in love.

621
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,780
It should be the other way around.

622
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,720
You who always hope that the other person is a victim

623
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,810
are more like an emotion controller.

624
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:50,820
Secondly,

625
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,100
as colleagues,

626
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,200
we shouldn't interfere

627
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,680
with each other's love life.

628
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,400
But if you have to

629
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,310
point fingers at my life,

630
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,050
I have to remind you something as well.

631
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,820
If someone like me dumps you for the first time,

632
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,780
someone like me will dump you twice.

633
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,150
It's not fun for you to say that.

634
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,300
I really said it for your own good.

635
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,960
Stop.

636
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,449
No need.

637
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:14,770
Wait.

638
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,739
I'm not done yet.

639
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,870
Who are you?

640
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,670
Let's go.

641
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,350
♫When you first told me your name♫

642
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:47,070
♫I didn't hear a word you said♫

643
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:52,739
♫Bet it was written on my face♫

644
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:57,750
♫Shoulda known it was you I would love until the end♫

645
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:56,730
Look.

646
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,310
There are people kissing over there.

647
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,690
♫I don't know where this road leads♫

648
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:09,900
♫All I know is I wanna go with you♫

649
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:16,000
♫In a life where there's no sure thing♫

650
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,820
Brat.

651
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:21,350
♫I am sure I wanna live it with you♫

652
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:28,130
[The deserted heart is back to be covered by green at that moment.]
