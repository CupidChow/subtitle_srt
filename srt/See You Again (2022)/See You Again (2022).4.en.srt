00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,009
Xiang Qinyu,

5
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,430
are you making trouble on purpose?

6
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,100
I'm doing this for your sake,

7
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,539
so as to help you fulfill your wish.

8
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,460
Just tell me if you don't want to help.

9
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,970
I can rely on myself.

10
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,850
Waiter, one more cup.

11
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,180
Hello?

12
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:12,900
Who's that?

13
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,450
This is Feng Yousan.

14
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,100
Director.

15
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,890
Hello, Director Feng.

16
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,660
Hello.

17
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,780
Let me tell you.

18
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,540
You passed the interview.

19
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:25,970
But this is just my personal recommendation.

20
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,079
Later,

21
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,430
you also need to compete with one of the interviewees

22
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,390
through the script.

23
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,380
But I believe you can do it.

24
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,790
I've met many scriptwriters.

25
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,540
You are the only person who can

26
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,700
answer all the questions correctly.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,600
It took me many years to find

28
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,510
these materials.

29
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,640
Really?

30
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,060
It seems that you've really read

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,350
the only interview transcript left by Xiang Qinyu.

32
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,860
He did say that

33
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,270
he didn't like women.

34
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,550
Yu,

35
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,540
if we collaborate with each other,

36
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,010
we'll get what we want.

37
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,400
I'll write my script

38
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,850
for the test well.

39
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:14,910
This time,

40
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,070
I'll win for sure.

41
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,460
When can I see the whole script?

42
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,870
I need to check

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,380
if there's nonsense.

44
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,410
You can read it after I pass the interview.

45
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,940
Yu.

46
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,890
You don't like women.

47
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,910
Is it because...

48
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,630
Because women are too troublesome,

49
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,460
especially those who nag like you.

50
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,930
I don't like such women particularly.

51
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,670
The famous Xiang Qinyu has never been in a love relationship?

52
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,860
You're 27 now.

53
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,660
You've never been in a love relationship?

54
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,560
That's impossible.

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
Slow down. We can walk back home.

56
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,060
I want to take the rickshaw.

57
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,710
Yu, you can't take it.

58
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,820
Don't take the rickshaw.

59
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,340
Dude.

60
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,130
Yu.

61
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:00,910
Yu.

62
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,120
Sir.

63
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,890
Your price is too high.

64
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,620
You charge us 300 yuan for taking your rickshaw.

65
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,670
Young lady, your words are too harsh.

66
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,580
It feels familiar.

67
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,720
Of course you're familiar with spending money.

68
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,550
What a spendthrift.

69
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,850
- What are you doing? - Shh!

70
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,860
Just say it.

71
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,140
Don't lean on me.

72
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,100
You said you had never been in a love relationship.

73
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,140
Are you a sugarcane man who pretends to be a good guy?

74
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,140
What is this?

75
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,210
Earphone.

76
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,360
Earphone.

77
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,160
It's a small-sized gramophone, isn't it?

78
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,700
The gramophone is so small.

79
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,030
Is it expensive?

80
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,440
You like it?

81
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,520
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

82
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,180
Really?

83
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,540
By the way,

84
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,100
you mentioned "sugarcane man" just now.

85
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,440
What does it mean?

86
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,860
A sugarcane man

87
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,060
refers to

88
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,540
a sweet

89
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,040
and

90
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,670
tall man like you.

91
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,180
Are you going to

92
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,790
be like this every day from now on?

93
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,140
Being furtive like this

94
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,580
is so...

95
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,180
Shh!

96
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,170
Keep your voice down.

97
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,740
Do you want to go back or not tonight?

98
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,420
If we avoid

99
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,680
all her timing,

100
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:08,980
we will be safe.

101
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,820
Who exactly is your landlady?

102
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,820
I think she's eccentric

103
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,710
and is hard to deal with.

104
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,270
Look at this street.

105
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,660
It's all inherited by the landlady.

106
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
For some time,

107
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,930
as long as the tenant drew on a graffiti wall for her,

108
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,960
she would exempt him from one month's rent.

109
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,080
Did you draw it?

110
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,410
Of course.

111
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,470
Look at that peacock.

112
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,580
I drew it.

113
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,540
It's just that

114
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,909
I didn't

115
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,330
draw it very well.

116
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,080
Someone helped me revised it a bit later.

117
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,540
So,

118
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,760
I was exempted from two days' rent.

119
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:50,770
Three.

120
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:51,950
Two.

121
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,650
One.

122
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:57,650
Go.

123
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,960
Hide.

124
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,230
Go.

125
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,750
In two days,

126
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,840
we're going to participate in the competition.

127
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,940
Are you confident?

128
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,660
Yes.

129
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,780
Okay. Practice hard.

130
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,350
We must get the championship.

131
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,409
Now let me tell you about

132
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,620
some of the main points.

133
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,940
Why isn't he back yet?

134
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,260
Didn't I tell you

135
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,520
you must come back before nine?

136
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,520
Ms. Wu will come back to cook at nine.

137
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:12,900
By the way,

138
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,880
this is the newspaper of 1936 you asked for.

139
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,510
That's all I can find online.

140
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,700
Listen.

141
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,540
Stay at home these few days.

142
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,190
Don't go anywhere.

143
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,980
Let me remind you again.

144
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,250
If Ms. Wu...

145
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,000
Open the door.

146
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,890
It's me.

147
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,760
I'm Ms. Wu.

148
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,390
Shh!

149
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,309
Mr. Gan.

150
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,059
Ms. Wu.

151
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,929
Mr. Gan.

152
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,250
I'm here.

153
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,610
Mr. Gan.

154
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,620
So you're here.

155
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,370
Mr. Gan?

156
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,990
Ms. Wu.

157
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,540
-Let me explain. -Mr. Gan.

158
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,700
I heard you also

159
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,460
come from Guangdong.

160
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,180
So

161
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,340
I made some soup

162
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,920
early this morning and sent it to you.

163
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,510
The soup is a little hot.

164
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,580
I don't know if it suits your taste.

165
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,230
No need.

166
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,320
You're too kind.

167
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,470
Don't say that.

168
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,070
Do you dislike it?

169
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,530
Just show some respect and taste it.

170
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:17,920
Alright.

171
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,520
Jin Ayin, take it.

172
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,540
We've agreed on it.

173
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,890
Let's meet tomorrow morning

174
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,700
at seven o'clock.

175
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,280
Don't worry.

176
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,100
Thank you

177
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,340
for your help today.

178
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:30,930
Then

179
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,300
I'll take my leave.

180
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,850
I'm leaving now.

181
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,380
Bye. Bye. Bye.

182
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,300
See you. See you.

183
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,430
Remember.

184
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,220
Bye. Bye.

185
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,990
Take care, Ms. Wu.

186
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,140
What happened?

187
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,080
You don't have to worry about your issue with the landlady anymore.

188
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,480
Just focus on your writing.

189
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,790
What happened?

190
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,690
Shape arms like carrying a ball.

191
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,820
Focus the center of gravity on your right foot.

192
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,540
Thrust your left foot and right hand forward.

193
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,410
Look at the upper part of your hand.

194
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,700
You're misleading them.

195
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,480
Young man,

196
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,980
what did you say?

197
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,410
You brat.

198
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,020
Why are you still here?

199
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,620
Sir, let me tell you.

200
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,700
This brat

201
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,230
ruined my house.

202
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,540
You little bastard.

203
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,090
When I started practicing Tai Chi,

204
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,500
you wasn't born yet.

205
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,260
That's right.

206
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,040
Your way of doing Tai Chi isn't correct.

207
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,210
Move your eyes along with your waist and think before you act.

208
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,380
Air sinks to the pubic region and keep your head steady.

209
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,570
Stretch your shoulders and hips to make your body tight or relax properly.

210
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,360
Remember these three key points.

211
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,020
Your movements just now...

212
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,900
He's criticizing us.

213
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,900
-You just know the pithy formula. -Right.

214
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,980
Everyone knows it.

215
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,660
-Right? -Yes. We all know it.

216
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,660
If you are capable of doing it,

217
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,090
how about fighting with me to show some skills?

218
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,830
Right. Come on.

219
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,900
Show us your skills.

220
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,580
Alright.

221
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,500
Mr. Zhang.

222
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,020
Mr. Zhang, are you alright?

223
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:39,900
I'm fine.

224
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,260
If you can't understand the essence,

225
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,790
I'm afraid you won't be able to learn the rudiments all your life.

226
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,400
Sir,

227
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,250
may I know your name?

228
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,300
In your words,

229
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,090
just call me Sugarcane Man.

230
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,910
Mr. Gan, please stay.

231
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,770
Mr. Gan, don't go.

232
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,220
Yu,

233
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,030
can you

234
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,070
stop

235
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,790
calling yourself Sugarcane Man?

236
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,440
Why?

237
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,450
Because

238
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,190
it's not good to make it widely known.

239
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,450
Focus on your writing.

240
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,340
Mr. Zhou passed away.

241
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,400
War.

242
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,490
[The War Will End Soon]

243
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,020
War.

244
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,290
[The Workers Are on Strike Collectively]

245
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,220
On strike.

246
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,160
What have I missed these years?

247
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,040
No way.

248
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,900
It's been with me for so long.

249
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,710
Don't break down at the critical moment.

250
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,430
Well,

251
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,450
it's an old problem.

252
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,480
It'll be fine after a rest.

253
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,940
No need.

254
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,580
My laptop is good.

255
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,700
It's not always broken.

256
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,380
That's not okay.

257
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,990
Although I can't go back

258
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,310
to the past to redeem my own reputation for the time being,

259
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,800
I can't let my descendants slander me arbitrarily.

260
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,490
My master once told me that

261
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,020
a good tool is a prerequisite for the successful execution of a job.

262
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,740
Your Know-it-all doesn't work well.

263
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,450
How can it assist you in getting the job

264
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,620
of script writing successfully?

265
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,160
I have you to help me with the success.

266
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,120
Don't waste money on those things.

267
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,900
Hello, sir.

268
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,360
Which is the best Know-it-all here?

269
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,500
Know-it-all?

270
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,620
It's something

271
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:13,940
like this.

272
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,670
Let me recommend it to you.

273
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,750
This is our latest design.

274
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,810
No need.

275
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,770
We won't buy it.

276
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,530
Take your time.

277
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,700
Thank you.

278
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,130
Don't buy it.

279
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,060
You don't have to pay this time.

280
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,330
I'll pay.

281
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,580
Where did you get so much money?

282
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,530
Well,

283
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,500
none of your business.

284
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,110
Besides,

285
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,780
give me a mobile phone like this, too.

286
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,720
I've observed.

287
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,100
Now everyone has it.

288
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,420
This will do.

289
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,540
It's durable.

290
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,310
It's loud, too.

291
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,580
Besides,

292
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,810
you're old enough to use this.

293
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,470
I want this.

294
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,540
The expensive one is better.

295
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,050
This principle

296
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,550
can be used in any era.

297
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,370
You really know what to choose.

298
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,770
Please come again.

299
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,520
Thank you.

300
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,590
So stingy.

301
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,340
With that little money,

302
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,290
how could you pretend to be rich?

303
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,090
I bought a Know-it-all for you,

304
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,240
and I spent all my money.

305
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,370
You have to pay for my mobile phone first.

306
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,880
I don't have much money.

307
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,990
I haven't forgotten it.

308
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,880
You still have my watch.

309
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,220
Let's go.

310
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,750
Where are we going?

311
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,540
You've got a good tool.

312
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,620
It's time to tidy up

313
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,840
your messy environment.

314
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,670
What?

315
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,460
♫Put your photos in my phone♫

316
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,410

00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:15,980
I have cushions at home.

341
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,400
♫And to hug you again♫

342
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,180
I don't want this.

343
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,940
♫I want one more second of memories between you and me♫

344
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,890
♫With one more second, in this world, there will be no♫

345
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,099
♫More trouble♫

346
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,360
♫Every minute and second♫

347
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,900
Why do you take this?

348
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,650
Put it back.

349
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,240
No.

350
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,250
I must keep this.

351
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,870
Jin Ayin, what are you doing?

352
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,740
Go to the basket over there

353
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,190
and bring me a receipt like these.

354
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,350
What's the use of it?

355
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,220
Follow me.

356
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:10,920
Thank you.

357
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,220
The Jin Family's trick to turn rubbish into treasure.

358
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,620
Collect all the receipts that others

359
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,960
have discarded to accumulate points.

360
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,900
Then we can get what we want in exchange.

361
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,600
How do you know so much?

362
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,700
I know a lot.

363
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,300
Let's go. I'll treat you to a movie.

364
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,900
If you want to eat, wait over there.

365
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,350
Okay.

366
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,420
Hello, please wait a moment.

367
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:36,920
Thank you.

368
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,510
You're welcome.

369
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,710
Let's go.

370
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,600
Be quick.

371
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,170
Mr. Gan.

372
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,070
You're back.

373
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,500
Rich lady, come on!

374
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,930
Rich lady, come on!

375
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,700
Rich lady, come on!

376
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:48,950
Not bad.

377
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,270
What is inside this box?

378
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,780
This box contains...

379
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,630
These

380
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,780
are the scripts I've written before.

381
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,610
So many, right?

382
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,060
But none of them

383
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,160
could satisfy the clients.

384
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,710
In the end,

385
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,420
they were all forgotten,

386
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,700
and cast aside.

387
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,440
Go.

388
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,460
Get a new box

389
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,260
and clean all of them.

390
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,700
Pack them up again.

391
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,930
After the Legend of Xiang Qinyu written by you

392
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,140
becomes an immortal masterpiece,

393
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,620
these can be shown to others again.

394
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,580
Yu.

395
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,020
don't worry.

396
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,710
In my writing, you'll become

397
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,790
an immortal figure.

398
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,010
What is this?

399
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,340
Why are you

400
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,700
looking like a ghost?

401
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,140
Can you stop making trouble?

402
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,860
This is an authentic massage.

403
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,060
Do you understand?

404
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,040
Alright. You're the only one who understands it.

405
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,800
Okay?

406
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,360
What's that sound?

407
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,140
Xiang Qinyu.

408
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,340
Don't come over.

409
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,120
What are you doing?

410
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,670
Anyway, don't come over.

411
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,540
Just don't come.

412
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,930
Go write your script.

413
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:20,980
Okay.

414
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,950
This is...

415
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,590
This is...

416
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,770
I want to do some woodwork.

417
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,250
By the way,

418
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,570
it's almost finished.

419
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:59,600
It's unique.

420
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,520
You spent the whole day

421
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,560
just for making this?

422
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,080
Or did you do it for me?

423
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,250
I told you.

424
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,880
I just want to do some woodwork.

425
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,230
Look at your balcony.

426
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,660
It's a mess.

427
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,600
What are these?

428
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,950
With this hanging chair,

429
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,650
when I'm free,

430
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,000
I can sit on it and enjoy the sunshine.

431
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,340
I knew you wouldn't be so kind.

432
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,100
However,

433
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,480
since you like it so much,

434
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,900
I can allow you

435
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,520
to sit on it occasionally

436
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,130
when I don't use it.

437
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,210
But be careful.

438
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,780
Don't erase this signature.

439
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,560
Got it.

440
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,310
Thank you, Yu.

441
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,350
Are you so free now?

442
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:23,920
You have nothing to do?

443
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,530
Have you finished the script?

444
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,790
Finally, it's almost finished.

445
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,580
Hello, Ma'am.

446
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,180
Miss Jin,

447
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,440
I'm sorry to inform you that

448
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,900
the crew has changed the leading actor.

449
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,050
He asked us to use the scriptwriter he's familiar with.

450
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,870
So you don't need to continue your work.

451
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,050
Is there

452
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,260
any problem with me?

453
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,300
I...

454
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,550
I'm going to finish it soon.

455
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,510
Why don't you read it first before you decide?

456
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,170
Jin Ayin.

457
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:45,830
Jin Ayin.

458
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,070
What are you burning?

459
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,540
Are you crazy?

460
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,720
These are all your efforts.

461
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,770
These things are not essential.

462
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,450
If I keep them here, they'd occupy much space.

463
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:02,980
It's better to burn them.

464
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,100
No one will like them anyway.

465
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,570
What's wrong with you?

466
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,880
The leading actor

467
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,550
brought investment to the crew,

468
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,140
and demanded to use his own scriptwriter to add more scenes.

469
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,150
For the sake of money, the producer

470
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,470
didn't even read the script

471
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,260
I was about to finish,

472
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,590
and she fired me.

473
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,900
I read your script.

474
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,380
Although the writing is a bit like bombast,

475
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:46,840
the plot

476
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,830
is not bad.

477
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,440
Look. Take this scene as an example.

478
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,020
He...

479
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,260
No need to comfort me.

480
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,390
It's okay.

481
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,710
I've got used to it.

482
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,710
Maybe

483
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,380
since I was born, good luck has been

484
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,450
something I can never have.

485
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,200
I'm just an unimportant person.

486
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,200
What are you doing, Xiang Qinyu?

487
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,470
I'm taking you to ask for justice.

488
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,750
Your effort can't be wasted.

489
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,280
I'm not going.

490
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,290
-You must go. -It's useless.

491
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:37,850
I'm not going.

492
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,280
Do you think I'm not miserable enough?

493
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,790
Why do you admit defeat so easily?

494
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,550
Let go of...

495
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,230
What do you want me to say to make you understand?

496
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,710
I'm different from you.

497
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,510
I'm afraid you've never

498
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,520
experienced failure.

499
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,010
But I'm different.

500
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,680
My ability isn't good.

501
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,710
My education background isn't good, either.

502
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,310
With just a few words,

503
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,830
others could easily take away my job

504
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,730
which I had done all my best to get.

505
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,160
Do you have to

506
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,470
step on the last remaining dignity

507
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,900
I've got?

508
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,320
Get up.

I've been pretending to be an excellent writer.

Am I an essayist?

513
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,190
I'm just a laborer on words.

514
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,320
I'm the kind of person

515

who can't even make others satisfied by being a ghostwriter.

However,

I still dream of becoming a scriptwriter.

That's right.

when I first met you,

521

there was a moment

that my dream would come true.

00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,380

is just a dream.

it probably doesn't suit me at all.

00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,270
I like you.

678
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:12,980
It has nothing to do with you.

679
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,960
Let me finish first.

680
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,260
I still remember when we first met,

681
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,950
it was a rainy night.

682
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,050
I was injured that day.

683
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,820
You and master saved my life.

684
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,640
I remember you thought I was a thief.

685
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,600
I was angry and also found it funny.

686
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,430
I just thought you were a crazy girl.

687
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,570
Later, you took care of me every day.

688
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,470
Although you were clumsy,

689
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,590
and were despised by me,

690
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,760
I knew you really cared about me.

691
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,900
But now,

692
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,880
our master doesn't allow us to be together.

693
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,290
Read your lines.

694
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,850
My senior fellow apprentice,

695
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,410
I'm willing to wait.

696
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,080
After you take revenge,

697
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,800
there will be

698
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,520
no barrier between us.

699
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,340
But identity isn't

700
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,860
the only barrier between us.

701
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:23,780
My senior fellow apprentice,

702
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,540
don't go.

703
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,500
My junior sister apprentice,

704
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:58,530
[It turns out that all the plots in the movies are true.]

705
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,560
[Sweet On]

706
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:03,560
[See You Again]

707
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,550
[Exclusively on iQIYI]

708
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:04,970
-I'll pay more.-Come on. Be quick.

709
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,580
Come on. Be quick.

710
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,050
Mr. Gan.

711
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,430
These are our tuition fees.

712
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,260
Take them.

713
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:16,690
He took the fees.

714
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,580
-He took the fees. -Come on. Hurry up.

715
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,480
Thank you, Mr. Gan.

716
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,120
Alright.

717
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:24,730
Dear apprentices,

718
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,560
let's begin.

719
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,820
Keep your shoulder and elbows down.

720
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,140
The trunk remains in the middle, and stretch your limbs.

721
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,100
Bend your chest and lift your back up.

722
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,570
Air sinks to the pubic region.

723
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,570
The steps should be flexible.

724
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,720
Know when to make your body tense or relax.

725
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,930
Guide your movements with your thoughts.

726
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,870
Combine the interior and exterior together.
