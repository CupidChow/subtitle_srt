00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,740
Why were you so reckless?

175
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,260
Didn't I tell you

176
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,060
not to let her know

177
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,220
-our relationship. -How can you blame me?

178
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,370
It's all because of you.

179
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,620
Just try calling her for me.

180
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,480
I won't.

181
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,060
Please, sister.

182
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,290
Call her for me.

183
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,060
Please.

184
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:46,660
Hello?

185
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,530
Miss Mumu.

186
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,740
I sent you the new script

187
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,620
of A Troublesome Old Idol.

188
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,060
Did you receive it?

189
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,280
Yes, I'm reading it now.

190
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,100
The lines marked red

191
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,750
were revised

192
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,540
according to your suggestions.

193
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,130
Got it. Anything else?

194
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:04,900
Yes.

195
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,580
Well,

196
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,300
I didn't tell you

197
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,580
about Jin Chuan and me.

198
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,960
I...

199
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,950
I'm sorry,

200
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,310
so I wanted to apologize to you.

201
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,060
He didn't mean to lie to you.

202
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,920
Actually, it's because of me,

203
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,880
that he...

204
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,250
It's okay. It's all over now.

205
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,380
The problem between us

206
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,340
is not because of you.

207
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,280
Not me?

208
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,410
Then...

209
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,900
Pick up my call.

210
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,020
Pick up my call.

211
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:45,900
Ayin.

212
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,960
I have some suggestions of revision

213
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,620
about the script.

214
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,670
Please go ahead.

215
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,800
I want to make revision to a scene.

216
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,340
I think the male lead

217
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,000
should go back to the past.

218
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,340
Because he belongs to that time.

219
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,350
He shouldn't stay for anyone.

220
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,620
He should go

221
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,550
wherever he wants to go.

222
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,480
Do you know something?

223
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,890
I went to the izayaka the day before yesterday to find you.

224
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,030
I heard everything.

225
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,270
You hung up?

226
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,520
Did you make Miss Mumu angry again?

227
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,120
I should have

228
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,950
stopped you two from being together with my life.

229
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,200
Say something.

230
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,650
Did she

231
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,660
really want me to revise the script just now?

232
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,820
Wu, what a coincidence.

233
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,290
I've been looking at you over there.

234
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,610
Why are you drinking alone?

235
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:31,730
It's nothing.

236
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,180
I heard from them that

237
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,510
you won't go to Tibet this time.

238
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,200
Yes.

239
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,890
I won't go this time.

240
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,690
Haven't you been expecting it for a long time?

241
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,170
I have something else to do.

242
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,500
I plan to

243
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,660
stay here for the time being.

244
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,540
Cut it out.

245
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,790
I heard that

246
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,910
it's because

247
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,040
you have a new girlfriend.

248
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,790
How charming

249
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,230
must she be

250
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,990
to make Chuan, who never missed out on any occasion,

251
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:06,940
suddenly

252
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,760
decide not to go?

253
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,530
How about

254
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,460
taking your girlfriend

255
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,660
with us on the journey?

256
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,050
How great will that be?

257
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,550
She...

258
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,670
Forget it.

259
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,620
She won't go.

260
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:34,780
Fine.

261
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,750
How charming is she?

262
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,420
She showed up

263
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,240
and immediately overrode

264
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,770
our friendship of so many years.

265
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,380
Brother,

266
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,090
stop persuading me.

267
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,950
I apologize to you.

268
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,060
OK.

269
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,930
Remember to invite me

270
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,940
to your wedding.

271
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:52,940
I'm leaving.

272
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,520
Bye.

273
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,460
Hello?

274
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:45,890
Miss Mumu.

275
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,080
The new budget you made

276
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,300
was rejected by Mr. Wu again.

277
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,930
Is he still in the company?

278
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,140
Yes.

279
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,410
Tell him

280
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,470
I'll be right there.

281
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,070
If your throat is sore,

282
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,000
drink this to moisten it.

283
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,000
Why are you like this, too?

284
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:04,950
Shouldn't you

285
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,580
be happy

286
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,100
and enjoying your love life right now?

287
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,360
Let me ask you a question.

288
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:12,770
Go ahead.

289
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,660
There's something

290
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,290
that will make Ayin sad after she getting to know the truth.

291
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,010
Should I tell her?

292
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,600
Will anything change

293
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,140
if she knows?

294
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,950
I don't think so.

295
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,890
Then no.

296
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,350
Sometimes,

297
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,790
the more you know,

298
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,370
the more things you can't do.

299
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,290
There will be more trouble.

300
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,480
What are you hiding then?

301
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,750
I didn't mean to hide it from her.

302
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,480
I just...

303
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,170
I'm just worried that

304
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,540
she would stop me.

305
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,610
That's why I can't and dare not tell her.

306
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,390
Maybe

307
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,980
I don't know her well enough.

308
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,360
In the world I live in,

309
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,150
the elders often say that

310
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,140
there are many things

311
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,370
that you want to protect even if you'll be wronged.

312
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,140
Still, the results may not be satisfying most of the time.

313
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,640
What matters is the heart, not the action.

314
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,220
It's pretty much the same thing, right?

315
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,900
Actually, I was always on Li Longda's side.

316
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,070
Do you know why?

317
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,380
Because I can tell

318
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,640
he must be the one who treats my sister better.

319
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,950
But you

320
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,580
are the one who can make her happier.

321
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,940
Actually, I know

322
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,540
you have many secrets.

323
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,690
My sister

324
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:12,990
is actually very simple.

325
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,080
There are many secrets that

326
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,040
I can't be honest with you about.

327
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,630
But I promise

328
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,030
as long as I'm here, even for one day,

329
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,100
I won't let her get hurt.

330
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,080
I hope you can do it.

331
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,900
I'll hand such a silly girl

332
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,660
to you.

333
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:08,410
You...

334
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,550
You're leaving?

335
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,130
Mind your own business.

336
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,150
I don't need you to worry about me.

337
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,240
I'm leaving.

338
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,150
My silly sister.

339
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,430
Why did he call me that?

340
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,250
Did you badmouth me behind my back?

341
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,030
Why are you smiling?

342
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,100
What did you talk about?

343
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
The silly things you did

344
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,510
in your childhood.

345
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,490
I didn't do any.

346
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,080
He said you snore when you sleep.

347
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,170
You also grind your teeth.

348
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,460
I never snore

349
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,400
or grind my teeth.

350
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,820
Ayin.

351
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,400
I won't let you get hurt. Not one bit.

352
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,630
What do you want to do the most?

353
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,670
I'll do it with you.

354
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:12,980
Sorry,

355
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,940
the subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.

356
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,530
Please redial later.

357
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,010
Sorry,

358
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,300
the subscriber you dialed...

359
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,770
There are many things

360
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,470
that you want to protect even if you'll be wronged.

361
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,440
Still, the results may not be satisfying

362
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,600
most of the time.

363
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,720
What matters is the heart, not the action.

364
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,810
It's pretty much the same thing, right?

365
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,490
Hello, where are you?

366
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,260
Come up.

367
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,140
Have a drink.

368
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,230
You know why I came to you.

369
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,100
-The new budget... -Mumu.

370
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,130
Do you have to be so cold talking to me?

371
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,840
Today,

372
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,620
it's just the two of us here.

373
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,080
There's no need

374
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,440
to be like how you treat me in the company,

375
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,100
being irreconcilable in front of everyone.

376
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,110
Besides,

377
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,810
in our company,

378
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,890
from upper to lower levels,

379
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,980
who doesn't know our relationship?

380
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,310
Even if we had some relationship in the past,

381
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,390
it's over now.

382
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,860
Mr. Wu,

383
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,510
please don't waste your time here.

384
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,670
I'm here to talk about work with you.

385
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,390
And work only.

386
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,960
I'm afraid you didn't have time to check the new budget I made.

387
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,360
It contains

388
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,940
the form of the scenes merged.

389
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,490
It saved a lot of money.

390
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,350
The current total budget is far lower than expected.

391
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,620
I don't think you have any reason to reject it.

392
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,990
Unless you're picking on this project.

393
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,410
Chen Mumu.

394
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,620
I'll tell you again.

395
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,050
Everything you know

396
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,250
was learnt from me.

397
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,870
So I know exactly

398
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,740
what you want to do

399
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,480
with this money.

400
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,350
The budget before the shooting starts

401
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,260
is the closest to the real evaluation.

402
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,320
But now,

403
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,430
the shooting is coming to an end.

404
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,850
You merged several scenes

405
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,350
and saved a lot of money.

406
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,700
The more confident you are,

407
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,190
the more you seem to have a problem with your early work.

408
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,670
I rejected your email

409
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,220
with only one aim, which is to help you.

410
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,030
I don't want the headquarters to know about your mistake.

411
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,000
What do you mean?

412
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,340
Are you suspecting that

413
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,560
I took money from the project?

414
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,100
Wu Jianzhou.

415
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,690
How could you say that?

416
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,910
I pulled my personal strings

417
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,690
to film in the studio

418
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,650
to replace a number of scattered scenes.

419
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,110
This is my personal ability.

420
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,940
And I asked

421
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,640
to rebuild an important scene

422
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,680
with the premise of lowering total cost.

423
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,350
These are all reasonable demands.

424
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:53,490
Wu Jianzhou.

425
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,570
Not everyone is as dirty as you think.

426
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,210
Is that so?

427
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,530
Mumu,

428
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,360
let me tell you again.

429
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,440
Jianghe

430
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,280
not only focuses on art,

431
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,590
but also investment.

432
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,430
Do you think

433
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,750
your so-called profession

434
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,350
can be recognized by the headquarters?

435
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,230
It's exactly because of people like you,

436
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,300
art becomes less like art.

437
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,600
I'm wasting my time talking to you.

438
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,040
You're still so impatient.

439
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,630
Are you going to Mr. Gao again

440
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:45,870
to tell on me?

441
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:47,900
Chen Mumu,

442
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,830
I won't indulge you

443
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,730
and let you forget that

444
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,750
I'm your boss.

445
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,690
How about this?

446
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,170
You can

447
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,520
come back to me.

448
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,480
It's just a few hundred thousand yuan.

449
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,740
I can pay for it myself.

450
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,220
Anyway,

451
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,130
the company is ours.

452
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,660
Instead of

453
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,870
trying your best to persuade Mr. Gao,

454
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,080
why don't you beg me,

455
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,550
your ex-boyfriend?

456
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:22,580
Wu Jianzhou.

457
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,290
You really disgust me.

458
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,140
Chen Mumu.

459
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,580
Don't think you can lecture me

460
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,900
after being a producer for a few years.

461
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,070
I'm not lecturing you.

462
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,910
It's just I didn't see what kind of person you really are

463
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,210
until tonight.

464
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,640
Not only do you have no pursuit in art,

465
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,130
but also no bottom line.

466
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,700
You think you can do everything

467
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,280
with your little experience and knowledge.

468
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,010
I really feel sorry for you.

469
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,000
Wu Jianzhou, let me tell you.

470
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,390
Sooner or later,

471
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,160
you'll be abandoned by this industry.

472
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,920
[You know I'll wait for you]

473
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,920
[until the day you don't need me.]

474
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,210
Be quick, Xiang Qinyu.

475
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,110
Take a photo for me.

476
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,910
♫Put your photos in my phone♫

477
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,860

478
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,250

Yu, sing a song.

00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,010
I can't sing.

504
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,760
Just sing a song.

505
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,110
But I really can't sing.

506
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,100
Don't be shy.

507
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,590
Come on, this love song, alright?

508
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,810
I'll like it

509
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,540
no matter how bad you are.

510
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,570
What about this one?

511
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,140
I really can't sing.

512
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,020
Forget it.

513
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,900
I shouldn't have forced you.

514
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,140
I really can't sing.

515
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,070
I've stopped trying.

516
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,470
Ayin, don't be angry, okay?

517
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,520
No.

518
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,250
You said you'd listen to me today.

519
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,950
I just want my boyfriend to sing me a song.

520
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,080
You didn't satisfy me and made me angry.

521
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,550
I'm out of tune.

522
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,540
Out of tune?

523
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,940
I thought you could do everything.

524
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,230
So there are things that you are not good at.

525
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,240
I have been out of tune since I was a kid.

526
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,050
So I never sing after I grow up.

527
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,050
Did you do it on purpose?

528
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,720
After all, you can do everything.

529
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,110
Besides,

530
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,820
I was acting in the beginning,

531
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,410
but then you rejected me.

532
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,090
The more I thought about it, the more I felt wronged.

533
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,500
Well,

534
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,650
let's hug

535
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,290
and forgive each other.

536
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:24,900
OK?

537
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,620
No.

538
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:26,360
No hug.

539
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,470
Just a hug.

540
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,090
Alright.

541
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,200
Don't be angry, okay?

542
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,820
Stop.

543
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,630
Don't come over.

544
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,650
I...

545
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,240
I'll go out for some fresh air.

546
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,560
Turn around.

547
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,560
Turn around.

548
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,630
This...

549
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,630
What's going on?

550
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,430
Well,

551
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,280
I've been too tired these days.

552
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,840
I'll be fine soon.

553
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,940
Don't lie to me.

554
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,970
Let's go to the doctor, okay?

555
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,060
If the doctor can't treat it,

556
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,860
I...

557
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,350
We...

558
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,670
Are you leaving?

559
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,080
It's OK, Ayin.

560
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,820
I'm here, right?

561
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,820
Then tell me,

562
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,390
why are your hands becoming transparent?

563
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,300
Does it mean you're going back?

564
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,210
It only makes sense to come and go.

565
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,080
Since I've come,

566
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,450
I have to go someday.

567
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,100
I don't want you to leave.

568
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,660
I don't want you to go back.

569
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,170
Since when did this happen?

570
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,720
Why...

571
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,500
Why did I

572
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,050
not know about it till now?

573
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,950
I've always been a fool.

574
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,630
I only know about it now.

575
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,690
Actually, this already happened

576
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,410
when we were in the garden.

577
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,560
But I didn't know how to face you.

578
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,970
That's why I pretended that I didn't hear you.

579
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,220
I'm sorry

580
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:28,970
that I made you sad.

581
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,140
I knew it.

582
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,560
How could you reject my confession of love?

583
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,530
Actually,

584
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,660
I thought about leaving without saying goodbye.

585
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,190
But now,

586
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,650
I want to stay for you.

587
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,760
Trust me.

588
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,250
I will stay.

589
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,660
But Ayin,

590
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:08,820
if...

591
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,020
I mean

592
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,350
