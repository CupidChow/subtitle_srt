Why?

15
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,060
Why?

Don't you know why?

17
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,630
Xiang Qinyu.

18
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,820
Are you really not Chi Yu?

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,560
Longda.

20
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,230
Let me explain.

21
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,150
You're not Chi Yu.

22
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,770
You're Xiang Qinyu.

23
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,380
You really killed him.

24
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,170
It's not like what you think.

25
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,070
It's Ma Zehao who killed Chi Yu.

26
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,590
You pretended to be Chi Yu and lied to me for so long.

27
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,960
Do you think I'll believe you?

28
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,750
Li Longda, you idiot.

29
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,140
I pretended to be Chi Yu in order to lure him out.

30
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,670
You still look down on me now.

31
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,730
You killed my buddy.

32
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,790
You took my woman away,

33
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,860
and even took my role.

34
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,829
Do you think no one will discover this one day?

35
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,860
Fine.

36
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll wake you up now

37
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,750
and see if I'm the fool you call me.

38
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:56,980
Sir.

39
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,600
Go to this place. Hurry up.

40
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,370
Miss,

41
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,760
this is an abandoned factory.

42
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,820
It's very remote.

43
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,900
Sir, I'm in a hurry.

44
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,700
Please be quick.

45
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,340
Okay.

46
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,810
Don't worry.

47
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,790
I won't let you off easily today.

48
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,360
Li Longda.

49
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,390
It's boring to fight with bare hands.

50
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,530
Here you are.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,750
Use this.

52
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,880
It'll be fun to fight with this.

53
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,780
Li Longda.

54
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,420
How dare you say you're not stupid?

55
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,510
You've been used by this pervert.

56
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,850
If you really want to take revenge on me,

57
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,720
why don't you untie me?

58
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,740
Let's fight fiercely

59
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,120
like real men.

60
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,070
Untie you?

61
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,820
Do you think I'm really stupid?

62
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,180
Fine.

63
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,060
I'll take revenge for Chi Yu now.

64
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,070
Have you forgotten?

65
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,310
Chi Yu didn't betray you.

66
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,560
The fact is that you betrayed Chi Yu.

67
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,670
Now, for your own sake,

68
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,820
are you really going to betray him again because of

69
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,490
this murderer who killed Chi Yu?

70
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,810
Li Longda.

71
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't listen to him.

72
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,930
Think about what Chi Yu suffered before.

73
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,300
What are you doing?

74
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,590
Ma Zehao, shut up!

75
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,350
You obviously want to use him

76
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,000
to complete your escape plan.

77
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,520
Li Longda.

78
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,100
How long have you been waiting for this day?

79
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:46,730
I'm telling you, if you kill him yourself,

80
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,350
Jin Ayin will be yours, too.

81
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:49,940
Hurry!

82
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,180
Do it now.

83
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,409
Do it!

84
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,700
Ma Zehao.

85
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,170
Are you quite happy

86
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,590
to see Taotao be like this now?

87
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,210
Unfortunately,

88
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,600
Taotao will never like you.

89
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,390
She likes Chi Yu.

90
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,300
Of course you know it.

91
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,240
Only when she lies there forever

92
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,620
does she really belong to you.

93
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,160
In a sense,

94
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,100
Chi Yu helped you with it.

95
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:29,950
Shut up.

96
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,980
You just want to know what happened

97
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,170
between Taotao and me, don't you?

98
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,850

Go!

What the heck is that?

107
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,140

Kid,

113
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,540
Taotao has told me about it.

00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,850
come to my home for a meal.

117
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,630
Just add a pair of chopsticks.

118
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,570
You can keep Taotao company.

119
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,210
You have no idea

120
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,080
what she means to me.

121
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,240
That person

122
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,870
is you.

123
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,460
You took away the only light in my life.

124
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,680
Is everything

125

really related to Ze?

126
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,510
Why did this happen?

127
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,620
Why didn't Taotao tell me

128
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,270
about such a big thing?

What you are seeing now

131

are the secrets I've hided.

132
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,340
I'm really sorry that

133
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,580
I didn't tell you

134
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,580
the truth,

135
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,940
especially Chi Yu,

136
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,460
who had pulled me from darkness

to light.

138
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,660
What's wrong with you?

139
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,320
The eyebrows are not symmetrical at all.

140
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,070
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,670
You failed at the critical moment, huh?

142
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,710
-I’m sorry. -I have to keep an eye on so many actors’ makeup every day.

143
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,590
I don't have time or energy to focus on you only.

144
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,070
I'll be more careful next time.

145
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,990
Alright, Ma'am.

146
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,680
It's okay.

147
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,050
She didn't mean it.

148
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,420
Let me tell you.

149
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,890
Don't make so many excuses.

150
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,790
We're here to help the actors put on makeup well.

151
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,580
Ma'am.

152
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,550
It's okay. The site assistant is urging me.

153
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,310
Reapply it.

154
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,460
I'm really sorry.

155
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,380
I can usually control it.

156
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,840
But sometimes,

157
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,060
my hands still tremble.

158
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,610
Everyone makes mistakes.

159
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,640
You can practice it on me.

160
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:00,810
Go for it!

161
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,120
I saw a celebrity today.

162
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,640
She's so thin.

163
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,940
I'll look as pretty as her when I dress up.

164
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,150
Happy Double Seventh Festival.

165
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,480
I listened to a song.

166
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,290
I'll sing it for you.

167
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,200
Merry Christmas.

168

170
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,860
Chi Yu, let me tell you.

171
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,690
You are the most hypocritical person in the world.

You're the one who could bring Taotao warmth,

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,850
but you're also the one who dragged her into the abyss.

174
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,710
Do you smell something? It stinks.

175
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,930
This is the food I've prepared for you.

176
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,370
I told you

177
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,140
not to bring me food again.

178
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,390
But I prepared for it for the whole afternoon.

179
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,130
I really don't want it.

180
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:03,710
I...

181
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,580
In this scene, you two were childhood sweethearts.

182
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,090
So later when you meet each other...

183
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,460
Answer the phone first.

184
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,430
If you don't accept me,

185
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,930
I'll post it on Weibo.

186
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,420
I'll say you raped me,

187
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,150
and then abandoned me.

188
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,390
In order to get you,

189
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,740
I can do anything.

190
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,060
So when you two

191
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,180
look at each other,

192
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,220
it'll feel

193
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,700
very familiar.

194
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,020
Come to my home now.

195
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,410
As long as you come,

196
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,460
I promise I won't pester you again.

197
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,930
Otherwise, I'll kill myself right now.

198
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,430
Don't regret it then.

199
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:40,940
Taotao.

200
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:43,350
Tao...

201
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:49,890
Taotao.

202
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,130
Taotao.

203
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,790
Taotao!

204
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:55,530
Tao...

205
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,370
Taotao!

206
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,140
Taotao!

207
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,190
Taotao!

208
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:23,940
Taotao.

209
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,490
Taotao!

210
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,650
Taotao!

211
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,660
Taotao!

212
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,340
Taotao!

213
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,680
Taotao!

214
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,340
I was so obedient.

215
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,190
He asks me to die,

216
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,880
and I'll die.

217
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,260
So,

218
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,410
you killed Chi Yu.

219
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,890
A life for a life.

220
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,740
Didn't you deserve to die?

221
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,720
It's you.

222
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,180
You killed Chi Yu.

223
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,790
You lied to me.

224
00:16:59,070 --> 00:16:59,750
Li Longda.

225
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,660
Didn't you also lie to me?

226
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,490
When did I

227
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,430
tell you

228
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,990
my name is Ma Zehao?

229
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,290
Ma Zehao.

230
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,819
Were you close to Chi Yu?

231
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:24,930
No.

232
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,200
Xiang Qinyu.

233
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,780
Why did you find such a stupid teammate?

234
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,980
Since I could ask you out,

235
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,900
I would be fully prepared.

236
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,780
It would be good if Li Longda didn't turn his coat.

237
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,350
But if he turns his coat in the middle,

238
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,520
I don't mind seeing you two

239
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,800
fight with each other cruelly.

240
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,790
The game has just begun.

241
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,900
Kill him.

242
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,310
Then I'll let you go.

243
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,070
Ma Zehao!

244
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,460
Come out!

245
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,460
Ma Zehao!

246
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,940
Ma Zehao!

247
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,380
It's useless to hide.

248
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,990
You will eventually come out,

249
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,660
unless you want to abandon Taotao.

250
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,290
Are you willing to do that?

251
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,640
Xiang Qinyu.

252
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,310
You have no right to mention Taotao to me.

253
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,500
Ma Zehao,

254
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,340
aren't you afraid of retribution?

255
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,820
Retribution?

256
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,340
You guys always say that I'll get retribution.

257
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,340
But people like me

258
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,670
are not afraid of retribution.

259
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,440
Even if I go to hell,

260
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,180
I'll drag you all there one by one.

261
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,780
Ma Zehao,

262
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,820
have you ever thought that

263
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,670
you're controlling Taotao's life by doing this?

264
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,910
Don't be silly.

265
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,910
People like me and Taotao

266
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,690
have no life.

267
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,030
That's what you think,

268
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
not Taotao.

269
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,310
Xiang Qinyu!

270
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,040
Xiang Qinyu!

271
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,370
Xiang Qinyu, where are you?

272
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,870
Xiang Qinyu!

273
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,740
Ayin!

274
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:30,570
Don't come up!

275
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,580
Ayin.

276
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,580
I'm here!

277
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,980
-Ze. -Ayin!

278
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,770
I'm here!

279
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,290
Xiang Qinyu!

280
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,830
-Xiang Qinyu! -Jin Ayin!

281
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,600
Don't move!

282
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,410
Be careful!

283
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,680
Xiang Qinyu!

284
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:51,940
Don't move!

285
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,390
Otherwise, I can't guarantee her safety.

286
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,430
Ze.

287
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,590
Calm down.

288
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,410
Ze!

289
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,460
Ze.

290
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,820
Don't come near me!

291
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,410
Ze.

292
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,340
I've already known

293
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,800
what happened between Taotao and Chi Yu.

294
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,610
Don't keep making mistakes.

295
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,870
Turn yourself in.

296
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,880
What do you know?

297
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,380
Can any of you let me off?

298
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,780
I've arranged everything.

299
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,250
It's you guys! It's you guys!

300
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,500
You've been destroying everything.

301
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,220
Don't come any closer!

302
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,120
Ma Zehao.

303
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,560
Don't hurt her.

304
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,260
I'll let you go.

305
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,500
Abao!

306
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,100
Don't come over!

307
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,100
Are you okay?

308
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:50,640
Don't come over!

309
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,030
Sister.

310
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,620
Abao.

311
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,090
Ze,

312
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,580
it's not too late to turn back now.

313
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,180
If Taotao sees us being like this,

314
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,370
how sad would she be?

315
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,480
It's too late, Jin Ayin.

316
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,060
There has been no turning back for me.

317
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,550
Why didn't you tell me?

318
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,630
Haven't we been friends all the time?

319
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,710
Friends?

320
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,510
Because of you,

321
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,710
Taotao is being like this now.

322
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,730
[Come on, Taotao! I'll wait for you in Shanghai.]

323
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,610
Ze.

324
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,320
Don't touch me!

325
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,870
You don't understand Taotao at all.

326
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,680
She is different from us.

327
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,770
If it weren't for you,

328
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,540
Taotao wouldn't have come to Shanghai.

329
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,640
She wouldn't have met

330
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,580
Chi Yu.

331
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,460
It's not like that.

332
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,090
Shut up!

333
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,810
I just want to be good to Taotao.

334
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,020
In this world,

335
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,070
only I... only I can treat Taotao well.

336
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,090
Ze,

337
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,820
if Tatao sees you being like this,

338
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,520
how sad would she be?

339
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,960
Taotao will definitely say

340
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,880
Ze is a good man,

341
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,650
and that he wouldn't do such a thing.

342
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,010
Ze,

343
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,740
you clearly know what happened

344
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,790
between Taotao and Chi Yu.

345
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,600
You just don't want to believe it.

346
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,530
Taotao is not like that.

347
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,760
Can you just turn back?

348
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,780
I'll explain it clearly to the police.

349
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,070
Ze!

350
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,520
What right do you have to mention Taotao to me again?

351
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,710
Let me tell you.

352
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,810
Chi Yu has died.

353
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,320
It's Xiang Qinyu.

354
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,390
It's Xiang Qinyu who keeps going after us.

355
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,150
If it weren't for him,

356
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,460
we would have left here.

357
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,860
Jin Ayin, let me tell you.

358
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,410
I won't let Xiang Qintu off.

359
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,220
I will kill him myself.

360
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,180
Ayin.

361
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:42,980
Ayin.

362
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,580
What happened?

363
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,100
Ambulance.

364
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,540
Save her.

365
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,340
Young man, are you okay?

366
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:06,980
Call the ambulance!

367
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,500
Hurry up.

368
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:07,980
Okay.

369
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:12,850
Hello?

370
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:13,590
Is that ambulance service?

371
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,120
There's a car accident here.

372
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,050
Someone is injured.

373
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:55,940
Ayin.

374
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,550
Ayin.

375
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,720
Don't fall asleep.

376
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,080
Ayin.

377
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,400
[In Operation]

378
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:29,010
[Operating Room]

379
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:31,890
The light went out.

380
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,710
Doctor.

381
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,230
Doctor.

382
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,150
How is she?

383
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,510
Don't worry.

384
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,530
Nothing serious.

385
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,450
Fortunately, someone was there and bandaged her wound in time.

386
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,480
The bleeding has been stopped.

387
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,190
Xiang Qinyu, I want to go home.

388
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,630
I don't like the smell of the hospital.

389
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,330
Okay.

390
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,070
Lie down and have a good rest first.

391
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,600
Doctor.

392
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,140
Can she be discharged from hospital now?

393
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,100
She'd better stay here for observation.

394
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,910
If there's nothing serious,

395
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,820
she can be discharged.

396
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:03,580
OK.

397
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,980
-Thank you. -Thank you.

398
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,330
Jin Ayin.

399
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,880
I told you not to do it if you can't.

400
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,830
But you didn't listen.

401
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,060
Xiang Qinyu.

402
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,860
Alright.

403
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,180
Massage it.

404
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:17,910
Alright.

405
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:18,860
You two just show your love here.

406
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:19,530
I have to go.

407
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,040
Jin Abao.

408
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,690
You're injured.

409
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:24,540
Don't ride the motorcycle.

410
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,380
Okay. I got it.

411
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,210
Remember.

412
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,840
Okay.

413
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,380
Does it still hurt?

414
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,280
Yes.

415
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,540
Yes.

416
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,540
It hurts here.

417
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,150
Here?

418
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:36,500
Here.

419
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,640
Ayin, how are you?

420
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,980
Li Longda, how dare you come?

421
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,390
Listen to me.

422
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,450
What were you doing?

423
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,980
Calm down.

424
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,320
Listen to my explanation patiently.

425
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,940
Go away.

426
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,460
What are you doing?

427
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,100
I want you to help me.

428
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,020
No.

429
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,810
Why should I help you?

430
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,290
For the sake of

431
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,230
Chi Yu.

432
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,630
I'm sorry.

433
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,410
I kept it from you for so long.

434
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,160
Where is Chi Yu now?

435
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,710
This man was so wicked.

436
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,620
He held a gun. The policeman and he shot each other.

437
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,500
The last shot hit his shoulder.

438
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,420
He couldn't resist then.

439
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,080
So this is the legendary ruthless robber?

440
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,590
Yes.

441
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,210
He's coming.

442
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,750
Can you do it gently?

443
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,770
Are you a newcomer?

444
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,980
For a wound like this, it does hurt a little.

445
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,110
You'll feel better after ice compress.

446
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:06,860
Take it.

447
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,070
But

448
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,730
the recording pen

449
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,570
was broken by Ma Zehao.

450
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,070
However,

451
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,460
we beat him

452
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,240
in his own game.

453
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,480
That fool wouldn't have thought that

454
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,770
we had double safeguard measures.

455
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:39,800
So,

456
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,100
the evidence is collected successfully.

457
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,750
I'll hand over the part where he confessed his own crime

458
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,400
to the police.

459
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,030
So,

460
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,570
this is the plan made by both of you?

461
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,180
No.

462
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:51,970
Not us.

463
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,560
I came up with this idea myself.

464
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,470
It's a pity that

465
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,740
Ma Zehao ran away.

466
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,040
I wonder

467
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,200
how Ze is now.

468
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,340
So...

469
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,240
how did you know something wrong happened to me?

470
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,570
Don't treat me as an idiot.

471
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,470
Chi Yu's watch has been repaired.

472
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,330
Inside it, there are

473
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,150
the backups from his mobile phone.

474
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,120
We can give it to the police, too.

475
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,340
The last message in his watch

476
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,060
was left by Chi Yu

477
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:28,940
on the day of his accident.

478
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,280
But at that time,

479
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,050
Taotao was already in a coma and lying in hospital.

480
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,460
How could she

481
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,750
send such a strange message to Chi Yu?

482
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,870
So I don't think

483
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,830
this message

484
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,230
was sent by Taotao.

485
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,540
It was sent by the murderer.

486
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,010
So,

487
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,260
here is the key point.

488
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,300
As for

489
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,380
Taotao,

490
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,750
sending messages is tiring enough.

491
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,760
She rarely uses punctuation marks.

492
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,140
But there's a semicolon in this message.

493
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,430
This is Ze's habit.

494
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,680
I once asked him about the reason.

495
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,620
He said

496
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,890
he had to write lots of

497
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,510
programs and codes

498
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,540
in his life,

499
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,770
so he would end each line with a semicolon.

500
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,750
Besides, he uses this habit

501
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,010
in his life.

502
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,650
I used to write suspense novels for the story club.

503
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,870
You're right.

504
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,960
This clue is so obvious.

505
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,690
Anyone can guess it.

506
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,650
How annoying.

507
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,600
I'm still here.

508
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,520
However,

509
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,400
since I found out that you're Xiang Qinyu,

510
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,710
I've hated you even more.

511
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,020
If you dare to treat her badly,

512
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,020
I'll break your leg even if I have to

513
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,070
go after you to the ends of the earth.

514
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,710
Well,

515
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,350
you have to defeat me first.

516
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,080
Fine.

517
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,500
I have to go.

518
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,429
Longda.

519
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,580
I have something to tell you.

520
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,300
Longda.

521
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,650
I'm sorry.

522
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,460
You're a good person,

523
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,620
but I...

524
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:09,920
Stop it.

525
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,340
Don't use the excuse that I'm a good person.

526
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,900
It's okay. It's not necessary.

527
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,180
Don't worry.

528
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,590
I...

529
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,190
won't be the sad male supporting role.

530
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:21,940
I believe

531
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,520
I'll be the shinning male lead

532
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,700
in a certain girl's heart.

533
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,610
Of course.

534
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:35,380
Alright.

535
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,960
I'm leaving.

536
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:37,740
Okay.

537
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:56,690
[It's getting dark.]

538
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:56,690
[The movie ends.]

539
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:56,690
[The night lasts so long that it's hard to get over the bad feelings.]
