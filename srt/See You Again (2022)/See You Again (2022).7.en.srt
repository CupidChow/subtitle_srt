00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,730
Why did you really leave?

5
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,970
Leave me alone to clean up the mess.

6
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,390
If you don't apologize to me now,

7
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,030
I'll let you know

8
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,670
what real death is like.

9
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,420
Mom. Mom.

10
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,140
What do you want?

11
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,420
I want candies.

12
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,240
No.

13
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,930
I told you you can't have candies.

14
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,530
You already have decayed teeth. How can you still have candies?

15
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,930
I want it.

16
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,120
Why are you so disobedient?

17
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,560
I want a candy.

18
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,579
Only one.

19
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,500

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,420
Which one?

22
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,340
This one.

23
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,740
You'll get decayed teeth if you eat it.

24
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,220
You can't eat it.

25
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,190
Didn't I tell you

26
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,840
not to take things from strangers?

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What if someone takes you away?

28
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,270
All you know is eating.

29
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,380
You're so greedy.

30

Disappear!

35
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,380
Miss Teng Xi.

36
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,060
Why are you here?

37
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,570
Chi Yu's...

38
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,940
Just call me Xi.

39
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,740
What's wrong?

40
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,079
Can you

41
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,300
write down

42
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,760
Chi Yu's parents' address for me?

43
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,930
I see.

44
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:03,930
I'll give it to you.

45
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,900
But let me tell you,

46
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,020
Chi Yu is very afraid of his dad.

47
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,180
You just need to deal with his parents first,

48
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,020
and you two will be fine.

49
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,650
Looks like

50
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,550
we finally got something done today.

51

Is it here?

52
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,040
Yu.

53
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,490
Chi Yu.

54
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,050
It's really you, Yu.

55
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,730
You are?

56
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,780
I'm your uncle, kid.

57
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:56,940
You got the wrong person.

58
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,340
Don't go.

59
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,470
Do you know

60
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,620
how worried your parents are?

61
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,470
Come back with me.

62
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,450
You really mistook me for someone.

63
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,270
Come back with me.

64
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,460
You're back, Yu. It's really you.

65
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:05,980
Go back.

66
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,860
Seriously.

67
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,340
You really got the wrong person.

68
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,020
Your parents are so worried.

I went to the finance department to paste the invoices.

71
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,980
I heard them say

72
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,930
the first payment to the on-set screenwriters has been transferred.

73
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,110
Check and see if you've received it.

I think you got the wrong person.

85
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,840
I'm not Chi Yu.

86
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,380
I don't know you either.

87
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,620
I'm here to investigate

about Chi Yu's disappearance.

I know it's a bit abrupt to come here,

90

but this is not how you should treat guests.

91

Please untie me first.

I won't be so polite if you pull me again.

101

Who are you going to be impolite to?

102
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,750
He's your uncle. You want to fight him?

Why didn't you tell us?

105

Do you know how worried your mother was?

106
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,670
I said I don't know you.

107

108

Why did she take things this hard?

118
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,620
What can it be that she couldn't overcome?

119
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,580

I've never heard you talk about her.

What's up, dear?

Grandma is drying up tea leaves.

Don't mention Sun.

He has changed his mind.

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,580
Really?

174
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,060
That's good.

175
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,020
Grandma,

176
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,660
I received a sum of money today.

177
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,570
Over 10,000 yuan.

178
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,220
I don't want your money.

179
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,430
Keep your money to yourself.

180
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,670
You should take care of yourself.

181
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,170
Take care of yourself too.

182
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,240
Come visit me when you have time.

183
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,460
I miss you.

184
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,300
Got it, Grandma.

185
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,870
Bye.

186
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,590
Okay, bye.

187
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,230
How about

188
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,830
I take it?

189
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,460
No, no, no.

190
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:08,890
How can you

191
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,400
take others' money for no reason?

192
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,000
Jin Ayin.

193
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,660
You're not that kind of person.

194
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,170
Please take back your bank card.

195
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,250
Jin Ayin.

196
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,300
Come on!

197
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,460
You're only one digit away from your million-yuan deposit goal.

198
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,580
Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

199
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,540
I'd say

200
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,130
you still don't want to leave me.

201
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,780
Ms. Fan, I'm here.

202
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,090
Let go of me.

203
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,610
Let go.

204
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,260
Tell me.

205
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,120
I haven't seen you much lately.

206
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,220
Are you seeing

207
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,900
some other girl?

208
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,660
No.

209
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,890
What are you thinking?

210
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,800
In my heart,

211
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,690
there's always only you, Fan.

212
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,150
If you want money,

213
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,280
you have to behave.

214
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,420
When I call you,

215
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,020
you need to answer immediately.

216
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,000
Besides,

217
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,560
you have to show up any time I want you.

218
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,340
Okay.

219
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,740
Be good.

220
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,880
Really?

221
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,650
Yes.

222
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,630
Is he...

223
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,820
Is it that

224
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,990
he doesn't want to work hard at such a young age?

225
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,150
The entertainment industry is not easy indeed.

226
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,340
As long as you behave.

227
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,040
Be good.

228
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:38,700
Okay.

229
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,480
Show up any time I call you.

230
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,000
Of course.

231
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,540
Take care.

232
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,690
Bye, Fan.

233
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,990
Take care, Fan.

234
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:54,910
Ayin.

235
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,240
Longda.

236
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,250
I saw nothing.

237
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,210
Nothing.

238
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,170
Well...

239
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,070
are you here shopping after work?

240
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:11,820
No.

241
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,330
Well...

242
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,330
Are you okay?

243
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,480
It's just that

244
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,930
he's been a bit out of his mind lately.

245
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,500
I apologize on his behalf.

246
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,900
It's okay.

247
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,340
Why were you avoiding me?

248
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,300
Was I?

249
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,090
No, I wasn't.

250
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,190
You weren't?

251
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,330
Are you still

252
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,300
angry with me for leaving early last time at the bar?

253
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,010
Of course not.

254
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,130
Then what is it?

255
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,040
Longda.

256
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,180
Well...

257
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,820
Everyone has

258
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,070
their own choice of lifestyle.

259
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,890
I totally respect it.

260
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,260
I...

261
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,730
I saw it just now.

262
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,580
But don't worry.

263
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,950
I won't tell anyone.

264
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:58,990
Wait, Ayin.

265
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,070
What was that?

266
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,200
A domineering female boss

267
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,670
and her toyboy.

268
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,600
I've written about this before.

269
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,170
A toyboy?

270
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,550
Well,

271
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,420
I'm sorry.

272
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,400
I didn't...

273
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,580
I didn't mean that.

274
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,420
Then...

275
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,900
In that case,

276
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,190
since you know

277
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,640
it's not easy for me to make money,

278
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,560
buy me dinner.

279
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,480
I'm hungry.

280
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,370
Let's go.

281
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,070
I forgot to order something to drink.

282
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,090
Waiter.

283
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,010
Waiter.

284
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,680
Give me a pomegranate juice.

285
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,220
What would you like?

286
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,680
No, thanks.

287
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,050
Just water.

288
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,770
Please enjoy your pomegranate juice.

289
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,020
Thank you.

290
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:13,860
You're welcome.

291
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,590
Since

292
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:23,930
you've seen it,

293
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,220
tell me.

294
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,390
What do you want?

295
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,420
Don't worry.

296
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,070
I won't tell anyone about your secret.

297
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,520
I won't threaten you

298
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,040
or blackmail you.

299
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,140
It's just...

300
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,090
Just what?

301
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:53,900
It's just...

302
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,410
I just feel

303
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,550
a little...

304
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,050
My heart

305
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,180
hurts a little.

306
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,260
Longda.

307
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,700
No matter what,

308
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,140
you're an actor.

309
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,010
You are already a leading actor.

310
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,619
If you become famous,

311
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,400
and your dark history gets exposed,

312
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,849
your efforts

313
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,349
will be in vain, right?

314
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,099
You're right.

315
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,260
What should I do?

316
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,060
In my opinion...

317
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,460
Look at you.

318
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,900
You are

319
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,430
a handsome man.

320
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,010
Stop using women

321
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,030
to do those things.

322
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,150
You can never

323
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,530
get enough money.

324
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,020
Even so,

325
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,530
but...

326
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:49,990
Thank you.

327
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,500
Although the saying goes like that,

328
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,240
you have to see if it's worth it.

329
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,000
For example,

330
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,630
look at

331
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,970
my spaghetti, which is worth 98 yuan.

332
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,940
It's delicious.

333
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,940
Your

334
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,700
more expensive squid

335
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,890
is delicious too.

336
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,210
It's not even as good as the spaghetti in the convenience store.

337
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,170
Try this.

338
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,630
Is it the same?

339
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,660
Almost the same.

340
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,620
Are you full?

341
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,410
If you like it,

342
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,350
I'll take you here again next time.

343
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,050
No, thanks.

344
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,700
By the way, Longda.

345
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,000
Give me your phone.

346
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:14,850
Phone?

347
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,550
This is

348
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,210
the money you gave me at the bar last time.

349
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,690
I just saved it in the bank.

350
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,100
It's not easy for you to make money.

351
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,590
Stop spending money extravagantly

352
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,440
and squandering it like this.

353
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,460
In the past,

354
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,270
it was always me who spent money on girls.

355
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,140
No girl has ever given me money.

356
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:46,980
Why are you so nice?

357
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,040
No.

358
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,570
I'm only doing this

359
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,270
to make myself feel better.

360
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:54,980
OK.

361
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,540
I'll give you

362
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,220
whatever you want.

363
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,720
Longda,

364
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,070
I have a question for you.

365
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,110
But

366
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,630
I was too drunk to ask last time.

367
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,370
Go ahead.

368
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,240
How did Chi Yu go missing?

369
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,420
I really don't know.

370
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,640
But

371
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,170
you were at that villa last time.

372
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,480
The Magpie Bar.

373
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,910
How do you...

374
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:24,940
Longda.

375
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,500
Stop lying.

376
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,150
I know you're hiding something.

377
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,370
Longda,

378
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,140
I don't think you're a bad guy.

379
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,360
But

380
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,250
if there's something hard to say,

381
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,800
you can tell me.

382
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,200
Are you full?

383
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:43,940
I'll go get the bill.

384
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,220
There are some things

385
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:54,770
that I can't say clearly

386
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,340
for now,

387
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,460
but thank you for trusting me.

388
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,920
I'm not a bad person.

389
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,250
Hello, check please.

390
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,230
Longda, I promised to treat you.

391
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,510
I chose this restaurant.

392
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,530
Besides,

393
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,530
you've already paid me back.

394
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,500
Let me do it.

395
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,110
How about

396
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,580
we split it?

397
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,260
Do you have

398
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,140
any discount?

399
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,780
Is there a coupon for group purchase?

400
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:42,980
No? For real?

401
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,500
In the end,

402
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,670
everyone avoided her.

403
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,460
Those rich people are hypocrites.

404
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,180
The paper lanterns burst as soon as they are poked on.

405
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,340
Only the

406
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,090
kind heart is the most beautiful.

407
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,760
This is the story of "Ball of Fat".

408
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,580
Did you

409
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,060
listen to me?

410
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,950
Yes, I did.

411
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,590
I know I talk too much.

412
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:15,500
But...

413
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,530
I love to hear you talk.

414
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,730
Ladies and gentlemen,

415
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,190
dear guests,

416
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,000
as long as you participate in the competition,

417
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,750
the one who can do plank for the longest time

418
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,860
will get a big prize.

419
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,750
The first prize

420
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,740
is a balance bike worth 1,500 yuan.

421
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,740
How about we call it a day?

422
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,230
You go back first.

423
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,250
Ayin.

424
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,140
You want it?

425
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,590
Friends here,

426
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,700
please raise your hand

427
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,170
if you want to participate in the competition.

428
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,430
Come up to the stage.

429
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,830
It's already three minutes.

430
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,440
Ayin.

431
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,950
Forget it.

432
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,620
No.

433
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,060
Look at that fatty.

434
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,650
He must have worked out.

435
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
And the man beside you

436
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,470
must be doing pull-ups

437
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,570
in the park every day.

438
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,760
Anything

439
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,790
I can struggle through

440
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:20,940
is never

441
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,380
a big deal.

442
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,390
It's been four minutes.

443
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,850
Don't you want that balance bike?

444
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,780
I'll buy you one.

445
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,260
It's new. It's better than this.

446
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,220
No.

447
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:52,690
Three.

448
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,100
Two.

449
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,630
OK. Congratulations to our winner.

450
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,060
Alright.

451
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,120
We won!

452
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:08,890
Since I was little,

453
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,580
my grades may not have been the best,

454
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,380
but when it comes to

455
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,830
swimming or running,

456
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,090
I could struggle through

457
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,170
anything that calls for stamina.

458
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,380
Hang in there,

459
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,220
Jin Ayin.

460
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,700
Why do you want it so much?

461
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,130
You call it clothes?

462
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,040
You...

463
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,210
Disappear!

464
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,010
This is yours now.

465
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,770
Jin Ayin.

466
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,680
He fled to escape punishment.

467
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,450
You still want to give him a gift?

468
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,010
Is this

469
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,130
for me?

470
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:05,940
Ayin.

471
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,050
I wonder if Jin Ayin is home safely.

472
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:15,950
Forget it.

473
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,190
Find Li Longda first.

474
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,340
Where else can I be?

475
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,440
On set.

476
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,570
Let me tell you.

477
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,020
I have got enough story for a drink these days.

478
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,700
Listen.

479
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,530
Don't mention Li Longda to me.

480
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,650
He pissed Director Feng off on set today.

481
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,730
Are you the person in charge here?

482
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,100
Chi Yu.

483
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,450
Hey, you...

484
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,130
When did you come back?

485
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,580
Why didn't you tell me?

486
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:45,640
But

487
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,650
it's good that you are back.

488
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,000
It's good that you're back safely.

489
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,750
I'm sorry.

490
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,370
I just want to know

491
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,460
where Li Longda is now.

492
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,460
What's wrong, bro?

493
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,420
Don't you recognize me?

494
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,860
I...

495
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,070
I'm Hu.

496
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,860
On the night of your accident,

497
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,140
you, me and Longda,

498
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,560
we drank at the Magpie Bar, remember?

499
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,100
The leading actor of my play

500
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,980
should have been you.

501
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,820
You forgot about this, too?

502
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,650
Chi Yu was the leading actor.

503
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:12,980
Oh no.

504
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,740
You are completely off.

505
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,100
You must be out of your mind due to the drowning.

506
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,460
Let me see.

507
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,860
When Chi Yu went missing,

508
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,290
you and Li Longda were with him.

509
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,990
Yes.

510
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,990
What happened that day?

511
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,420
Let go of me first.

512
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,040
The kid is so strong.

513
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,810
What could have happened?

514
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,920
You said

515
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,100
you had to take a phone call outside.

516
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,740
Longda went out to look for you.

517
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,660
He told me when he came back

518
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,180
that you were pushed into the water.

519
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,530
You forgot?

520
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,050
The police looked for you for days.

521
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,580
There was no clue at all.

522
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,730
I saw Li Longda.

523
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,860
I saw him

524
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,400
running in a flurry

525
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,050
as if he saw a ghost.

526
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,500
Where's Li Longda?

527
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,530
How would I know where he is?

528
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,560
Let's talk about us first.

529
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,470
How about this?

530
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,580
I'll give you a chance

531
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,970
to play the leading actor again.

532
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,080
Otherwise, I'm afraid

533
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,250
I can't sell my drama.

534
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,840
Chi Yu.

535
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:07,860
Oh no.

536
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,610
He's completely off.

537
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:21,980
Well,

538
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,200
thank you for walking me home.

539
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,420
You're welcome.

540
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,580
I'll get going then.

541
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,660
Let me walk you.

542
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,780
No need. It's so close.

543
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,880
It's okay. Let's go.

544
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,560
Your neighborhood is pretty.

545
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,570
It's very artistic.

546
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,180
Actually, you don't need to...

547
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,840
It's okay.

548
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,140
Let's go.

549
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,960
You and Chi Yu are...

550
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,460
Don't get us wrong.

551
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,100
We just share a house.

552
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,020
Share a house?

553
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,140
Then you are roommates.

554
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,310
Roommates.

555
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,260
Do you have

556
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:02,980
a

557
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,260
boy...

558
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,790
Boyfriend?

559
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:09,810
Go on.

560
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,730
My neck...

561
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:32,750
Well...

562
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,170
When did you

563
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,380
have such a relationship

564
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,920
of going home together?

565
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,180
It's none of your business.

566
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,980
You took off the minute I told you to.

567
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,320
When did you become so obedient?

568
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,270
Keep running.

569
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,760
Shut up.

570
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,380
Chi Yu.

571
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,700
When did you become so rude?

572
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,990
You can't be so rude

573
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,120
talking to a cute girl.

574
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,390
What?

575
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,990
You're used to delicacies,

576
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,230
so you want to switch to the radish and cabbage now?

577
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,420
Who is radish and cabbage now?

578
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:09,940
Ayin.

579
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,030
Don't listen to his nonsense.

580
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,640
Don't touch her.

581
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,300
Let us go!

582
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,270
Jin Ayin.

583
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,230
As a girl,

584
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,180
you should behave yourself.

585
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,740
You're just like

586
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,730
the double-standard people you talked about.

587
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,360
How am I a double-standard person?

588
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,540
Isn't this the word to describe

589
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,790
the girl who goes crazy

590
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,220
as soon as a man sends you home?

591
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,000
We weren't just sending-home relationship.

592
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,600
We even went on a date.

593
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,730
Am I right, Longda?

594
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,240
Yes.

595
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,510
I think

596
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,540
Miss Ayin is nice.

597
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,180
What's wrong?

598
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,090
Besides,

599
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,480
it's none of your business whether I behave myself or not.

600
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:06,860
You...

601
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,610
What?

602
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,470
Aren't you

603
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:11,750
my fen?

604
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,130
That's called a fan.

605
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,260
Yes.

606
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,800
You should control yourself more.

607
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,370
You can't embarrass me.

608
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,990
I don't want to talk to you.

609
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,720
I'll go upstairs.

610
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,510
Psycho.

611
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
I'm not done yet.

612
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,650
Longda.

613
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,830
Take care.

614
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,550
Bye.

615
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,540
Be careful upstairs.

616
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,350
Let's meet another day.

617
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:52,940
I'm leaving.

618
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,330
Let me ask you.

619
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,720
Did you tell Chi Yu's family

620
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,860
about me?

621
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,500
You were back

622
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,740
but you didn't visit them.

623
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,790
They were worried.

624
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,270
I'm warning you.

625
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,710
Stay away from Jin Ayin.

626
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,100
She's not someone you can toy with.

627
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,240
It hurts.

628
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:25,930
It hurts.

629
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,800
Well...

630
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,800
Why are you so angry?

631
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,900
Are you jealous because of Jin Ayin?

632
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,390
Why would I be jealous?

633
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,340
I...

634
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,350
I...

635
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,760
I thought maybe

636
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,630
you also like Jin Ayin.

637
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,600
What do you mean by also?

638
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,260
You like her too?

639
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,660
Fine. I was just saying.

640
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,110
I was just saying.

641
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,030
If you don't like her,

642
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,650
why are you so fierce to me?

643
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,910
Nonsense.

644
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,700
Brother.

645
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:01,400
Be gentle. It really hurts.

646
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,970
Don't be glib-tongued.

647
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,260
Let me ask you.

648
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,060
Are you hiding something from me

649
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,780
about Chi Yu's disappearance?

650
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,700
I've told you everything I should.

651
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,580
Did you recall something?

652
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,250
Are you afraid that I recall things?

653
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,900
Why should I be afraid?

654
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,560
I'm not afraid.

655
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,150
Since

656
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,300
I have safely sent Jin Ayin home,

657
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,180
I'm leaving.

658
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,660
A good conscience

659
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,530
is a soft pillow.

660
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,500
How ungrateful.

661
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,400
Unrepentant.

662
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,040
If you want to apologize,

663
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,970
I won't accept it.

664
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:51,980
Unless...

665
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,050
I have only one thing to say.

666
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:15,920
[What you can't resist is not only love,]

667
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:15,920
[but also others' boyfriend/girlfriend.]

668
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,900
[Sweet On]

669
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,900
[See You Again]

670
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,900
[Exclusively on iQIYI]

671
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,830
The character they shot is quite interesting.

672
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,790
Sir,

673
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,030
I want to know where the exit is.

674
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,800
Ghost.

675
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,930
I saw a ghost.

676
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,410
I saw a ghost.
