4
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,890
Ze replied to me

5
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,450
and said he had to go back to work.

6
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,390
Weird.

7
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,640
Why does my phone

8
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,620
freeze a lot these days?

9
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,240
What are you looking for?

10
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,300
The watch Chi Yu's mom gave me is gone.

11
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,420
It's only been a few days.

12
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,840
Your stuff are a mess. Scattered everywhere.

13
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,760
It's only right that you can't find it.

14
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,270
Isn't this it?

15
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,380
Why is it powered but I still can't turn it on?

16
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,950
It's scratched.

17
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,320
What did you do to it?

18
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,520
It's not my fault.

19
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,120
You don't know how to use it, but you keep playing with it.

20
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:49,940
Alright.

21
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,930
Charge your watch for a while.

22
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,079
If you still can't turn it on later,

23
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,930
I'll take you to fix it.

24
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,090
By the way,

25
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,000
is this the Taotao

26
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,760
that you mentioned before?

27
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,540
Yes.

28
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,770
Why do you have Taotao's photo?

29
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,450
This is...

30
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,390
Taotao and Chi Yu?

31
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,260
How do they know each other?

32
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,730
What's their relationship?

33
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,260
I don't know.

34
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,600
There's something

35
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,760
I haven't told you.

36
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,300
In the past,

37
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,730
there was a girl

38
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,790
who looked exactly like Taotao.

39
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,829
This is our Flying Escort Action last year.

40
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,290
We went deep into the places where wild birds spend their winter

41
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,300
and take a rest

42
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,810
to patrol

43
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,800
for the birds' migration.

44
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,560
Are you okay?

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,250
This was stuck here by a customer.

46
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,300
I'll ask someone to fix it right away.

47
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:20,769
No need.

48
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,810
I'll take care of it.

49
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,060
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

50
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:24,980
It's okay.

51
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,060
Coming. Just a moment.

52
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,060
Hand me the takeout.

53
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,670
Single women nowadays protect themselves like this?

54
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,550
Why is he here?

55
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,340
Why are you so nervous to see me?

56
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,990
And you look so pretty in pajamas.

57
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,960
Don't you want your takeout?

58
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:38,970
Excuse me.

59
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,340
How did you know I live here?

60
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,060
It's on the delivery list.

61
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,820
Where should I put this?

62
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,020
Anywhere.

63
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,930
Just put it near the wall.

64
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,910
You left something at my place

65
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,340
last time.

66
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,550
Are you laughing at me?

67
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,340
Just keep it as a souvenir.

68
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,180
Is your foot better?

69
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,190
Don't bother.

70
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,690
This is for you.

71
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,900
What is this?

72
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,520
Fish food.

73
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,140
The turtle is so small.

74
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,490
How can it eat fish fry?

75
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,200
It eats this?

76
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,080
Yes.

77
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,140
If you have any questions,

78
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,100
just ask me.

79
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:49,730
By the way,

80
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,650
your takeout.

81
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,750
Spicy chicken ribs.

82
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,970
So you also eat such common-taste food.

83
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,840
You've delivered what you want.

84
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,510
If there's nothing else,

85
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,000
please go back.

86
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,500
I'm already here.

87
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,330
Don't you want to treat me to a meal?

88
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,540
I have something else to do.

89
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,110
I can't go out for dinner.

90
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,310
Besides,

91
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,880
there's nothing to eat at home.

92
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,780
I'll make myself at home then.

93
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,430
Are you sure you don't want a bite?

94
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,440
No.

95
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,350
It's too raw.

96
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,260
It tastes bad.

97
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,390
Really?

98
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,260
But I love to crack the hard nuts.

99
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,140
Fine.

100
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,180
Well,

101
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,060
let's officially,

102
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,020
properly,

103
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,180
have a talk

104
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,440
about our current situation.

105
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,960
I'm dying for it.

106
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,820
Considering the fact that

107
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,580
this is the third time

108
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,330
that we've met,

109
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:44,030
to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings,

110
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,800
I think it's better

111
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,180
to make things clear.

112
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,750
That day,

113
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,910
I was impulsive.

114
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,910
But you can forget about the past.

115
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,150
But you got the wrong person.

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,790
You added me on WeChat

117
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,320
and wouldn't leave my house.

118
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,430
You even sent

119
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,560
me a gift.

120
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,840
These tricks are just for little girls.

121
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,980
I won't fall for that.

122
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,540
I know there may be a gap in age

123
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,500
between us.

124
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,370
You may be concerned.

125
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,340
But age is not a problem.

126
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,650
Let me make it more clear.

127
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,730
I'm used to being alone.

128
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,530
I don't want anyone

129
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,030
to enter my life,

130
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,300
especially men.

131
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,860
Let alone

132
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,630
a little boy.

133
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,860
So you don't want to take responsibility?

134
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,100
Or are you afraid that I'll let you down?

135
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,420
We got to know each other

136
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,380
for fun.

137
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,600
Don't be so serious.

138
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,080
Alright.

139
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,740
Anyway,

140
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,780
I'm really not suitable for you.

141
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,060
I have something else to do.

142
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,430
See you then.

143
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,090
I really like you.

144
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,660
Can we be friends?

145
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,130
Can I see you again?

146
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,220
If it rains this week,

147
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,310
I'll see you.

148
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,250
If it doesn't rain,

149
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,000
please

150
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,690
don't contact me ever again.

151
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,620
Do you dare to bet with me?

152
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,040
OK.

153
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,650
There's at least a little hope if I take the bet.

154
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,690
If I don't, I won't even stand a chance.

155
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,630
Gosh, this is so...

156
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,240
This is so unbelievable.

157
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,710
You mean

158
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,520
there was a girl

159
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,970
who looked exactly like Taotao?

160
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,150
Yes.

161
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,130
So,

162
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,810
your coming here

163
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,570
might have something to do with Taotao.

164
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,820
What's the girl's name?

165
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,630
I really don't know.

166
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,830
You've seen her several times, right?

167
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,230
Why don't you even know her name?

168
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,420
Back then,

169
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,900
why would I care about that kind of person?

170
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,820
Then...

171
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,540
is she also sick?

172
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:26,990
What do you mean?

173
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,980
Well,

174
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,100
Taotao has

175
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,560
had a disease since she was a child.

176
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,490
What disease?

177
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,330
It's called...

178
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,320
Phenylketonuria.

179
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,450
It's a

180
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,770
rare genetic disease.

181
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,810
Her hands tremble from time to time,

182
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,930
and she can't really remember things.

183
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,210
And...

184
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,150
And what?

185
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,130
And, she also

186
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,480
has some strange smell.

187
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,780
Taotao was actually

188
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,660
adopted by Grandma Tao.

189
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,120
Back that time,

190
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,490
Grandma Tao took her to many big hospitals.

191
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,200
But they said it was too late.

192
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,170
So she was left with an incurable sequela.

193
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,030
I think

194
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,040
that's probably why

195
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,910
she was abandoned by her parents.

196
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,280
These people really don't deserve to be parents.

197
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,380
Anyway, people in the town

198
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,750
have always looked down on Taotao.

199
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,500
They said

200
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,270
she must be a child of inbreeding.

201
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,760
Taotao and I have been neighbors since childhood,

202
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,940
so we naturally got along better.

203
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,010
Ze was Taotao's friend.

204
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,900
After his father died,

205
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,790
Grandma Tao often invited Ze over for dinner.

206
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,210
The three of us

207
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,280
grew up together.

208
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,370
My name is Taotao.

209
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,390
Will you

210
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,260
be my friend?

211
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,650
Don't be afraid.

212
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,680
This is my friend, Jin Ayin.

213
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,010
Ayin, this is my new friend.

214
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,620
His name is

215
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,900
Ma Zehao.

216
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,810
But after I graduated,

217
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,100
I left the town early to study in the city.

218
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,220
Taotao stayed in the town to retake senior-year courses

219
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,920
due to her health condition.

220
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,460
But Ze...

221
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,800
Although he had good grades,

222
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,650
he always said

223
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,080
that he didn't

224
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,110
get into the school he wanted.

225
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,740
The three of us

226
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,290
separated at that time.

227
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,200
Then why is Ma Zehao in Shanghai now?

228
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,590
Actually, it's because of me.

229
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,970
After I arrived in Shanghai,

230
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,850
I encouraged Taotao to study hard

231
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,820
and reunite with me in Shanghai in the future.

232
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,570
After that, Taotao studied very hard.

233
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,460
She retook the courses for three years and finally graduated.

234
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,830
Ze

235
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,480
came to Shanghai

236
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,410
to keep Taotao company.

237
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,620
You two live too far away.

238
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,900
I transferred three lines to get here.

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,800
Can't you choose a university

240
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,500
closer to the city?

241
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,140
It's inconvenient for me to come to you.

242
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,470
This place is

243
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,330
closer and cheaper.

244
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,790
Ayin,

245
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,550
do you know

246
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,150
where the People's Square is?

247
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,130
Yes.

248
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,180
Can you take me there?

249
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,910
My classmates said

250
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,340
the perfume there is very good.

251
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,870
Why do you need perfume?

252
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,740
Well,

253
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,000
they said

254
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,600
the smell on me

255
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,070
can't be covered by detergent.

256
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,690
What smell?

257
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,640
Why can't I smell it?

258
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,780
Were they born in the year of dog?

259
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:44,850
Taotao.

260
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,180
We are now in Shanghai.

261
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,660
We live in a big city.

262
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:49,680
In the future,

263
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,300
you'll be a famous makeup artist.

264
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:53,620
Ze,

265
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:54,620
you'll be a famous

266
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,480
programming guru in the future.

267
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,120
Let's wait and see who still dare to bully us.

268
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:04,710
How about

269
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,920
I paint your nails red

270
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:07,920
to boost your morale?

271
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,060
If anyone bullies you,

272
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,990
just scratch him.

273
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,710
I think Taotao

274
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,510
is good enough like this.

275
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,290
Taotao,

276
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,180
you're not bad at all.

277
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,480
Not at all.

278
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,160
We're the same.

279
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,710
Really?

280
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,470
And then?

281
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,690
Then,

282
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,880
even though we were in the same city,

283
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,110
our relationship

284
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,790
wasn't as close as it was

285
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,620
when we were kids.

286
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,560
At first,

287
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,400
we were thinking about getting together on the Dragon Boat Festival,

288
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,860
or the Double Seventh Festival.

289
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,010
But everyone was busy with work,

290
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,300
and we lived far away.

291
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,930
We didn't get to meet for many times, so we stopped making appointments.

292
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,130
Later,

293
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,490
we talked less and less on WeChat as well.

294
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,930
And then...

295
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,010
You knew what happened afterwards.

296
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,940
I only got to know about it

297
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,980
a month after Taotao's accident.

298
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,940
Coincidentally,

299
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,940
her biological parents appeared at that time.

300
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,050
Hello?

301
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,170
Something happened to Taotao.

302
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,190
She's in hospital.

303
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,060
What?

304
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,730
Ze.

305
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,660
Ze.

306
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:30,770
What happened?

307
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,260
What happened to Taotao?

308
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,830
Taotao...

309
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,840
Taotao forgot to turn off the gas stove.

310
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,390
The hospital

311
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,120
tried their best to save her,

312
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,530
but they could only keep her alive.

313
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,690
Whether she can wake up...

314
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,970
Soon,

315
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,110
Grandma Tao also passed away

316
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,020
due to sadness.

317
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,130
Later, Ze said

318
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,860
Taotao's parents

319
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,690
don't want her

320
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,320
to have any contact with her old friends.

321
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,840
So they wouldn't let us visit her.

322
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,740
So now,

323
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,090
we can only

324
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,680
go visit her

325
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,700
when Taotao's parents are not around.

326
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:26,870
What's wrong?

327
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,400
I was thinking

328
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,640
if it wasn't because

329
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,470
Li Longda witnessed it by accident,

330
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,470
everyone would think that

331
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,980
Chi Yu fell into the water by accident.

332
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,580
If I really

333
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,690
fell to death as the murderer had planned,

334
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,700
how much evidence can prove

335
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,890
that my death wasn't an accident?

336
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,320
You mean...

337
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,780
What if it wasn't Taotao who forgot

338
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,820
to turn off the gas?

339
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,150
Did the one who tried to murder Chi Yu

340
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,020
also kill her?

341
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,770
Someone tried to kill me.

342
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,380
Then before that,

343
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,140
why did that girl

344
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,680

I came to this era.

All these repetitions.

347
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,510

Alright, don't scare yourself.

349

Didn't we talk about this before?

350
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,440
Don't worry about me.

351
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,140
Your watch can't be fixed.

352
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:55,710
Forget it.

353
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,310
I won't beat around the bush.

354
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,620
If you want to fix your watch, it will be troublesome.

355
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,700
And it's not as simple as it looks.

356

At least 1,000 or 2,000 yuan.

357
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,890
Don't trick me.

358
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,530
Just tell me if you don't understand

359
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,840
this kind of high-end fashionable watch.

You don't have to believe me.

If you don't believe me,

365
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,060
just ask around.

Well,

367
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,590
it can still be fixed, right?

368
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,330
It's a gift from others' parents.

369
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,090
It's quite meaningful.

370
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,970
I still want to fix it.

371
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,190
Okay, fix it.

You broke the toy,

so you have to take responsibility for it.

I went to your company to see you.

you are short of money recently.

427
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,140
And you are working part time here.

428

Did you get in any trouble?

429
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,020
The salary of a programmer is quite high, right?

430
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,090
How much do you need?

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,280
Well...

432
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,490
It's not such a big deal.

433
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,990

I'll figure something out with you.

440

Taotao always stood up for you

441

when you were bullied before.

442
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,290
None of your relatives came to help you.

I'm really fine.

446

You came to see me for?

447
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,460
It's nothing.

448
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,710
My phone seems to be attacked by virus.

449
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,710
I want you to check it for me.

450
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,540
It's crashing a lot.

451
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,980
And it's very battery-consuming.

452
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,880
The screen is always flickering.

453
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,570
Maybe

454
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,830
it's really

455
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,360
attacked by virus.

456
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,020
The mechanic said the same thing.

457
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,010
It's okay. I'll check and eliminate the virus for you.

458
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,510
I knew it.

459
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,170
Who doesn't have some friends who know about this?

460
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,520
The mechanic

461
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,800
wanted to charge me 50 yuan.

462

Well,

466
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,780
I'll leave you to it.

467
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:06,950
I'll wait for you to get off work.

468
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,450
Didn't we say we would visit Taotao together some day?

469
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,670
There's no need to meet another day.

470
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,360
How about today?

471
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,530
Go ahead.

472
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,670
I'll wait for you outside.

473
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,230
OK.

474
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,450
Ayin,

475
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,150
have some water.

476
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:36,730
Thank you.

477
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,440
Is your phone alright now?

478
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:39,820
Yes.

479
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,390
What were you looking at?

480
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,660
So focused.

481
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,230
Nothing.

482
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:46,340
Just news.

483
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,170
Alright, let's go.

484
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,060

Taotao's mother

488
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,390
went there suddenly today.

489
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,170
We can only cancel it.

490
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,160
I see.

491
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,680
Okay.

492
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,630
Well,

493
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,040
I'll go back first.

494
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:13,730
Okay.

495
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,720
Go ahead.

496
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,910
Okay, be careful.

497
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:35,890
What?

498
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,350
Please.

499
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,620
Auntie.

500
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,700
Don't you feel hot?

501
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,160
You got scammed.

502
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,290
These are all my props.

503
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:13,910
Alright.

504
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,910
Go wait in the car.

505
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,780
-Yes. -Yes.

506
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,280
This is also a prop?

507
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,360
Yes.

508
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,130
My dear daughter-in-law.

509
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,250
Auntie, don't call me that.

510
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,460
Just call me Ayin.

511
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,290
My daughter-in-law Ayin.

512
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,660
Why didn't you tell me

513
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,860
that you're coming to our family's store?

514
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,680
Do you also own a shop here, auntie?

515
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,210
Let alone one shop,

516
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,380
let me tell you.

517
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,060
Everything

518
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,740
in your sight

519
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,200
belongs to our family.

520
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,040
Didn't Longda tell you?

521
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,650
My son is such a good boy.

522
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,260
Let me tell you then.

523
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,050
All of this

524
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,940
is just a part of the treasure

525
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,800
my husband and I got in store for you two.

526
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,340
Auntie,

527
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,150
well,

528
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,780
I'm going back to the crew.

529
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,400
In my opinion,

530
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,260
Ayin,

531
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,970
you work too hard.

532
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,330
You need to rest for half a day.

533
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,580
Is your producer's surname Hu?

534
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,440
Don't worry.

535
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:28,650
Hello?

536
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,150
Hu.

537
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,340
Here's the thing.

538
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,090
Well.

539
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:39,570
Look.

540
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,430
Well...

541
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,480
Auntie,

542
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,970
how about

543
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,600
I go shopping with you another day?

544
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,380
I really...

545
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:45,860
I...

546
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,650
Great.

547
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,410
So there will be a next time.

548
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,940
I like this arrangement.

549
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
My daughter-in-law Ayin.

550
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,040
What are your hobbies?

551
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:57,650
I...

552
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,790
I don't really have any hobbies.

553
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,660
That's why I like you.

554
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,110
Just like auntie,

555
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,900
I have no hobbies.

556
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,150
I just like spending money.

557
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,550
Come on.

558
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,830
Let me show you my hobby.

559
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,520
Come on.

560
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,320
No need.

561
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,800
This. And this.

562
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,740
Send them to her home.

563
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,030
My daughter-in-law Ayin,

564
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:19,820
these

565
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,110
are prepared

566
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,160
for your future baby with Longda.

567
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,940
Don't worry.

568
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,900
Whether it's a boy

569
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,820
or a girl,

570
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,140
I've prepared everything for it

571
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,220
from zero to one year old.

572
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,200
You know what?

573
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,620
The first time I saw you,

574
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,860
I thought of

575
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,160
my grandchildren

576
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,490
crawling on the ground.

577
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,060
I will be so happy.

578
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,230
I'll tell you again.

579
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,140
Longda

580
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,690
is a very filial son.

581
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,440
You know?

582
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,310
My goodness.

583
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,410
My dear daughter-in-law.

584
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,150
Okay.

585
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,490
Thank you.

586
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,310
Auntie,

587
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,500
I beg you.

588
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,040
They are really not suitable for me.

589
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,520
Not suitable?

590
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,980
That's easy.

591
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,190
Show us another batch.

592
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,050
No.

593
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:36,950
I...

594
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,250
I didn't mean that.

595
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,590
My daughter-in-law Ayin.

596
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,900
Come on.

597
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,260
How about

598
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,650
we take a selfie together?

599
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:46,750
One more.

600
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,540
Let me see.

601
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,660
Look at you, young and beautiful.

602
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,180
How nice.

603
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,340
I'm envious of your collagen.

604
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,300
It's nice.

605
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,500
Give me your phone and I'll send it to you.

606
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,330
Auntie,

607
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,530
I really like you.

608
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,010
Longda is a very good person, too.

609
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,140
But he and I

610
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,140
are nothing more than friends.

611
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,300
Soon,

612
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,520
you won't be.

613
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,470
Auntie.

614
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,980
What are you waiting for?

615
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:23,990
Get us another batch.

616
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,150
-Be quick. -This way, please.

617
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,140
-There's no need, auntie. -This way.

618
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,680
Auntie, do you understand my...

619
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,830
It's okay.

620
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,140
Try it on.

621
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,730
Gosh.

622
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:12,760
Hello, mom.

623
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,610
What's going on with your Moments?

624
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,060
What do you mean?

625
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,740
You're so stupid.

626
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,920
I'm just helping you.

627
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,980
Did you ask for her permission?

628
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,640
If Jin Ayin knows,

629
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,300
how can I explain to her?

630
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,340
You don't understand.

631
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,740
This is called love after marriage.

632
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,920
Your father was like this.

633
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,940
Let me tell you.

634
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:36,990
I can see that

635
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,990
if I don't do anything,

636
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,910
my precious daughter-in-law

637
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,490
must be taken away by someone else.

638
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,540
Let me tell you.

639
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,350
I don't want to see

640
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,060
your miserable face again.

641
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:46,790
How embarrassing.

642
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,620
Enough.

643
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,380
I'm busy.

644
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,920
Don't worry about anything.

645
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,720
Just prepare for your confession of love in two days.

646
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,410
Right.

647
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,180
Confession.

648
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,550
Hello, mom.

649
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,420
It really has nothing to do with me.

650
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,230
Wangcai, turn on the light.

651
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,570
You scared me.

652
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,380
Why are you back so early?

653
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,630
It's only been half a day,

654
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,790
and you are now married to a rich family.

655
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,090
What are you talking about?

656
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,700
You just got married to a rich family,

657
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,130
and you are already this arrogant.

658
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,530
I went to see Ze

659
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,870
and ran into Longda's mom.

660
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,750
Why were you looking for him?

661
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,320
Today,

662
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,240
I accidentally saw a photo of Taotao.

663
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,470
Ze and Chi Yu were in it.

664
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,520
Look.

665
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,000
But I think

666
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,990
this should be a misunderstanding.

667
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,870
It's just a coincidence.

668
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,770
If Ze really knows Chi Yu,

669
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,010
he should have reacted

670
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,820
when he saw you this morning.

671
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,980
I don't think so.

672
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,320
I've reminded you before.

673
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,070
This person is uncandid.

674
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,750
And he has erratic eyes.

675
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,850
What are you talking about?

676
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,360
I watched him grow up.

677
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,620
He doesn't know how to lie.

678
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,760
Why did you watch everyone grow up?

679
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,140
Don't move.

680
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,750
I have to return it tomorrow.

681
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,949
I think Li Longda is quite nice.

682
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,000
His mother likes you so much,

683
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,370
and he's very rich.

684
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,710
You're right.

685
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,500
How about

686
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,790
I don't return it

687
