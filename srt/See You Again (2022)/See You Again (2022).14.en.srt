00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,360
Okay. That's it.

6
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,580
Thank you, director.

7
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,530
Help me keep an eye on it.

8
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,280
Okay.

9
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,180
Hello.

10
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,789
I know, I know, I know.

11
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,450
I'll inform the coordinator,

12
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,940
get the Call Sheets ready,

13
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,500
and make time for each actor separately.

14
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,680
I heard you're also Chi Yu's friends privately.

15
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,079
Don't worry.

16
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,970
I've asked around about it.

17
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,440
The doctor in charge of the surgery is very famous.

18
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,520
He should be fine.

19
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,350
Mumu.

20
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,910
The police have caught the murderer.

21
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,310
Director Feng is helping to control the situation on site.

22
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,700
It should be fine.

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,630
If anything happens,

24
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,950
I'll deal with it in time.

25
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,140
Have you informed Chi Yu's parents?

26
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,150
I've just called them.

27
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,829
They've gone back to their hometown.

28
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,600
The film crew has booked early flight tickets for them.

29
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,000
They'll be back tomorrow morning.

30
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,380
I told them it's not a big problem,

31
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,650
and asked them not to worry.

32
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,930
Hello?

33
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,030
Okay. Got it.

34
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,350
Miss Mumu.

35
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,720
If you have something to do, just go.

36
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,640
We'll take care of it here.

37
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,380
Don't worry.

38
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,870
As soon as Wu Jianzhou came back from the headquarters,

39
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,040
he heard a piece of news like this.

40
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,350
If I don't go back,

41
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,890
I'm afraid he might tear down the Jianghe Studios.

42
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,060
How about this?

43
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,300
I'll go back to the company while you'll go to the filming set.

44
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,620
Call me if anything happens.

45
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,070
Okay.

46
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,700
You, too.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,340
You can contact me directly if anything happens.

48
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,110
Let's go back.

49
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:35,550
Longda.

50
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,540
Keep an eye on it.

51
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,720
Someone tried to hurt Chi Yu.

52
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,340
It can't be an accident.

53
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,490
Someone must have tampered with it.

54
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,660
What do you mean?

55
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,430
I shouldn't have challenged him.

56
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,480
I forgot the important business.

57
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,500
What are you talking about?

58
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,780
Someone tried to kill Chi Yu.

59
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,110
It wasn't an accident.

60
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,080
Someone must have tampered with it behind the scenes.

61
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,490
That person must have come back...

62
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,720
to hurt him.

63
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,030
He really lured the murderer here.

64
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,159
Are you hiding something from me?

65
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,430
Say something.

66
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,320
Look at me, and say something.

67
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,060
Actually...

68
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,470
Actually, it seemed someone was trying to kill Chi Yu.

69
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,290
He played the leading actor again.

70
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,690
He said those words at the press conference

71
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,540
so as to lure the murderer to look for him again.

72
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,970
Why didn't he tell me?

73
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,720
He was afraid of implicating you.

74
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,390
He was afraid you would also be in danger by his side.

75
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,260
Chi Yu.

76
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,710
Are you really going to push Ayin away,

77
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,510
and tell her nothing?

78
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,860
Do you know what

79
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,830
we are doing now?

80
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,530
How dangerous is it?

81
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,320
If the murderer finds out that I'm not dead,

82
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,420
he will find me again.

83
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,470
If I were still by her side by that time,

84
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,200
the only thing that I would bring her is danger.

85
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,500
Then...

86
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,260
If we keep everything from her,

87
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,100
will she...

88
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,260
I know her well.

89
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,460
If she knew,

90
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,740
she would choose to stand with me at all costs.

91
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,060
So I can't tell her the truth.

92
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,020
Nor can I get her involved.

93
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,550
Even if the chance should be one in ten thousand,

94
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,370
I won't try it.

95
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,740
That's why Chi Yu...

96
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,010
Are you the family of the patient who fell from the building?

97
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,580
Yes, I am.

98
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,120
Sorry, we've tried our best.

99
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,490
My condolences.

100
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,060
Chi Yu!

101
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,380
Chi Yu!

102
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,610
Chi Yu!

103
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,990
Xiang Qinyu.

104
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,780
Chi Yu, why did you leave us?

105
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,180
Chi Yu.

106
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,380
Xiang Qinyu.

107
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,510
-Xiang Qinyu! -Chi Yu!

108
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,540
This isn't Chi Yu.

109
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
Who is Chi Yu?

110
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,290
Ayin!

111
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,860
Xiang Qinyu.

112
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,660
You bastard!

113
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,920
Then stay away from the bastard.

114
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,409
From now on, don't pretend that

115
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,700
you're close to me when you're in the crew.

116
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,860
He was afraid of implicating you.

117
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,560
He was afraid that you would also be in danger by his side.

118
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,590
Yes.

119
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,110
Yes, Mr. Gao.

120
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,170
Mr. Gao, don't worry.

121
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,270
I've met Mumu.

122
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,250
She has

123
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,190
also told me

124
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,140
how it is going with the shooting of the Legend of Xiang Qinyu.

125
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,960
Everything is going well.

126
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,760
Okay.

127
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,710
If there is any problem with the project,

128
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,440
I'll report to you as soon as possible.

129
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,900
Okay, Mr. Gao.

130
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:22,900
Bye.

131
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,760
Since you've

132
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,130
reported your big boss,

133
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,919
I don't have to waste my time here.

134
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,740
Chen Mumu.

135
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,919
Don't think that as we were once boyfriend and girlfriend,

136
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,390
I can do nothing to you.

137
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,340
You...

138
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,440
will always be my subordinate.

139
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,350
I just think

140
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,230
instead of sitting with you here and doing nothing,

141
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,990
I'd rather go to see how the leading actor is.

142
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,370
Chi Yu is injured.

143
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,770
I'm not less worried than you are.

144
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,840
But the first thing I thought of was to block the spreading of the news.

145
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,620
-Chi Yu got injured. -Solve the PR problems that might occur.

146
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,520
What about Ayin?

147
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,900
Instead of reporting to you here,

148
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,060
or listening to your report to your big boss.

149
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,600
Don't touch me!

150
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,710
Don't touch me!

151
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,640
Are you crying because you can't find me?

152
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,130
I thought you left.

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,380
♫Remember to look back♫

171
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,680
You money maniac.

172
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,450
♫Look back♫

173
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,060
Liar.

174
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,970
Longda has told me

175
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,470
about what happened to Chi Yu.

176
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,840
What did he say?

177
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,800
He's always lying.

178
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,800
You believe him?

179
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,190
But I believe you.

180
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,060
It's getting late.

181
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,890
I'm going to rest.

182
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,360
Xiang Qinyu.

183
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,940
I'll forget it this time.

184
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,200
But don't do it again.

185
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,490
If you still keep it from me next time

186
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,400
when you're in danger,

187
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,900
I will...

188
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,960
I'll never talk to you again.

189
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,950
Isn't that what I want?

190
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,150
Jin Ayin.

191
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,990
I don't know how to explain it to you.

192
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,840
I feel that the murderer is still by my side.

193
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,640
Hao obviously wanted to kill me.

194
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,150
But why did he also come down?

195
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,750
So this matter

196
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,440
is not as simple as I thought.

197
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,520
You'll still be in danger by my side.

198
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,500
I'm afraid...

199
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,770
I'm not afraid.

200
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,540
But I'm afraid.

201
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,710
I don't want you to get hurt because of me.

202
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:21,810
Listen to me.

203
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,680
Before I catch the murderer,

204
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,800
pretend that you know nothing.

205
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,280
Continue to keep your distance from me.

206
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,460
Xiang Qinyu.

207
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,050
Stop!

208
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,510
I won't leave you alone.

209
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,590
So,

210
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,810
Chi Yu fell from such a high place,

211
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:41,930
and he's fine.

212
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,570
Except for spraining his leg.

213
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,060
I thought a serious accident had happened to him.

214
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,170
So I contacted you at once.

215
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,930
But you didn't answer my call.

216
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,500
I almost thought something wrong happened to you.

217
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,730
Anyway, it really scared me.

218
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,240
I finally understand

219
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,670
why the most beautiful phrase in the world

220
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,910
is a false alarm.

221
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,110
But both the action director and the prop team members

222
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,800
are experienced.

223
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,470
How could this happen?

224
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,040
Hao obviously wanted to kill me.

225
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,410
But why did he also come down?

226
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,520
So this matter

227
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,160
is not as simple as I thought.

228
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:25,700
Are you stunned from the eating?

229
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,210
I'm fine.

230
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,710
According to the news report online, a serious accident happened at the shooting site

231
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,660
of the Legend of Xiang Qinyu,

232
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,670
a new drama which stared to be filmed just a few days ago.

233
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,350
The leading actor and a martial artist

234
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,810
fell from a high place because of the breaking

235
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,080
of the film sets and the wires.

236
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,990
According to reliable sources,

237
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,250
they were both severely injured,

238
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,860
and died after the rescue failed.

239
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,630
Taotao,

240
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,010
let me tell you some good news.

241
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,250
The bad guys who bullied you

242
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,460
are finally dead.

243
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,390
I can finally take you home.

244
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,200
It's just that...

245
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,470
I've found that

246
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,950
Jin Ayin seems to know Chi Yu, too.

247
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,450
Do you think

248
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,700
she has been lying to us?

249
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,790
I told you

250
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,340
only I am

251
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,910
really good to you.

252
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,440
Ma.

253
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,220
Here's the receipt for you.

254
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,340
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

255
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,280
It's great that you can listen to me.

256
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,000
If you stay here every day,

257
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,470
how big the cost will be.

258
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,170
Take her back,

259
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,700
and live your life in peace.

260
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,630
I know you're a good boy.

261
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:09,920
It's not easy for you.

262
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,680
You treat her wholeheartedly,

263
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,140
and are heavily in debt.

264
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:14,780
By the way,

265
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,660
the two people

266
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,750
who chased you here that day

267
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,710
are also loan sharks, right?

268
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,880
How much do you owe them?

269
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,800
Why did they know you were here?

270
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,470
Did they do anything to you?

271
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,400
No. No.

272
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,710
Okay. I have to go.

273
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,060
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

274
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,350
You didn't answer my calls.

275
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,320
I'll bother you every day.

276
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,010
Xiang Qinyu.

277
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,230
Look what I've brought you.

278
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,530
The name of the character.

279
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,700
I'm used to calling him that.

280
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,640
Yin, give me these things first.

281
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,910
Mr. and Mrs. Chi,

282
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,140
let me introduce her.

283
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,060
This is Jin Ayin.

284
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,250
She's Chi Yu's ordinary friend.

285
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,340
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Chi.

286
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,380
I've brought some food for Chi Yu.

287
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,440
It's good for his health.

288
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,460
You and Yu are...

289
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,940
We are...

290
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,080
They are

291
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,340
very ordinary friends.

292
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,470
Chi Yu merely

293
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,240
lived in Ayin's home temporarily.

294
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,540
Yes, yes.

295
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,580
So you're Jin.

296
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,650
Yu used to

297
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,270
live in your home.

298
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,270
I've heard about it.

299
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,920
Yu is clumsy.

300
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,210
He can't do housework

301
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,660
and always make us worry.

302
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,980
Thank you and Longda for looking after him.

303
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,510
He always makes us worry indeed.

304
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,270
I mean,

305
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,760
friends

306
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,610
should

307
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,770
take care of each other and help each other.

308
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,530
Aren't you going to say something?

309
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,650
Have some oranges.

310
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,410
Thank you, Mr. Chi. Thank you.

311
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,180
How old are you?

312
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,500
What's your job?

313
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,350
How many members are there in your family?

314
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,500
Well...

315
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,630
What did you say?

316
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,690
You young people

317
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,760
have a lot to talk about when you meet each other.

318
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,310
Have a good chat.

319
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,830
We're leaving.

320
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,160
Yu,

321
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,260
get along with Jin.

322
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,670
Mrs. Chi,

323
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,560
they are just ordinary friends.

324
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,190
It's okay.

325
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,240
Jin,

326
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,620
you're welcome to visit our home often.

327
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,000
I'll make you delicious food.

328
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,130
Thank you.

329
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,440
Yu.

330
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,330
Take good care of yourself.

331
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,620
Your mom and I will visit you in a few days.

332
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,620
Why will you come?

333
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,600
Besides,

334
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,060
before we came here,

335
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,280
your mom asked me to

336
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,020
tell you that

337
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,680
I shouldn't have yelled at you

338
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,140
the other day when you came home.

339
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,260
Yu, don't refuse to go home

340
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,680
because you're angry.

341
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,610
Yu.

342
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,820
Now

343
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,480
your mom and I are not young anymore.

344
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,890
Don't do the same as you did before.

345
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,720
You used to be out for half a month without any news.

346
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,450
Besides, while you're away from home alone,

347
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,690
you have to be careful.

348
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,780
Whether you're busy or not,

349
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,330
remember to call your mom.

350
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,120
You can also call me.

351
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,470
Take the money.

352
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,800
As a mature man,

353
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,390
be generous.

354
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,540
Don't let the girl spend money while you go out together.

355
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,040
Got it?

356
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,320
If you want to eat something,

357
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,950
just call us.

358
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,030
Mr. Chi, don't worry.

359
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,740
He will call you often.

360
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:08,810
He surely will.

361
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Thank you, Jin.

362
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,140
Let's go.

363
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,660
We're leaving.

364
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,690
Take care.

365
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,750
Bye, Mrs. Chi.

366
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,500
Bye.

367
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,220
Bye, Mr. Chi.

368
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,340
Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Chi.

369
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,820
What did you say just now?

370
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,290
I said it as you had taught me.

371
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,820
Did I teach you that?

372
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,170
It was your first time to meet that girl,

373
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,800
and you said those weired things.

374
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,610
How awkward your questions were.

375
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,900
What should I ask?

376
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,720
Didn't I tell you not to come?

377
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,520
I can't come just because you said so?

378
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,820
If so, I'll lose face.

379
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,720
Eat it while it's still warm.

380
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,180
I don't eat.

381
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,540
It took me a long time to make the food.

382
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,580
I'll eat if you don't.

383
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,040
Give it to me.

384
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,020
Why is there no filling?

385
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,280
You didn't bite the filling.

386
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,000
There's no filling.

387
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,780
You bit too much.

388
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,500
No filling.

389
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,080
Stop talking. Just eat.

390
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,780
Which of you is Chi Yu?

391
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,660
Why was I the only one to be driven out?

392
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,540
Who is this, please?

393
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,480
His guardian.

394
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,450
Alright, Chi Yu.

395
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,260
We received a report from the crew.

396
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,580
It has been proved that

397
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,630
someone inserted an iron rod into

398
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,050
the tools used for shooting stunts.

399
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,060
The film sets were also destroyed deliberately.

400
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,730
We're here to confirm

401
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,280
what the relationship is

402
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,650
between you and the deceased, Hao.

403
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,520
Other than the grudges

404
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,790
caused by work which they've mentioned,

405
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,130
is there anything else?

406
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,730
Grudges?

407
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,000
Hao was the scar-faced man who had bullied you there.

408
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,930
Before the accident, the deceased Hao

409
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,050
bribed his former colleague who is a martial artist,

410
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,000
to replace

411
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,250
the actor who should have acted in the same scene with you.

412
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,020
Besides,

413
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,140
a member of the crew said

414
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,380
when he was about to

415
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,260
check whether the film sets were safe,

416
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,970
Hao lied that someone was looking for him.

417
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,420
That's why he didn't

418
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,960
properly check the bamboo board which later caused the accident.

419
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,440
So now we have sufficient reasons to

420
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,540
suspect that this is a premeditated

421
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,780
personal injury case.

422
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,140
So you mean

423
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,220
Hao was the murderer?

424
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,280
And he was also the man who had attacked Chi Yu previously?

425
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,300
We're not sure about it yet.

426
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,340
Because we haven't found

427
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,900
any link of valid evidence

428
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,180
between these two cases.

429
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,610
He was not the murderer of the previous case.

430
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,030
Why are you so sure?

431
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,980
When I was in the crew,

432
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,780
judging by his attitude towards me,

433
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:32,790
I can know

434
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,210
we didn't know each other before.

435
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,860
Besides, when he fell down,

436
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,940
he didn't know what was happening.

437
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,140
If it wasn't an accident,

438
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,180
the murderer must be someone else.

439
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,550
Maybe Hao's death...

440
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,960
The murderer killed him as he wanted to cover the truth?

441
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,510
Okay. I got it.

442
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,530
Next,

443
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,280
if you have any new clues,

444
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,640
please contact us immediately.

445
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,020
It'll help us

446
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,530
narrow down the range of suspects quickly,

447
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,520
and solve the case as soon as possible.

448
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,330
No.

449
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,510
I can't just sit there and do nothing.

450
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,850
I have to find some clues myself and find out the truth.

451
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,560
Tell me again.

452
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,860
What happened on the day

453
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,800
when Chi Yu fell into the water?

454
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,260
No.

455
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,840
I really can’t tell Chi Yu.

456
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,280
If I tell him, I...

457
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:32,940
No.

458
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,080
I really can't tell you.

459
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,070
Fine. You both kept it from me.

460
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,740
You... I...

461
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,150
Then I'll rely on myself.

462
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:53,940
I can help.

463
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,370

Hello?

492
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,710
Jin Ayin.

493
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,710
Li Longda brought me some food today.

494
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,540
It's going to rain soon.

495
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,310
You don't have to come today, okay?

496
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,050
Don't lie to me.

497
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,180
You came.

498
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,080
Come on.

499
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,450
It's still hot.

500
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,150
Eat it now.

501
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,600
How come you're wearing your shoes incorrectly?

502
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,040
I got muddled after I revised the script.

503
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,970
You're so busy.

504
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,580
No, just last night.

505
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,040
You're injured,

506
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,590
and the producer Mr. Hu is going crazy.

507
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,510
He's looking for people to work everywhere.

508
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,300
I have something to do. I have to go.

509
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,890
How about...

510
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,510
My dear daughter.

511
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,170
Sorry.

512
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,610
The number you have dialed is not available.

513
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,120
What are you busy with?

514
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,050
♫The moment I saw you♫

515
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,830
First of all,

516
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,150
let me briefly introduce

517
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,900
the specific plot.

518
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,320
♫I had sensed danger♫

519
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,540
He was born

520
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,980
in a southern village of China in the 1980s.

521
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,870
♫And that's what life is like♫

522
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,920
♫It's so fierce that I can't resist it♫

523
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,250
♫I miss you madly♫

524
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,440
♫Can't you feel it?♫

525
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,780
♫When you feel scared♫

526
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,040
♫Stick out your hands♫

527
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,470
♫Take your violin and go far away♫

528
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,820
♫I hope you can be your truest self♫

529
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,500
♫Just like Kapustin's beautiful concertos♫

530
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,720
Tuotuo.

531
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,770
Tuotuo.

532
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,260
Tuotuo.

533
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,240
Try to recall it for me again.

534
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,630
Did you really not

535
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,380
see any stranger that day?

536
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,590
Ms. Jin.

537
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,450
You're like my boss now, okay?

538
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,660
You are my queen.

539
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,500
I've asked around.

540
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,820
I've asked everyone I should ask.

541
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,500
I've asked about all the information I should get.

542
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,660
I really didn't get the answer you wanted.

543
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,780
No, Tuotuo.

544
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,180
Try to recall it again.

545
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,000
Recall it carefully.

546
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,980
Didn't you see any stranger from the beginning till the end?

547
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,350
I didn't from the beginning till the end.

548
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,290
No stranger at all.

549
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,620
Now I'm really...

550
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,460
I'm being late.

551
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,500
I have to get back to work.

552
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,420
Think of another way.

553
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,140
Tuotuo.

554
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,620
Mr. Hu.

555
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,490
Jin Ayin.

556
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,890
Who do you think you are?

557
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,090
Chi Yu is in hospital.

558
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,600
Are you also

559
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,380
hospitalized?

560
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:17,370
Now...

561
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,150
If I ask someone...

562
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,110
Will he not...

563
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,200
Mr. Hu.

564
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,730
Mr. Hu.

565
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,780
Isn't the signal very strong?

566
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,650
Mr. Hu.

567
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,740
-Mr. Hu, say something again. -Jin Ayin.

568
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,750
Are you slacking off in Chi Yu's room again?

569
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,790
Let me tell you.

570
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,820
-No, no, no. -You can't fool me.

571
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,340
-When I call you in other places, the signal is good. -I just...

572
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,500
How come there's no signal after you got into his room?

573
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,860
Mr. Hu.

574
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,770
Mr. Hu.

575
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,540
Stop sighing.

576
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,450
The sky will fall because of your sighing.

577
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,380
Mr. Hu is always like that.

578
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,840
He's an impatient man.

579
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,510
You went to see Chi Yu secretly,

580
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,000
and you didn't tell me about it.

581
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,420
Do you not regard me as your family?

582
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,780
If I hadn't come to find you,

583
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,270
I would have thought you migrated to another planet.

584
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,980
I didn't want you to worry.

585
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,480
I won't worry if you don't tell me?

586
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,940
You clearly know that this matter is not that simple.

587
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,980
You should keep a distance from Chi Yu.

588
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,780
Did you hear me?

589
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,160
Yes, I did.

590
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,610
Well,

591
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,970
because of Chi Yu,

592
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,380
you don't even care about your dignity.

593
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,640
You even risk your life.

594
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,760
By making such a big fuss in the crew,

595
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,270
have you found any evidence?

596
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,090
I've searched the crew several times,

597
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,000
but I still couldn't find anything.

598
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,350
Let me tell you.

599
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,950
If you keep doing this,

600
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,340
I'm afraid you'll lose your job.

601
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,139
How did the murderer

602
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,010
get into the crew?

603
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,139
Who knows?

604
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,429
He went there in disguise?

605
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,530
Anyway, that's the plot you can see in TV dramas.

606
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,159
Then what?

607
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,320
Then...

608
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,790
He bribed the mole.

609
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,280
You said the police had told you that

610
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,590
Hao was the mole.

611
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,219
How did Hao

612
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,570
know Chi Yu didn't use wires?

613
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,340
Maybe they knew each other before.

614
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,989
Impossible.

615
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:41,980
Why?

616
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,000
Even if Hao knew Chi Yu before,

617
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,480
yet it's the current Chi Yu who doesn't use wires.

618
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,810
It's impossible that Hao knew the current Chi Yu well.

619
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,480
Do you understand?

620
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,810
No, I don't.

621
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,070
Right.

622
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,270
How did the murderer know in advance that

623
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,530
Chi Yu didn't use wires?

Rock sugar clears heat and pears nourish the lungs.

I've raised you for a long time, and it's all in vain.

635
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,260
You didn't even say goodbye.

636

You had no conscience.
