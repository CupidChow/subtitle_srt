Ayin.

It's really good.

After we transfer to Suzhou tomorrow,

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,300
we can do it like this.

Ayin. Ayin.

9
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,770
Did you hear me?

10
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,800
Okay, Director.

11
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,080
Director.

12
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,600
That's all for the previous scene?

13
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,720
We'll shoot the male lead's part when he's ready.

14
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay.

15
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,750
Please.

16
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,620
Hello, Director.

17
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,340
I'm a cool person.

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,760
I can't interfere anymore.

19
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,530
It has nothing to do with me.

20
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,190
Forget it. I’d better take care of it.

21
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,770
Jin Ayin.

22
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,150
Director Feng said a few words to you.

23
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,090
You didn't seem to hear it.

24
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,710
I... I didn't mean

25
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,250
to interfere in your business.

26
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,880
I was just thinking that it...

27
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,250
What's wrong?

28
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,460
You...

29
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,260
Why are you crying?

30
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,210
That's not what I meant.

31
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,100
I just saw Director Feng talking to you.

32
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,920
But you ignored him.

33
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,180
He had already known it.

34
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,650
What?

35
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,670
Do you think

36
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,100
it was me who broke his earphones?

37
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:37,910
Well...

38
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,970
I must have broken his earphones by accident,

39
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,440
right?

40
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,200
Go find him.

41
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,120
Let's go.

42
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,310
What are you doing?

43
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,220
Let's go find him.

44
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,460
-Longda. -Come in.

45
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,050
Chi Yu.

46
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,700
You guys go out first.

47
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,260
Go out first.

48
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,250
What's wrong?

49
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,269
Ayin has something to ask you.

50
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,120
Tell him.

51
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,050
Tell him.

52
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,080
Well,

53
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,050
you left your earphones at home.

54
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,040
I brought them for you.

55
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,290
Sorry.

56
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,420
I seem to have broken them.

57
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:01,940
How about...

58
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,860
How about you...

59
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,940
They broke yesterday.

60
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,480
Well,

61
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,340
what I said...

62
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,430
I heard it.

63
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,740
Then why did you...

64
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,000
That's my answer.

65
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,050
Jin Ayin.

66
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,870
If I did something

67
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,940
that made you misunderstand,

68
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,270
I apologize.

69
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,450
But you know that

70
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,640
I must leave.

71
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,490
So,

72
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,400
from beginning to end,

73
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,730
we're just friends.

74
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,190
Stop it.

75
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,770
Chi Yu.

77
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,890
What's wrong with you?

78
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,290
Li Longda, let me remind you.

79
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,159
It has nothing to do with you.

80
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,440
Why doesn't it have anything to do with me?

81
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,900
Now it has something to do with me.

82
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,580
Let me tell you.

83
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,620
-Li Longda. -You really...

84
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,420
Leave us alone.

85
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,390
-I'm going to teach him a lesson. -Stop fighting.

86
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,010
Leave us alone.

87
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,920
Ayin.

88
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,040
Ayin.

89
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,750
Ayin.

90
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,200
Ayin.

91
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,630
Ayin.

92
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,790
Are you hurt?

93
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,330
Does it hurt?

94
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:20,850
Ayin.

95
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,950
Look at me.

96
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,570
Look at me.

97
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,880
Yesterday...

98
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,930
I was like you yesterday.

99
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,260
I wished that the person I like would have me in her heart.

100
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,820
I wonder if I can have a little space

101
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,659
in her heart.

102
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:47,950
But

103
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,330
when he showed up last night,

104
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,880
she just left.

105
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,580
Do you understand?

106
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,900
I told myself yesterday that

107
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,150
I would take my feelings back.

108
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,480
Your matters will

109
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,030
have nothing to do with me anymore.

110
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,940
Maybe after some time,

111
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,350
I will feel like

112
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,850
nothing ever happened.

113
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,100
But

114
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,080
yesterday,

115
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,340
then today.

116
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,330
I can't make it after just one day.

117
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,750
Longda, I...

118
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,350
Ayin,

119
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,110
it’s okay.

120
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,990
It doesn't matter who you love.

121
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,490
I can wait.

122
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,690
But as long as there is still a glimmer of hope,

123
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,480
I'll always be waiting for you.

124
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:49,950
Longda.

125
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
It does matter.

126
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,530
I only have him in my heart.

127
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,430
Even if he doesn't like me,

128
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,470
he's still the only one in my heart.

129
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,450

My girlfriend.

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,920
Please take a good seat.

175
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,280
Jin Chuan.

176
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,410
Are you going to

177
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,050
forget us

178
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,730
since you have a girlfriend?

179
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,570
Go away.

180
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,140
Chuan, your wife...

181
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,200
No.

182
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,410
Little sister-in-law.

183
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,280
Still not right.

184
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,620
Elder sister-in-law.

185
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,040
Just don't call me auntie.

186
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,140
Then...

187
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,340
Sister.

188
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,520
Miss.

189
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,460
Okay.

190
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,720
Miss.

191
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,100
I see.

192
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,260
Well,

193
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,510
what would you like to drink, Miss?

194
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,430
We'll make it for you.

195
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,440
No, no, no.

196
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,380
Beer will be fine.

197
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,050
Drink this.

198
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,270
They randomly learned to make beer from the Internet.

199
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,210
Don't drink it.

200
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,420
Okay.

201
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,960
Beer is fine.

202
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,930
Let's drink.

203
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,390
OK. Come on.

204
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,660
A toast to Miss, okay?

205
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,760
Come on. To Miss.

206
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,790
Cheers. Cheers. To Miss.

207
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,450
Cheers.

208
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,140
Welcome.

209
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,190
Do you want some quail eggs? Try one.

210
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,230
There's nothing you like to eat?

211
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:19,780
Have some of that.

212
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,630
-It’s good. -The fresh soybean.

213
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,320
Let me cook something for you.

214
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,910
You know how to?

215
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:25,970
Wait for me.

216
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,690
There's no meat.

217
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,140
They ate all the meat.

218
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,620
Here, there's more.

219
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:31,700
Let me do it.

220
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:31,980
Okay.

221
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,700
Take a rest.

222
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,780
Sit here.

223
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,930
You have to ask him.

224
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,620
This is his wine.

225
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,300
What are you doing?

226
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,100
Have some of yours.

227
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,000
Is your skin always this good?

228
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,620
I'm young.

229
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,240
Don't move.

230
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,010
This is the mascot of this shop.

231
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:21,870
This one?

232
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,160
Mascot?

233
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,070
Do you remember the time

234
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,430
when we went to the mountain with Ma and met wolves?

235
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,010
Without this crotch as a crutch,

236
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,610
I would have died there.

237
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,410
So without it,

238
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,950
this place won't exist.

239
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,460
Nonsense!

240
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,580
There are no wolves in Kangding.

241
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,180
You...

242
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,760
You're nothing.

243
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,590
Ask Chuan.

244
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,830
I forgot to ask you.

245
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,890
Did I cause you trouble

246
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,250
in your company last time?

247
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,780
No.

248
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,640
Even money is hard to buy my willingness.

249
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,140
Here.

250
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:04,870
Try it.

251
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,590
Let me ask you.

252
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,300
Have you really seen wolves?

253
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,630
Of course.

254
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,680
How many more things about you

255
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,110
don't I know?

256
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,180
The heart that I love you.

257
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,360
So,

258
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,640
Ma and I

259
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,360
have experienced life and death.

260
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,390
The two of us experienced much

261
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,790
together.

262
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,760
Let me tell you.

263
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,120
Ma

264
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,970
is trapped by you in this lifetime.

265
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,100
Don't rush to say lifetime.

266
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,020
If Ma and I...

267
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,750
I want to eat shrimps.

268
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,160
You...

269
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,850
Wait until the day I'm dying.

270
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,490
I'm going to walk in front of him, trembling

271
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,150
and tell him,

272
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,670
you're the only person that share the same track with me.

273
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,770
Come on.

274
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,020
If you can really experience these with the same person,

275
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,410
that's true love.

276
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,610
So,

277
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,470
as the saying goes,

278
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,630
70% of love is just good.

279
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,330
It's better to love at the perfect amount than more than that.

280
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,290
Jin Chuan, tell me.

281
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,220
Do you love people wholeheartedly or 70% of that?

282
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,060
In my opinion,

283
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,080
see how much she wants.

284
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,820
Boss, a bowl of vinegar.

285
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,670
Sister-in-law,

286
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,330
you have to tell him.

287
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,360
How much do you want?

288
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,710
If I have to choose,

289
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,500
70% is better.

290
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,670
Why?

291
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,590
If two people want to be together for a long time,

292
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,040
70% is just right.

293
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,270
70% of love

294
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,460
lacks restraint, but contains egos.

295
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,010
If you love too much,

296
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,050
it will become

297
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,359
a binding of each other in the end.

298
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,020
That makes sense.

299
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,690
Make sense.

300
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,220
Learn more.

301
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,349
That's an insight.

302
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:19,880
I don’t care.

303
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,859
I love Ma wholeheartedly.

304
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,990
Great.

305
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,770
Bye.

306
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,380
Are you okay?

307
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,520
OK. We'll drink happily next time.

308
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,450
Take care.

309
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,500
I'm leaving. Bye.

310
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,290
Bye. Bye.

311
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,350
Bye.

312
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,560
Take care. I need to talk to him.

313
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,620
Alright.

314
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,940
Have you thought about the thing of Tibet?

315
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,030
When will we set off?

316
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,560
Let me think about it.

317
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,320
Really?

318
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,760
Cut the crap.

319
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,980
I'll tell you when I've made up my mind.

320
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,530
Let me tell you.

321
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,480
I've made it clear to Datou this time.

322
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,950
We all have to go.

323
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,880
No one can quit.

324
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,810
Don't stand us up.

325
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,060
I know.

326
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,200
Bye.

327
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:04,920
Are you okay?

328
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,310
Don't hold my hand.

329
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,140
I can't even peel the shrimps properly.

330
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,870
No.

331
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,180
You are still laughing?

332
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,500
I just want to tell you that

333
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,560
I'm going on a business trip these days.

334
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,290
You won't be able to see me

335
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,750
in the next week.

336
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,400
So for the time being,

337
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,320
you can find whoever can peel shrimps well.

338
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,410
I was wrong.

339
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,410
I won't ask you to peel shrimps anymore, okay?

340
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,080
Okay? Okay?

341
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,260
I'll peel them for you tomorrow.

342
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,050
Hu.

343
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,150
Anyway,

344
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,310
it has a very bad influence that

345
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,940
actors fight in the crew.

346
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,770
Yes.

347
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,850
I'm worried that the filming process would be delayed.

348
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,800
This is not about the progress.

349
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,550
Let's be reasonable.

350
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,920
Since Li Yongda started the fight first,

351
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,150
he should apologize to Chi Yu

352
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,450
in front of everyone.

353
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,750
This is the rule.

354
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,860
OK. OK.

355
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,550
When we arrive in Suzhou,

356
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,470
I'll ask Longda to...

357
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,170
-No need. -Here.

358
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,560
I provoked him first.

359
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,420
I promise it won't happen again.

360
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,200
Okay.

361
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,140
[Don't worry. Two men of us are there now.]

362
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:40,990
Yu.

363
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,430
I've told them.

364
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,400
Just let them know if you need anything.

365
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,490
Where's the watch?

366
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,740
Nice to meet you.

367
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,240
Just call me Ze.

368
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,780
Congratulations.

369
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,050
You're already the lead.

370
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,330
You'll get the Golden Movie Award sooner or later.

371
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,750
I accidentally found the photos Taotao posted before.

372
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,010
Ze was in it,

373
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,880
and Chi Yu.

374
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,610
If there is a chance,

375
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,130
take me to the crew and play.

376
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,950
He was lying.

377
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,230
The one below?

378
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,550
Let me do it.

379
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,620
Let's hurry up.

380
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,390
Hurry up.

381
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,040
It's late today.

382
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,980
Arrange everyone first...

383
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,980
The weather is nice here.

384
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,020
It's not hot or cold.

385
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,230
[Welcome the Crew of The Legend of Xiang Qinyu]

386
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,220
[Yu, he's out. Today is the same time.]

387
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,030
You...

388
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,540
I saw you not go to dinner.

389
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,690
So I packed it for you.

390
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:12,870
Don't just stand there.

391
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,800
Come and eat.

392
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,590
If you're in a bad mood, you really should eat.

393
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:24,960
Longda.

394
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,550
Ayin.

395
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,670
-You don't have to. -You are not…

396
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,920
You talk first.

397
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:46,720
Ayin.

398
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,160
I've made up my mind.

399
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,670
I won't regret it.

400
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,450
But I...

401
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,270
I know what you want to say.

402
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,790
You've made it very clear.

403
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,630
I also know

404
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,100
you would still reject me.

405
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,770
But I just want to do what I want to do.

406
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,510
It has nothing to do with you.

407
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,520
Longda.

408
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,690
-Actually, you don’t have to... -I like you.

409
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,140
Ayin.

410
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,780
I'm serious.

411
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,350
Rest early.

412
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,430
We have work tomorrow.

413
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,410
[The order has been submitted successfully.]

414
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,870
Hello?

415
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,240
I'm from No. 26, 12th Lane, Yangji Road.

416
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,490
Here's the thing.

417
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,310
I asked for a maintenance service today.

418
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,350
I want to cancel it.

419
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,150
No need for today.

420
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:23,580
Yes.

421
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,400
Okay, thank you.

422
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,500
Honey.

423
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,700
Someone is knocking at the door. Go check who it is.

424
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,790
I'm cooking.

425
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,280
Coming.

426
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,840
Hurry up.

427
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,870
Coming.

428
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,380
Who is it?

429
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,930
A guy who fixes the broadband.

430
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,040
Come in, young man.

431
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:25,970
No need to change your shoes.

432
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,830
Where is the receipt for the broadband repair?

433
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,270
Remember.

434
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,470
All the receipts are kept in this drawer.

435
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,910
This is the broadband receipt.

436
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,330
Auntie, I noticed that

437
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,130
you got these talismans for your son.

438
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,780
When my mother was alive,

439
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:53,950
she also got some for me.

440
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,850
Really.

441
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,260
Parents care about their children.

442
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,140
Yes.

443
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,280
Well...

444
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,470
The router is over there.

445

I need to cook.

The Legend of Xiang Qinyu

applies for additional location fee.

450
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,150
And it was cut half by Mr. Wu.

451
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,110
About the budget cut,

452
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,400
I will deal with it after I'm back from Suzhou.

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,700
If Mr. Wu has any moves

that interfere with our project,

call me immediately.

Stop.

Why are you here?

458
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,090
It hurts every time I see you.

459
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,130
Didn't I tell you?

460
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm going on a business trip

461
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,390
and will be back in a week.

462
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:50,940
Go on with your work.

463
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,430
I won't disturb you.

464
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,390
What about your job?

465
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,060
My job

466
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,780
is to take photos of stray cats like you.

467
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,460
Delete the photo.

468
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,270
It suddenly occurred to me

469
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,820
the theme of my next exhibition.

470
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,780
It can be called

471
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,470
Those Never Say Uncle Moments.

472
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,870
You know what?

473
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,570
You're like

474
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,340
an unemployed mistress,

475
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,800
not even letting your husband go on a business trip.

476
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,670
Aboard.

477

Honey.

You are here, Mumu.

479
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:08,880
Hu.

480
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,670
How is it?

481
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,210
Was it easy

482
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,120
to drive all the way here?

483
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,140
It's okay.

484
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,370
It's raining. Can we go up the mountain?

485
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:15,800
Don't worry.

486
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,940
We've asked the overall planning

487
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,850
to check the weather forecast.

488
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,510
And some teams have already gone up.

489
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,230
Why are you here?

490
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,390
Why are you also here?

491
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,060
Brother-in-law.

492
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,240
Why is there a bug on your face?

493
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:33,710
Do you

494
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,660
know each other?

495
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,150
We...

496
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:43,950
We are

497
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:44,690
colleagues.

498
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,560
Colleague?

499
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,480
We are

500
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,360
ex-colleagues.

501
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,290
I wrote an article for Bao.

502
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,630
Yes, Bao.

503
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:56,800
Bao?

504
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,960
Yes, my nickname is Bao.

505
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,320
I wanted to ask just now.

506
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,430
Who is this tanned guy?

507
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,920
He's the photographer I hired.

508
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,470
He'll take some photos of us working for publicity.

509
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,040
Great.

510
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,150
Hello, Producer Hu.

511
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:14,910
Hello. Hello.

512
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,090
Hurry up and get ready.

513
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,470
We'll leave right after the rain stops.

514
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,460
Don't delay the progress.

515
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,700
Hurry up.

516
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,600
Hurry up.

517
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,220
The rain has stopped.

518
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,580
Hurry up if the rain stops.

519
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,570
Be careful.

520
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,700
Go.

521
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,650
OK.

522
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,570
Let's go into the hotel.

523
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,260
The room is ready.

524
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,720
Let's go. I'll take you there.

525
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,410
Everything is ready. Don't worry.

526
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,400
Bastard.

527
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,440
Why are you always following me?

528
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,650
Don't say you don't know I'm in this crew.

529
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,370
I really didn't know at first.

530
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,610
Or let's be honest.

531
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,530
It's no big deal.

532
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,550
Do you want to die?

533
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,990
We just said we were colleagues and now we are siblings?

534
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,060
Can I still live?

535
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,080
Who are you chatting with?

536
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:26,820
Who?

537
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:32,730
Her.

538
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,750
I think she's not your ex-colleague,

539
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,810
but your ex-girlfriend.

540
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,380
She even knows your nickname.

541
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,630
Don't worry.

542
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,600
We can only be brothers.

543
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,390
Nothing could happen between us.

544
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,030
Who knows?

545
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,690
Young people like you

546
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,070
are more likely to have messy relationships.

547
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,000
Are you jealous?

548
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,540
Stop it.

549
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,770
Are you jealous?

550
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,030
This is my workplace.

551
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,820
Don't make trouble for me.

552
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,780
You haven't started working yet.

553
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,280
Isn't it natural to be in a relationship?

554
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,100
I always ask others to separate personal and working occasions.

555
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,850
But now I brought you to the site.

556
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,080
It's already not appropriate.

557
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:15,680
How about this?

558
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,390
You go take some photos.

559
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,640
I'm going to the bathroom.

560
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,040
Is Chen Mumu who you talked about?

561
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,170
Really?

562
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,280
I knew it.

563
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,930
I thought I met him somewhere before.

564
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,300
He came to the crew to look for someone

565
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,290
and he even rode a motorcycle.

566
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,320
It is said that on the premiere of Jianghe's movie,

567
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,070
he and Mumu hugged and kissed

568
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,380
in front of everyone.

569
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,760
No way.

570
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,010
How old is she?

571
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,460
She's already that old, yet she's still acting like this.

572
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,840
My friends of Jianghe hate her very much.

573
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,420
She thinks she’s an independent woman,

574
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,850
but she's doing such private things with the advantage of work.

575
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,140
I heard

576
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,140
she only booked one room for herself.

577
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,330
Is she trying to get a promotion by this?

578
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,140
Or that screenwriter...

579
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,050
You like gossiping in the crew so much.

580
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,120
Why don't I help you change your career to be entertainment reporters?

581
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,520
Stop.

582
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,090
I'm not finished yet.

583
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,000
Who told you to leave?

584
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,290
I remember

585
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,420
you two helped me with the accessories before, right?

586
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,380
Earrings and belts

587
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,610
were not suitable to the scenes.

588
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,830
And it's the second time.

589
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,740
I'm sorry, Teng Xi.

590
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,500
I'm sorry.

591
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,430
From now on,

592
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,980
I won't make mistakes again.

593
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,180
You'd better not.

594
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,400
Or I'd better ask Producer Hu

595
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,020
to change your whole team.

596
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,270
We will go check again now.

597
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,380
Also,

598
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,260
if I hear you spread rumors again,

599
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,260
I promise

600
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,040
it will be more serious than you think.

601
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,650
Thank you

602
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,940
for defending me.

603
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,250
No need.

604
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,480
I'm not doing this for you.

605
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:20,699
Then you are...

606
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,429
I just don't want to embarrass Jin Chuan.

607
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,130
He is my friend.

608
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,800
How about

609
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,600
you tell me

610
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,550
your relationship with him?

611
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,870
You are also gossipy?

612
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,120
I only care about him.

613
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,730
We are...

614
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,409
just like what they said.

615
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,770
I'm warning you.

616
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,690
If you're not serious,

617
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,320
don't provoke him.

618
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,520
How about

619
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,180
you tell me

620
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:13,780
your relationship

621
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,220
with him?

622
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,310
I can tell

623
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,470
he really likes you.

624
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,400
But if you're just entertaining with him,

625
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,470
I advise you not to do this.

626
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,730
Because he's different from you.

627
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,310
You are not suitable for each other.

628
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,780
It seems that you know him well.

629
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,010
No one should stop him.

630
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:30,890
Young man.

631
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,800
Here.

632
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,030
Even if you're a professional backpacker,

633
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,360
according to the rules,

634
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,090
you should at least bring one person with you.

635
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,070
The ignition plug was drowned by petrol.

636
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,340
I can't change it without backups.

637
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,620
Datou. Datou.

638
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,280
Something happened here.

639
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,360
After you send him there,

640
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,330
drive the car to B4 transfer station to pick me up.

641
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:22,580
Where's your bag?

642
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,390
It's in the back seat.

643
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,120
Someone will pick us up at the transfer station.

644
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,340
We're walking on foot now.

645
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,840
What about my car?

646
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:34,800
Thanks to you,

647
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,190
it has to wait here until tomorrow.

648
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,080
I'm really sorry that

649
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,420
I have to trouble you.

650
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,260
You drove so fast before leaving.

651
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,590
I thought you were a veteran.

652
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,470
You don't know me?

653
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,830
Datou asked me to come this time.

654
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,510
I seldom join such a big group.

655
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,320
Why are you laughing?

656
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,610
Nothing.

657
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,740
It's my first time joining an adventure team like this.

658
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,410
I usually like to go out to play.

659
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,510
But

660
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,010
I don't have much experience.

661
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,230
You found the bioluminescent bay nearby?

662
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,460
I saw it on Weizhou Island last time.

663
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,740
You must have been to many places.

664
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,480
This is my dream.

665
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,500
I want to travel to more places

666
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,350
and take all the new things in the world

667
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,600
in my pocket.

668
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,100
When I get old,

669
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,020
I can share it with the person I love.

670
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,540
Let's go.

671
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,700
Jin Chuan.

672
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,660
Do you have a girlfriend?

673
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,410
He and you,

674
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,020
or us,

675
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,750
are different.

676
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,000
If I were you,

677
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,840
I wouldn't have made a fool of him in front of everyone.

00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,010
I cannot finish revising it. I'm doomed.

682
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,800
Leave me alone.
