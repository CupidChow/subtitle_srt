That's it.

5
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,420
A man wearing a hat.

00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,250
That's all?

7
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,320
He said he didn't see his face clearly.

8
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,220
Since the murderer is not Li Longda,

9
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,000
what are you going to do next?

10
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,820
Who do you think

11
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,720
Chi Yu has offended?

12
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,720
Why does he want to kill him?

13
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,440
Don't look at me like that.

14
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,740
I've practiced Kung Fu before.

15
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,320
No one can hurt me.

16
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,500
You're bragging.

17
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,920
Just think about how you came here.

18
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,270
Go to bed.

19
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,370
Are you going to revise the script tomorrow?

20
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,300
Just go.

21
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,780
How can you get rid of me as soon as I've done my job?

22
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,460
-You have no conscience. -I...

23
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,740
Why did you hurt yourself

24
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,520
while trying to scare someone?

25
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,270
Well,

26
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,290
I lost balance and fell down.

27
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm fine.

28
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:37,900
I...

29
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,300
I can do it myself.

31
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,530

♫And to hug you again♫

37
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,520
Wangcai, who told you to play music?

I forgot to tell you something.

50

I found a photo

51
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,420
at Chi Yu's home yesterday.

52
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,380
The girl on the photo and I used to...

53
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:55,740

Taotao.

58
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,930
Are you her family?

59
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,100
No.

60
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,260
Her friend.

61
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,700
Have you registered at the reception?

62
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,540
The patient's family doesn't allow outsiders to visit her.

63
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,780
What's wrong with her?

64
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,060
Gas poisoning.

65
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,040
She's in a vegetative state now.

66
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,409
She's been lying in bed for over a year.

Can she wake up?

68

I'm not sure.

69
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,820
It depends on God.

Chi Yu.

71
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,700
Do you have coffee?

72
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,980
You don't drink coffee, do you?

73
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,280
I forgot.

74
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:33,820
What?

75
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,940
Do you remember anything?

76
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,850
What's the relationship

77
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,720
between you and this Taotao?

78
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:40,980
I don't remember.

79
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,530
Mr. Xiang.

80
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,430
Come on. A toast to you.

81
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,580
Qinyu has been feeling unwell recently.

82
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,430
The second concubine of Mr. Zhang from the Meng's Group.

83
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,130
I have to go.

84
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:18,580
No.

85
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,910
Since you are here,

86
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,050
just stay for Mr. Lin's sake.

87
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:22,980
Okay?

88
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,840
As no one was wiling to pay,

89
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,160
you sold Mengsheng to Mr. Lin reluctantly.

90
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,680
If we want to film the Legend of Huangpu well,

91
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,390
we still need to depend on Mr. Lin.

92
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,820
I'm here just to show up for a while.

93
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,090
I won't drink with him.

94
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,260
Tell him I have to leave.

95
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,250
Just say that I'm not feeling well.

96
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,910
Alright.

97
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,760
Yu.

98
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,260
Do you remember me?

99
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,840
My name is Yang Xiaoyun.

100
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,520
I finally signed a contract with Mengsheng today.

101
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,520
Congratulations.

102
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,670
Yu!

103
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,440
I'm really your super fan.

104
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,730
Mr. Lin said once I sign the contract,

105
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,540
I can act in movies with you

106
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,110
in Mengsheng in the future.

107
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,440
Alright.

108
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,460
Give it to me.

109
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,380
Aren't you here to ask for my autograph?

110
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,610
Can I really get it?

111
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,820
Thank you, Yu.

112
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:30,970
Thank you, Yu.

114
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,390
Yu!

115
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,490
It's me.

116
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,700
Leave her alone.

117
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,380
Drive inside.

118
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:54,970
Yu!

119
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,140
Let go of me!

120
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,930
Let go of me!

121
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,450
Yu!

122
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,120
Let me in!

123
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,050
Yu!

124
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,080
Stop looking.

125
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,540
Yu!

126
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,500
Don't get involved with this kind of person.

127
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,540
What kind of person?

128
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,130
I thought you had recognized her.

129
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,500
It's me.

130
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,700
She's the new actress whom Mr. Lin has just signed a contract with.

131
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,220
Yu!

132
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,890
She specializes in movies of...

133
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,820
She specializes in that kind of movies.

134
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,210
She's not a decent woman.

135
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,550
She approaches you

136
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,580
in order to create some gossip with you.

137
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,100
You have to stay away from them.

138
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,630
Lin did this to Mengsheng.

139
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,990
He is in charge of Mengsheng now.

140
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,060
Even if he should tear down Mengsheng,

141
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,550
it would have nothing to do with us.

142
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,630
Forget it.

143
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,690
As long as Mr. Lin

144
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,900
can help us film

145
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,140
the Legend of Huangpu as he promised,

146
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:46,780
let's not

147
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,660
interfere in other things.

148
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,220
Yu!

149
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,130
Yu, it's me.

150
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,380
Yu!

151
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,110
Why is it her again?

152
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,750
Yu!

153
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,390
-Go ask her. -Yu, it's me.

154
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,280
What does she want?

155
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,860
The staff on the filming site said

156
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,620
this girl is not in her right mind.

157
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,460
Don't worry.

158
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,650
I'll take care of it.

159
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,250
Just one minute. Please.

160
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,130
Let's go. Stop looking.

161
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,630
Yu, it's me.

162
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,340
Yu!

163
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,890
Yu!

164
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,020
She took off her clothes.

165
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,400
Look at her arms.

166
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,820
Don't push me.

167
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,570
Let me see.

168
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:51,920
What are you doing?

169
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,370
Yu.

170
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,190
Get back to work.

171
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,270
Okay.

172
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,870
You're an actress,

173
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,300
You're acting in a movie.

174
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,330
Don't be shy.

175
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,520
You have to make some sacrifices.

176
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,830
Then why did you come to see her?

177
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,710
Because I always feel

178
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,370
she has something to do with me.

179
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:27,960
Alright.

180
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,050
Don't be anxious.

181
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,630
I'll go to the nurse station

182
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,540
to ask about her condition.

183
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,000
Let me help you.

184
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,140
Chi Yu.

185
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,420
Chi Yu!

186
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,740
That man seems to be the one who attacked you by the lake.

187
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,410
Yu!

188
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,840
Buddy.

189
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,720
How are you?

190
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,490
Are you okay?

191
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,950
Come on. Get up.

192
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,790
Slowly, slowly.

193
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,860
Slowly, slowly.

194
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,780
Are you okay?

195
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,900
How did you drive when delivering food?

196
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,820
Couldn't you be more careful? You hit someone.

197
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,540
Sorry. Sorry.

198
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,480
Shall I take you to the hospital for a check?

199
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,700
Yu.

200
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,930
Chi Yu.

201
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,540
Since God has sent you here,

202
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,390
he must have his reasons.

203
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,390
Maybe

204
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,140
in addition to fulfilling your dream,

205
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,950
you can also find

206
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,880
who the murderer is.

207
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,490
How are you? Are you okay?

208
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,260
Chi Yu.

209
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,010
Just go away. Go away.

210
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,480
Chi Yu.

211
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:26,740
Chi Yu.

212
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,420
Do me a favor.

213
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,980
Gao Bai.

214
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,099
Yu.

215
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,500
Now in Shanghai, they would really kill people.

216
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,150
Last time, Mr. Zhang sent someone to tell us

217
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,859
not to shoot movies that speak ill of the Japanese.

218
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,180
I, Xiang Qinyu, am not afraid of these.

219
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,180
Don't worry.

220
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,300
I'll be responsible for this film by myself.

221
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,140
I'll bear the consequences of it.

222
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,470
I will never implicate

223
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,610
or let others implicate you.

224
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,580
When did I tell you these things?

225
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,500
You really

226
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,900
know me well.

227
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,550
I'll bear the consequences of it.

228
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,780
I'll bear the consequences of it.

229
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,220
Since it's my own trouble,

230
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,460
I can't...

231
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,530
Hu,

232
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,820
how did you persuade Old Mr. Di to act in a move again?

233
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,480
I heard that

234
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,910
he had won a lifetime achievement award,

235
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,940
and then he retired without accepting any acting role, right?

236
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,400
Actually,

237
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,800
I don't know, either.

238
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,830
When I went there that day,

239
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,860
I told him about it,

240
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,340
and he said,

241
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,890
"No,

242
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,590
I won't act again."

243
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,980
But when I told him

244
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
we were going to film the Legend of Xiang Qinyu,

245
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,600
he agreed

246
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,820
immediately.

247
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,890
Do you think that's awesome?

248
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,810
Finally,

249
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,800
we've gathered all the actors.

250
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,040
It's just the leading actor.

251
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:01,860
Hu,

252
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,880
are you sure

253
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,930
Chi Yu won't come?

254
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,340
Director Feng.

255
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,630
I'm quite sure

256
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,490
he won't be able to come.

257
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,130
The press conference is about to be held.

258
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,470
Stop thinking about Chi Yu.

259
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,470
Longda.

260
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,800
You're not waiting for me in the meeting room.

261
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,840
Why did you come here?

262
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,900
Chi Yu.

263
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:31,540
Chi...

264
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,310
Chi Yu.

265
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:35,700
You...

266
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,640
Does what you said

267
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,220
still count?

268
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,260
Hello, Miss Mumu.

269
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,980
Miss Mumu.

270
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,560
Wait.

271
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,490
Send me the follow-up schedule of the last film right away.

272
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:07,910
Okay.

273
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,020
I want to see the makeup and hair design

274
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,610
for Xiang Qinyu again.

275
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,110
Okay.

276
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,580
Where's Mr. Wu?

277
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,340
I don't know.

278
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,140
While you were away from the company these few days, he barely came here.

279
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:19,660
Miss Mumu,

280
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,380
these several files on the top

281
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,690
are the projects of the previous meeting.

282
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,390
Please take a look.

283
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,540
Below them are the contracts for the actors.

284
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,300
Please have a look.

285
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,380
Put them on my desk first.

286
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,260
I'll read them after the press conference.

287
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,660
Okay.

288
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,140
Besides,

289
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,460
ask the special effects company we cooperate with

290
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,380
to have a phone conference immediately.

291
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,760
Okay.

292
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,680
Where's Hu?

293
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,870
Mr. Hu and Director Feng are in his office.

294
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:36,910
Help me put my bag away.

295
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,410
Okay.

296
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,960
Thank you.

297
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,780
Hu.

298
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:42,780
Director.

299
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,660
I know I'm not good at acting.

300
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,490
Since Chi Yu is back,

301
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,790
the male lead was his anyway.

302
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:50,780
Can you still

303
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,570
let him play the role?

304
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,420
This...

305
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,100
Chi Yu.

306
00:21:59,500 --> 00:21:59,900
You...

307
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,900
Can you really play the role?

308
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,950
So the press conference is about to be held,

309
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,250
and you want to change the leading actor now?

310
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,700
Mumu,

311
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,180
let me explain.

312
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:10,940
Don't worry.

313
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,960
I'll play the role of Xiang Qinyu well.

314
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,010
The press conference was about to be held,

315
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,540
but they delayed it without telling us the specific reason.

316
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,430
What is the reason?

317
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,340
Who knows what Li Longda is up to again?

318
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,360
You've walked back and forth for several times,

319
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,620
but no one has helped you.

320
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,500
Why didn't you come and help?

321
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,720
It's easier to say it than do it.

322
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,660
The press conference is delayed.

323
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,270
Everyone has gone to help.

324
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,760
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been so tired.

325
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,300
Why does everyone

326
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,210
look idle while waiting for it?

327
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:09,890
Mr. Di.

328
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,500
You came. Please come in.

329
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,620
Mr. Di, thanks for coming.

330
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,890
Come on. Have a seat, Mr. Di.

331
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,340
Have a seat.

332
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:14,820
I'll sit.

333
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,620
Sit here, please.

334
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,460
Everyone,

335
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,010
this is the latest script Director Feng has confirmed.

336
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,100
If you have any questions,

337
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,730
we can communicate with the screenwriter anytime.

338
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,350
Yes.

339
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,820
You can ask me directly if you have any questions.

340
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:30,930
Director Feng.

341
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,660
Everyone.

342
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:32,500
Mr. Di.

343
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,610
Let me introduce her.

344
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,970
This is our chief producer,

345
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,600
Chen Mumu.

346
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,310
Hello, Mr. Di.

347
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,230
Thanks for coming.

348
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,220
Have a seat.

349
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:39,760
Okay.

350
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,630
Everyone, sit down.

351
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,900
Sorry, guys.

352
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,820
Due to my business trip,

353
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,260
I've failed to meet each member of the creative team.

354
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,850
I heard from Mr. Hu

355
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,980
the previous shooting

356
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,310
went very well.

357
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,140
Thank you for your cooperation.

358
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,830
I have another

359
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,880
important news

360
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,110
to announce here.

361
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,420
As you all know,

362
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,500
the selling point of this project is the male lead

363
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,300
Xiang Qinyu.

364
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,980
In order to make this movie

365
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,500
presented in a better way,

366
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,780
after we producers discussed it,

367
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,490
we've decided to make a change

368
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,330
on the actors.

369
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,940
I also want to inform you of the news here.

370
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,720
Coming.

371
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,910
Mumu.

372
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,530
This is Chi Yu.

373
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,180
From now on,

374
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,290
he will play the role of Xiang Qinyu.

375
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,490
Li Longda will continue to play

376
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,260
another important role in the movie,

377
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,940
that is, the supporting actor, the senior fellow apprentice.

378
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,040
Chi Yu.

379
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,340
Chi Yu.

380
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,220
Who are you?

381
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,030
I'm Chi Yu.

382
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,050
Your name is Chi Yu?

383
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,680
You look so similar to him.

384
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,030
So similar.

385
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,000
No.

386
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,860
You're not Chi Yu.

387
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,820
You are Qinyu.

388
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,250
Qinyu.

389
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,650
I'm Husheng.

390
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,900
Do you remember?

391
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,960
When I was 12,

392
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,570
I went out alone to work as a martial arts actor.

393
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,220
You let me stay in Mengsheng,

394
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,120
to work with my senior fellow apprentices.

395
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,650
If it weren't for you,

396
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,100
I wouldn't have got the achievements today.

397
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,820
Unfortunately,

398
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,340
you had an accident later.

399
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,300
Mr. Lin stopped filming the Legend of Huangpu.

400
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,870
All our fellow apprentices knew

401
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,210
you had put a lot of effort into it.

402
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,060
Back then, with my low positon,

403
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,440
my words were of little effect.

404
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,360
I couldn't find anyone to speak for you.

405
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,200
So,

406
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,300
I had no choice but to steal the photographic film,

407
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,560
and put it at your door.

408
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,990
That was all that I could do.

409
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,920
I don't know

410
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,830
what happened after that.

411
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,980
All these years,

412
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,570
I've been working on my own.

413
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,920
Every time I encounter an obstacle,

414
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,990
I always think of Qinyu.

415
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,160
I didn't expect to see you again

416
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,360
in the rest of my life.

417
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:56,780
Right.

418
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,950
At first, I didn't believe

419
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,020
there would be such a strange thing in the world.

420
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,660
But don't tell anyone

421
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,580
about my secret.

422
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,690
Don't worry, Qinyu.

423
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,580
You treated me so kindly.

424
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,250
I heard them say that

425
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,030
they were going to film your story.

426
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,490
That's why I'm here to make a guest appearance.

427
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,060
By the way,

428
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,430
there's one more thing

429
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,480
I want to ask you about.

430
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,400
Say it.

431
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,980
Who shot me

432
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,020
on the filming site?

433
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,490
Do you know?

434
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,370
It was a strange accident.

435
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,030
We haven't caught the murderer.

436
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,120
Later,

437
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,630
I went to the hospital.

438
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,310
I wanted to visit you.

439
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,610
I tried a few times but they all stopped me from doing it.

440
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,120
I kept inquiring about your news all those years.

441
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,290
I wanted to know

442
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,270
whether you were alive or not,

443
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,500
or whether you'd gone somewhere.

444
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,760
There should be result.

445
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,580
There were too many rumors back then.

446
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,470
I couldn't tell if they were true.

447
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,210
Are you...

448
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,080
Are you okay?

449
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,640
I'm fine.

450
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,290
My eyes were blurred just now.

451
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,420
I'm old and useless.

452
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,300
Don't say that. Don't say that.

453
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:29,920
Don't say that.

454
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,900
Let me tell you.

455
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,460
Chi Yu

456
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,490
is a perfect actor to

457
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,060
play the role of Xiang Qinyu.

458
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,530
I even thought he was Xiang Qinyu himself.

459
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,440
I mistook him for Qinyu.

460
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,760
-Let me tell you. -Thank you, Mr. Di.

461
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,510
Chi Yu not only looks like him,

462
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,290
he's also good at martial arts.

463
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,800
I believe through the Legend of Xiang Qinyu this time,

464
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,360
everyone will know him.

465
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,270
I hope so.

466
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,610
Please wait a moment.

467
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,720
I'll arrange a car to send you back.

468
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,030
Okay.

469
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:55,770
Qinyu.

470
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,690
I have to

471
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,090
go first.

472
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,600
Take care.

473
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:24,820
Chi Yu.

474
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,100
This is great.

475
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,140
You are the leading actor

476
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,980
while I'm the leading actress.

477
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,570
We, the best couple,

478
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,830
can work together again.

479
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:39,660
Well...

480
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:42,930
I'm sorry.

481
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,120
Long, pat your head.

482
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,290
Don't be sad.

483
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,120
Come with me.

484
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,580
What happened?

485
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,500
Where did you go this morning?

486
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,800
Why did you suddenly admit that you were Chi Yu,

487
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,050
and become the leading actor?

488
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,050
Besides,

489
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,020
what's wrong with Mr. Di?

490
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,290
Di Husheng is a martial arts actor who was once trained by me.

491
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,130
He recognized me.

492
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,810
But he promised me

493
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,930
he wouldn't reveal my secret.

494
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,620
Are you saying that

495
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,400
Mr. Di used to be your subordinate?

496
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,320
I didn't expect

497
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,500
you had been so amazing.

498
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:22,930
However,

499
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,980
why do you want to be the leading actor?

500
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,380
And why did Li Longda

501
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,620
give you the role of the male lead?

502
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,630
I have my own plan on this.

503
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,430
Don't ask.

504
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,670
What do you mean?

505
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,360
I thought about it.

506
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,550
I don't even know whether I'll live or die.

507
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,350
What's the point of going back?

508
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,340
So today I decided

509
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,060
I would not go back.

510
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,770
I'll stay in this era.

511
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,540
As for how I became the leading actor,

512
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,650
I borrowed 100,000 yuan from this card

513
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,140
and used it to build connections.

514
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,850
Xiang Qinyu, are you crazy?

515
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,940
Do you know how long

516
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,310
I've tried to save the money,

517
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,110
and how important it is to me?

518
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,580
You just spent it like that.

519
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,930
Just a little money.

520
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,230
Don't make a fuss.

521
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,300
Besides, after I become the leading actor,

522
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,790
I'll pay you back with my remuneration.

523
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,530
How do you know my password?

524
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,170
When you used another card,

525
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,420
I memorized the numbers.

526
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,210
You thief.

527
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,640
Not only did you steal Chi Yu's identity,

528
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,750
but also my money.

529
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,980
I was even thinking

530
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,490
about how to help you.

531
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,700
How ungrateful you are.

532
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,770
I won't need you anymore.

533
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,310
You also know you are not

534
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,510
that smart.

535
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,270
What are you talking about?

536
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,730
I just feel that working with you

537
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,010
isn't very effective.

538
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,780
Rather than helping me to investigate it,

539
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,460
it's more like messing around.

540
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,880
Since everyone thinks I'm Chi Yu,

541
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,080
I'll stay here,

542
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,010
and finish the shooting of the Legend of Xiang Qinyu.

543
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,090
It helps to fulfill my wish, too.

544
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,460
This has nothing to do with you anymore.

545
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,300
Just leave.

546
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,850
Do you mean that

547
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,260
these days,

548
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,080
I've been meddling in your business?

549
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,960
I think

550
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,570
you must have misunderstood something.

551
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,270
We met each other by chance,

552
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,980
and we're just friends.

553
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,140
I told jokes with you.

554
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,860
I admit

555
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,580
I've been using you.

556
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,000
But I feel awkward to keep pretending it.

557
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,480
Xiang Qinyu is going to be famous here.

558
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:57,900
And I

559
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,050
will use Chi Yu's identity

560
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,160
to go back to my old life.

561
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,020
If I interact with you too much,

562
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,490
it will only affect my reputation.

563
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,470
So,

564
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,130
do you understand?

565
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,880
Do you know what you're talking about?

566
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,060
If you do this,

567
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,450
you're lying to Chi Yu's parents

568
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,260
and Li Longda.

569
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,090
This is unfair to them.

570
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,160
Fair?

571
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,760
The movie needs a suitable leading actor.

572
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,460
Chi Yu's parents

573
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,210
also need a son who's still alive.

574
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,470
It's good for both of them.

575
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,050
Xiang Qinyu.

576
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,570
You bastard!

577
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,730
Then stay away from this bastard.

578
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,210
When you're in the crew in the future,

579
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,610
don't pretend that you're well acquainted with me.

580
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:04,940

581
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,600
Hello, Yu.

582
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,620
-Hello, Yu. -Hello, Yu.

583
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:11,480
Let me tell you.

584
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,570
I really saw it.

585
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,120
Di Husheng bowed to him.

586
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,949
He's really taken as Xiang Qinyu.

587
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,139
Chi Yu

588
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,770
will be great in the future.

589
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,750

Don't forget to revise it as soon as possible.

593
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:29,659
Okay.

594

Please pay special attention

601
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,139
to the actor who plays

602
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,340
the male lead of Xiang Qinyu.

603
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,110
His name is Chi Yu.

604
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,580
Chi Yu is not only

605
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,449
good at martial arts,

606
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,620
but also better than me

607
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,060
in saying lines in the movie.

608
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,380
Please

609
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,590
pay more attention to him.

610
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,540
I'll say no more.

611
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,030
Okay.

612
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,760
OK. Thanks, Mr. Di. Thank you.

613
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,680

Say something to us.

617
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:13,580
Hello, everyone.

618
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,260

Chi Yu.

As I got injured and fell into the water previously,

621
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,560
many things were delayed.

622
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,930
The crew's plan had to change, too.

623
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:28,770
I'm sorry.

624
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,140
But now I'm fully recovered.

this movie

628

will bring you a lot of surprises.

More importantly,

630
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,670
I want to say something to the person who's waiting for me.

You'll look forward to seeing me again.
