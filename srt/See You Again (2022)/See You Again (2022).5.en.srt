Fellow apprentice.

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,250
I'm willing to wait.

6
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,830
After you take revenge,

7
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,460
there won't be any barrier

8
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,310
between us.

9
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,990
But between us,

10
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,539
there's not only the barrier of identity.

11
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,400
Fellow apprentice.

12
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,350
Don't go.

I...

19

I...

20
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:36,930
suddenly feel

21
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,420
you're right.

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,400
It's no need

23
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,140
to have a kiss scene here.

24
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,730
It's better to be conservative.

25
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,180
Isn't it?

26
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,470
Just write as I said.

27
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,990
Practice before you know what is right.

28
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,110
Yes.

29
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,110
Very good.

30
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,380
My waist hurts.

31
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,130
The sofa...

32
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,940
is too hard.

33
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,310
Go to bed early after finishing.

34
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,410
And the bed in your bedroom is too soft.

35
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,870
It makes my waist hurt.

36
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,900
Your attic looks nice.

37
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,100
From now on,

38
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,290
I'll live upstairs.

39
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,180
But

40
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,079
there's nothing in the attic.

41
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,940
How can you live here?

42
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,630
I've used your books

43
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,350
to make a simple bed.

44
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,390
From now on, I'll travel around the book sea every night.

45
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,670
That's not bad.

46
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,030
Don't stay up late today.

47
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,760
Rest early.

48
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,060
Good night, Yu.

Jin Ayin.

50
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,100
You should believe in yourself.

51
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,780
Write what you want to write.

54
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,580
Turn on the TV.

55
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,650
Okay.

56
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,520
Good job.

Hit him!

58
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,480
Be brave

59
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,780
and fight for what belongs to you.

60
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,780
Of course. Who am I?

61
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,420
Sure.

62
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,060
Okay, I'll contact you in a few days.

63
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,820
That's all.

64
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,670
Well...

65
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,120
Excuse me.

Why are you here?

It's you.

69
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,140
Give me back my money!

70
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,990
You little girl.

71
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,030
You little girl.

72
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,350
See how I will treat you today.

73
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,210
Don't pull my hair.

74
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,180
How dare you pull me!

75
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,030
Let go of me.

76
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:56,560
Let go.

77
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,640
What are you doing?

78
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,090
I told you to wait downstairs.

79
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,030
Why are you here?

80
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,420
I'm afraid you're timid,

81
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,750
so I came up to give you some courage.

82
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,570
Who are you?

83
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,930
Chi Yu?

84
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:30,860
Longda.

85
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,400
I'm glad you're here.

86
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,020
Look.

87
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,860
She is the infamous sreenwriter fired by you.

88
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,970
She even brought a hooligan to help.

89
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,390
He touched me as soon as he showed up.

90
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,090
Look.

91
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,550
They broke my nails.

92
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,480
I feel dizzy now.

93
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,770
I'm dizzy.

94
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,390
I think my bones are going to break.

95
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,020
You started it.

96
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,190
You started it.

97
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:47,820
Longda.

98
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,810
You must help me.

99
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,740
Chi Yu.

100
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,580
Chi Yu.

101
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,220
I'm glad you're back.

102
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,060
What are you doing?

103
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,500
Chi Yu.

104
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,900
It's good you're back.

105
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,820
Listen.

106
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,460
I've been having nightmares these days.

107
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,860
It's really great that you came back safe.

108
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,510
That's great.

109
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,180
Who are you?

110
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:13,900
Chi Yu.

111
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,140
Who saved you?

112
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,970
Why didn't you tell me you came back?

113
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:20,860
What?

114
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:24,860
I'm

115
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,100
Longda.

116
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,650
I've never seen you.

117
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,250
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.

118
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:36,419
Did you hit yourself

119
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,799
on that night?

120
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,559
Did you hit your head?

121
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:39,820
Do you want to

122
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,640
go to the doctor?

123
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,110
Or...

124
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:41,760
It hurts.

125
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,570
I said I don't know you.

126
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,100
If you touch me again, I'll break your leg.

127
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,300
Don't touch me.

128
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,110
Don't fight.

129
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,090
Don't fight.

130
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,400
Look.

131
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,160
I told you.

132
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,930
These two hooligans hit people.

133
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,640
Chi Yu, what's wrong with you?

134
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,650
How did you get here?

135
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,220
Yes.

136
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:56,820
Bastard!

137
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,700
Who let you in?

138
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,440
I did.

139
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:58,940
What's wrong?

140
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,780
It's true that people

141
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,700
are divided by groups.

142
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,300
Two hooligans together.

143
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,580
You saved Chi Yu?

144
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:10,930
She is

145
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,180
the competitor?

146
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,180
Yes, that's her.

147
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,180
You are the male lead

148
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,970
who fired me?

149
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,660
Open your eyes and see.

150
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,500
My writing

151
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,860
is much better than that fatty's.

152
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,060
Who is fat? Who is fat?

153
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,900
You dwarf!

154
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,260
No.

155
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
What's wrong with Chi Yu?

156
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,080
What do you mean?

157
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,580
He lost his memory?

158
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,660
Lost his memory?

159
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,560
Look at them.

160
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,700
They are like fools.

161
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,220
Baldy holds an umbrella.

162
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,060
You're lawless.

163
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,700
You are the lawless one!

164
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,020
You plagiarized and copied.

165
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,740
Who plagiarized?

166
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,060
You!

167
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,500
Who copied?

168
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,380
You...

169
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,610
Alright, stop arguing.

170
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,530
Ms. Mu.

171
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,020
Come with me.

172
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,220
Okay.

173
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,080
I won't waste time on you.

174
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,020
Am I doomed?

175
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,540
Jin Ayin

176
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,360
was an ant in my hand.

177
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,820
She doesn't respect me

178
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,160
after taking a job.

179
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,460
She

180
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,010
won't repent

181
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,920
if I don't scold her into crying.

182
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:24,940
Ms. Mu.

183
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,780
I wanted to

184
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,490
meet you at Jianghe Film

185
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,080
just to meet the producer again.

186
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,770
But

187
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,330
if you keeps messing up like this,

188
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,420
if anything happens,

189
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,250
that'll be troublesome.

190
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,100
Besides,

191
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,580
if you keep arguing,

192
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,310
if she says something bad

193
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,620
to others,

194
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,940
that's even worse.

195
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,750
Then...

196
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,300
Don't worry.

197
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,650
I'll take care of it.

198
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,460
I...

199
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:56,860
Fine.

200
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,530
I'm really sorry about earlier.

201
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,670
I didn't know you are

202
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,500
Chi Yu's friend.

203
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,130
We're all friends.

204
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,580
It's a misunderstanding.

205
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,410
It's a misunderstanding.

206
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,020
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,660
I was rude just now.

208
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,820
It's okay.

209
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,420
The script.

210
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,330
The script.

211
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,750
This is the script I wrote.

212
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,530
I dare not say anything else,

213
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,180
but no one is more suitable

214
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,560
than me for writing Xiang Qinyu.

215
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,020
Please

216
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,610
give me another chance.

217
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,770
No problem.

218
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,640
I will talk to the director and producer

219
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,860
to explain

220
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,800
clearly.

221
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,220
Don't worry.

222
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,420
I won't cause you any trouble.

223
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,670
Thank you.

224
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,420
You're welcome.

225
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:14,650
That's good.

226
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,190
We'll leave now.

227
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,370
You...

228
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,850
Where are you going?

229
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,620
I said

230
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,140
you got the wrong person.

231
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,870
How could I?

232
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,160
I can recognize your face

233
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,160
even if it turns into ashes.

234
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,740
This is Chi Yu?

235
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,940
Isn't this you?

236
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,970
This is so similar.

237
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,910
Where is he now?

238
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,300
You really don't remember?

239
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,460
A month ago at the Magpie Bar...

240
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,500
then...

241
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,060
Then you

242
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,440
suddenly disappeared.

243
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,210
Disappeared?

244
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,290
You really don't remember?

245
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,770
Actually,

246
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,870
I don't know

247
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,010
what exactly happened.

248
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,700
I really don't know anything.

249
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,060
You just

250
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,140
suddenly disappeared.

251
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:27,660
Jin Ayin.

252
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,520
Let’s go.

253
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,700
I...

254
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,580
We're leaving.

255
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,410
Where do you live now?

256
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,700
How can I find you?

257
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,340
He's still there.

258
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,700
Did you find out?

259
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,020
You left in such a hurry.

260
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,060
I thought

261
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,790
you're not curious about this Chi Yu.

262
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,370
That guy looked sneaky.

263
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,990
We'd better stay away from him.

264
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,750
Yu,

265
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,820
you think too much.

266
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,700
I think Li Longda is quite good.

267
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:35,700
Look.

268
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,020
He's handsome

269
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,900
and gentle.

270
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,720
It's you who didn't

271
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,690
look like a good guy today.

272
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,420
Do you think

273
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,180
is it possible that you are Chi Yu

274
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,380
or

275
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,950
he's your grandson?

276
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,640
My surname is Xiang.

277
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,390
Maybe you married into your wife's family.

278
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,120
I'm kidding.

279
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:00,820
Look.

280
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,700
I found it.

281
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,480
[Chi Yu Magpie Izakaya]

282
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,010
Magpie.

283
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,190
I've been here.

284
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,260
January

285
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,410
16th.

286
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,310
Isn't this the day when you came?

287
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,260
There was no update.

288
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,750
That means the person disappeared

289
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,250
the day I came.

290
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,340
What a coincidence!

291
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,820
I've been looking for it for so long,

292
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,420
but I couldn't find

293
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,880
about my past.

294
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,300
Now, another person

295
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,410
like me appeared.

296
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,880
Find a chance to meet Li Longda

297
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,160
and investigate Chi Yu.

298
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,640
That's none of my business.

299
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,470
I'm not doing it.

300
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,550
Young man,

301
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
you look so handsome.

302
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,960
Are you married?

303
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,540
They asked you to act as a blind man.

304
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,640
Let me tell you.

305
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,819
That assistant director is darn.

306
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,819
I gave him a lot of money.

307
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,550
I thought I could play a supporting role.

308
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,380
Fine.

309
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,780
I can't even have a shot of my face.

310
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,020
It's still cold.

311
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,500
It's a little frozen.

312
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,300
Don't talk.

313
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,500
If he hears you,

314
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,610
he'll make you play a corpse.

315
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,900
In a place where birds don't poop,

316
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,420
where did you get the hot water?

317
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,450
It's specially warmed up for you with the warmer pads.

318
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,300
Young Master,

319
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,140
I'm so touched.

320
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,460
I can only give myself to you.

321
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,480
That's right.

322
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,180
So warm.

323
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,210
[Li Longda Chi Yu]

324
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,550
So stubborn.

325
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,620
Should use the brain.

326
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,420
Hello, Da Ye.

327
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,580
Can you get

328
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,380
Li Longda's phone number?

329
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,420
Yes.

330
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:13,920
I'll wait for you.

331
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:14,490
Hurry up.

332
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,170
Help yourself with dinner.

333
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,460
I have something to do.

334
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,660
I need to go out.

335
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,620
What should I do?

336
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,940
Ms. Screenwriter.

337
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,420
Okay. You can go.

338
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,060
Okay.

339
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,050

You're here.

Well...

Don't call me that.

344
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,180
Just call me Ayin.

345
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,530
I didn't ask him to come.

346
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,500
I came to ask you a question.

347
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,040
Let's talk while drinking.

348
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:29,810
Okay.

349
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,100
What do you want to drink?

350
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,730
Whatever.

351
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,290
Whatever.

352
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,280
OK. With ice?

353
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,700
Thank you.

354
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,030
Ayin.

355
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,320
Chi Yu really doesn't remember me

356
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,420
because he was injured?

357
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,390
I think so for now.

358
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,060
Mr. Longda.

359
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,070
Have you always been good friends with Chi Yu?

360
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,230
We were best friends.

361
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,890
It's been seven years

362
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,940
since college.

363
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,450
So,

364
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,670
you know him well?

365
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,180
Of course.

366
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,330
Chi Yu's friends are my friends.

367
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,410
It's my fault for changing the screenwriter.

368
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,580
I'll tell them

369
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,640
to let you compete again.

370
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,620
A toast to you.

371
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,930
Let's go for something exciting.

372
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,820
I want to ask you

373
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,780
something about Chi Yu.

374
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,050
Jin Ayin!

375
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,660
Where have you been?

376
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,860
Why aren't you back yet?

377
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,670
Hello.

378
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,060
-Yu.
-Why is it so noisy?

379
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,020
Come here.

380
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,880
I'll send you an address.

381
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:09,840
Come and play with me.

382
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,860
It's fun here.

383
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,260
No.

384
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,420
Jin Ayin.

385
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,490
Ayin.

386
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,640
This is for you.

387
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,420
Here.

388
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,340
Thank you for saving Chi Yu.

389
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:40,930
Money.

390
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,740
You give me money?

391
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,380
No way.

392
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,610
Take it back.

393
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,180
You must accept it.

394
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,150
This money...

395
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,600
these unimportant things

396
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,540
are not enough to express

397
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,030
my gratitude to you.

398
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,910
I'm such a jerk.

399
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,300
We were best friends.

400
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:14,740
No.

401
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,400
-I can't take it.
-If you keep refusing,

402
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,080
you're looking down on me.

403
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,000
[Dear Wife]

404
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,780
Shush.

405
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,820
Shush.

406
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,950
Hello, honey.

407
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,270
I'm drinking with my buddy.

408
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,730
Okay.

409
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,810
Let's go home now.

410
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,100
Let's go.

411
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,270
I'll see you off.

412
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:48,980
No need.

413
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,260
No need.

414
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,380
You don't have to see me off. Sit down.

415
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,210
Why are you so careless?

416
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,250
You even compressed my flowers.

417
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,200
I'm sorry.

418
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,820
What did you just say?

419
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,160
I'm sorry.

420
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,870
I'm sorry.

421
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,120
I knew it.

422
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,230
I've seen you before.

423
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,140
I really have to go back.

424
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,170
Be careful.

425
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,290
Remember to call a taxi.

426
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,750
Jin Ayin.

427
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,180
Jin Ayin.

428
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,680
Yu.

429
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,940
You're here.

430
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:14,950
Alright.

431
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,090
Stop drinking.

432
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,460
Stop drinking.

433
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,360
Let me get you some water.

434
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,630
Hello.

435
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,140
Please give me a bottle of water.

436
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:26,700
Okay.

437
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,380
Thank you.

438
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:31,820
Jin Ayin!

439
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,010
Jin Ayin!

440
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:36,920
Jin Ayin!

441
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:39,860
Jin Ayin!

442
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,310
Hello, everyone.

443
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,700
My name is Jin Ayin.

444
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,450
Jin Ayin.

445
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,530
Jin Ayin.

446
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,490
What are you doing?

447
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,620
It belongs to me.

448
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,360
I won't back down.

449
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,300
You won't.

450
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:14,830
You won't.

451
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,600
I won't.

452
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,900
Luckily,

453
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,050
although you were so noisy at night,

454
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,410
I'm glad you didn't throw up.

455
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

456
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,120
Look at me now.

457
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,360
I was like this because I want

458
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,700
to help you.

459
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,420
I want him

460
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,290
to tell the truth after drinking.

461
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,750
Help me?

462
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,800
Yes.

463
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,790
Otherwise, why would I drink with him?

464
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:27,850
You have no conscience.

465
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,540
I feel so bad.

466
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,830
Why did you help me?

467
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,330
Because...

468
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,140
I told you

469
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,400
I won't leave you alone.

470
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,170
This is a gift from Xiang Qinyu.

471
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,500
He even gave me his autograph.

472
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,050
Enough.

473
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,180
Stop it.

474
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,100
Go to sleep.

475
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:15,940
What are you doing?

476
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,620
You are drunk. Control yourself.

477
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,690
Why are you hiding?

478
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,260
Jin Ayin, behave yourself.

479
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:35,940
Money.

480
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,550
Money.

481
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,620
Look.

482
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,530
Money.

483
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,560
You're such a money-grubber.

484
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,740
Yes.

485
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,810
I'm a money-grubber.

486
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,920
I don't have such big dreams as you do.

487
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,190
Keep your name forever.

488
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:01,690
No.

489
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,080
I used to think

490
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,880
if one day

491
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,840
I become a millionaire,

492
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,090
I'll buy a house

493
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,520
on that building.

494
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,420
A small house.

495
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,610
Every day when I come home and open the door,

496
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,750
I can smell gardenia's fragrance.

497
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,620
The most important thing is

498
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,410
there must be a big French window,

499
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:45,850
so that

500
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,620
once I open the curtains,

501
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,410
I can see

502
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,010
the brightest TV tower in the center of the city.

503
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,580
When I was writing dramas,

504
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,740
I looked up

505
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,680
every day,

506
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,640
I can feel

507
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,240
my value

508
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,830
in this city.

509
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,240
But the house price

510
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,960
hit me hard

511
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:17,970
on my face.

512
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,520
The more bitter life is,

513
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,510
the sweeter the wine is.

514
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,490
You have a deep grudge at such a young age.

515
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,680
Good attractions

516
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,320
all need tickets.

517
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,600
Expenses for poetic trips are also very expensive.

518
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:47,920
Tell me.

519
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,050
Isn't money

520
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,820
important?

521
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,730
You don't understand.

522
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,020
You don't even like women.

523
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,100
How can you understand

524
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,170
the pain of ordinary people like us?

525
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,840
Who said I don't like women?

526
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,490
I just treat love

527
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,180
dedicated.

528
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,890
And if I marry a woman,

529
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,830
I will take care of her for the rest of my life.

530
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,860
Xiang Qinyu.

531
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,770
I'm going to be rich soon.

532
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,890
When my draft won,

533
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,410
I'll be the screenwriter Jin Ayin.

534
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,200
By then,

535
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,240
money,

536
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,080
fame,

537
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,220
and benefits

538
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,450
are all mine.

539
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:55,900
Yes.

540
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,550
They'll all be yours.

541
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,360
You're drunk.

542
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,520
Why are you taking off your clothes?

543
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,250
Put it on.

544
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,850
Wangcai.

545
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,190
Music.

546
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,490
This song is for you.

547
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,130
I can only help you that much about chasing girls.

548
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,680
What does

549
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,190
"chasing girls" mean?

550
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,630
♫On that day♫

551
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,530
♫The wind gently crosses your face♫

552
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,980
♫I secretly wrote it down♫

553
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,540
♫The first chapter of my unlikely encounter with you♫

554
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,930
♫If one day♫

555
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,730
♫You'll wonder about me too♫

556
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,200
♫That's the sound of a heartbeat♫

557
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,230
♫A foretaste of what's to come♫

558
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:15,480
♫Maybe one day we'll meet♫

559
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:19,000
♫Build our fortress♫

560
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:21,520
♫To treat you with care and consideration♫

♫I want to tell you in person♫

♫It's all I want♫

00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,980
♫An open secret♫

575
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,290
Behave yourself.

576
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,090
Behave yourself.

577
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:32,960
It's dawn.

578
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,390
Thirsty?

579
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,520
Open your mouth.

580
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,890
You're still so stubborn when you're asleep.

581
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,760
You...

582
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,000
are awake.

583
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,110
I’ll go wash up.

584
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:47,310
Ayin.

585
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:47,970
Jin Ayin.

586
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,230
Who is it?

587
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,530
Shush!

588
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,930
Jin Ayin, it's me, Jian Ye.

589
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,120
The wardrobe! The wardrobe!

590
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,400
I saw you.

591
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,590
Open the door!

592
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,530
Go in.

593
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,400
No.

594
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,220
I do things righteously.

595
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:15,720
Shush.

596
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,060
Why am I acting like a adulterer?

597
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,440
What's going on?

598
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,400
Brother, I beg you. You don't know her.

599
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,870
She is famous

600
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,340
for being well-informed

601
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,430
and gossipy.

602
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,370
If she sees us,

603
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,630
our reputation will be ruined.

604
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,370
Go inside.

605
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,360
Hello.

606
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,730
I just got up.

607
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,120
Wait a minute.

608
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,500
Don't make a sound.

609
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,740
Jin Ayin.

610
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,480
Ayin.

611
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,200
Coming.

612
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,600
What took you so long?

613
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,230
Did you hide someone in the room?

614
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,260
No.

615
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,100
No.

616
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,820
No?

617
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,480
I heard someone talking.

618
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:26,740
Really?

619
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:29,980
Wangcai.

620
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:34,860
Well...

621
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,330
I'm so sleepy.

622
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,780
Why does it smell like alcohol?

623
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,050
Ms. Jin's

624
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,520
living such a happy life.

625
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,980
You are singing while eating hot pot,

626
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,820
drinking and chatting.

627
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,900
After I came back from my business trip,

628
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,740
I wanted to see you.

629
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,090
I almost couldn't come in.

630
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,020
I have good news for you.

631
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,400
I heard that

632
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,850
the male lead

633
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,130
made a lot of efforts

634
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,420
to get ten screenwriters to vote anonymously

635
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,940
and asked for fair selection.

636
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,330
Don't worry.

637
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,400
Eight voted on your script.

638
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,300
Really?

639
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,590
Of course.

640
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,500
Congratulations, Ms. Jin.

641
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,430
-The duck that flew away can be again...
-Why did you even start chatting?

642
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,050
It seems

643
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,340
it's time for you to run.

644
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,580
That's really great.

645
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,010
What are you looking at?

646
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,800
Well...

647
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,990
I have a stiff neck.

648
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,650
My neck hurts.

649
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,170
Stiff neck.

650
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,040
What's that sound?

651
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:47,660
Don't move.

652
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:53,730
