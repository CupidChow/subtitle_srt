00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,930
I cannot finish revising it.

5
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:57,900
I cannot finish revising it.

6
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,270
Who is it? Leave me alone.

7
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,640
Producer Hu said

8
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,290
this place is mine today.

9
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,410
Why are you here?

10
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:33,340
Director said

11
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,960
I should come and see you

12
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,180
and check the scenes tomorrow.

13
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:43,940
These

14
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,220
were

15
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,300
brought by Director.

16
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,720
When you're hungry in work later,

17
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,579
you can have some.

18
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,070
Let's start.

19
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,680
Okay.

20
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,360
First,

21
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,460
Scene 31.

22
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,040
Xiang Qinyu's first time to act

23
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,400
as a role of martial art in a costume drama.

24
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,720
At that time,

25
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,460
I acted arbitrarily.

26
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,400
Then...

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,600
Let's continue.

28
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,450
Scene 35.

29
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,350
My second movie,

30
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,260
Heroes in Jianghu.

31
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,720
At that time, actually...

32
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,130
I...

33
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,170
What I said...

34
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,720
I heard it.

35
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,320
Then why did you...

36
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,560
That's my answer.

37
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,460
So...

38
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,420
From beginning to end,

39
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,400
♫Every frame and second in front of the camera♫

40

Uncle and auntie,

it's fixed. Try it.

83
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,970
Thank you.

84
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,710
It's okay.

85
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,880
Young man,

86
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,850
why is there still no Internet here?

87
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,420
Let me check.

88
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:13,800
Look.

89
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,260
You didn't tap "connect to Wi-Fi".

90
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,270
You have to tap it.

91
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,060
OK.

92
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,450
Young people are young people.

93
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,620
Thank you.

94
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,360
You're welcome.

95
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,730
Young man,

96
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,150
you've been busy for a long time.

97
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,700
Sit down and have some tea before you leave.

98
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,270
Will that be okay?

99
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,220
Have a seat.

100
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,180
It's definitely okay.

101
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,000
Normally, there are not many people in this house.

102
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,590
It's not easy for young people to come here.

103
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,850
Hurry up. Have a seat.

104
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:40,940
Have a seat.

105
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,550
Thank you, uncle and auntie.

106
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,659
Auntie,

107
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,620
is that your son's picture on the wall?

108
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,980
He seems to be my age.

109
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,460
Doesn't he

110
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,280
come home often?

111
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,610
It's a long story.

112
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,560
Such a big thing actually happened.

113
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,710
You two must be blessed in the future.

114
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
What blessing?

115
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,450
I'm a talkative person normally.

116
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,450
I always stay at home and no one listens to me.

117
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,950
By the way, auntie,

118
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
you just said

119
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,020
your kid lost his memory.

120
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,160
Did you take him to the hospital

121
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,410
to have a check?

122
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,250
Don't mention it.

123
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,750
Every time

124
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,940
we intended to take that brat to the hospital,

125
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,360
he always said he's fine.

126
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,370
So stubborn.

127
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,809
He doesn't listen to us at all.

128
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,470
Yes.

129
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,909
Children are all like this.

130
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,080
I remember when I was little,

131
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,260
I didn't dare tell my parents

132
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,820
when I was bullied outside.

133
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,380
I just tolerated it myself.

134
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,340
Yes.

135
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,320
You are all like that when you were little.

136
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,930
When Yu was little,

137
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,120
his ankle got burnt

138
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,960
by hot water.

139
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,260
He got a very big bleb.

140
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,090
He didn't dare to tell us.

141
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,430
We didn't find out until it got festered.

142
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,240
His ankle

143
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,640
got a scar as big as an egg.

144
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,990
A scar?

145
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,260
-Thank you, young man. -Bye.

146
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:15,960
Bye.

147
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,900
The scar left when he was little...

148
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:01,920
Bastard.

149
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,270
Why does this place look so familiar?

150
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,330
Ma Zehao

151
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,780
seems to be in debt.

152
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,660
I saw him having several jobs.

153
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,630
He's even working to fix the broadband.

154
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,820
Besides,

155
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,660
he has never been to

156
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,570
the hospital you mentioned these days.

157
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,320
Nothing else

158
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,600
was found out.

159
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,390
The weather forecast said there will be a heavy rain tomorrow.

160
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,520
And there's a possibility of mudslides here.

161
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,700
Let's wait for the notice in the group chat

162
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,090
to see if we will film tomorrow, okay?

163
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,680
Okay.

164
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,320
Take a rest.

165
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,090
Ayin.

166
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,580
Ayin.

167
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,450
Longda.

168
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:02,850
Director.

169
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,480
Have you seen Ayin?

170
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,340
No.

171
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,940
Didn't she get in the car?

172
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,090
No, she didn't come back.

173
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,900
Producer Hu also said

174
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,700
there will be a heavy rain and mudslides tomorrow.

175
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,870
I haven't submitted the script yet.

176
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,600
This is bad.

177
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,660
What did you say?

178
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,580
Say it again.

179
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,320
You knew she was up there.

180
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,510
Why didn't you tell her?

181
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,340
You only need to care a little bit of her

182
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,170
and ask her.

183
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,510
Yes.

184
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,740
You don't care about her at all.

185
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,640
I really don't know.

186
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,310
Tell me what you know. Tell me.

187
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,340
-Let me tell you. -Longda.

188
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,060
-If anything happens to Ayin. -Don’t be impulsive. Calm down.

189
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,940
If she is missing in the mountain,

190
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,280
I'll never let you off.

191
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,460
Longda, what are you doing?

192
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,780
Chi Yu, get up.

193
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,180
What are you doing?

194
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,270
You start fighting again, you kid.

195
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:18,980
Jin Ayin is...

196
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,020
I know the thing of Jin Ayin.

197
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,420
It’s our fault.

198
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,520
We changed the place

199
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,970
for her to revise the script.

200
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,780
We forgot her when we came down the mountain as we were in a hurry.

201
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,800
The crew has sent someone to look for her up in the mountain.

202
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,340
There won't be a problem.

203
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,880
He knew it but didn't mention anything.

204
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,620
Enough.

205
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,260
You're so cold-blooded.

206
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Enough.

207
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,870
Listen.

208
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,860
I won’t let you off if anything happens to Jin Ayin.

209
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,350
Alright.

210
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,580
Can you stop?

211
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,380
Get back to your work.

212
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,400
What's going on?

213
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,470
What happened?

214
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:39,930
It’s our fault.

215
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,490
People don't know the place

216
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,140
where Ayin revises the script.

217
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,900
We forgot to bring her down

218
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,740
when we came down.

219
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,600
That's why he was angry.

220
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,670
I've sent someone up the mountain.

221
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:46,530
Well,

222
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,420
give me the car key.

223
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,920
Why?

224
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,920
I'm going to find her.

225
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,450
What are you talking about?

226
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,810
There is a possibility that neither of you can come down.

227
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,620
I'm fine.

228
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:51,980
Shut up.

229
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,500
Li Longda.

230
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,660
Drive this car.

231
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,460
It's four-wheel drive.

232
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:56,690
Be careful.

233
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,320
I know the location.

234
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,650
Oh my precious,

235
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,100
be careful.

236
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:17,740
Hurry up and

237
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
call the people on the mountain.

238
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,510
Yes.

239
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,020
Tell them to make sure to bring back the screenwriter safely.

240
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:21,640
I know.

241
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,980
And tell them that

242
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,560
Chi Yu and Li Longda went up too.

243
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,580
You shouldn't give them the car key.

244
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,260
Do you know?

245
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,260
Tuotuo, let's go.

246
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,450
Hu, where are you going?

247
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,430
Jin Ayin.

248
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,430
Ayin.

249
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,410
Ayin.

250
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:44,740
Ayin.

251
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,370
Jin Ayin.

252
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,090
Ayin.

253
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,350
Ayin.

254
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,410
Chi Yu.

255
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,180
Let me ask you this once.

256
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,600
Why did you become like this?

257
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,160
It's like you've suddenly become another person.

258
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,100
You're no longer the Chi Yu I know.

259
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,200
I have my reasons.

260
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,140
What reason

261
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,300
can make you ignore her?

262
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,320
Are you still a man?

263
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,600
Don't worry.

264
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,580
I'll leave her soon.

265
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,610
I...

266
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,130
You're not good enough for her.

267
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,830
You don't deserve her.

268
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,180
If

269
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,860
I did something that made you misunderstand,

270
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
I apologize.

271
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,080
From beginning to end,

272
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,470
we are just friends.

273
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,430
Xiang Qinyu.

274
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,380
Xiang Qinyu.

275
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:49,870
Ayin.

276
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,390
Ayin.

277
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,680
Ayin.

278
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,670
Longda.

279
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,420
Ayin.

280
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,010
I’m glad you’re fine.

281
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,180
I...

282
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,090
I went down the mountain road.

283
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,500
I thought I could walk down the mountain.

284
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,100
But

285
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,420
I seem to be lost.

286
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,010
It's raining heavily.

287
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,410
Why didn't you wait in the room?

288
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,580
How did you know where I was?

289
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,300
You're all wet.

290
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,100
Let's go. My car is over there.

291
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,460
Let's go.

292
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,940
Is he here too?

293
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,700
Where is he?

294
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,030
Say something. Where is he?

295
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,370
He will go down the mountain himself.

296
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,780
He won't leave unless he finds me.

297
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,470
Don't you know who he is?

298
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,830
Wake up, okay?

299
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,930
I trust him.

300
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,880
Don't you trust me?

301
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,450
Longda,

302
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,660
the rain won't stop for a while.

303
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,680
It's dangerous for him to be alone in the mountain.

304
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,290
I can't leave him alone.

305
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,600
He deserves it.

306
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,220
Ayin. Ayin.

307
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,530
Ayin, I'm begging you.

308
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,329
Please go down the mountain with me.

309
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,710
It's okay if you don't like me.

310
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,020
I can give up everything.

311
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,109
You can reject me.

312
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,869
I won't bother you anymore.

313
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,380
But I beg you.

314
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,420
I just want you

315
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,220
to be safe.

316
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:21,980
OK?

317
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,740
Come down the mountain with me.

318
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,790
Longda.

319
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,450
I'm sorry.

320
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,580
Come with me.

321
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,170
Ayin, I'm begging you.

322
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,270
Leave me alone. Leave.

323
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,330
Xiang Qinyu.

324
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,390
Ayin.

325
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,410
Xiang Qinyu.

326
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,830
Xiang Qinyu.

327
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,040
Xiang Qinyu.

328
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,590
Xiang Qinyu.

329
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,100
Where are you?

330
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,150
Are you looking for me?

331
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,400
I'm glad you're okay.

332
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,870
Let's make up.

333
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,740
Let's go.

334
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,500
Xiang Qinyu.

335
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,750
Help!

336
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,900
Help!

337
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,040
Xiang Qinyu.

338
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,780
I don't want to die.

339
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,620
I haven't been successful yet.

340
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,370
I haven't had the chance

341
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,510
to see my grandma for the last time.

342
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,170
I don't want to die.

343
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,190
Xiang... Xiang Qinyu.

344
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,170
Go, Xiang Qinyu.

345
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,460
I know it's too late.

346
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,180
Go now.

347
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,280
You have to live.

348
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,260
Hang in there. I'll think about a way.

349
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,540
And...

350
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,520
I know.

351
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,200
I know you don't like me.

352
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,260
But I still like you so much.

353
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,810
What are you talking about?

354
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,780
Who said I don't like you?

355
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,460
Give the stuff to me first.

356
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,020
I'll hold it for you.

357
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,050
My computer.

358
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,250
If you still want to see it,

359
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,050
give me your hand.

360
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,620
Don't worry.

361
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,050
I'm here.

362
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,580
Step on me

363
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,740
and climb up.

364
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,530
Xiang Qinyu.

365
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,590
I want to tell you.

366
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,320
Why are you still talking so much at this time?

367
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,220
Climb.

368
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,060
Xiang Qinyu.

369
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,960
What will you do if I go up there?

370
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,910
Leave me alone.

371
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,150
As long as you climb up,

372
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,610
we'll make up.

373
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,660
You can do whatever you want.

374
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,400
Hurry up. There's no time.

375
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,950
I'm here.

376
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,390
Xiang Qinyu.

377
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,860
Xiang Qinyu.

378
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,130
Xiang Qinyu.

379
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,390
Xiang Qinyu.

380
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,800
Xiang Qinyu.

381
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,370

♫In the interplay of light and shadow♫

383

Is it that precious?

412
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,180
Will you keep what you said just now?

413
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,980
What did I say?

414
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,760
Just now.

415
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,060
Under the cliff.

416
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,000
I forgot.

417
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,250
I saved your life just now.

418
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,500
I'm your life saver.

419
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,860
Back in my time,

420
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,430
I would be your second parent.

421
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,910
I just pulled you up.

422
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,970
It equals to saving you.

423
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,070
Back in your time,

424
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,290
you will have to marry me.

425
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,390
My ears must have been watered.

426
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:58,780
I...

427
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,060
I didn't hear anything.

428
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,670
Xiang Qinyu.

429
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,010
Xiang Qinyu, wait for me.

430
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,490
Xiang Qinyu.

431
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,820
Xiang Qinyu.

432
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,930
I can't hear you now.

433
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,280
-You... -I really can’t hear you.

434
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,020
They are still not...

435
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,420
They... they are back.

436
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,690
They are back.

437
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,700
You two precious.

438
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,980
You are finally back.

439
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,460
If you are still not back,

440
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,060
I won't be able to work here anymore.

441
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,500
If Li Yongda hadn't come back to report,

442
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,380
I would think something happened to you.

443
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,420
I almost called the police.

444
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,220
Excuse me.

445
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,860
Are you okay?

446
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,380
You are fine?

447
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,510
Well...

448
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,640
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

449
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,740
I'll call you later.

450
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:57,990
Sister.

451
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,170
If anything happens to you,

452
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,910
grandma will skin me alive.

453
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,180
I'm fine.

454
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:07,500
I'm fine.

455
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,700
Enough.

456
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,490
Why is your hair wet?

457
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:21,610
Mumu.

458
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,060
Hello, sir.

459
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:56,980
Hello.

460
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,980
The owner of this room

461
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,420
asked me to give you this letter.

462
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,270
Thank you.

463
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:01,850
You're welcome.

464
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,720
[I know what happened.]

465
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,720
[I'll be busy for a few days. Go back to Shanghai first.]

466
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,390
I hope you are safe and don't get hurt.

467
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,240
Leave me alone.

468
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,230
Leave.

469
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:13,950
Longda.

470
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,510
Are you there?

471
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,890
I'm sorry

472
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:22,500
for what happened today.

473
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,770
I was rude.

474
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,560
Longda.

475
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:52,840
Boss.

476
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,150
Boss, wake up.

477
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:54,910
Boss.

478
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,360
Boss.

479
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,830
It's been a while.

480
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,210
You haven't said where to go.

481
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,590
Buy me a bottle.

482
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,650
I'll tell you where to go.

483
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,780
I'll give you 10 times the price.

484
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,860
A stupid second-generation rich.

485
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,060
What did you say?

486
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:19,600
Nothing.

487
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,060
I said your car is so nice.

488
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,200
So beautiful.

489
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,100
Are you looking down on me?

490
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,060
Boss, don't hit me.

491
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,770
Don't, boss.

492
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,890
I'll give you 10 times the price.

493
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,400
I have plenty of money.

494
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,120
Get out of the car.

495
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,190
Get off!

496
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,010
Get off!

497
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,090
-What a bad luck to run into a drunkard. -Get off.

498
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,430
What did you say?

499
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,550
Don't go.

500
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,250
Don't go.

501
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,980
I just drank a few bottles.

502
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,590
Drink more.

503
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,170
Why all of a sudden?

504
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,440
You just quit?

505
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,830
I intended to work until the end of this month.

506
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:26,660
But

507
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,350
I have something to confirm.

508
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,180
Do you sell alcohol?

509
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:44,810
Another drunkard.

510
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,980
Please give this to the boss.

511
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,340
Did you remember something?

512
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,300
What's your relationship with Taotao?

513
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,150
I feel like I've seen you somewhere.

514
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:43,750
Who are you?

515
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,310
I remember now.

516
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,310
You...

517
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,830
Know Jin Ayin?

518
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,700
Last time when I came out of her house,

519
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,030
I saw you go for her.

520
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,920
Let me handle this.

521
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,300
Eat something.

522
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:29,920
Stop drinking.

523
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,310
In the past,

524
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,800
Chi Yu also tried to persuade me like that.

525
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,440
He's allergic to alcohol.

526
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,970
I know.

527
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,920
He was afraid that I might hurt my liver.

528
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,180
But now?

529
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,810
Everything has changed.

530
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,820
Changed?

531
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,870
Chi Yu changed?

532
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:28,780
Li Longda.

533
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:31,590
Drink.

534
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,830
Little Ayin.

535
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,120
Where are you going?

536
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:46,850
Hu.

537
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,600
The car of the crew is back in the parking lot.

538
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,620
Hu,

539
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,889
I want to ask.

540
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,570
How many days will our crew take off this time?

541
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,889
The art group will set up the scenes again.

542
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,030
About

543
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:58,920
four or five days.

544
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,020
Wait for the notice in the group.

545
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,400
Then, can I take a leave

546
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,880
and not go back with the crew's car?

547
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,140
Where are you going?

548
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,710
I want to go back to visit my grandma.

549
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,630
I understand.

550
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,730
Such a big thing happened.

551
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,190
It's right to go home and see the elderly.

552
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:13,800
Go.

553
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,260
But look at the weather.

554
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,600
The rain is unpredictable.

555
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,840
If you are not in a hurry,

556
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,690
wait until the rain is lighter.

557
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,740
Well,

558
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,820
about Mumu...

559
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:24,720
Don't worry.

560
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,270
Ms. Chen had something to do this morning

561
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,220
and flew away.

562
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,910
I'll tell her later.

563
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,390
Just go home and visit your grandma without worry.

564
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:32,750
But remember

565
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,860
to be careful on the way.

566
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,690
Thank you, Hu.

567
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,350
It's okay.

568
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:01,370
[It's not hard to tell a story.]

569
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:01,370
[Maybe true love requires not only cautious nourishing,]

570
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:01,370
[but also patience until it blooms.]
