4
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,660
Nice shot.

5
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,390
Well...

6
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,380
Watch the game till the end.

7
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,460
The game is over.

8
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,980
Let's...

9
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,300
Break up.

10
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,060
Chuan.

11
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,600
You don't have to be.

13
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,180
Here.

14
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,800
I wish you can be a happy drunkard

15
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,950
every time you lift up your glass.

16
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,720
When I come back next time,

17
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,020
let's have beer together.

18
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:09,940
Well,

19
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,510
let's shake hands.

20
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,550
You really like this.

21
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,570
It doesn't matter, right?

22
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,730
It's the last time anyway.

23
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,510
I thought at least

24
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,040
we wouldn't see each other for a while.

25
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,020
At least

26
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,220
you wouldn't come to my office.

27
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,230
I wrote this letter of resignation

28
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,690
two years ago.

29
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,660
I didn't want to give up

30
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,920
the project half way,

31
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,110
so I didn't hand it in.

32
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,920
This is from last year.

33
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,590
I was reluctant

34
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,860
to give up the script I'd followed for a year,

35
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,750
So I held it up again.

36
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,560
What's this about?

37
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,600
I don't know.

38
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,450
This was written in Suzhou, on the day

39
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,150
when I knew the budget was cut by half.

40
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,770
But when I poured wine on you that day,

41
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,230
I felt much better.

42
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,810
So I put up with it.

43
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,640
What I want to say is that in my heart,

44
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,600
you've been fired countless times.

45
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,560
Life is not in vain.

46
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,430
Every step counts.

47
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,140
So I don't regret being in Jianghe for so many years.

48
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,900
But now,

49
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,330
I don't want to bear it anymore.

50
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,460
I wrote this last night.

51
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,510
Hush.

52
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,440
I...

53
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,340
I'm Ma.

54
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:12,990
Ma.

55
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,620
Ma.

56
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,580
Why are you here?

57
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,340
I want to take Taotao away.

58
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,170
After all this,

59
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,650
how can you possibly take her away?

60
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,400
What you did is already on TV.

61
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,930
The police are all around here,

62
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,170
waiting to arrest you.

63
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,670
Police?

64
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,780
Ms. Zhang.

65
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,740
I beg you.

66
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,110
You...

67
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,460
Don't tell the police about me.

68
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,360
No, no.

69
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,630
Don't tell the police I'm here.

70
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,390
Don't tell them. Please.

71
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:32,980
Fine.

72
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,659
I beg you.

73
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,960
Okay. I won't call the police.

74
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,049
I won't.

75
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:36,419
OK.

76
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,980
But someone will come

77
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,600
to check on Taotao later.

78
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,380
How about this?

79
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,850
I'll help you

80
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,289
keep an eye outside of the door.

81
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,260
Help me watch them.

82
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,070
I'll help you.

83
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,170
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

84
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,760
Thank you.

85
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,540
You...

86
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,810
Qinyu,

87
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,480
you have to think it through.

88
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,040
Since no one dares to film the Legend of Huangpu,

89
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,070
I'll sell Mengsheng

90
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,790
and raise money to shoot it myself.

91
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,370
Mengsheng

92
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,860
is your own business.

93
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,750
I know

94
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,470
the position it has in your heart.

95
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,500
I'll say this.

96
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,140
Whether you'll succeed or not,

97
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,670
the door of the Wen's family

98
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,580
is always open for you.

99
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,460
Master.

100
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,580
Cut.

101
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,020
Mr. Di, it's a wrap.

102
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,860
Congratulations, Mr. Di.

103
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,100
Congratulations.

104
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,710
Mr. Di.

105
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,380
Thank you.

106
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,940
Tomorrow will be the last day

107
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,780
for the Legend of Xiang Qinyu.

108
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,660
It'll be a wrap.

109
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,520
Keep it up.

110
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,290
Okay.

111
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,090
Cheers.

112
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,980
Let's take a photo first.

113
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,570
Runners, clean up both sides please.

114
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,910
Thank you, Yu.

115
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,610
Who would have thought

116
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,330
the boy from Shanghai who was bullied

117
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,760
in the martial arts troupe

118
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,120
has become so respected.

119
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:26,860
By the way,

120
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,540
I have a favor

121
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,800
a ask you.

122
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,980
Okay, go ahead.

123
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,690
What can he do?

124
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,790
This kid

125
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,940
is always like this, right?

126
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,300
He knows nothing,

127
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,180
except how to make trouble.

128
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,170
I think

129
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,340
he's on his way to have fun again.

130
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,560
Teng Xi.

131
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,890
Hold on.

132
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,900
There's another scene.

133
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,740
Well,

134
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,380
I'll go first.

135
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,900
Go ahead.

136
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,500
What are you doing?

137
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,780
I haven't seen this for a long time.

138
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,340
Before Chi Yu and I

139
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,620
graduated,

140
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,890
we worked as extras in the crew.

141
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,670
We had lunch with this.

142
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,860
One day,

143
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,920
he got his salary for two days

144
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,050
and bought me

145
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,920
such a big plate of braised prawns.

146
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,100
But he didn't know that

147
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,150
actually, I secretly

148
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,330
had some other snacks every night.

149
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,660
Let's say...

150
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,420
If...

151
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,340
If Xiang Qinyu is still alive

152
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,380
after the attack,

153
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,520
can Chi Yu still be alive?

154
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,900
Ayin.

155
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,110
I owe him an apology.

156
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,700
Even for this,

157
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,860
I'll keep looking for him.

158
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,260
Even if I can never find him.

159
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,180
No matter how long it takes,

160
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,890
I will never give up.

161
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,140
Longda said

162
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,180
he believes

163
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,610
Chi Yu is still alive.

164
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,510
What do you think?

165
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,220
I believe it, too.

166
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,900
When Chi Yu is back,

167
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,980
and finds out that someone

168
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,860
acted in a drama in replacement of him,

169
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,330
his reactions must be funny.

170
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,620
What's wrong?

171
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,620
Maybe it's because the shooting is about to end,

172
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,420
I feel empty

173
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,560
inside my heart.

174
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,070
Who always asked

175
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,650
when we could stop revising the script?

176
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,860
My talent

177
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,600
hasn't been fully shown yet.

178
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,980
I promised you

179
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:25,970
to help you fulfill your wish

180
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,220
and make you famous.

181
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,090
I don't want to be famous anymore.

182
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,400
I just want you to remember me.

183
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,700
That's enough.

184
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,000
How is it?

185
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,290
New clothes.

186
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,280
Do you think it'll look good in photos?

187
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,620
Yes.

188
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,470
The one picked by me, Jin Ayin,

189
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,780
is certainly the best.

190
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,780
Of course you look good in everything.

191
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,100
Yes.

192
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,100
Chi Yu.

193
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,210
Take a look.

194
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,570
This is the last scene which I spontaneously revised with Mr. Hu.

195
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,140
I think it's more meaningful

196
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,600
to shoot it this way compared to before.

197
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,950
Xiang Qinyu saw the man in black

198
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,690
holding a gun

199
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,120
pointing to him.

200
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,520
I've collected a lot of news

201
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,420
about the Legend of Huangpu

202
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,650
and scrabbled up this scene.

203
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,170
Take a closer look.

204
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,310
Director, don't...

205
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,050
We still have so many things to do.

206
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,210
We still have couple photos to take.

207
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,080
Xiang Qinyu,

208
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,170
can you not go filming tomorrow?

209
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,590
Ayin.

210
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,320
If you don't go shooting tomorrow,

211
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,710
it won't happen.

212
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,980
Yes.

213
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,100
It won't happen if you don't go.

214
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,140
Ayin.

215
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,220
Ayin.

216
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,740
Ayin, let me out first.

217
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,940
Let's have a talk.

218
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,420
Ayin.

219
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,640
Xiang Qinyu.

220
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,400
I don't want this to end like this.

221
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,890
We can't end like this.

222
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,530
Ayin.

223
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,170
Let me out.

224
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,310
Let's talk.

225
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,560
I know you are leaving.

226
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,570
Xiang Qinyu.

227
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,140
The scene in the script

228
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,390
is exactly the same

229
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,220
as it was in the Legend of Huangpu.

230
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:08,859
Does it mean,

231
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,790
just like before,

232
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,230
Ze will come tomorrow,

233
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,099
and everything

234
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,170
will be replayed, right?

235
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,760
Chi Yu's dad said

236
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,510
this world is a big valley of echos.

237
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,140
The sound that goes out will come back.

238
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,660
If Ma Zehao

239
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,370
really corresponds to the person who wanted to kill me,

240
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,820
he will come back.

241
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,150
Then you'll get hurt tomorrow.

242
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:02,980
Ayin.

243
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,490
I...

244
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,260
I wish I could find a way

245
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,070
to stay.

246
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,460
But if not,

247
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,190
I must catch him.

248
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,220
I can't let him hurt you,

249
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,160
and Chi Yu's parents.

250
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,530
You're innocent.

251
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,550
You said before

252
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,220
no matter how romantic the encounter is,

253
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,040
it's not half as good as the reality.

254
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,750
Let me tell you now.

255
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,140
No matter how painful the parting is in my imagination,

256
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,080
it's not even one 10000th of the reality.

257
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,250
But I don't regret it.

258
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,460
For every minute and second I've spent with you here,

259
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,770
I have no regrets.

260
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,600
Sleep well tonight.

261
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,490
You'll be fine when you fall asleep.

262
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,690
I'll come up with

263
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,260
something to make you happy tomorrow.

264
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,240
Why is my black dress gone?

265
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,360
Maybe

266
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,590
someone bought it.

267
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,810
♫Every frame and second in front of the camera♫

268
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,080
There's not even one thing

269
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,380

♫I'm used to being surrounded by you♫

277

I asked someone to change the stove.

278
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,590
I also watered your plants.

Don't be so stingy to yourself anymore.

Chi Yu.

331
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,720
The script has been revised a lot.

332
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,580
Let's rehearse.

333
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,710
Not now.

334
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,780
What's wrong with him?

335
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,170
How could he suddenly revise the script the night before shooting?

336
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,120
I've never seen anyone like this.

337
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,980
Hush. Keep it down.

338
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,220
Let's make it through today.

339

Watch where you're going.

341

Chi Yu.

342
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,450
Why are you so absent-minded today?

343
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,720
He is...

344
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,540
Prop.

345
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,140
He must be on the prop team.

346
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,420
A masked man

347
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,360
with a hat on.

348
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,100
He's not from the crew.

349
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,300
He must have sneaked in.

350
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,020
Chi Yu.

351
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,860
You've just mentioned

352
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:42,960
a masked man

353
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,410
with strange eyes?

354
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,540
I think I've seen him somewhere.

355
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,500
Someone came to deliver flowers

356
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,860
and pushed a cart.

357
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,130
He put them next to the director's CCTV.

358
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,220
Where is the person who delivered this?

359
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,090
Chi Yu.

360
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,430
I was talking about you.

361
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,840
Where is the person who delivered this?

362
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,310
Don't be anxious. I'll check it for you.

363
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,140
What's the hurry?

364
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,370
It's weird.

365
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,110
We didn't order flowers today.

366
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,060
No flowers?

367
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,330
Ma Zehao.

368
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,490
Yu.

369
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,590
Yu. Yu.

370
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,340
It's me.

371
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,740
Why are you...

372
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,700
What are you holding?

373
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,050
The stuff for the lighting team,

374
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,420
for the shooting later.

375
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,670
Are you okay?

376
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,290
I'm fine.

377
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,540
I got the wrong person.

378
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,190
Yu.

379
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,240
I have something to do.

380
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,350
I have to go.

381
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,180
Ma Zehao.

382
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,570
Come out.

383
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,740
Ma Zehao.

384
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,190
Come out.

385
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,220
It should be this box.

386
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,460
Take a look.

387
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,560
Xiang Qinyu.

388
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,770
Teng Xi said you are not feeling well.

389
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,670
What's wrong?

390
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,770
Ma Zehao is here.

391
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,120
Ma Zehao?

392
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,740
Where is he?

393
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,800
I don't have time to tell you.

394
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,410
If anything happens to me,

395
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,280
take care of Ayin.

396
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:35,780
Wait.

397
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,920
What do you mean?

398
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,580
Hurry up.

399
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,310
Where are you going?

400
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,000
Something happened in Warehouse A02.

401
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,440
Isn't that the place where we store guns?

402
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,430
What happened?

403
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,340
Go away.

404
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,540
Why won't you listen?

405
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,870
Go away. Don't stop me.

406
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,970
You don't understand.

407
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,820
My friend.

408
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,520
This is our on-set screenwriter.

409
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,310
Screenwriter?

410
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,270
Long, no matter who she is, she can't go through it like this.

411
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,660
It was not easy for us to tidy up the boxes.

412
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,460
She messed it all up.

413
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,180
What is she doing?

414
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,020
There's nothing I can do.

415
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,020
Come down.

416
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,360
Someone put a real gun in here.

417
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,690
Let's talk outside.

418
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,190
Dismissed.

419
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,130
Come on. Let's go.

420
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,880
Sorry, Lai.

421
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,960
Calm down.

422
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,180
I'm sorry.

423
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,780
So,

424
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,250
there is a real gun in here

425
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,800
which was used by Ma Zehao to kill you.

426
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,610
Then

427
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,620
isn't it the same as before?

428
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,940
Then you are...

429
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,700
I'll find the actor who's supposed to shoot the gun

430
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,340
and tell him to stop acting.

431
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,030
If he quits,

432
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,580
someone else will do it.

433
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,720
It's useless.

434
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,120
I'll go find Ma Zehao then.

435
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,570
Xiang Qinyu.

436
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,140
If you need help,

437
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,090
remember to tell me.

438
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,040
Xiang Qinyu.

439
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,650
I can't find it.

440
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,260
I can't.

441
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,810
It's okay.

442
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,010
It's okay.

443
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,420
Everyone, hold on.

444
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,530
I'm really sorry for what happened just now.

445
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,130
Can you keep an eye on

446
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,590
any stranger that

447
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,840
we've never seen in the crew before?

448
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,920
Long.

449
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,800
There are so many people in our crew every day.

450
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,760
I really can't tell who's new.

451
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,470
Here's the thing.

452
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,630
This person is very important.

453
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,940
Pay attention to him.

454
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,340
Okay, brother.

455
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,110
Thank you.

456
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,940
All right.

457
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,530
After today's filming,

458
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,880
everything will be over.

459
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,420
But after the filming is over,

460
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,700
you'll be leaving.

461
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,920
Maybe

462
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,520
I won't die.

463
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,710
We still don't know yet.

464
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,600
Can you stay a little longer?

465
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,030
You can't leave yet.

466
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,950
I don't want you to leave.

467
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,050
I know.

468
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,810
I've written many stories,

469
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,480
but I've never written a tragedy.

470
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,659
I don't like tragedies.

471
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,060
Our story

472
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,040
shouldn't be a tragedy.

473
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,500
Then

474
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,540
write me the best ending.

475
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,660
At least

476
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,250
on a rainy day.

477
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,130
At a street corner,

478
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,570
or

479
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,180
in a cafe.

480
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,350
Someone sings some old songs,

481
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,420
and we spend

482
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,080
the most satisfying day there.

483
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,140
Then you say goodbye.

484
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,980
I'll say goodbye, too.

485
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,340
Let's go.

486
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,020

Just make do with it.

493

Hurry up.

Come on, move. Ready.

567

Come on, run a few steps over there.

Hurry up.

569
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,660
Anyway, I think this scene

570
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,300
is the last scene of our movie.

571
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,140
It's the ending.

572
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:56,980
A wrap-up.

573
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,900
Be careful.

574
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,220
Don't let anything happen to you

575
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,640
at the end of our filming.

576
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,540
Is there anything else

577
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,440
we can do?

578
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,690
We can only hope

579
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:18,910
this story

580
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,410
will have a good ending.

581
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,630
Be careful.

582
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,390
[The Legend of Xiang Qinyu]

583
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,540
Scene 95, take one, shot one.

584
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,330
The last scene.

585
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,710
He's really arrogant.

586
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,590
How dare you come alone?

587
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:15,960
Do it!

588
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,730
The climax is coming.

589
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,460
At this time,

590
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:54,080
Xiang Qinyu still doesn't know

591
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,450
his glorious life

592
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,950
will turn into a complete myth

593
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,130
in the next ten seconds.

594
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,560
What is Xiang Qinyu thinking

595
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,190
at this time?

596
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,930
Does he believe

597
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,010
that he can

598
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,800
build the glory of Shanghai action movies by himself?

599
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,770
Does he still believe

600
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,650
that even though he's been through a lot,

601
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,090
the family he can never find

602
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,380
will be waiting at his door?

603
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,930
Everything

604
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,300
is uncertain.

605
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,250
What we know is that

606
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,940
for this scene,

607
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,820
he's doing his best, like he always does.

608
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,020
I don't compete with others for anything,

609
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,350
but if something belongs to me,

610
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,180
I'll never give in.

611
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,200
But the accident happened unexpectedly.

612
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:16,660
Cut.

613
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,350
Congratulations to Chi Yu. It's a wrap.

614
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,660
Congratulations.

615

You are almost like Xiang Qinyu himself.

622

Especially the nervousness.

623
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:42,050
It was very good.

624
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,620
Not bad.

Okay.

Yes.

Everyone, get ready.

647
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,260
Action.

648
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,390
Don't explode.

649
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,340
Stop.

650
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,240
Xiang Qinyu.

651
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,540
The exploder is glitched.

652
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,140
The exploder is glitched.

653
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,430
Xiang Qinyu.

654
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:36,150
[I know the world has always been like this.]

655
