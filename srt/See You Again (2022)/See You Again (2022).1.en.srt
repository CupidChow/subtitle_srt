346
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,140
I should call the police first.

347
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,440
Help!

348
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,400
Help!

349
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,190
Help!

350
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,670
Who are you?

351
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,560
-Help! -Why did you try to kill me?

352
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,140
Who are you?

353
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,460
I'm Jin Ayin.

354
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,620
I'm sorry, bro.

355
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,170
I don't know what I've done to offend you.

356
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,140
Please forgive me.

357
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,530
If you like anything,

358
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,300
go get it yourself.

359
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,380
Go get it yourself.

360
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,050
If money is what you want,

361
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,060
please don't kill me.

362
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,980
You... You're bleeding.

363
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,380
How did he get hurt?

364
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,100
I don't know.

365
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,940
I think it's a gunshot wound.

366
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,100
Wait here.

367
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,820
I'll report it to the higher-ups right away.

368
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,060
Don't go.

369
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,180
What about me?

370
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,620
Sir,

371
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,700
I've done my best.

372
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,980
You are in a hospital.

373
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,580
Someone will come to save you.

374
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,860
Then we should never meet again.

375
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,730
Bed 1 in Ward 101 is calling.

376
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,940
Bed 1 in Ward 101 is calling.

377
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,580
What is this place?

378
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:15,940
Xiaole.

379
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,460
Hello, kid.

380
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,900
Welcome to our hospital.

381
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,620
Xiaole.

382
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,820
How can I help you?

383
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,690
Please register if you need to see a doctor.

384
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,380
Please go to the second floor to visit your family members.

385
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,940
What is this place?

386
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,980
What the hell.

387
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,860
No way.

388
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,700
Could it be him?

389
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,420
Why do they look so alike?

390
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,500
Impossible.

391
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,620
I'd better run first.

392
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,090
Bro.

393
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,140
Calm down.

394
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,580
It's the middle of the night.

395
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,540
What do you want?

396
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,100
Do you know who I am?

397
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,140
How would I know who you are?

398
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,340
You broke into my house

399
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,380
and yelled at me.

400
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,460
Now you're following me

401
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,740
and you just took my bag.

402
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,700
You really don't know me?

403
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,660
You are definitely not the person I know.

404
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,420
Don't worry.

405
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,020
I know

406
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,100
the rules.

407
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,290
I didn't see anything.

408
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:25,930
I'm begging you.

409
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,460
Please let me go.

410
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,060
I'm Xiang Qinyu.

411
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,620
You really said that.

412
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,660
I said

413
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,580
I'm Xiang Qinyu.

414
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,300
Are you filming a new show?

415
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,540
A reality prank show?

416
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,660
Are there hidden cameras?

417
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,540
Will I get a bonus if I guess it right?

418
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,580
Enough.

419
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,220
It's the middle of the night. Just come out.

420
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,500
Why are you so dedicated?

421
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,220
That's enough.

422
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,060
Won't you stop acting?

423
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,260
You do look like Xiang Qinyu.

424
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,420
But your temperament

425
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,540
is not as good as his.

426
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,090
Bro.

427
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,140
You're immersed in it.

428
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,090
You...

429
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,580
Xiang...

430
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,060
Xiang Qinyu?

431
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,420
This is mine.

432
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,790
Why do you have it?

433
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,850
This is my ID card.

434
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,700
I was born in 1993.

435
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,220
I...

436
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,930
I'm definitely not the murderer you mentioned.

437
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,990
Jin A..

438
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,620
Is this Yin?

439
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,620
We use simplified Chinese characters now.

440
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,050
Or...

441
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,770
it was one of your ancestors who shot at me.

442
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,400
Impossible.

443
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,790
In my family's past three generations,

444
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,900
no one

445
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,300
looked

446
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,260
similar to me.

447
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,540
My hometown is a small place.

448
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,220
I'm the only one who came to Shanghai.

449
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,420
The

450
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,690
People's Republic

451
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,180
of China?

452
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,900
The People's Republic of China was founded.

453
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:39,780
Well...

454
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,450
Yu...

455
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,210
Yu,

456
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,530
I don't know

457
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,900
if I

458
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,760
should say this or not.

459
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:48,970
You are sure

460
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,530
you're not a ghost, right?

461
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,250
I'm here in the flesh.

462
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,890
I don't look like a dead person.

463
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,760
But I hope I am dead.

464
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,160
Then it'll be easier to explain everything.

465
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,560
How did you get this?

466
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,250
So this

467
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,510
is really yours?

468
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,600
Yu.

469
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,060
This tie clip

470
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,500
means a lot to me.

471
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,140
Can you give it back to me?

472
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,680
It means a lot to me too.

473
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,910
And you just said

474
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,400
it's mine.

475
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,100
But

476
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,470
it's the year of 2018 now.

477
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,230
It doesn't belong to you

478
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,300
after you died.

479
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,120
I died?

480
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,850
So you know what happened back then?

481
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:58,700
I...

482
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,430
I only know that

483
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:01,870
now

484
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,490
it belongs to me.

485
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,660
Take me to Wuma Road.

486
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,290
What happened back then

487
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,750
should be recorded.

488
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,180
Wuma Road?

489
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:18,940
Mengsheng Filming Site is gone?

490
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,080
Mengsheng?

491
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,070
[Produced by Mengsheng Studios]

492
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,140
I think I know

493
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,170
the place you just mentioned.

494
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,740
He has a shadow

495
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,190
and makes sound when he walks.

496
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,840
Did he come here through time travel,

497
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,120
just like what's described in books?

498
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,230
He looks so handsome.

499
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,100
I want to go to Mengsheng.

500
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,060
Why did you bring me here?

501
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,190
This is the Film Library.

502
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,650
The original Mengsheng is gone.

503
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:01,770
Gone?

504
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,260
What happened to Mengsheng?

505
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,490
I don't know.

506
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,040
I thought you want to find out

507
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,199
what happened back then.

508
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,800
Come on. I'll take you there. Let's go.

509
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:13,860
Yu.

510
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,060
I want you to know

511
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,719
I'm a huge fan of yours.

512
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,100
Today's fans

513
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,400
include fans of singers

514
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,850
and fans of film stars.

515
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,520
Stop talking.
