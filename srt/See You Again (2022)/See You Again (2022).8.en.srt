I have only one thing to say.

Be realistic as soon as possible.

Don't dream of becoming successful all of a sudden.

The dinner I had tonight

was expensive and I'm not full.

would you like to try it?

tonight.

Don't touch this.

21
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,340
Isn't this something to withdraw money?

Why are you hiding it here?

What do you know?

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,090
This means prosperity.

Money can be generated by water.

I'm sorry.

I don't need your help.

I used to work in a western restaurant for two years.

But I got busy filming.

45

So I never did it again.

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,030
Why can't I work?

48

You only care about success.

You don't know the suffering of the mortal world.

53

The western restaurant I used to work at

54
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,100
was the biggest western restaurant in Shanghai.

55
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,750
The chef was a British.

56
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,250
He had 30 years of cooking experience.

57
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,270
If it weren't for the war,

58
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,450
he would never have come to China.

59
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,270
He taught me this.

60
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,630

61
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,070
Steamed egg with apple.

62
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,370
Steamed egg with apple?

63
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,860
Mix an egg

64
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,310
with apple puree.

65
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,700
Then steam it through water.

66
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,240
The egg will have the fragrance of apple.

68

Zhou Shu

83
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,850
must be someone special to you.

Unfortunately,

85
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,179
I returned the book.

86

Otherwise,

87

I can give it to you as a souvenir.

between you two?

91

you always tell the public you are an orphan.

93

But

94
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,410
you are not an orphan.

95
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,350
I left her when I was a teenager.

96
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,170
I learned kungfu from my master.

97
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,850
Then I became an actor.

98
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,790
It's all because of her.

99
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,110
I wondered if she would admit that I'm her son

100

when I became successful.

101

But she didn't recognize me until death.

102

The only good she did to me

103

was this steamed egg with apple.

No matter how popular I was,

142

I'm still the aunt of the male lead now.

So what?

144
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,630
So pretentious.

Even if you act as an aunt,

you're still the most eye-catching aunt.

148

But this page

150

was torn down by me accidentally.

In order to return this,

152
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,250
I was

153
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,540
fined 50 yuan.

154
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,140
You cut it well for me?

155

Today,

156
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,120
I went to Chi Yu's house

157
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,330
and met his parents.

158
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,260
Did they give you a hard time?

159
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,510
No.

160
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,590
Maybe I really don't know much about family.

161
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,840
Things like blame of parents

162
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,350
and care,

163
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,080
I've never experienced it.

164
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,070
Just like the British chef said

165
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,620
when he first came to Shanghai.

166
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,900
When he got off the ship,

167
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,870
he found a completely different world.

168
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,000
I want to help Chi Yu's parents find him.

169
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,090
How?

170
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,520
Chi Yu didn't disappear by accident.

171
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,200
He was beaten into the water.

172
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,200
By whom?

173
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,570
I suspect it is Li Longda.

174
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,870
Li Longda?

175
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,910
Aren't they friends?

176
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,420
He has a motive to do this.

177
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,620
The charger of the crew said

178
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,630
Chi Yu should have been the leading actor.

179
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,180
You mean

180
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,240
Li Longda made his friend disappear

181
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,110
for the role?

182
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,390
I'm not sure yet.

183
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,690
But one thing is for sure.

184
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,140
He lied.

185
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,200
What should we do?

186
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:24,850
Call the police?

187
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:26,880
We can't act rashly yet.

188
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,310
My goodness.

189
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,260
How many secrets

190
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,580
does Li Longda have?

191
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,970
I have an idea

192
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,000
to make Li Longda tell the truth.

193
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,540
If the murderer

194
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,420
really came to this era

195
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,620
with me,

196
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,320
he must regard Chi Yu as me.

197
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,360
Since it's my own trouble,

198
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,950
I cannot get Ayin involved again.

199
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,230
Qinyu.

200
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,750
It's just a small gift.

201
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,230
It's nothing.

202
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,840
Mr. Xiang is 24 years old, right?

203
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,160
A young talent.

204
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,140
Take it as your opening gift.

205
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,760
Wish you good luck

206
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,590
and a good business.

207
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,220
You'll be the big boss of Mengsheng.

208
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,820
If you have any opportunities of shooting,

209
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,260
remember to think of me.

210
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:24,640
Ayin,

211
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,380
we will start shooting this week.

212
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:28,880
Let me tell you.

213
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,590
Change the seventh scene

214
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,930
once more and make it better.

215
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,120
See if there's anything else to add.

216
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:37,940
Okay.

217
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,540
Director Feng.

218
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,280
Director Feng.

219
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,280
Come here.

220
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,690
What is it?

221
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,440
Last night,

222
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,670
I saw Chi Yu.

223
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,790
You really saw him come back?

224
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,820
Of course.

225
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,060
Not only did I see him,

226
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,329
I even touched him.

227
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,660
Hey, light buddies,

228
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,410
don't try the lights now.

229
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,359
Turn it off.

230
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,720
Sorry, sorry.

231
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,770
I want to say

232
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,380
if Chi Yu really comes back,

233
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,330
it's not too late to change the actor.

234
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,290
Li Longda is really...

235
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,470
I know.

236
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,280
We are thinking about the same thing, Director Feng.

237
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,620
I told him then.

238
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,130
Chi Yu,

239
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,220
come back and play the leading role for me.

240
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,310
I'll give you another chance.

241
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,510
Guess what?

242
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,650
He didn't say anything

243
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,520
before he was gone.

244
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,380
Are you sure

245
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,970
what you saw was a human?

246
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,290
How rude.

247
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,220
Could I see...

248
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,640
Stop it.

249
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,910
It's scary.

250
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,750
No.

251
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,620
I didn’t scare you.

252
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:20,930
Ayin.

253
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:22,610
Wait.

254
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,910
Flowers are for you.

255
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,190
Clean cherries are in the bag.

256
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,730
I picked them one by one.

257
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,380
You need to eat them secretly.

258
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,430
Don't let Chi Yu share them.

259
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,910
Who is Chi Yu?

260
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,360
What did you just say?

261
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:52,860
Chi what?

262
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,000
Chi Yu.

263
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,590
Hasn't he been staying at your place?

264
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,510
We met yesterday.

265
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,020
I've always been living alone.

266
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,000
You must be mistaken.

267
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,680
No.

268
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,910
He came to the crew yesterday

269
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,210
and caused trouble,

270
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,500
and even made the color powder on us.

271
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,700
You cleaned it for a long time.

272
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,140
You...

273
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,170
Have you forgotten?

274
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,470
Didn't the prop teacher

275
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,310
fall down and hit it himself?

276
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,290
Ayin,

277
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,790
are you kidding me?

278
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,050
Are you kidding me?

279
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,170
No. Not that sound.

280
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,140
The director wants to see me.

281
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,990
I'll go first.

282
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,660
Thank you for this.

283
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:41,840
You're welcome.

284
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,790
Hurry up. Hurry up.

285
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,340
Whether it is superstition or not,

286
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,220
let's finish early today and get off work early.

287
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,060
It is said that

288
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,050
there was an accident when filming here.

289
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,450
Someone was burned to death.

290
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,580
It's dark here.

291
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,220
Many wronged souls

292
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,410
can be summoned here.

293
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,490
Today

294
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,940
is the anniversary of death.

295
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,750
Don't scare me.

296
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,330
But

297
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,500
I heard from the guard

298
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:13,990
that last night

299
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,710
the crew was haunted.

300
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,960
Hello, Biao.

301
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,550
Did you...

302
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,270
Did you see Chi Yu yesterday?

303
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
The one who robbed my scene yesterday.

304
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,720
Which one?

305
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,020
Chi Yu.

306
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,280
Wasn't he missing?

307
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,040
A businessman died next door last night.

308
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,240
It was so cruel.

309
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,000
His intestines were dug out.

310
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,310
It is said

311
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,870
the Shadowless Hand did it.

312
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,410
Longda.

313
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,580
Longda.

314
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,860
Why is Li Longda running so fast?

315
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,440
Director,

316
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,070
I think

317
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,720
are the lines just now

318
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,320
too much?

319
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,550
What else do you think?

320
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,590
Ayin,

321
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,180
I’m leaving.

322
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,570
Ayin,

323
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,290
can you stay longer?

324
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,680
I have a scene later.

325
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,670
I can't leave.

326
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:31,970
It's getting dark.

327
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,730
I'm a little scared.

328
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,220
Longda.

329
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:39,950
What's wrong?

330
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,480
Maybe

331
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,260
it's haunted.

332
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,410
Longda.

333
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,090
You have to be careful today.

334
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,360
So many people died here.

335
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,240
Negative energy must be strong here.

336
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,290
I heard the vengeful spirits

337
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,930
like young men like you the most.

338
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,080
My grandma once said

339
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,530
you must be careful

340
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,080
where it is haunted.

341
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,670
Especially at midnight,

342
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,150
negative energy is the strongest.

343
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,520
Don't look into the mirror,

344
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,050
or you'll be possessed.

345
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,730
I'll go back now.

346
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,970
In the dark night,

347
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,960
Xiang Qinyu, who is afraid of the dark,

348
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,790
came back home alone.

349
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,620
He found

350
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,340
someone seemed to come to the room earlier.

351
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,100
He carefully opened the curtains.

352
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,940
Xiang Qinyu walked into the bathroom.

353
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,900
Before he left,

354
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,370
he looked at himself in the mirror.

355
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,180
Suddenly,

356
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,650
the bell in the living room

357
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,530
rang for twelve.

358
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,020
No way.

359
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,590
The thing under the bed is...

360
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,340
Help!

361
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,130
Help!

362
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,480
Ayin, help!

363
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,160
Finally, there is someone.

364
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,940
Are you from the crew?

365
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,890
Water.

366
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,880
You killed me.

367
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,520
You are the murderer.

368
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,350
I didn't kill you.

369
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,730
You killed me.

370
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,790
I just saw it.

371
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,940
I saw someone else there.

372
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:43,770
I didn't mean it.

373
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,320
It wasn't me.

374
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,970
So you can tell the truth.

375
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,370
You saw it.

376
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,830
And then?

377
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:29,640
That day,

378
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,650
after talking to Hu,

379
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,020
I noticed you didn't come back for a long time.

380
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,420
So I went out to find you.

381
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,610
Lied to me again.

382
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,680
Chi... Chi Yu.

383
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,300
One with a hat.

384
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,100
Nothing else.

385
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:30,810
That's all?

386
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,970
I really didn't see the face clearly.

387
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:34,730
Maybe

388
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,990
as tall as me.

389
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,140
I really don't know anything else.

390
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,280
Trust me.

391
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,230
Why didn't you tell me before?

392
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,120
I was so scared.

393
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,810
I'm sorry, Chi Yu. I...

394
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,860
I saw you asking for help.

395
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,840
I didn't come out to stop him.

396
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,460
I'm sorry.

397
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,110
Then I asked you what happened that day.

398
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,080
Why did you lie again?

399
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,840
I'm afraid you won't forgive me

400
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,230
if you know it.

401
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,820
Isn't it because you want to be the leading actor?

402
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,060
I...

403
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,730
I really...

404
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,560
At that moment, I did think of that.

405
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,250
But I regret it very much after that.

406
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,420
I thought about calling the police

407
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,300
and telling the police

408
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,730
everything I saw.

409
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,880
But I didn't see that guy's face clearly.

410
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,640
Trust me.

411
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,350
Chi Yu.

412
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:56,880
I'm sorry.

413
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,550
Please forgive me.

414
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,760
While you were missing,

415
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,080
I blamed myself every day.

416
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,090
I've thought about it.

417
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,870
If you cannot come back,

418
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,480
I will be filial to your parents

419
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,090
and make up for everything I can.

420
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,440
But as long as you come back,

421
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,910
I'll give you whatever you want.

422
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,670
You can beat me or scold me.

423
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,500
I can take it.

424
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,650
How about you hit me now?

425
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,530
Hit me now.

426
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,930
Hit me. Hit me.

427
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,010
Don't touch me.

428
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,580
Take a seat.

429
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,400
So Chi Yu,

430
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,280
you really forgive me?

431
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,940
I have another question for you.

432
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,790
If you dare lie to me,

433
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,200
I...

434
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,620
I dare not.

435
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,110
Go ahead.

436
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,640
Do you know this person?

437
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,270
Taotao?

438
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,090
Who is Taotao?

439
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,600
She was the makeup artist of our crew.

440
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,330
What happened

441
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,290
after that?

442
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,600
She suddenly disappeared.

443
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,090
She made up for me before.

444
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,760
Can you help me find her?

445
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:05,950
[The world is so tiny like the settings of one street.]

446
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:05,950
[This one is finished and another one happens.]

447
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,940
[Sweet On]

448
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,940
[See You Again]

449
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,940
[Exclusively on iQIYI]

450
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,540
What did this stupid woman prepare?

451
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,050
Hello?

452
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:58,910
Hello?

453
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,590
Chi Yu.

454
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,310
You guys will be fine since you're close with Long.

455
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,700
But if he knows...

456
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,370
even I cheated him,

457
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,850
he won't let me go.

458
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,860
Your boss loves playing games.

459
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:11,940
He won’t blame you.

460
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,610
Don't worry, Bi.

461
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:15,210
Biao.

462
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,870
My name is Biao.
