00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,789
Ayin.

5
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,620
Shush!

6
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,330
Are you done?

7
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,240
Ayin.

8
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,020
You came at the right time.

9
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,580
Mom.

10
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,080
Why are you here?

11
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,600
Mom?

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,560
Ayin!

13
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:06,670
Ayin!

14
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:07,850
Ayin!

00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,060
Ayin!

16
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,500
You think it's funny?

17
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,540
Do you all think I'm stupid?

18
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,720
Yes, I'm stupid.

19
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,430
No.

20
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,579
I just think you are very cute

21
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,800
when you think like this.

22
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,500
No.

23
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:21,980
I...

24
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,900
I wanted to explain to you

25
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,770
in a few days.

26
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,420
I thought you really...

27
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,970
-I just said those words to your mom. You... -Baby.

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,480
I don't even know

29
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,680
my daughter-in-law's name.

30
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,060
Mom.

31
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:51,910
Mr. Chi.

32
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,060
Please choose your clothes.

33
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,340
What kind of clothes are these?

34
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,100
Xiang Qinyu lived in the 1930s.

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,590
How could he have these clothes at that time?

36
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,520
Take them away.

37
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:13,890
Chi Yu.

38
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,890
I can see it.

39
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:19,300
What?

40
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,820
You

41
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,000
are jealous.

42
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,120
Me?

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,680
Who am I jealous of?

44
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,270
Stop pretending.

45
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,140
I knew it

46
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:34,940
when I first saw you.

47
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,970
You

48
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,250
like Jin Ayin.

49
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,180
I like her?

50
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,860
Impossible.

51
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,010
There's no way I'd fall in love with a dwarf like her.

52
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,740
Back then,

53
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,860
when I was at filming sites,

54
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,380
so many pretty girls chased me around.

55
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,120
But I didn't fall in love with anyone.

56
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,140
How could I like her?

57
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,210
Impossible.

58
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,210
Fine.

59
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,790
Just think of it as my misunderstanding.

60
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,210
Yes.

61
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,890
You said I like her.

62
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,380
You

63
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,500
think too much.

64
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,610
It must be like that.

65
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,460
Xiaoxiao.

66
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,380
Let's go.

67
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,820
Let's go somewhere else.

68
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,020
The air here smells like vinegar.

69
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,690
Wait.

70
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:19,980
Am I

71
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,140
really

72
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,410
jealous?

73
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,430
If Xiang Qinyu came here,

74
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,380
he would definitely say this place is dirty

75
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,409
and messy.

76
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,970
He even called me a stingy person.

77
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,450
You don't know how annoying he was today.

78
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,740
He bullied Li Longda

79
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,090
and flirted with Teng Xi.

80
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,540
Jin Ayin,

81
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,440
what does it have to do with you?

82
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,460
No matter what he did at the filming site,

83
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,120
it has nothing to do with you.

84
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,170
You said you wanted to focus on your career yesterday.

85
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,180
How could you forget

86
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,690
after just one night?

87
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,290
I'm impressed, baby.

88
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,340
We have so much food, but you still won't stop talking.

89
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,340
What's the big deal?

90
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,110
Take it easy.

91
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,550
There are so many men in the world.

92
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,020
Why do you have to look for trouble?

93
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,640
I'm happy today.

94
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,380
Let me show you something.

95
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,250
A special drink for today:

96
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,740
Don't go home tonight.

97
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,860
I made this specially for my prince charming.

98
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,460
Didn't you say

99
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,720
you don't have a relationship with Chi Yu?

100
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,710
I'm not talking about you.

101
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,640
My prince charming will be back soon.

102
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,140
Now,

103
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,770
I'm just asking you to

104
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,060
try it.

105
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,170
Here.

106
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:20,580
Try it.

107
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,240
I did that for her own good.

108
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,910
Stupid woman.

109
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,720
Bah!

110
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,280
Stupid man.

111
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,880
You don't understand women.

112
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,770
Although I don't understand her,

113
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,930
I have my reasons.

114
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,980
I think you are

115
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,310
self-righteous.

116
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,520
Women are simple.

117
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,030
Women like you

118
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
for who you are.

119
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,670
Just be a cool guy.

120
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,140
You don't have to do anything else

121
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,890
or say anything else.

122
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,130
Just like this hero

123
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,090
in my heart.

124
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,420
He

125
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,470
has a free soul

126
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,110
and is brave enough to deal with a relationship.

127
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,660
Except for not liking me,

128
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,050
he is perfect.

129
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,010
But this is not his problem.

130
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,720
It's my problem.

131
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,840
Teng Xi said

132
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,600
the boy she likes doesn't like her worldly life.

133
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:45,900
Do you think

134
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,940
that boy is you?

135
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:50,740
So,

136
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,440
it's not

137
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,260
Chi Yu in this photo?

138
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,570
You don't know

139
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,950
if it's you?

140
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,130
Then why do you keep pestering me?

141
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,050
I'm bored.

142
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,780
Besides,

143
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,260
you

144
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,030
are just one of my male friends.

145
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,980
How can you compare yourself with my prince charming?

146
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,960
Master is right.

147
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,140
A woman's heart

148
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:33,990
is a deep ocean of secrets.

149
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,299
A man's heart

150
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,309
can never be figured out.

151
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,450
I chose not to tell you for your own good.

152
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,380
My heart

153
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,020
has always been with you.

154
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,470
I...

155
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,980
There is no way I have a crush on her.

156
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,220
Impossible.

157
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,130
But why

158
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,250
doesn't he like me?

159
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
Look.

160
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,600
She must be troubled by love

161
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,900
and is drowning sorrows.

162
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,640
A lover gets drunk on

163
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,860
a drop of tears.

164
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,500
A sentimental heart

165
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,100
breaks at the touch of it.

166
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,170
Everyone gets drunk

167
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,420
on love.

168
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,630
She's an epitome of you,

169
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,460
Jin Ayin.

170
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,190
I'm done eating.

171
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,620
The bill, please.

172
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,060
What happened?

173
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,170
Are you hurt?

174
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,270
I'm fine.

175
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,630
Who is this?

176
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,260
Listen, Ayin.

177
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,060
If Chi Yu gets drunk like this

178
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,400
and calls you,

179
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,360
don't answer it

180
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,460
if you are still a proud girl, okay?

181
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,220
I'm telling you.

182
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,590
I'm definitely more proud than you think.

183
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,180
Let's go.

184
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,010
That's right. Let's go.

185
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,170
Go.

186
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,260
Slowly.

187
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:09,900
Be careful.

188
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,020
Hello?

189
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,500
Hello.

190
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,260
Chi Yu

191
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,290
is drunk.

192
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,250
Come and pick him up.

193
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,940
Who is Chi Yu?

194
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,530
I don't know him.

195
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,850
Teng Xi.

196
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,460
Teng...

197
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,720
Are you coming or not?

198
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,330
I... I'm coming.

199
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,790
I... I'm coming.

200
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,230
You

201
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,770
are not a proud person at all.

202
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,600
You drank too much.

203
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,680
Are you okay going back alone?

204
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,470
Women don't drink wine that is ordinary.

205
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,270
Women who drink wine

206
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,830
are not ordinary.

207
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,060
It's not even a problem if I need to come here again.

208
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,080
Bye.

209
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,180
Call me when you get home.

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,170
Call me, Ye.

211
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,260
Screenwriter.

212
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,450
I'll take Xi home.

213
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,470
Chi Yu.

214
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,330
This's all that I can do for you today.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,940
Be careful.

216
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,650
Be careful.

217
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,860
Hello.

218
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,270
We're closing.

219
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,600
Who will pay the bill?

220
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,780
RMB 987?

221
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,340
Are you trying to rip me off?

222
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,300
Take a look.

223
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,020
Xiang Qinyu.

224
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,320
Wake up.

225
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,630
If you don't leave, I'm leaving.

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Don't go.

227
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,910
Didn't you say you only watched my movies when you were little?

228
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,680
Why did you change your mind so soon?

229
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:28,850
Let's go.

230
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,550
Ayin.

231
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,420
You're here.

232
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,820
You're not mad at me anymore?

233
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,460
You mocked me before.

234
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,100
You can't drink too much, either.

235
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,530
No.

236
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,660
I'm still angry.

237
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,330
I'll ignore you.

238
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,660
Ignore you.

239
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,420
Let's go.

240
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,170
How did you get hurt?

241
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,110
How dare you ask?

242
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,320
It's all because of you.

243
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,910
What are you doing?

244
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,400
♫Put your photos in my phone♫

Why did he suddenly decide to live in your house?

He kept saying he wants to come here.

It's not convenient for him to go back to his home.

00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,840
Why?

309
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,410
I can't tell you.

310
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,960
It's our secret.

I didn't promise you.

I've bought the tickets.

Enough.

321
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,000
Just take him upstairs.

322
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,410
Hurry up.

323
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,480
Why are you standing there?

324
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,470
Why did he drink so much?

325
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,600
Wake up.

326
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,070
Help him out first.

327
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:06,890
Hold him.

328

Why is he so heavy?

329
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,470
Be careful.

Slowly.

331
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,440
He lost a shoe. Carry him steadily.

Slowly.

333
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:24,810

00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,410
Here.

346
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,670
I'm not drinking it.

347
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,849
Longda.

348
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,060
Longda.

349
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,569
What's wrong?

350
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,380
I'll leave him to you.

351
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,460
I should go.

352
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,900
Remember to leave him a lamp.

353
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,000
Okay.

354
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,700
Is he allergic to alcohol and dead?

355
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,290
What are you doing?

356
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,010
I thought you passed out.

357
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,640
How did I get back yesterday?

358
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,130
Why do I feel so painful all over the body?

359
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,620
I didn't beat you.

360
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,250
Jin Ayin sent you back.

361
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,460
Ayin?

362
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,580
Take me back to the crew.

363
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,700
I have work in the afternoon.

364
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,120
But I don't.

365
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,900
I'm almost your driver.

366
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,090
Can't you take a taxi?

367
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,420
No.

368
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,430
Jin Ayin has never let me go out alone.

369
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,100
But I'm not her.

370
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,450
Get up and have breakfast.

371
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,650
You had a hangover and should have breakfast.

372
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,440
Just get up.

373
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,480
Eat.

374
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:10,890
You

375
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,960
didn't put poison in it, right?

376
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,030
If I wanted to do that, you would have been dead

377
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,290
when you were in school.

378
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,020
How is it?

379
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,380
Tomorrow,

380
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,180
I'll prepare one for Ayin.

381
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,330
She will like it.

382
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,690
What is this?

383
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,740
It tastes terrible.

384
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,520
What's wrong with you?

385
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,210
You always think it's delicious.

386
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,610
I asked my friend to deliver this

387
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,240
from Australia.

388
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,130
I want Ayin

389
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,760
to gain more nutrition.

390
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,890
What's wrong?

391
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,920
This doesn't suit me.

392
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,740
I'd better drink this to moisten my throat.

393
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,840
It suits me better.

394
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,040
You're ignorant.

395
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,920
Teng Xi,

396
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,680
are you ready?

397
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,860
Yes, director.

398
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,700
Okay, let's get started.

399
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,370
Scene 20, Shot 1, Take 1.

400
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,030
Okay.

401
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:32,570
Three.

402
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,660
Two.

403
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,700
One.

404
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,890
Action.

405
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,500
Cut. Director.

406
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
The sound is not good.

407
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,260
What's going on? Get someone to check it out.

408
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,630
Nobody stood up. Who wants to check it out?

409
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,470
Jin Abao.

410
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,850
I knew it was you.

411
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,740
Sister.

412
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,140
Why are you here?

413
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,670
Move this stupid motorbike away.

414
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,100
Or I'll call the traffic police.

415
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,680
I'm here for a friend.

416
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,240
Why didn't you contact me?

417
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,150
Do you know

418
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,560
how many times I called you?

419
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,820
Your phone was either dead or had no signal.

420
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,180
I thought you were dead.

421
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,620
Sister,

422
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,170
there's no signal in the mountains.

423
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,200
Even if there's no signal,

424
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,460
why didn't you call me

425
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,260
with a landline phone to report your safety?

426
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,030
Do you know...

427
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,730
Do you know how many times grandma asked about you?

428
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,970
Can you be mature?

429
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,010
I was taking pictures of a brown bear in the mountains.

430
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,640
Do I look like a bear to you?

431
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,380
I didn't mean that, sister.

432
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,550
I was busy with the photography exhibition as soon as I came back.

433
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,690
I'm not busy today.

434
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,030
The photography exhibition?

435
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,860
So you are still unemployed now?

436
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,230
Come here.

437
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,940
Sister.

438
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:50,880
Sister.

439
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,060
Sister.

440
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,220
Let go of me.

441
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,050
Jin Abao, let me go!

442
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,100
Call me Jin Chuan.

443
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,090
Stop calling me Abao.

444
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,580
-Go away! -How many times have I told you?

445
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,740
You! Let go!

446
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:03,620
Let go!

447
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,080
No.

448
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,760
Let go!

449
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,610
-Jin Ayin. -No.

450
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,170
Let go of me!

451
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,050
-I... -Let go!

452
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,100
What are you doing?

453
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,810
Xiang Qinyu, what are you doing?

454
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,180
I'm beating him.

455
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,900
Who are you?

456
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,720
Why did you beat me?

457
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,960
Why not?

458
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,250
Were you molesting her

459
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,560
in broad daylight?

460
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,670
It's not what you think.

461
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:25,840
Chi Yu.

462
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,200
Why did you beat him?

463
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:27,980
I...

464
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,410
Are you okay?

465
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:29,950
I'm fine.

466
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,480
He's my brother.

467
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,060
How could Chi Yu beat you?

468
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,600
It's okay.

469
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,260
Just a misunderstanding.

470
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,970
Is Jin Ayin

471
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,250
really your sister?

472
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,460
Of course.

473
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,650
Then why did I never hear you say

474
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:14,920
that you have a sister?

475
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,350
I didn't expect to run into her.

476
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,760
I planned to visit her after seeing you.

477
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,250
But I ran into her first.

478
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,240
This is Abao?

479
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:36,760
How did they

480
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,650
know each other?

481
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,170
He has really grown up.

482
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,500
He even knows how to pursue a girl.

483
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,360
By the way,

484
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,760
I'm here to thank you.

485
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,500
I received a call from the exhibition center.

486
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,100
Really?

487
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,650
That's great.

488
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,960
I was worried that it couldn't be done.

489
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,820
I must thank them.

490
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,660
Xi.

491
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,540
I appreciate your help

492
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,990
on behalf of my team.

493
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,980
But it's too expensive.

494
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,190
That place is too good

495
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,220
for our photography exhibition.

496
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,290
Didn't they tell you?

497
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:17,910
You don't need to pay for it.

498
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,380
Don't worry.

499
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,620
I've arranged everything.

500
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,660
They did.

501
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,660
But

502
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,140
I don't know how to return the favor.

503
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,660
Xi,

504
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,860
I know

505
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,460
people have to make a reservation for the exhibition center at least a year in advance,

506
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,870
so that they can get a schedule.

507
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,950
You must have asked for help from many people.

508
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,380
Then why did you refuse?

509
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,680
That's why

510
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,910
I have to refuse.

511
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,850
By the way,

512
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,270
this is a ticket to my photography exhibition.

513
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,170
You must come if you have time.

514
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,100
I'm here today

515
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,400
to tell you

516
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,260
I'm grateful for everything you've done for me.

517
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,610
But I can't...

518
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,220
I know.

519
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,610
You've rejected me many times.

520
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,000
By the way,

521
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,640
where did you

522
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,680
go this time?

523
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,340
Shigatse.

524
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,360
Nice.

525
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,810
I hope I can

526
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,630
go to those places with you next time.

527
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,630
You don't need to feel burdened.

528
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,710
Actually, I did all that

529
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,660
because I was happy.

530
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,570
But if you feel uncomfortable,

531
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,220
just don't accept it.

532
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,620
But you can't stop me from doing it.

533
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,120
Xi, what I meant is...

534
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,810
How about this?

535
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,090
Take another set of photos for me

536
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,100
next time when you take pictures on location

537
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,020
to return the favor.

538
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,180
Here.

539
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:09,870
Long time no see.

540
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,500
Cheers.

541
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,820
What are you doing?

542
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
That's not what decent people do.

543
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,300
Keep your voice down.

544
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,600
Is beating someone what decent people do?

545
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,200
I thought he was molesting you.

546
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,680
He's my brother.

547
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,940
So he is the big fish.

548
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,240
Keep your voice down.

549
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,640
What big fish?

550
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,390
Last night,

551
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,540
Teng Xi told me

552
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,520
there was a fish that refused to enter the net.

553
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,350
She couldn't catch it.

554
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,040
I don't understand what you're talking about.

555
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,420
Anyway,

556
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,080
last night,

557
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,720
I found there was over RMB 1,000 less in my wallet.

558
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,220
Did you take it?

559
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,200
I...

560
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,550
RMB 1,000. Here is the change.

561
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,400
You drank too much.

562
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,940
It cost over RMB 900.

563
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,020
Don't forget that

564
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,110
you still owe me so much money.

565
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,730
You can't let me pay for that.

566
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,590
What about the remaining RMB 200?

567
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,870
I need to take a taxi home, right?

568
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,720
Don't you know how expensive it is to take a taxi at night?

569
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,480
You have no common sense.

570
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,430
I didn't ask you to come.

571
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,160
It's my wishful thinking, OK?

572
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,500
If I pick you up again,

573
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,920
I'll change my name into Xiang Ayin.

574
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,560
That's him.

575
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,050
Shut down the engine.

576
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,690
I told you to shut it down.

577
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,040
Are you scared?

578
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,210
I've never done this before.

579
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,020
I'm worried that if we got caught,

580
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,180
would...

581
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,860
I knew you're a coward.

582
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,960
You carried a laptop everyday.

583
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:32,910
After so many years,

584
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,270
You haven't improved at all.

585
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,020
Don't worry.

586
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,260
We just came here to check it out.

587
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:38,860
We are not doing it today.

588
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,500
Okay.

589
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,180
Put it on.

590
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,730
Hao,

591
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,990
I have a question for you.

592
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,880
Do you have any trouble

593
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,980
with Chi Yu?

594
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,870
Take this.

595
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,040
Make sure your high-tech devices will actually work.

596
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,990
Otherwise, you won't get a penny.

597
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,920
Where did you

598
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,890
get this key?

599
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,460
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

600
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,250
I'm sorry.

601
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,060
Chi Yu really lost his memory?

602
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,280
I don't think he's pretending.

603
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,890
He doesn't remember anything.

604
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,010
He doesn't know anything.

605
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,080
I want to see

606
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,310
whether you really lost your memory or not.

607
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,840
Put the stuff here.

608
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:48,790
Xiao Yue.

609
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,550
These things are not right.

610
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,880
How come?

611
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,110
It doesn't match what's on the warehouse list.

612
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,630
Computers, flowers,

613
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,230
toilets, sofas, and tables.

614
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,070
Okay.

615
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:58,980
Go back first.

616
00:29:59,010 --> 00:29:59,690
I'll check it out later.

617
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,310
Okay.

618
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,920
Where is that guy?

619
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,200
If I meddle in your business again, I'll take your surname.

620
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:01,910
Where's my cup?

621
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,470
Yu.

622
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:57,800
[Destiny]

623
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:57,800
[is just what follows after you make every choice.]
