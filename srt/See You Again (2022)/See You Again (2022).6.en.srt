00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,370
What's that sound?

5
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,080
Don't move.

6
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,960
Well...

7
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:06,880
Well...

8
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,470
They are decorating downstairs.

9
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,820
The sound insulation is bad.

10
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:11,760
They are decorating downstairs.

11
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,470
I'll go take a look.

12
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,090
Don't move.

13
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,320
Shush.

14
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,780
Jin Ayin.

15
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,829
I...

16
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,350
They are decorating downstairs,

17
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,990
and my floor is almost broken.

18
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,040
Stop pretending and come out.

19
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,160
I can hear a man.

20
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,260
You actually locked the door, Jin Ayin.

21
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:54,730
Hurry.

22
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,240
I'm coming.

23
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,120
Wait.

24
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,190
I've been through this.

25
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,710
You don't need to do this.

26
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,090
What do you mean?
[K💖I💖S💖S💖K💖H]

27
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,220
I said no one is here.

28
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,460
No one?

29
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,440
Why don't you believe me?

30
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,630
You can stop searching.

31
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,640
It's too messy up there.

32
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,750
There's nothing.

33
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,420
It's just stuff and books.

34
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,900
How do you explain this?

35
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,180
Jin Abao.

36
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,980
My brother, Jin Abao.

37
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,029
He...

38
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,650
stayed here for a day last week.

39
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,800
I didn't have time to clean up.

40
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,150
No one is here.

41
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,300
What's that for?

42
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,320
I...

43
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,060
My clothes are dry.

44
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,020
Good for you, Jin Ayin.

45
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,630
I'm impressed.

46
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,700
Such a handsome guy...

47
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,360
Such a gorgeous man.

48
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,680
It's OK if you don't want to share him with me.

49
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,150
But you didn't even tell me.

50
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,159
What's going on?

51
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,080
Pretty boy.

52
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,880
Let me introduce myself.

53
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:47,909
Jian Ye.

54
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,620
J-I-A-N.

55
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,950
Y-E.

56
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,280
What's your name?

57
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,100
-Jin Abao. -Xiang Qinyu.

58
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,750
If I say

59
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,070
my brother Jin Abao

60
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,060
looks like this now,

61
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,750
do you believe it?

62
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,020
He said he's Xiang Qinyu.

63
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,920
It's as ridiculous as you said

64
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,500
he's Jin Abao.

65
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,620
Actually, I...

66
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,910
Actually, I rented Miss Jin's house.

67
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,150
I live here temporarily.

68
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:33,810
Yes.

69
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:34,800
A tenant.

70
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,980
Is he a liar?

71
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,550
Are you trying to

72
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,860
win both her and money

73
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,690
just because you look like Ayin's idol?

74
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,860
No.

75
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,610
He...

76
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,960
I can't explain it to you right now.

77
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,240
Fine.

78
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,950
You are adults.

79
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,600
Just don't cross the line.

80
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,100
How would we

81
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,730
cross the line?

82
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,880
Fine.

83
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,120
I can see what's going on.

84
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,250
I'm leaving.

85
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,920
You two get along well with each other.

86
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,830
Come here.

87
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,670
This man is good.

88
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,360
This one is really good.

89
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,490
Thin waist, long legs,

90
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,620
broad shoulders and sexy hips.

91
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,370
He's amazing.

92
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,700
Here, this is for you.

93
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,340
What is this?

94
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,909
This is a love amulet.

95
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,880
A master gave it to me when I went down south.

96
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:42,940
You secretly

97
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,920
put this

98
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,830
into his personal clothes

99
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,320
to feel the magnetic field.

100
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,530
After 49 days,

101
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,570
at a full-moon night,

102
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,600
Yin and Yang are intertwined.

103
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,000
You two will definitely work.

104
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,360
This is my trump card.

105
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,890
I'm giving it to you now.

106
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,800
Bye.

107
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,070
Jin Ayin.

108
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,590
Are you ready?

109
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,660
Remember.

110
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,830
Keep your body straight

111
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,760
and

112
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,380
eyes sharp.

113
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,710
Excuse me.

114
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,620
Smoke and fire producers.

115
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,500
Stop! Stop!

116
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,280
There's enough smoke.

117
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,910
But Yu,

118
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,040
why are you here?

119
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,550
I need to investigate Li Longda myself.

120
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,500
I'm sure I'll find something about Chi Yu.

121
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,400
Let's go.

122
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,640
Come here. You come here.

123
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,440
You go over there.

124
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,350
Come here.

125
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,690
You guys come with me.

126
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,640
The screenwriter?

127
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,180
Here.

128
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,100
Come here.

129
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,240
Yu, I'll go over there.

130
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,180
Don't move.

131
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,620
Come on.

132
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,180
There's one more this time.

133
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,060
A new piece of paper.

134
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,750
Is the prop team ready?

135
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,330
These are for filming?

136
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,680
Right.

137
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,330
People can be pulled off the ground with wire ropes.

138
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,350
Why didn't I think of that?

139
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,220
Real kung fu is more reliable.

140
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,030
Didn't I tell you not to move?

141
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:58,850
Yu.

142
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,140
They just called me a screenwriter.

143
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:01,880
Miss Jin.

144
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:02,820
What do you think

145
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,490
I should name my future studio?

146
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,770
How about Golden Twinkle Studio?

147
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,270
No.

148
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,330
Wolverine?

149
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,110
That's not good.

150
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,050
Jin Ayin?

151
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,180
Honeysuckle?

152
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:17,820
Golden Flowers?

153
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,830
No.

154
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,410
Jin Youqian.

155
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,400
Yu.

156
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,620
Don't touch it.

157
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,280
Tell me.

158
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,630
Why are cameras so small nowadays?

159
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,870
Where do they put a photographic film?

160
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,840
How long can it last?

161
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,830
I don't know.

162
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,770
Maybe six or seven hours.

163
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,010
Six or seven hours?

164
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,540
Do they have a death wish?

165
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,230
Do you know how easily a photographic film gets on fire?

166
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,580
Don't touch it.

167
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,750
What are you doing?

168
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,620
Sorry.

169
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,600
Which division are you in?

170
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,000
I told you not to touch it.

171
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:58,770
Let's go.

172
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,280
I didn't expect that the Chinese film industry

173
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,870
has developed so quickly.

174
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,270
I feel relieved.

175
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,710
Jin Ayin.

176
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,450
Your generation

177
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,060
is better than I thought.

178
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,810
Stubborn.

179
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,560
You...

180
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,300
Come with me.

181
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,280
I've found out that Li Longda is right ahead.

182
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,390
Let's go find him.

183
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,390
Okay, that's it.

184
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,010
Stop talking nonsense.

185
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,560
Bye.

186
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:28,970
How's it?

187
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,310
Director Feng,

188
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,260
do you still want to use Chi Yu?

189
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:34,890
But

190
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,900
we can't find him now.

191
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,130
We can't stop filming.

192
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,160
Then we don't have to use Li Longda.

193
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,150
Let me tell you the truth.

194
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,830
Our project started in a hurry.

195
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,980
The company doesn't have so much money.

196
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,190
If he didn't invest,

197
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,180
I wouldn't have brought him

198
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,770
to your team, right?

199
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,370
If I knew this,

200
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,810
I would've cooperated with another company.

201
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,800
Don't, Director Feng.

202
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,290
Don't be angry.

203
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,710
Even if it's not for me,

204
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,560
you should think about Mumu, right?

205
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,420
Calm down.

206
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,760
What's more, when Li Longda comes,

207
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,710
you can make some adjustments.

208
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,330
It's not a big problem.

209
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,450
All right.

210
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:08,950
Well.

211
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,440
You tell that new screenwriter Jin

212
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,030
to revise

213
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,210
the teasers

214
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,220
quickly.

215
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,230
Okay, no problem.

216
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,970
Don't worry.

217
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,960
Thank you very much.

218
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,320
Excuse me,

219
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,030
where is Mr. Li Longda?

220
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,320
In that tent.

221
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:36,830
Thank you.

222
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,070
Stop touching it.

223
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,380
Li Longda is in that tent.

224
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,570
I have something

225
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,390
to do.

226
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,260
Go find him yourself.

227
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,100
I won't accompany you.

228
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,720
Don't touch anything.

229
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,020
Don't touch anything.

230
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,100
Why are you here?

231
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,600
Come in.

232
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,390
Come in.

233
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,990
Come in.

234
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,640
Come here.

235
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,550
Have a seat.

236
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,630
Sit down.

237
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,440
Why do you touch me every time you see me?

238
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,450
I'm just wondering

239
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,420
why you didn't tell me you'll be here.

240
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,050
Why should I?

241
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,170
Are you afraid of me being here?

242
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,210
No.

243
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,860
I just think there are so many people.

244
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,510
You just get better and you'd better not get hurt again.

245
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,130
Don't touch me.

246
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,260
I'm here

247
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,700
to ask you something.

248
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,830
Tuotuo.

249
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,360
Come here.

250
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,320
What? Why do we have to come here?

251
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,860
I saw goji in your cup

252
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,180
and brought you some.

253
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,890
This is for you.

254
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,180
Ningxia goji.

255
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,820
You know me.

256
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,430
Thank you.

257
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,540
By the way,

258
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,510
this is the teaser clip.

259
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,180
It was revised yesterday.

260
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,270
I'll give it to the director immediately.

261
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,380
Thank you.

262
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,790
-It's not a big deal. -Thank you.

263
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,700
Bye.

264
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,100
Where's the screenwriter?

265
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,500
Which one is the new screenwriter?

266
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,060
Here.

267
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,210
I am.

268
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,120
-You? -Yes.

269
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,830
I think she's just a little girl.

270
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,370
This is your first time in a crew, right?

271
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,470
Did you change my actions?

272
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,590
You really got something.

273
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,120
No.

274
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,960
I did a competitive presentation.

275
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,010
With this rubbish you wrote?

276
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,720
Tell me.

277
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,890
What do the front stance

278
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,670
and trespassing the gates with domination mean?

279
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,690
I know every character,

280
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,040
but I just don't understand what they mean when they are together as a phrase.

281
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,190
Are they acrobatics?

282
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,060
Right.

283
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,450
-You're making a fool of us. -Sorry.

284
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,540
If you think it is inappropriate,

285
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,990
I'll revise it.

286
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,480
No need.

287
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,630
You can just show us.

288
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,580
-Show us. -Show us.

289
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,540
Show us.

290
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,670
-Show us. -Show us.

291
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,470
Come on.

292
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,060
-Show us. -Show us.

293
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,010
Come on.

294
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,150
Show us.

295
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,270
I can't.

296
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,830
Show us the front stance.

297
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,580
I really can't do it.

298
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,640
I'll revise it, OK?

299
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,560
Revise what?

300
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,400
What do you mean?

301
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,210
Nothing.

302
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,630
What do you mean by nothing?

303
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,700
Are you okay?

304
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,099
Then why don't you stand up?

305
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,260
Let go!

306
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,650
Why are you dressing like this?

307
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:23,880
Who are you?

308
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,430
Who the hell are you?

309
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,100
It's easy.

310
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,320
What?

311
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,580
Actors nowadays

312
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,920
are as useless as you?

313
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,780
Who do you think you are?

314
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,740
Show me.

315
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,650
If you can do it,

316
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,240
I'll let you have my role.

317
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,790
Sorry.

318
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,660
We should go.

319
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,620
Go.

320
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,350
Okay.

321
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,080
This is trespassing the gates with domination.

322
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,030
Do you understand?

323
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,790
Brother.

324
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,300
Who else wants to fight?

325
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,490
I'm right here.

326
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,200
No. That's enough.

327
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,400
Go get him.

328
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,400
Enough. That's impressive.

329
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,170
Dismiss.

330
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,450
Dismiss.

331
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,750
Tuotuo.

332
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,300
Tuotuo.

333
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,470
Not bad, young man.

334
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,660
I'm impressed.

335
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,340
But which short-sighted guy

336
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,980
dressed you like an extra?

337
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,640
You should join the action team.

338
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,100
Li Longda.

339
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,130
You are from the male lead's team.

340
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,840
Right, screenwriter.

341
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,420
I've given the USB to the director.

342
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,710
The director said it's okay.

343
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,780
The test shooting is about to start.

344
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,690
I'll go and get ready.

345
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,790
Okay.

346
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,080
Why are you dressing like this?

347
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,690
Didn't you go to see Li Longda?

348
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,510
Where is he?

349
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,520
He went shooting.

350
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,600
He said Chi Yu offended a lot of people.

351
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,600
He told me to wear this

352
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,660
to avoid being recognized.

353
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,200
Li Longda always said something irrelevant

354
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,010
and didn't answer my questions directly.

355
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,090
He shouldn't be a good person.

356
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,050
Don't think too badly of him.

357
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,230
You're weird.

358
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,890
Have you been bribed by him?

359
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,290
Everyone looks like a bad guy to you, huh?

360
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,050
All right, I'm done talking to you.

361
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,300
The test shooting is about to start.

362
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:47,990
I'll go there.

363
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,770
Can't I go?

364
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,800
Longda.

365
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,010
How is it?

366
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:56,850
Director.

367
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,410
I'm fine. Let's do it.

368
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,100
No need for a rehearsal?

369
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,720
No need.

370
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,070
Everything is under control.

371
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:04,970
OK.

372
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,360
All right. Everyone, get ready.

373
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,500
Start recording.

374
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,850
Action.

375
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:10,810
Clapperboard.

376
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,620
Scene 3, Shot 1, Take 1.

377
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,450
Three, two, one.

378
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,350
Action.

379
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,660
All of you, stop!

380
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,090
You're not getting away!

381
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,690
No emotions.

382
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:27,780
Today...

383
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,510
Lower your voice.

384
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,840
None of you...

385
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,710
None of you...

386
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,980
None of you...

387
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,950
His performance is awkward.

388
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,390
You are professional.

389
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,400
Cut.

390
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,370
Didn't you say everything is under control?

391
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,810
Sorry, director.

392
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,660
One more time.

393
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,340
No need.

394
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,750
Get ready.

395
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,550
Start recording.

396
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,020
Clapperboard.

397
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,570
Scene 3, Shot 1, Take 2.

398
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,650
Come on. Three, two, one.

399
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,590
Action.

400
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,900
All of you, stop!

401
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,480
You're not getting away!

402
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,020
Today,

403
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,920
none of you

404
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,910
can escape.

405
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:25,840
Sister,

406
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,220
our big brother and I are here to save you.

407
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,230
Don't...

408
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:34,940
Don't...

409
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,820
-Cut. -Don't...

410
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,110
This is a good story.

411
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,680
But you found a fool for me.

412
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,260
How can we continue filming?

413
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,660
Any one of them is better than him.

414
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,780
Director, don't be angry. Let's...

415
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,340
How about this?

416
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,080
We can ask him to say numbers.

417
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,730
Why do they let him say numbers?

418
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,590
Say numbers

419
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,850
-instead of lines. -OK. Ready.

420
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,120
-Action. -Later,

421
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,960
-they'll find a dubber to read the lines. -All of you, stop.

422
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,070
No.

423
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,020
How can they do that?

424
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,730
Longda,

425
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,900
you can just say one, two, three, four, five.

426
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,030
We'll find a dubber later. Come on.

427
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,070
Ready.

428
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,870
Start recording. Clapperboard.

429
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,380
Scene 3, Shot 1, Take 3.

430
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,580
One, two, three, four, five.

431
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,020
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

432
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,910
One, two, three, four, five, six.

433
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,600
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

434
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,430
I heard that Li Longda

435
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,960
is one of the investors.

436
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,300
For the sake of money,

437
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,350
even a fool

438
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,230
can be tolerated.

439
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,550
No.

440
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,980
This is an insult to me.

441
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,360
Next,

442
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,930
I'll show

443
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:53,990
my trump cards.

444
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,660
OK. Longda steps back.

445
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:56,620
Time for Longda's double.

446
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,650
OK. Longda steps back. Time for Longda's double.

447
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,310
Ready.

448
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,940
I don't believe this can actually work.

449
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,570
Action.

450
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,040
OK. Longda's turn.

451
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,060
Come on.

452
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,570
Longda's turn. Hurry up. The double steps back.

453
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,660
That's okay.

454
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,320
Three, two, one.

455
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,340
Action.

456
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,550
Done. The next scene.

457
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,930
The martial arts team, get ready.

458
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,470
Have a seat. Thank you.

459
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,220
Thank him for what?

460
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,520
Jin Ayin,

461
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,760
if I can't stand it one day,

462
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,600
don't stop me.

463
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,340
I want to beat him to death.

464
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,400
Shut up.

465
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,920
Excuse me. I want to ask you a favor.

466
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,580
I want to join the action team.

467
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,850
It's

468
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,700
not a problem.

469
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,370
In this scene,

470
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,230
Xiang Qinyu and his little brothers are going to rescue

471
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,930
his junior sister apprentice.

472
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,020
It's the first action scene

473
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,110
of Xiang Qinyu.

474
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,100
I hope you can do a good job.

475
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,460
-Okay, Director. -Okay.

476
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:10,930
Ready.

477
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,050
Leave it to me.

478
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,470
What are you doing here?

479
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,760
I want to experience the current life in the crew.

480
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,390
I also want to show them

481
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,390
what martial arts actors are like.

482
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,660
Just give up.

483
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,230
Where is our junior sister apprentice?

484
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,040
Is Teng Xi's double ready?

485
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,190
Director.

486
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,130
I'm here.

487
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,340
Why are you here?

488
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,810
A double is enough.

489
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,310
No way.

490
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,860
I need to help them get immersed.

491
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:43,860
OK.

492
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,260
You are a dedicated young girl.

493
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,160
Come on.

494
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,350
Come on.

495
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,070
So soon?

496
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,280
I'm not ready yet.

497
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,500
I'll jump and kick.

498
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,350
She's dedicated.

499
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,800
She seems a little bit professional.

500
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,090
A little bit?

501
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,970
She may be young,

502
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,870
she's a popular star of Jianghe Studios.

503
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,320
She has a huge fan base, understand?

504
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,100
She's been acting since she was three.

505
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,260
I'm not exaggerating.

506
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,980
Her films accompanied us to grow up.

507
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,700
Great.

508
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,110
Do you like her?

509
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,820
I thought you don't like women.

510
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,050
The martial arts team.

511
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,100
Get ready.

512
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,980
Bro, let's go.

513
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,030
I'm going.

514
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:35,460
Don't make trouble.

515
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,800
Hurry up and move.

516
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,590
Ready to start.

517
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,710
Pay attention to the timing, okay?

518
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,080
-Okay. -Thank you.

519
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,650
Okay.

520
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,570
Ready.

521
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,300
Start recording.

522
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,650
Move.

523
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,680
Who is this guy?

524
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,760
This is

525
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,780
a new extra.

526
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,990
An unexpected surprise.

527
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,030
Let him do more in the future.

528
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,470
OK.

529
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,460
I would be so happy

530
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
if Li Longda were half as good as him.

531
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,420
Cut.

532
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,110
Longda.

533
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,470
Director.

534
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,340
What happened?

535
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,630
That's not good.

536
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,550
Can we do it again?

537
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,920
That's all I need.

538
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,890
Well done.

539
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,080
Longda,

540
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,070
don't be angry.

541
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,660
It's just a few seconds in the teaser.

542
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,110
How about

543
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,390
I give you a close-up?

544
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,310
Director, let's do it again.

545
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,310
The director said we just need a close-up.

546
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,220
Isn't he too arrogant?

547
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,840
I've never seen an extra upstage the male lead.

548
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,240
He should've been the male lead.

549
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:44,800
Brother.

550
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,550
Did you do it on purpose?

551
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,230
He's not that good.

552
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,290
How can you blame me?

553
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,050
He doesn't even know how to fight.

554
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,060
When I was an extra,

555
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,700
that's how I made a living.

556
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,420
Lower your voice.

557
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,590
There are many ways to investigate him.

558
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,210
Why do you have to upstage him?

559
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,610
I beg you, OK?

560
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,310
Stop causing me trouble.

561
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,190
Besides,

562
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,820
it's not just about me

563
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,040
that I wrote The Legend of Xiang Qinyu.

564
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,460
It's a win-win situation.

565
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:18,700
I know.

566
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,120
That's right.

567
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,250
We don't make trouble,

568
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,410
and trouble won't come to us.

569
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,430
How do you know

570
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,880
trouble won't come to us?

571
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,870
You've improved a lot, Chi Yu.

572
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,760
It's really you.

573
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,140
Why are you here?

574
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,160
You know me?

575
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:42,660
Well.

576
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,150
What do you mean?

577
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,100
I heard from them that

578
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,410
you had an accident.

579
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,210
Are you okay?

580
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,270
Really?

581
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,180
It's me.

582
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,850
When we were in school,

583
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,360
we were the best couple in the acting class.

584
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,760
Hello, Miss Teng Xi.

585
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,060
Miss Teng Xi.

586
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:20,900
You got the wrong person.

587
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,040
I'm not Chi Yu.

588
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,460
Yes.

589
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,540
You got the wrong person.

590
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,440
You are his girlfriend.

591
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,860
No.

592
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,150
Don't worry.

593
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,290
Nothing happened between me and him.

594
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,440
We are just good friends,

595
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,060
like brothers and sisters.

596
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,450
Don't worry.

597
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:47,840
Hurry up.

598
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,410
If you two really become a couple,

599
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,420
I'll give you a big red packet.

600
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,710
Xi,

601
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,760
the crew is looking for you.

602
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,370
Okay.

603
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,540
All right, I'll get back to work.

604
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,620
I'll drink with you later.

605
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,380
It seems that Li Longda is right.

606
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,000
Chi Yu

607
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,740
did mess up with many people.

608
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,630
Is Teng Xi's loved one

609
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,520
Chi Yu?

610
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,260
Considering how familiar they are,

611
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,430
I don't believe

612
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,730
they are not together.

613
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,090
Teng Xi said her loved one

614
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,900
despises her worldly life.

615
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:37,710
Bro,

616
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,910
are you Teng Xi's loved one?

617
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,840
I mean Chi Yu.

618
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,880
Never judge a book by its cover.

619
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,900
Teng Xi looks

620
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,180
innocent.

621
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,600
Teng Xi is innocent,

622
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,000
while others are frivolous.

623
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,400
A man with double standards.

624
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,600
What is a man with double standards?

625
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,420
It's used to describe men who

626
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,650
lose their mind

627
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,700
after being hugged by a beauty.

628
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,870
Frivolous.

629
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,450
I'll ask the director if there is anything else.

630
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,590
If there is nothing else, we'll go home.

631
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,480
You stay here.

632
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,770
Don't go anywhere.

633
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,810
Touch nothing.

634
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,760
You've caused enough trouble for me.

635
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,380
If someone else

636
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,090
comes later,

637
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,110
I'll just leave you alone.

638
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:24,560
Don't move.

639
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,520
Fine.

640
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:53,860
Be careful.

641
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,550
There's a hidden weapon.

642
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,010
Grab it.

643
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,300
Thank you, bro.

644
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,400
Xiang Qinyu,

645
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,620
what are you doing again?

646
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,190
Well.

647
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,080
Don't come over.

648
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,260
I thought I told you not to move.

649
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,200
You really scared me.

650
00:32:59,210 --> 00:32:59,880
Xiang

651
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:00,980
Qin

652
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,400
Yu!

653
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,680
I...

654
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,750
just moved a little bit.

655
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,430
Do you believe it?

656
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,300
No.

657
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,690
What's wrong with you guys?

658
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,590
How many more problems are you going to cause me?

659
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,050
Do you think I'm not miserable enough?

660
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,680
Somebody help me!

661
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,150
Be careful.

662
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,520
You.

663
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,350
Disappear!

664
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:53,929
[It's like frying streaky pork with hot oil.]
