[Sweet On]

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,520
Even if Hao knew the previous Chi Yu,

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,730
but it is the current Chi Yu

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,920
who refuses to use the wire.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,280
Hao can't know the present Chi Yu.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:17,920
Do you understand?

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,460
No.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,780
That's right.

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,670
How did the murderer know

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,860
Chi Yu doesn't use wire?

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,620
And Tuotuo said

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,920
it's the director who confirmed

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,220
with Chi Yu in person about

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,480
not using wire a few days before the shoot.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,660
Outsiders

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,150
wouldn't know about it.

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,330
Someone might overhear it.

19
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,290
Someone might overhear it?

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,590
I'm just saying.

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,760
This is how they act in the play.

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,610
Overheard.

Producer Hu.

25
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:05,820
Are you

26
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,060
slacking off in Chi Yu's room again?

27
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,860
Other places are fine.

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,950
There's no signal in his room. I just...

29
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,340
I...

30
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:13,740
Ye.

Go back first.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,750
I need to go back to the crew.

33
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,380
Now?

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:16,820
No.

35
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,820
Just stay here

36
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,380
and wait for my call.

37
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,580
You can only speak

38
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,300
when I ask you to.

39
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,700
Hello.

40
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,090
Hello, can you hear me?

41
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,320
What are you doing?

42
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,900
Ye, say something else!

Little mute, no mother.

I feel sorry for you.

Little mute.

No mother.

59
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,540
I feel sorry for you.

As long as you call me...

61

Who is it?

62
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,860
Bad guys, go away!

63
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,100
Don't bully others.

64
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,300
What's that smell?

65
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,100
It stinks.

66
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,970
My mom said she's a rat girl that no one wants.

67
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,950
The rat girl that no one wants.

68
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,650
The rat girl that no one wants.

69
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,360
The rat girl that no one wants.

70
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,110
The rat girl that no one wants.

71
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,990
Rat girl.

72
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,550
My name is Taotao.

73
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,270
Will you

74
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,110
be my friend?

75
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,590
If those people bully you again,

76
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,100
you must tell me.

77
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,590
I'll protect you from now on.

78
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,230
I'm not feeling well.

79
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,210
They all say I smell weird.

80
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,830
No.

81
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,950
No.

82
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,590
Really?

83
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,780
What's your name?

84
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,930
I'm usually clumsy.

85
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,610
I always forget things.

86
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,450
So I write them down.

87
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,400
Then I won't forget.

88
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,860
My name is Ma Zehao.

89
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,860
You mean Chi Yu is fine?

90
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,220
But it's said on the Internet that he...

91
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,260
That's good.

92
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,570
That's good.

93
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,390
I've watched

94
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:48,850
his dramas before.

95
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,640
Don't be nervous.

96
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Because you showed up

97
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,159
in the call records of the deceased for the past two months,

98
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,370
So you're the same as others.

99
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,730
We called you here

100
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,100
to ask about the situation.

101
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,040
Okay.

102
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:02,990
Tell us

103
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,280
why Hao called you.

104
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,870
Why did he call me?

105
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,070
We met on the street a while ago.

106
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,780
I don't know what bad luck he had.

107
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,160
He said he lost his job

108
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,170
and asked me to treat him to dinner.

109
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,640
A few days later,

110
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,810
he called me

111
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,340
to borrow money from me.

112
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,350
I thought

113
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,410
we haven't seen each other for so long.

114
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,710
How could I lend money to him so easily?

115
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,270
After that,

116
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,100
I saw something happened to him.

117
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,900
I thought

118
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,690
luckily I didn't lend money to him.

119
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,780
When did you meet Hao?

120
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,680
Two years ago.

121
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,760
I went to the crew to find a friend.

122
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,909
He was also a staff member of the crew.

123
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,820
Did you find anyone suspicious

124
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,420
in your last meeting?

125
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,080
No.

126
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:07,610
No?

127
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,780
No.

128
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,880
Okay, thank you for your cooperation.

129
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,120
Take a look.

130
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,120
This is the statement.

131
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,120
Sign if there's no problem.

132
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:19,970
Then you can leave.

133
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,650
Okay.

134
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,280
You mean Chi Yu is fine?

135
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,160
You'll look forward to seeing me again.

136
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,550
Don't push me.

137
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,130
I can walk on the crutch.

138
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,000
It's not the first time I sprained my ankle.

139
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,050
It's really urgent.

140
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,590
You're too slow.

141
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,410
What is it, Jin Ayin?

142
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,380
Shut up.

143
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,240
You'll know when we get there.

144
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,380
You're here.

145
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,380
Hello.

146
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,300
This way.

147
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,950
The bug

148
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,390
was found by your friend.

149
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,020
After she called the police,

150
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,520
we also found a pinhole camera.

151
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,370
Pinhole?

152
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,110
It's a small camera for secret photography.

153
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,020
It's nothing.

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,770
You've been looking for evidence

155
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,020
without telling me, right?

156
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,540
And

157
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,590
cooking

158
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,290
for you.

159
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,780
Why are you so disobedient?

160
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,800
These things

161
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,050
were found in your dressing room.

162
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,170
So we think

163
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,020
the murderer must have entered your room.

164
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,330
In other words,

165
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,540
all my recent actions

166
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,070
are under his nose.

167
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,490
Based on the current evidence,

168
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,300
we have reason to suspect

169
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,040
this case

170
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,670
was conducted by the same person

171
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,360
who attacked you and made you fall into the sea last time.

172
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,750
After you were attacked last time,

173
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,000
we had retrieved the surveillance video.

174
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,500
In the end...

175
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,050
I thought

176
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,210
the security guard at Magpie Bar said it was broken

177
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,320
to fool me.

178
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,190
The surveillance data was missing.

179
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,090
This time there is surveillance equipment.

180
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,500
The similarity of the two cases

181
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,190
is that the murderer knows electronic products

182
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,510
and used them to commit the crime.

183
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,660
So,

184
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,410
we will continue to investigate

185
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,110
according to this direction.

186
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,300
Besides,

187
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,810
you have to pay extra attention to your daily life.

188
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,060
Don't let your guard down.

189
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,660
We also sent someone to conduct a more detailed investigation.

190
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,060
We suspect

191
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,770
the murderer is still trying to monitor you.

192
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,390
Be careful.

193
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,580
Thank you, sir.

194
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,210
Bye.

195
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,100
Jin Ayin!

196
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,590
I'm hungry.

197
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Buy me some food.

198
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,640
Let me push you up first.

199
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,650
It's okay.

200
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,220
I don't even need to sit on this.

201
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,320
Put it here for the moment.

202
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,140
I can go up by myself.

203
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,100
But

204
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:05,880
your...

205
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,890
-your leg... -I'm starving.

206
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:08,530
Go.

207
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,300
Stop dawdling.

208
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,720
All right.

209
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,720
I'll take my bag with me.

210
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,530
Is it okay?

211
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,060
Be careful.

212
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,550
I'll be back soon.

213
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,890
Be careful.

214
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,450
I'm back.

215
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,020
Xiang Qinyu.

216
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,340
Xiang Qinyu.

217
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,600
What are you doing?

218
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,890
You scared me.

219
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,880
Get up first.

220
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,150
Are you okay?

221
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,980
What are you looking for?

222
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,380
I...

223
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,100
I'm catching a rat.

224
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,060
Catching a rat?

225
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,060
I've lived here for so long,

226
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,840
but I didn't find your kind.

227
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,750
Why are you in such a hurry to come back?

228
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,590
Is it because

229
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,480
of what I found in the crew

230
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:43,990
that you are scared?

231
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,270
Who said I'm scared?

232
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,440
I was just checking.

233
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,370
Just in case.

234
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,530
Did you find it?

235
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,950
He can get his way

236
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,920
because the crew is crowded.

237
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,470
He can't come in my home without the key.

238
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,260
Climb over the wall?

239
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,330
Isn't he afraid of falling to death?

240
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,100
Besides,

241
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,210
I'm so smart.

242
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,000
If there is,

243
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,130
I would have found out.

244
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,900
It's getting late.

245
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,780
I'm going back.

246
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,540
You can't leave.

247
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,060
I came back to confirm

248
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,100
if your place is safe.

249
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,940
You know now...

250
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,540
Since you're back,

251
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,510
you can't leave.

252
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,900
Don't go.

253
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,630
Just move back.

254
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,620
Longda's house is much spacious than here.

255
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,480
Although

256
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,260
the taste is worse

257
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,160
than that of my old house's.

258
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,620
But his bed is very comfortable.

259
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,540
How can a small attic like yours

260
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,430
keep me?

261
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,510
Then I...

262
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,090
I can return the bedroom to you.

263
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,130
Don't worry.

264
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,760
Not only will I not hold you back,

265
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,040
I can also help you.

266
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,030
Look.

267
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,300
Look.

268
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,760
You're an antique.

269
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,370
You don't even know how to scan the QR code.

270
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,530
You can't even take care of yourself.

271
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,220
What can you find out?

272
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,820
I'd better go back.

273
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,480
Don't go.

274
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,780
Let go of me.

275
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,940
Ayin, stop it.

276
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,300
If you want to leave,

277
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:14,990
step over me.

278
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,720
When someone else encounters something like this,

279
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,140
they can't wait to run away.

280
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,100
Are you out of your mind?

281
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,390
You came to my house this morning

282
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,750
and stole my money.

283
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,760
What if the bad guy...

284
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,280
Don't worry.

285
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,700
Don't you know me?

286
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,270
If we meet a bad guy,

287
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,750
I'll push you out first.

288
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,690
Xiang Qinyu.

289
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,780
Even if you don't agree,

290
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,640
I won't give up.

291
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,140
Never.

292
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,460
Besides,

293
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,600
aren't you worried

294
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,320
that

295
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,520
I'm in danger

296
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,620
when you aren't with me?

297
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,900
Promise me

298
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,850
no matter what happens next,

299
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,170
you must protect yourself.

300
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,990
I will do my best

301
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,180
to stay by your side and protect you.

302
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:07,640
Okay.

303
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,740
I promise you.

304
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,170
If anything happens,

305
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,530
I'll run away.

306
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,480
I won't look back at you.

307
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,420
Can you

308
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,130
come down first?

309
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,900
You're so heavy.

310
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,840
I don't know if my leg needs to be amputated

311
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,810
after being pressed by you.

312
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,200
Also,

313
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,300
I don't want rice balls anymore.

314
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,610
Look at the pizza. It's good.

315
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,020
Isn't that a pie?

316
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,100
How is it different from my rice balls?

317
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,660
Is the moon overseas rounder?

318
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,540
Wangcai.

319
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,990
Play a song.

320
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,010

345
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,780
but also a kind of respect for crabs.

346
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,230
♫With one more second, in this world, there will be no♫

347
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,620
How does it taste?

348
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,380
♫More trouble♫

349
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,240
♫Every minute and second♫

350
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,420
What do you want?

351
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,460
I want to tell you

352
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,420
what the real Romantic is.

353
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,940
What do you think?

354
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,020
Is it romantic?

355
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,190
Don’t write nonsense in the future.

356
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,150
Not bad.

357
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,940
Not bad?

358
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,350
In our era,

359
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,710
this is the most modern way to chase girls.

360
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,270
Is the money real?

361
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,140
Does it matter?

362
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:29,770
Let me see.

363
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,000
Get away.

364
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,620
-Let me see. -What's good to see?

365
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,080
No.

366
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,880
-Let me see. -What's good to see?

367
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,370
Didn't you say

368
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,960
this watch

369
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,620
can record the number of my punches?

370
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,870
Why is there no response?

371
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,530
How many times have I taught you?

372
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,030
My grandma learns faster than you do.

373
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,430
High-tech stuff

374
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,770
is a waste to you.

375
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,630
What did Li Longda say

376
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,050
about the circle of friends...

377
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,200
How to post that?

378
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,550
You'd better learn to make friends first.

379
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,460
There are only three or four people on your WeChat.

380
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:40,340
Here.

381
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,800
You're still studying Chi Yu's stuff?

382
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,710
It's been days.

383
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,590
Any new discovery?

384
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,190
Enjoy yourself.

385
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,010
Answer the phone.

386
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,140
Answer the phone.

387
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,410
Son.

388
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,970
Have you eaten?

389
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,610
Yes.

390
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,430
Yu.

391
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,060
Your dad asked me to call you.

392
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,550
He asked me to ask that

393
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,580
I didn't give you enough money last time,

394
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,490
do you have enough money now?

395
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:51,790
Yes.

396
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,490
Yes.

397
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,350
I have

398
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:56,900
money.

399
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,450
I have...

400
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,280
money with me.

401
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,350
Say something to your son.

402
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,120
Come on, say something.

403
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,240
I can't see anything.

404
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:05,940
What would I say?

405
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,450
You...

406
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,990
I'm doing well.

407
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,000
Come, let's talk here.

408
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,990
I'd better not.

409
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:13,770
You...

410
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,400
How are you

411
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,790
recently?

412
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,760
We're fine.

413
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,740
But your dad is not feeling well.

414
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,730
Why are you talking about this?

415
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:24,930
Well...

416
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,370
Don't worry.

417
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,630
I'll take good care of your dad.

418
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,730
Bye.

419
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,460
Let's go.

420
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:01,890
Do you want to drink?

421
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,290
I don't want to.

422
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,000
I know

423
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,450
you call this fatty's drink.

424
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,260
I don't want it to ruin my kung fu.

425
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,380
Hello, take one.

426
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,740
You too.

427
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,220
Free?

428
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,210
Why didn't I know that?

429
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,580
I almost missed it.

430
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,920
Our shop is on trial operation.

431
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,900
As long as you scan the QR code,

432
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,860
you can get milk tea for free.

433
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,180
Here.

434
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,170
Thank you.

435
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,210
It's okay. Take the straw.

436
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,220
Here.

437
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,140
Originally,

438
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,880
I didn't plan to drink it.

439
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,800
But since it's not easy to get,

440
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,080
I'll sacrifice myself

441
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,080
to help you with it.

442
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,230
Let's go.

443
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,530
[Connected]

444
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,310
Don't be scared. She's my friend,

445
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,700
Jin Ayin.

446
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,580
Have some candy.

447
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,650
Jin Ayin, this is my new friend.

448
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,260
His name is...

449
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,010
Ma Zehao.

450
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,540
Be careful.

451
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,220
Your leg hasn't recovered yet.

452
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,670
How can you shoot?

453
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,040
How about

454
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,940
asking Producer Hu

455
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,580
for a few days off and taking a rest.

456
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,410
No need.

457
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,240
No need.

458
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,680
But your leg...

459
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,820
I mean,

460
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,670
I know my body well.

461
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,300
I'll be fine after a few days' rest.

462
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,220
Be careful.

463
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,580
Whose dog did this?

464
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,910
Look at my shoes.

465
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,550
It's dirty.

466
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:28,880
Your leg...

467
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,160
recovered?

468
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,470
It just did.

469
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,880
It just did?

470
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:37,820
Yes.

471
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,580
It just recovered this morning.

472
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,580
It just did.

473
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,770
It just did.

474
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,060
-It really just did. -Just did.

475
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,240
-Are you saying it just did? -It suddenly recovered.

476
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,090
Stop right there!

477
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,640
-It's true. -Stop there.

478
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,490
Xiang Qinyu, stop!

479
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,780
Stop!

480
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:53,570
Liar!

481
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,760
Liar!

482
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,470
I'm getting frozen shoulder.

483
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:57,950
This side.

484
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,420
This side.

485
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,500
Here comes the God of Wealth

486
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:11,770
and my luck.

487
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,160
Meet gold when I go out.

488
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,630
Hold silver when I sleep.

489
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,280
What are you doing?

490
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,860
Paying back to my wish?

491
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,930
Do you remember the fortune teller?

492
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,700
Didn't she say

493
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,800
that I'll finally meet someone and get rich again?

494
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,530
Look.

495
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,770
I got the deposit for my new script.

496
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:30,840
So superstitious.

497
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,660
Show me the new script.

498
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,690
Let me give you some advice.

499
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,060
No.

500
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,420
Why not? I'll just take a look.

501
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,080
No.

502
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,860
Did you write something you shouldn't have

503
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,390
-in it? -No.

504
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,250
No.

505
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,030
No.

506
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:42,700
No?

507
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,410
No?

508
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,420
-Let me have a look. -You can't.

509
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:46,580
Wait.

510
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:48,800
Hello?

511
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,020
Did you get the money?

512
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:51,820
Did you add

513
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,860
erotic literature in it?

514
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,790
It's late.

515
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,260
And you're still with Chi Yu.

516
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,250
You treat my words as nonsense.

517
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
I'll leave you alone.

518
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,340
I'm angry.

519
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
I'm not going to the photography exhibition.

520
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,470
I have to take a look.

521
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,230
No.

522
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,170
-No way. -Just one look.

523
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:07,980
-No way. -Why not?

524
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,680
You are guilty.

525
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,260
You can't look. You can't.

526
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,780
Just one look.

527
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,560
-You can't look. -Just one look.

528
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,260
No.

529
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,220
You took back the contract

530
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,060
of "Old Idol".

531
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,340
Why?

532
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,370
Because I can't explain it to everyone

533
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,020
why you can use a script

534
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,300
which is not determined yet

535
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,400
to get so much money from the company.

536
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,940
Your "The Legend of Xiang Qinyu"

537
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,660
is already a thunder above your head.

538
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,040
The leading actor was changed.

539
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,340
And the leading actor got hurt.

540
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,650
It's dramatic enough.

541
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,040
But you also gained

542
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,810
exposure on social news.

543
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,350
Do you think

544
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,750
if I didn't cover up,

545
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,330
would your project

546
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,500
continue?

547
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,610
I knew it.

548
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,630
You asked me to come back urgently

549
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,100
to report my work

550
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,860
just to let me see

551
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,810
how you hided it from Mr. Gao.

552
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,210
But you don't know

553
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,920
I sent an email to Mr. Gao that night

554
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,130
and explained the truth.

555
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,300
I told him Chi Yu is fine.

556
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,050
And I also prepared response in PR.

557
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,600
I know

558
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,550
you were the one who brought me into this industry.

559
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,450
But I've been relying on myself all these years.

560
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,530
I didn't rely on you.

561
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,070
Back to "Old Idol".

562
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,020
The script is adjusting.

563
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,180
It's normal to change it.

564
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,600
Why should I sign the contract first?

565
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,100
Because I think Director Han

566
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,820
is the most suitable candidate for this project.

567
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,500
I have to pay the deposit first

568
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,640
to get his schedule.

569
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,990
This is also a reasonable request.

570
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,330
I've made up my mind.

571
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,630
We can't initiate the project.

572
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,940
Why?

573
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,200
Give me a reason.

574
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,690
I don't accept the current one.

575
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,550
Chen Mumu,

576
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,020
I don't want to quarrel with you today.

577
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,770
How about this?

578
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,410
Let's calm down

579
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,580
and make a clear decision.

580
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,390
Okay?

581
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,540
But Director Han is waiting there.

582
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,820
I need an answer today.

583
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,620
If you insist,

584
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,930
I'll have to cross the line and apply.

585
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,740
Chen Mumu,

586
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,300
can you be more careful?

587
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,110
Don't take risks with the company's money,

588
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,550
Okay?

589
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,700
You said

590
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,000
every film and television project is risky investment.

591
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:40,890
But why

592
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,330
the "Old Idol" that has passed the risk assessment

593
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,470
will be denied by you?

594
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,770
Inform the HR department

595
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,020
to transfer Chen Mumu's annual leave.

596
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,200
Start from today.

597
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,930
Chen Mumu, let me remind you again.

598
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,920
Don't be so impulsive.

599
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,720
Remember,

600
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,990
in work,

601
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:11,730
the gun

602
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,540
always shoots the bird that comes out on top.

603
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,760
Are you really not coming?

604
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,050
It's hard to coax.

605
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,760
At least three barbecue meals.

606
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:33,960
Longda.

607
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,880
Do you remember the sections?

608
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:37,960
Yes.

609
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,110
Then you go to the door to welcome the guests

610
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:40,650
and guide them.

611
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,700
I'll send out the brochure.

612
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,190
Okay, I'll complete the task.

613
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,080
Where is he?

614
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,830
Come out!

615
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:51,440
No.

616
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,140
Why would I dress like this at the exhibition?

617
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,450
Shouldn't I wear something formal?

618
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,140
You tied it wrong.

619
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,980
This is the formal uniform.

620
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:03,390
All right.

621
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,060
You're like a sticky plaster.

622
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,920
You lied to me about going back to your home.

623
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,120
Isn’t Jin Ayin's my home?

624
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,060
You can’t help me.

625
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,760
Go home.

626
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,100
You dress so fancy every day.

627
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,430
Are you here to help?

628
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,930
This is fashion, you know?

629
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,770
What fashion? Tell me.

630
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,560
Alright, stop it.

631
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,020
You go with him

632
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,140
to welcome the guests.

633
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,850
Call me if you need anything.

634
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,420
Stop it.

635
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,540
Today is an important day for my brother-in-law.

636
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,700
If you don't understand,

637
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,170
just stay still.

638
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:44,980
Don't make trouble.

639
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:45,910
No.

640
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,840
Why your brother-in-law?

641
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,260
You are shameless.

642
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,880
How am I shameless?

643
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,510
You liar!

644
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,350
You're a drag.

645
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,880
I advise you to know the truth.

646
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,650
Jin Ayin begged me to come today.

647
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,900
It shows that I am important to her.

648
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,420
She usually calls me Yu.

649
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,520
Usually calls you Yu.

650
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,670
She calls me dear Longda.

651
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,910
It's dear, not just the name.

652
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,380
Li Longda, if you keep acting weird,

653
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,080
I'll break your leg.

654
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,810
You always want to break my leg.

655
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,100
What else can you do?

656
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,720
Your leg just recovered.

657
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,270
Don't break it again.

658
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,270
Li Longda.

659
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:21,670
What?

660
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,980
Try poking me again today.

661
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,020
I will.

662
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,250
What's wrong with you?

663
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,040
Be quiet.

664
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,190
She's talking to you. Be quiet.

665
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,100
And you.

666
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:29,840
Be quiet.

667
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:30,700
And you.

668
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,280
Get back to work.

669
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:33,820
Hurry up.

670
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:35,420
Get to work.

686
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,290
add three spoons of sugar and three spoons of salt.

687
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,770
After being boiled for three minutes with medium heat,

688
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,650
the dish is ready.

689
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,760
You must learn to cook this dish

690
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,300
and cook it for your husband

691
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,300
or at friends gatherings.

692
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,480
It will be a good choice.

693
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,290
Mumu.

694
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,600
You didn't see

695
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,490
Mr. Wu's face turned green when he saw the email you sent.

696
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,160
This afternoon,

697
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,550
he was asked to meet Big Boss in Beijing.

698
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,720
I also heard that Big Boss

699
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,860
scolded him on the phone,

700
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,390
saying if Mr. Wu is so afraid of taking risks,

701
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,430
in the future,

702
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,700
he'd better not do any new projects.

703
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,010
Director Han's contract must be sent today.

704
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,630
I'll take care of the problems if there's any.

705
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,620
Was I really blind in the past?
