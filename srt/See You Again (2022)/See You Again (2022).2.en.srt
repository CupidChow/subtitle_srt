Yu.

5
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,840
Actually, this book mentions you.

6
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,690
Here. Look.

7
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,650
Xiang Qinyu,

8
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,370
born in Shanghai in 1909.

9
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,420
He was an orphan since childhood,

10
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,370
and became

11
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,250
Wen Zhen's disciple.

12
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,760
Xiang Qinyu was against

13
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,970
the negative evasion from society in martial arts genie movies,

14
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,760
and he tried to find the realistic meaning of martial arts movies.

15
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,420
He became very popular.

16
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,890
However, due to his

17
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,660
aloof personality,

18
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,460
he got in

19
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,750
quite...

20
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,850
A lot of grudges.

21
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,230
After being shot on set of The Legend of Huangpu

22
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,860
in 1936,

23
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,500
he disappeared

24
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,400
from the scene.

25
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,440
No one knows if he's alive or dead.

26
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,790
It's just a small gift.

27
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,440
Don't mention it.

28
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,190
Wish your business a great success.

29
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,750
Yu,

30
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,579
think on the bright side.

31
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,450
All good things come to an end.

32
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,480
After all,

33
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,310
you are one of

34
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:41,930
the pioneers

35
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,329
of Chinese movies.

36
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,030
Since you're not the murderer,

37
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,940
this has nothing to do with you anymore,

38
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,750
Miss Jin.

39
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,050
For what happened today,

40
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,050
I, Xiang Qinyu, want to express my gratitude.

41
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,740
Yu, where are you going?

42
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,580
Home.

43
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,470
I...

44
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,170
You still have my tie clip.

45
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,030
Where is my house?

46
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,920
Yu.

47
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,040
I think

48
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,380
even if you had a house,

49
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,620
it can't still

50
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,700
be yours now.

51
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,930
Yu.

52
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,650
What are you doing?

53
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,050
Help me connect to Gao Mansion.

54
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,250
What's the phone number of your reception?

55
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,260
What reception?

56
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,670
The reception where they can help me connect

57
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,340
to Gao Mansion.

58
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,660
I'm looking for someone called Gao Bai.

59
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,260
We don't have such a thing here.

60
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:15,630
Well...

61
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,970
No cable address, either?

62
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,620
Yu, don't worry.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,780
I'll help you think of a way.

64
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:36,920
Didn't you say

65
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,180
there was a newspaper that says something about me?

66
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,550
Where is it?

67
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,150
Is it because I didn't sleep well lately

68
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,570
and got out of my mind?

69
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,140
I remember there was a newspaper.

70
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,200
Why can't I find it?

71
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,960
But don't worry.

72
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,380
There's no need to worry.

73
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,460
I can handle it.

74
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,390
Leave it to me.

75
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:56,700
Let's go.

76
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,770
It can know how I got here?

77
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,440
Although I can't

78
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,740
send you back right away,

79
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,860
I read about

80
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,960
a great theory.

81
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,540
I think it can explain

82
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,530
how you got here.

83
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,540
A super black hole

84
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,159
has the mass of four million suns.

85
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,560
Black hole?

86
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,090
Time travel?

87
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,580
Keep watching.

88
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,680
A black hole like this has

89
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,560
much more power than anything in the universe.

90
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:45,860
This is

91
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,810
a time machine

92
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,510
-You can - produced naturally.

93
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,800
understand these?

94
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,110
Of course.

95
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,130
He wants to say that

96
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,220
one day to someone

97
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,010
is one year,

98
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,980
ten years,

99
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,960
or even longer to us.

100
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,330
So he means...

101
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,060
So,

102
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,490
I think he means

103
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,440
you might have run into a black hole.

104
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,260
Yu, think about it.

105
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,650
Did anything strange happen

106
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,420
before you got shot?

107
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,150
A supernatural phenomenon like a black hole

108
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,520
definitely comes with

109
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,510
a rare unnatural reaction.

110
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,550
That's right.

111
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,120
When there's strange astronomical phenomenon,

112
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,460
something weird will happen.

113
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,170
Isn't there thunder and lightning tonight?

114
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,370
Maybe

115
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,250
you were sent here by a black hole.

116
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,909
That's what the movie said as well.

117
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,380
Are you sure this theory

118
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,930
is connected to my presence here?

119
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,280
Anyway, look.

120
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,630
There were two thunderstorms in two places at the same time.

121
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,970
At that time,

122
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,670
you might have approached the black hole

123
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,490
because of this,

124
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,810
and your time got slowed down.

125
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,360
When the two timelines overlap,

126
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,620
you came to

127
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,660
my beautiful house in 2018.

128
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,280
Then how can I go back?

129
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,760
How to go back?

130
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,450
Wait.

131
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,090
Wait?

132
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:26,410
Yes.

133
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,500
Wait for the right time.

134
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,700
Wait for another weird phenomenon.

135
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,919
Thunderstorm.

don't get water on your wound.

You'll get inflamed.

we need shampoo to wash our hair.

I'm sure you didn't.

149
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,620
I know.

150
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,290
We had shampoo powder back then.

You've covered it up. What can I see?

158
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,540
Your boiler is out of hot water.

159
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
This is the self-cultivation of a male star?

How about

161

I go in and take a look?

162

00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:56,690
Yu.

176
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,980
This is called a hoodie.

177
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,200
It's quite popular in our era.

178
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,660
And this is

179
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,560
the only clothes I have

180
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,120
that you can fit in.

181
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,790
Yu.

182
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,640
My bedroom will belong to you from now on.

183
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,920
Don't worry about me.

184
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,060
How is it, Yu?

185
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,650
Do you feel at home?

186
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,130
[Bao]

187
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,030
This is the character "bao".

188
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,520
Take it off.

189
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,770
Taking it off now.

190
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,750
What do you mean by "never heard of me"?

191
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,750
Aren't these all about me?

192
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,670
Although my residence is a bit messy,

193
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,050
I can say

194
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,550
I'm one of your only few fans here.

195
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:56,470
By the way,

196
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,950
what do you do?

197
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,830
I am...

198
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,900
I am

199
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,180
a literature worker.

200
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,190
I'm a mixed artist.

201
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,240
Mixed artist?

202
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,980
It's an artistic creator.

203
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,770
It's an occupation that has a say

204
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,000
in our era.

205
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,940
I can write anything.

206
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,700
Literature, novels, movies,

207
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,860
all of them.

208
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,760
Let me show you something.

209
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,590
I wrote something in this too.

210
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,010
Look.

211
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,560
Look.

212
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,220
And here.

213
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,250
And these comments.

214
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,810
The top ten high-quality comments

215
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,970
were actually all written by me.

216
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,660
You are not a paid troll recruited by the director, are you?

217
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,580
Fifty cents per comment?

218
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,640
What does "paid troll" mean?

219
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,140
Paid troll

220
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,830
is the description

221
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,110
of my writing by my fans.

222
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,940
They think it's smooth and sharp.

223
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,230
Just like Mr. Zhou.

224
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:06,840
Who?

225
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,140
Mr. Zhou.

226
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,020
He's a literature guru I know.

227
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,420
Don't you know him either?

228
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,790
I know.

229
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,300
He and I

230
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,780
are similar.

231
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,710
I guess you're one of the gurus here.

232
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,170
It's getting late.

233
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,040
Go to bed early.

234
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,220
Jin Ayin.

235
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,260
Come on!

236
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,820
You can even see Xiang Qinyu alive.

237
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,040
I'll definitely become a top screenwriter.

238
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,480
This is a rare opportunity.

239
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,580
What are you waiting for, Jin Ayin?

240
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:08,740
Don't get me wrong.

241
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,280
I'm here to turn off the lights for you.

242
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,190
Don't touch my light.

243
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,400
I'm sorry.

244
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,160
Yu,

245
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,619
go back to sleep.

246
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,540
WeChat transaction, ten yuan received.

247
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,980
Alipay transaction, eight yuan received.

248
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,330
Is it comfortable?

249
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,660
Yes.

250
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:47,810
Right.

251
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Young man,

252
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,900
you are good-looking.

253
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,420
Do you have a coupon for me?

254
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,510
The deliverymen nowadays

255
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,740
-care about health a lot. -Exactly.

256
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,690
What is delivery?

257
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,110
Food delivery.

258
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,920
I'm not with them...

259
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,010
So you are from Tuanlema.

260
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,830
The coupons of Tuanlema are also okay.

261
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,790
Where is my coupon?

262
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,920
I'm even a member.

263
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,200
Wake up.

264
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,120
What time is it?

265
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,200
You are so lazy at such a young age.

266
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,710
You got up so early.

267
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,580
I can't do it.

268
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,740
Let me sleep a little longer.

269
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,950
I just closed my eyes.

270
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,180
Take me to

271
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,580
the best store here.

272
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,310
I want to buy some decent clothes.

273
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,210
Buy clothes?

274
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,570
Do I need to explain?

275
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,750
I...

276
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:13,890
I'll get up now.

277
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:15,980
Wait for me.

278
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,580
This is the most luxurious store right now.

279
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,150
Come on, sweethearts, check this out.

280
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,470
This one.

281
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,610
This is our latest arrival.

282
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,660
Check it out. It's of great quality.

283
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,360
It's disgraceful.

284
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,460
Pick one.

285
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:20,940
Handsome.

286
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,130
Yu indeed.

287
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,230
You look better in this

288
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,160
than many celebrities nowadays.

289
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,580
Yu, look.

290
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,720
Beckham

291
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,510
wore these pants

292
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,890
at the best of his times.

293
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,430
Well,

294
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,230
the location of the holes are different.

295
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,590
Back in our times,

296
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,540
even a beggar wouldn't wear this.

297
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,220
Try this.

298
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,140
Try it.

299
00:21:59,380 --> 00:21:59,910
This one.

300
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,180
Try this.

301
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,160
Don't you have

302
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,170
some decent clothes?

303
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,190
Like the suits from Humsuit?

304
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:20,940
What is that?

305
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,290
Why are you laughing?

306
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,980
Even my grandpa won't wear it.

307
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,840
This is so handsome.

308
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,570
Clothes should be decent

309
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,900
so that those who wear them look graceful.

310
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,220
Boss.

311
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,350
How much is this?

312
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:07,980
Eight hundred.

313
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,080
Eight hundred?

314
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,720
You might as well rob us.

315
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,260
Young lady.

316
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,770
I like this one.

317
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,030
Is it not enough?

318
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,740
Boss,

319
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,080
I don't know the price for now,

320
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,290
but these are all top-class Yuan Datou silver coins.

321
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,880
Don't go too far.

322
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,170
They don't accept this now.

323
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,840
Money isn't for biting.

324
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,860
You have no idea

325
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,740
how the price is rising nowadays.

326
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,690
Your silver coins

327
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,310
are worth at most a few bowls of noodles.

328
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,130
I'll be a good person to the end.

329
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,950
I'll take your coins.

330
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,700
And I'll pay for your clothes.

331
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:11,890
Boss.

332
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:12,780
Four hundred.

333
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,370
-Four hundred. -No one else would buy your clothes.

334
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,300
-Who said that, young lady? -Check out the clothes on that man.

335
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,940
So pretty.

336
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,890
Boss, do you have any in store?

337
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:20,930
Yes.

338
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,620
Yes.

339
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,250
What type is this?

340
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,900
A suit is a suit.

341
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,200
What style?

342
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,280
This is a suit of young fashion.

343
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,500
It's similar to Baromon's Russian style.

344
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,370
Although the fabric is not as good,

345
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,050
it's much better than others

346
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,620
even only in the aspect of style.

347
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,670
Give me two.

348
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,980
Okay.

349
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,260
Wait a minute.

350
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,950
-Do you want one? -Wait a minute.

351
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,020
If you buy more,

352
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,360
I'll give you a discount.

353
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,060
How many do you want?

354
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,260
Three.

355
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,420
Okay.

356
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:53,860
Okay.

357
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,490
Boss.

358
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,880
Let's talk about it.

359
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,420
We'll help you with promotion.

360
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,570
How about divide it into 30% to 70%?

361
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,050
Yu,

362
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,070
if you like it,

363
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,380
you can pick more.

364
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,280
I'll pay.

365
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,410
Are you sure?

366
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,880
I've talked with the boss.

367
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,260
You can try everything

368
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,470
in the store.

369
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,700
If you like anything,

370
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,560
we can take it.

371
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,100
No big deal.

372
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,170
Why are you looking at me?

373
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,660
There's no such opportunity after this.

374
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,050
Hurry up and try it.

375
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,100
Go on.

376
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,030
Try this on again.

377
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:42,730
Go.

378
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,500
Go.

379
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,460
Try again.

380
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,280
Yu.

381
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,090
Wait for me.

382
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:02,720
Yu.

383
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,780
I have to say

384
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,890
you are the kind of elegant person

385
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,810
who can pull off a 20-yuan piece

386
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,300
like it's 2000 yuan.

387
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
Don't envy me.

388
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,840
If you spend enough money,

389
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,440
your taste will catch up as well.

390
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,710
-Yu, you are always right. -Mr. Zhao.

391
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,840
Mr. Zhao.

392
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,700
When will you pay the rent?

393
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,710
It's been days.

394
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,710
Let me tell you.

395
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,140
-If you don't pay the rent, -Yu.

396
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,910
-I'll rent this house to someone else. -You go up first.

397
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,130
Help me take these upstairs.

398
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,040
-You can't stall it forever. -Go up.

399
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,520
Right?

400
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,260
You go up first.

401
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,500
I need to make a living too.

402
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,650
Right?

403
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,330
How many days have I given you?

404
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,200
Look.

405
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,290
It's been almost ten days.

406
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,420
How can you do that?

407
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,420
Jin Ayin.

408
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,900
When will you pay your rent?

409
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,300
Mrs. Zhang, I just got my salary.

410
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,080
Here you are.

411
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,200
Fine.

412
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,930
Where else can you live in such a beautiful

413
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,580
and high-quality house?

414
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,420
Very good.

415
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,100
Right?

416
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,220
I knew artists like you

417
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,110
would love a house like this.

418
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:00,700
Right?

419
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:01,650
But you can't always delay

420
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,730
the rent.

421
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,170
Right?

422
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,340
What about lunch?

423
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,250
Hurry up.

424
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,020
What is this?

425
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,080
Noodles.

426
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,770
The soup is so muddy.

427
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,270
Is this for pigs?

428
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,550
You may not believe it,

429
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,590
but this is indeed the greatest invention

430
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,920
in the last century.

431
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,620
But you didn't get to...

432
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,370
Anyway,

433
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,540
now,

434
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,340
this enjoys fame all around the world.

435
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,500
Try it.

436
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,550
Tableware.

437
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,430
How is it?

438
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,380
Although the soup

439
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,090
is muddy,

440
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,720
it has a strange fragrance.

441
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,580
The noodles are also chewy.

442
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:55,950
Not bad, right?

443
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,700
Make me some coffee.

444
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,560
I've prepared

445
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,680
something better than coffee.

446
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,660
Snow pear braised with

447
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,340
rock sugar.

448
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:12,360
Open it.

449
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,720
Let me do it.

450
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,320
It's so simple.

451
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,510
How can I not know it?

452
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,030
Harder.

453
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,650
Well...

454
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:37,620
Just say it.

455
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,880
Can I have your autograph?

456
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,150
Just write

457
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,400
To Jin Ayin.

458
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,550
To.

459
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,800
T, o.

460
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,330
I know.

461
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,710
And your life motto.

462
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,600
I don't have any.

463
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,200
I don't compete with others

464
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,510
for anything,

465
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,080
but

466
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,940
if something belongs to me,

467
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,460
I'll never give in.

468
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,830
Yes, that's it.

469
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,720
It's from The Legend of Huangpu.

470
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,370
When I was young, after school,

471
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,820
I would ask my dad to play this clip for me every day.

472
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,190
Without that,

473
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,900
you wouldn't have a fan named Jin Ayin.

474
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,620
In that case,

475
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,660
I like your taste.

476
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,470
After reading the script,

477
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,990
many people took it

478
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,850
as the essence of The Legend of Huangpu.

479
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,310
Actually, it's not.

480
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,680
Back then,

481
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,260
I had no idea where to start writing.

482
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,000
I accidentally heard that from my friend.

483
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,930
It may sound rude and reckless,

484
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,650
but I didn't mind

485
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,540
adding this line.

486
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,330
I didn't expect someone to imitate it later.

487
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,170
In comparison,

488
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,220
I prefer the ending line.

489
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,180
-My life is... -Wait.

490
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,490
You mean

491
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,550
you stole this line?

492
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,770
I took it.

493
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,770
Not plagiarizing or stealing.

494
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,650
Do you really think

495
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,390
I said those reckless words?

496
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,420
This is just a gossip.

497
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,050
How is that a gossip?

498
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,540
Fine.

499
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,850
I'll write it for you.

500
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:32,890
Forget it.

501
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,920
I don't need you to write it.

502
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,300
Stop!

503
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,950
What's wrong with you?

504
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,690
It's not just a line.

505
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,230
Xiang Qinyu's tie clip.

506
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,880
From now on,

507
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,790
it's yours.

508
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,170
In the future,

509
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,780
you must be

510
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,230
a strong person.

511
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,600
Didn't Xiang Qinyu say that

512
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,830
"I don't compete with others for anything,

513
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,360
but if something belongs to me,

514
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,490
I'll never give in"?

515
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,370
Xiang Qinyu is a liar.

516
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,490
You've been inside for two hours.

517
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:58,980
Are you alright?

518
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,910
Jin Ayin.

519
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:01,960
Come out.

520
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,130
I have something to ask you.

521
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:12,950
What?

522
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,400
How do you use

523
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,210
the know-all equipment?

524
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,420
Learn by yourself.

525
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,300
Why don't you teach me?

526
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,080
I'm tired.

527
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,280
I want to sleep.

528
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,770
It's written clearly here.

529
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,510
And there are signs.

530
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,710
Just write down what you want to search

531
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,010
in the square frame.

532
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,600
Ask Wangcai

533
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,270
if you have any more questions.

534
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,210
I'm here.

535
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,490
You sleep in the daytime?

536
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,780
And I need to use this know-all now.

537
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,239
Here.

538
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,389
Go back to your room and use it.

539
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,719
I kindly advise you that

540
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,719
you can tell one's self-discipline

541
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,340
from his/her daily routine.

542
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,139
And the achievements of a person

543
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,650
are highly relevant to his/her self-discipline.

544
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,420
Achievements...

545
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,170
Jin Ayin.

546
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,050
I...

547
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,610
Do you need help, my friend?

548
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,580
Do you need help, my friend?

549
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,790
Don't worry, Longda.

550
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,840
Bring the money.

551
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,400
The leading actor, investment.

552
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,670
All will be taken care of.

553
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,880
Bro,

554
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,320
you have to act well.

555
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,110
As for Director Feng...

556
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,670
I don't know if Chi Yu is still alive.

557
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,170
I guess he won't mind

558
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,500
who I want to use.

559
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,660
Take it.

560
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,160
Look at Chi Yu.

561
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:12,820
He's so unlucky.

562
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,210
It didn't happen sooner or later.

563
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,810
Who did he offend to be punished like this?

564
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,660
The police sent so many people to look for him,

565
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,180
but they couldn't find him.

566
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,040
It's unknown if he's dead or alive.

567
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,430
I guess

568
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,630
he's behind the eight ball.

569
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,540
Sign it.

570
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,120
Hu.

571
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:50,580
Don't worry.

572
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,310
Chi Yu is my friend.

573
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,380
I'll film this movie well

574
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,850
even for him.

575
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:55,650
Sign it.

576
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,330
Young man, are you okay?

577
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:18,970
Sorry.

578
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:15,550
[Take things as they come.]

579
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:15,550
[After dawn,]

580
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:15,550
[it just got started.]

581
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:20,580
[Sweet on]

582
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:20,580
[See You Again]

583
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,560
[Exclusively on iQIYI]

584
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,220
Jin Ayin, are you ready?

585
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:28,740
Yes.

586
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,270
Are you ready?

587
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,510
Wangcai.

588
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,340
Play the video.

589
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:47,770
OK.

590
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,980
Compatriots.

591
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:59,400
The Central People's Government

592
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,690
of the People's Republic of China

593
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,000
is established today.

594
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,570
After so many years of war,

595
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,560
we finally won.

596
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,620
The Chinese people have finally arisen.

597
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,410
Indeed the man I've loved since childhood.

598
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:22,780
My idol.
