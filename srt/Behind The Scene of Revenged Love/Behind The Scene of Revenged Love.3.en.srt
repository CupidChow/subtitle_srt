1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,501
And then bam, you're on the floor.

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:03,920
Hey, don't go out of frame.

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,797
We're filming.

4
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:06,464
It's here.

5
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:07,716
Come on, act here, okay?

6
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,050
Tying your shoelace.

7
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,426
If you fall over there...
Hey, how is the camera supposed to film that?

8
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,137
Right. 3, 2, 1.

9
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:12,721
Action.

10
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:13,805
Bam.

11
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,307
That's a bit over the top.

12
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,268
Balala the Fairies. (A magical girl show)
That's not very realistic, sir.

13
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,311
My butt hurts from being grabbed.

14
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,604
How can I even roll?

15
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,107
Then just... after he grabs you,

16
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,025
you just turn your head around.

17
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,901
Just take a step back.

18
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:27,736
Yes, yes, that works.

19
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,487
I can't sit.

20
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:30,905
My butt hurts.

21
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,782
His grip is so strong.

22
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,616
Mhm.

23
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,201
Just say "snacks" will be fine.

24
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,829
Because earlier, there was a part about eating snacks.

25
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,290
Ah, he gave you a braised egg before.

26
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,708
First a braised egg...

27
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,542
then Jell-O...

28
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,085
and now a lollipop.

29
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,007
And then...

30
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:50,425
Yes, yes, yes.

31
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,427
You're treating me like a three-year-old.

32
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,515
No, you still have that other part.

33
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:58,600
You have to eat the lollipop.

34
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,101
First, you turn his face towards you.

35
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,227
You two have already kissed.

36
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,020
In this scene.

37
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,980
You've already kissed in the wheat field.

38
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,440
Episode 2.

39
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:06,733
Oh, sorry.

40
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,068
The wheat field kiss is in Episode 2.

41
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:08,777
Sorry.
You scared me.

42
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,904
Sorry, I was thinking of Episode 5, Scene 8.

43
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,365
And then bam, a slap.

44
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,658
Just when Li Wang is here.

45
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,452
Oh.

46
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,540
Okay.

47
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,041
Be gentle, okay?

48
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,459
Alright, alright.

49
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,835
Rejuvenate me.

50
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,462
Dr. Jiang.

51
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,298
Can you use your magic hands...

52
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,635
to rejuvenate me?

53
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,803
Da Wei is out of character.

54
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:37,430
Oh sorry.

55
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,765
He really slapped me.

56
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,724
Da Wei broke character.

57
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,392
It slipped. My finger slipped up.

58
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:41,935
I saw it.
Da Wei, I saw it.

59
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:43,144
Yeah.

60
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,355
Just hit him.
Let's just do a real hit.

61
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:46,397
Hit him.
Let's roll.

62
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,733
Quiet on set.

63
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,736
Okay, 3, 2, 1, Action.

64
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,325
Dr. Jiang.

65
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,247
I'm in desperate need of your magic hands.

66
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:03,706
To help...

67
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:04,833
me...

68
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,126
re...

69
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,168
juvenate.

70
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,922
Who said "one more take"?

71
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,635
That was a pretty good slap.

72
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,011
That one really stunned me.

73
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,805
Has no one ever slapped you before?

74
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,430
3, 2, 1.
Go.

75
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,308
How did you do that?

76
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,687
What did you say?

77
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,771
How long have you been standing here?

78
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,898
Never mind how long I've been standing here.

79
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,692
That guy likes you, right?

80
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,944
He's coming here for treatment
because he wants to pursue you, doesn't he?

81
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:34,404
No.
Listen to me.

82
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,824
I want to pursue you.

83
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:38,908
Let's start over.

84
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,118
I want you to be my master.

85
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,411
Be your master?
Yes.

86
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:42,912
Teach me.
Teach you what?

87
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,081
Teach me how to hook a man.

88
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,208
Hook a man?
Yes.

89
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:48,877
Teach me how to hook...

90
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,628
my ex-girlfriend's current boyfriend.

91
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,006
Are you crazy?
