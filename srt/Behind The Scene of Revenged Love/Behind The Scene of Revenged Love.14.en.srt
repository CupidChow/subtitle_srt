1
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:27,733
Come on.

2
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,233
Happy birthday!
So we're doing this, huh?

3
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:36,933
Happy birthday!

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,066
(Today is) the birthday of Mr. Ziyu, who plays Wu Suowei.

5
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:41,600
Birthday.

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,900
Let's all wish Mr. Ziyu a happy birthday together!

7
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,900
Thank you.

8
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,733
Your flowers.

9
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,366
Thank you.

10
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,866
Let me take a picture for you. Come on.

11
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:17,900
Happy birthday.
Thanks.

12
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,800
"Say hi hi to all the happiness..."

13
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,833
"My dear, my dear..."

14
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,400
"Hap-py-birth-day!"

15
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:47,066
Who's 22?

16
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,333
You, you're 22.

17
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:51,300
You're forever 22. Ouch.

18
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:55,233
Pretty heavy.

19
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:59,900
Three layers. Is it ice cream?

20
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,133
Yeah, three layers of ice cream.

21
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,733
Come on, hold it up.

22
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:03,533
Hold it, hold it.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I hold it?

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,266
Is it my birthday or your birthday?

25
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:13,633
Here we go.

26
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,633
Let's have you all do a simple self-introduction, okay?

27
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:45,166
Why don't you do it yourselves?

28
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,166
Sure.
Okay, come on.

29
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:48,566
Let's start with Tian.

30
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:50,900
I'm Tian Xuning, the actor who plays Chi Cheng.

31
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,033
Ah, just the three of us.

32
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:54,833
There are four.

33
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,666
Who did I miss?

34
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:03,300
I'm Ziyu, the actor who plays Wu Suowei.

35
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,100
I'm Zhan Xuan, the actor who plays Guo Chengyu.

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,133
I'm Liu Xuancheng, the actor who plays Jiang Xiaoshuai.

37
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,400
Why don't you guys talk about your character's backstory?

38
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,933
Let's talk.

39
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:20,133
Well, for me... in the beginning,
he was deeply hurt by a past relationship.

40
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,100
He might not trust this thing called love anymore.

41
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,200
Which led to him swinging both ways, you could say.

42
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:29,033
And then, after meeting him later on...

43
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,900
he started to believe in love again.

44
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,566
And then... for me, at the start...

45
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:41,200
I went through some self-doubt after a breakup.

46
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,800
And then after seeing her get together with you...

47
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:46,000
and also, many of my opportunities at that time...

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,533
to start my own business...

49
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:49,433
were ruined by you through a twist of fate.

50
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,200
So I decided I had to get my revenge on you.

51
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,766
But in the process of getting revenge...

52
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:57,533
I ended up throwing myself into it (falling for you).

53
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,233
Right. And later on, I felt like maybe...

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,266
maybe it wasn't such a bad thing after all.

55
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:06,566
In the beginning, I was just busy shipping those two.

56
00:04:06,566 --> 00:04:08,500
How did you start shipping the other CP?

57
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,300
When I first started reading, I was shipping them the whole time.

58
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,333
Started shipping the bros, huh?

59
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,300
Yes.

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,166
But I feel that with us two...

61
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,333
it's actually quite interesting too.

62
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,500
Right. Including in terms of my own personality...

63
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,033
The image I wanted to create is more...

64
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,766
roguishly handsome, cool, and aloof, but with a bit of a flirty side.

65
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,766
I'm Jiang Xiaoshuai.

66
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:36,233
And maybe after encountering some things in the past...

67
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:40,033
but then after meeting Wu Suowei...

68
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:43,733
I gradually started to open myself up.

69
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,733
And afterwards, I got along really well with Wu Suowei.

70
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:50,133
And he often comes to my clinic...

71
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,500
and jokes around with me and stuff.

72
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,866
And then I also started to find him interesting.

73
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:57,900
For me... as for Wu Suowei...

74
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,066
Are you shipping the right CP?

75
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,900
Because in the beginning, I only had scenes with Wu Suowei.

76
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,466
So I had a pretty deep impression of Wu Suowei.

77
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:08,633
But later on, I had some minor friction with Guo Chengyu.

78
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:10,533
Right, put it on your body.

79
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:22,533
Why not?

80
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,266
Closing your eyes is good too.
Closing your eyes is good.

81
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,600
Listen to him.

82
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,166
OK, close your eyes.

83
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:30,466
A little closer.
A bit more forward.

84
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:32,433
Hey, yes, yes.

85
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,333
And then change the position of your hand.

86
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:35,700
Your hand, hey...

87
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:39,966
Don't laugh.
Let's try another one.

88
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:41,233
Let's change it up again.

89
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,866
Move it down a little more.

90
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:17,733
Hey, yes, yes, good.

91
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,933
Those legs are really long.

92
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,266
Come on, turn towards the camera just a little bit.

93
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,133
Hey, right.

94
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,633
It feels like being caught cheating in bed.

95
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:35,633
Hahaha.

96
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:36,633
Come sit on his lap.

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,000
Go on, sit.

98
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,566
Where do I sit?

99
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,400
Oh my god.

100
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,433
Sit on one of his legs.

101
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:45,900
Isn't it weird to sit like this?

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,333
It's uncomfortable for my butt no matter how I sit.

103
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:51,700
Turn around.

104
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,333
Right.

105
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,433
Isn't this better?

106
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,433
Switch.

107
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:12,133
You're really getting more and more out of line.

108
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,033
Wrapped.

109
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:16,533
Xiaoshuai, sit up straight.

110
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:17,166
Come on.

111
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:20,766
Too far apart.
Too far.

112
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,233
Hurry up.

113
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm in a hurry.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,233
Quick.

115
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:26,100
Lie down.

116
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:28,533
You're lying down the wrong way.

117
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,000
Lie on my lap.

118
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,133
Lie on my lap, not sit on my lap.

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,800
Careful.

120
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:41,366
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:43,566
This is really tough on our little Shuai.

122
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:45,233
Look at the camera.

123
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,200
Hey, this one's good.

124
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,266
Yes.
Good.

125
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:52,000
This one looks good.

126
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,000
Looks good.
Praise me.

127
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:56,600
Come on.

128
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,466
Awesome.

129
00:07:57,966 --> 00:07:58,833
Come down.

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,800
Too close.

131
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,833
First you say we're too far.

132
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,866
Now you're saying we're too close.

133
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:06,033
No.
Look at the camera.

134
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:07,233
Look at the camera first.

135
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,700
Can you tilt a little more?

136
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,100
Like this?

137
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,566
This looks too weird for us.

138
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,100
Just find a comfortable position.

139
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,233
Guo Chengyu looks handsome here.
Xiaoshuai's...

140
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:25,033
Close your eyes.

141
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,433
Wake up.

142
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:32,566
I love you.

143
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,400
Okay.

144
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,466
Get up, the floor is cold.

145
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:44,433
Get up, the floor is cold.

146
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,066
My eyes are small.
I wear glasses.

147
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:47,733
To touch them up a bit.

148
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,666
If I had big eyes like you...

149
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,333
Oh my god.
I wouldn't even open my mouth.

150
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,300
I would speak with my eyes.

151
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,233
Is that so?

152
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:54,466
Yes.

153
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,900
Let's do it.

154
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,566
We're both in position.
Come on.

155
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:00,133
OK.

156
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:04,666
Move your faces a little closer.

157
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:05,966
A little closer.
Okay.

158
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:07,033
Good.

159
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:12,633
Don't put your hand out.
Like this.

160
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:15,066
Like this?

161
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,366
Oh, that works.
A full sense of security.

162
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,300
You have to look at the camera together.

163
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:23,366
Look at the camera.
Hey, hugging is okay.

164
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,066
Hugging works.
Hug me.

165
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,633
Yes.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,633
Right.

167
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:30,733
Control your expression.

168
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,833
Hey, don't be too...

169
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:32,966
Don't be so fierce, okay?

170
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:34,500
Love me a little, okay?

171
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,300
So serious.
Yeah.

172
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:36,966
Your expression...
A little fiercer.

173
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,100
No, I have to prop myself up with one hand.

174
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:41,366
You know, this half-up, half-down position...

175
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:42,533
is a bit awkward.

176
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:45,166
You're too weak, I don't love you anymore.

177
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,533
Okay, okay, I'm weak.

178
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:51,066
I'll lean a bit more... relaxedly.

179
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:51,666
More gently.

180
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:56,933
Come on.

181
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,000
Guo Chengyu, be a little sweeter.

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,900
A little sweeter.

183
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,333
Hey, right.
Both of you together.

184
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,066
