1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,900
He doesn't seem disgusted at all.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,800
You need to...
You need to be disgusted.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,600
At the beginning, you must act very disgusted.
The moment he grabs you...

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,500
He grabbed me with all his might.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,133
Right, so you need to give a reaction.

6
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:12,333
You need to put force into your hand.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,600
And also, you have to pull away.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,600
You have to pull away, and also...

9
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:17,633
Yes.
You need to have this kind of...

10
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:19,400
like you're grinding your back teeth.

11
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,200
You need to have this feeling...

12
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,700
Imagine a very "greasy" Xiao Long is grabbing you.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,500
You have to look disgusted.

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,300
You can't show any hint of happiness.

15
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:30,000
Your eyes filled with disgust.

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,200
There's no way I'm letting you go.

17
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,600
Don't laugh, don't laugh, you can't laugh.

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,800
The more you tell me not to laugh, the more I want to.

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,400
Put force into your hand.

20
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,800
You have to be extremely disgusted.

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,500
Yes, yes, yes.

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,500
You're really strong.

23
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,100
You have to be very disgusted.
You are a super straight guy.

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,100
I'm going to eat you up.

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,900
Smile.
You're really smiling.

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,400
You should just...

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,200
Just smile like this.

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,300
What's so funny?

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,300
Freeze for a little longer.
Right.

30
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,400
What are you doing here?

31
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:19,000
What are you doing here?
Come on, continue.

32
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:21,033
To change my dressing.

33
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,200
What are you doing here?

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,333
This is a bit awkward for me.
I should probably hide under the table.

35
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:31,633
When you see them...

36
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,233
When they do this... you two need to turn back and exchange a look.

37
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:35,533
I'm here to change my dressing.

38
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,400
Your home and company aren't that close to here, are they?

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Aren't there any clinics near your place?

40
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,100
Your home and company aren't that close to here, either.

41
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,700
What are you doing here?

42
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:46,300
Hey, no, you two are leaving.

43
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,400
How can he point at you two?

44
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,300
Where are you two going?

45
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,600
Right now you look like that guy from "Balala the Fairies"...

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,500
the Fake Smile Prince.
Prince Fun.

47
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,700
Let's do it again.

48
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,800
Let's run it from the top.

49
00:01:58,133 --> 00:01:58,833
Smile.

50
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,233
You can add something.

51
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,300
You can give him a line to cue him.

52
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,100
Then he can smile.

53
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:05,300
You say, "He told me he wants to..."

54
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,933
And I'll just say "me too" or something.

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,300
3, 2, 1.

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,800
Master, he told me he wants to sleep with me.

57
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,400
So I followed the advice you gave me before.

58
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,500
I said, "me too."

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
I can't smile.

60
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,200
Did you really say "me too" to him?

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,200
Stop laughing.

62
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,133
It's all your fault for giving me that lousy idea.

63
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,000
And now look.
So awkward.

64
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,200
He just hung up the phone on me.

65
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,100
He's disappeared.

66
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,600
How could you say something like that?

67
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,200
Then what should I have said?

68
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,500
Should I have said, "Come on over"?

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,300
Bro, I'm a woman.

70
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,300
I'm not a man.

71
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm not a woman.

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,800
This thing I have isn't just for show.

73
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,200
Come on, pick it up from here.

74
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,500
Go on, say something.
Make me laugh.

75
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:16,533
Head up.

76
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,433
Ah.

77
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:24,166
Ah!

78
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:35,533
It got in my eye.

79
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:36,533
Help me!

80
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,166
Quick!

81
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,166
Makeup! Makeup!

82
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,233
Here.

83
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,333
Quick, help him out.

84
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,666
It got in his eye.

85
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,266
I didn't bring eyedrops.

86
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:00,266
Eyedrops.

87
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,266
I want to taste yours.

88
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:06,933
Doesn't it all taste the same?

89
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,366
So sweet. I can already feel the sweetness.

90
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,033
If I turn like this...

91
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:17,033
Isn't that a bit much?

92
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,533
Don't hold it so far out.

93
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:19,633
You seem very reluctant.

94
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:20,766
You don't have to feed it all the way to his mouth.

95
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,700
You seem very reluctant.

96
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,766
You don't want to give it to him.

97
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,100
That's fine.
You can put it in the middle.

98
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:31,433
And you just go straight for the kiss.

99
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,866
Why did you lean in to meet him?

100
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:34,766
Don't lean in.

101
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:36,566
Sorry, I haven't shaken off the feeling from the last scene.

102
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:57,766
Okay, cut!
Come on.

103
00:04:58,366 --> 00:04:59,066
Da Wei.

104
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,433
Why did you lean in to kiss him?

105
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:02,766
Don't lean in.

106
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:05,133
After he kisses you, your face should be completely still.

107
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:06,166
Don't worry about whether he can reach you or not.

108
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:06,566
It's fine.

109
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:38,600
Then how do you know you like men?

110
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,533
I don't know if I like men.

111
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,066
I just know that I like you.

112
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:45,066
Saying this... isn't it just asking for a kiss?

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,466
Right.

114
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,833
It Is asking for a kiss.

115
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,466
Or how about this?

116
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:57,333
You stand up.
Face away from him.

117
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,300
Don't face him.

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,500
"I don't know if I like men."

119
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
"I just know that I like you."
You say, "I like you."

120
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,200
You have your back to him.

121
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,500
And then he comes over to kiss you.

122
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,533
"I just know that I like you."

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,300
Right.

124
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,000
Because when you say that, you're basically tricking him, right?
