1
00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:01,166
What are you doing?

2
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:03,533
Up here.

3
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:05,800
What are you doing?

4
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:07,933
I'm not buying this!

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,666
Stop wasting my time!

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,500
How dare you!

7
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:23,966
This snake is poisonous.

8
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:26,466
Don't laugh.

9
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:31,733
Don't laugh.

10
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,100
Are you all right?

11
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:35,866
I'm all right.

12
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:39,966
This snake is poisonous.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,966
There's a laugh in the back.

14
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:47,400
Are you all right?

15
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:49,500
It's okay.

16
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:53,300
This snake is poisonous.

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,666
Ok.
Done.

18
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:00,966
I didn't laugh.

19
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:01,633
Good.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,833
Could you help me with a light?

21
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:05,566
This take was fine.
Fine.

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,833
Yes.

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,900
Then move over a bit.

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,266
Just go with it.

25
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,433
Hey, you two.

26
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:29,333
Help me set the position after the pull apart and back grab.

27
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,133
Action.

28
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,000
I owe you.

29
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:45,800
I’ll definitely pay you back.

30
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:02,733
Ok.

31
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:04,233
You're so funny.

32
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:08,300
I don't know this.

33
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,400
Climb over, then.

34
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:12,000
You know that?
You...

35
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,100
We’ve slept in the same bed.

36
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:19,200
He even came and hugged him while sleeping?

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,666
He didn’t actually fall asleep.

38
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:21,666
Those two...

39
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,166
This can’t get out.

40
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,733
When did you come back?

41
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,566
Since the moment you started thinking of me.

42
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,533
How do you know...

43
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,266
that I was thinking of you?

44
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:51,366
How do you know
I was thinking of you?

45
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,533
Hey.

46
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,433
I get to decide...

47
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,433
The one who you were thinking of.

48
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,333
Suowei, can you not make that sound?

49
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,466
When did you come back?

50
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,433
From the moment you started missing me.

51
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:23,266
Hey.

52
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:26,966
Don’t smile like Xiao Tian!

53
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,166
There's no way that

54
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,966
I'm getting caught like this.
