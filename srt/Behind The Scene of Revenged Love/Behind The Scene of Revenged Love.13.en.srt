1
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:01,366
Come on.

2
00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:02,433
And then you snatch his phone.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,466
Snatch it from that side.
Yes.

4
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:07,033
Face recognition.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,333
Let me see first.

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,333
No, he didn't...
It's not locked.

7
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,866
Straight to it... Wow, a princess carry!

8
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:13,400
Princess carry and then toss him over there.

9
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,666
Where do I toss him?
Toss him over there.

10
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,100
Huh?

11
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:17,500
Toss him on the sofa.
Oh my god.

12
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:21,200
To think there'd be a day I'd be princess-carrying someone else.

13
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,533
How are you going to princess-carry him?

14
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,300
Just scoop him up from under his legs.

15
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,033
This isn't my dominant hand.

16
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,266
So strong.

17
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:36,200
I feel like I was lifted up in an instant.

18
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,866
Yes, one scoop.
Scoop him over there.

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:38,833
Go.
First...

20
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:40,833
You walk over first.

21
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:42,900
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

22
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,166
Don't move.

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,400
Let's just start from here.
No need to start over.

24
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:53,666
Are you okay?

25
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:55,766
Did you hit yourself anywhere?

26
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:57,466
It hurts a lot, stop pulling me.

27
00:00:57,466 --> 00:00:59,966
I feel like you're about to rip my ribs out.

28
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:00,800
Let's just hug then.

29
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:02,066
And then kiss.
Kiss as soon as you lift him.

30
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:05,200
This should be fine, right?

31
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:06,866
It's fine.

32
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:07,933
This is fine.

33
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,366
Hey!

34
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,200
Careful, careful.
Right, stop messing around.

35
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:13,500
This is too dangerous.

36
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,866
I didn't dare to move much.

37
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:15,433
Right.
Let's see.

38
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,700
Just a forceful kiss like this.

39
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,800
Are you shy?

40
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,866
Come on, you resist.

41
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:30,833
First, try out the posture for a forceful kiss.

42
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:31,566
Let me see.

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,133
Forcefully kiss me.
Come on.
Where?

44
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,200
Where do I forcefully kiss from?

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,333
Just yank him onto the table and kiss him.

46
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,466
Just grab his head and pull it over.

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,566
Mhm.
Yes.

48
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:43,133
And then you turn your head away.

49
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:43,833
Look at the window.
Look outside the door.

50
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:44,966
You say, "No."
"No."

51
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,600
Then you turn his face back again.

52
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,166
"Don't worry."
This...

53
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:48,066
Yes, yes, yes.

54
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,233
Turn his face back.

55
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:49,833
"I've already locked the door."

56
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,100
Then things should proceed downwards from here.

57
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:53,466
That's why he has that...

58
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:54,266
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

59
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:57,166
How do we proceed downwards?

60
00:01:57,466 --> 00:01:59,466
You have to flip him over and pin him down first.

61
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,266
Yes, this posture is very suitable.

62
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:03,433
This table.

63
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,800
Kissing, kissing, kissing, and then flip him over.

64
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,233
Right, just yank him.

65
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:11,600
Yes.

66
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,266
That's the idea.

67
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,300
The kind of master who turned you gay?

68
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:19,000
Look, it's so late.

69
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:20,433
Let's wrap up and go home.

70
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,766
Do you think I'm blind?

71
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,200
Hey, this shot is super cool.

72
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:25,733
Let me see.
Right.

73
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,133
And I can't even fight back.

74
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:28,566
I can only clamp his leg between mine.

75
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:33,800
Because I can't use any strength.

76
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,933
And then continue.

77
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:37,133
Hey, no.

78
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:38,133
Hey, right.

79
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:39,233
Practice this move.

80
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,000
Practice this move for a bit.

81
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,000
After you've kissed him,
besides kissing,

82
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,933
you must have some hand movements.

83
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,033
Slowly, slowly move down.

84
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:49,933
You can't be so aggressive.

85
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,500
Right.

86
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,533
Like dry tinder and a raging fire, sir.

87
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,533
Touch his hand, touch, slowly touch his belt.

88
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:57,800
And start unbuckling his belt.

89
00:02:58,866 --> 00:02:59,266
No.

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,566
It's a bit itchy.
Don't get the wrong idea.

91
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:03,433
No one is getting the wrong idea.

92
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,266
What are you doing?

93
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,566
My knee hurts.

94
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,500
Are you okay?

95
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm fine.

96
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,900
Failed at trying to look cool.

97
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,833
Holding his face.

98
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,800
I just like you wearing flowery boxer shorts,

99
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,433
clumsily making sugar figures,

100
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,933
and picking your feet while reading comics.

101
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,900
Can you not cover my ears?

102
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,366
You are my...

103
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,300
I just like you.

104
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,900
Who covers someone's ears when holding their face?

105
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:46,633
Okay.

106
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:47,866
I'll take you back to the clinic.

107
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,700
Every minute I'm with you,

108
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,266
I'm not myself.

109
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,933
I was going to ask, can my butt sit down?

110
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,100
Oh, that's true.

111
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,866
Actually...

112
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,100
Then it feels a bit like sitting just for the sake of sitting.

113
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,700
Like you want to sit but then suddenly stand up.

114
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:03,766
Actually...

115
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:04,400
Right.

116
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,533
Do you think this is how you look in my heart?

117
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:11,233
Hey.
Pause for a moment.

118
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,133
After the kiss.

119
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,633
"You think this is how you look in my eyes?"

120
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:18,866
Is there anything else you want to say?

121
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:21,266
I don't think so.

122
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,466
I'll take you back to the hotel.

123
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:26,666
Back to the clinic.

124
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,733
I'll take you back to the hotel.

125
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:30,600
Back to the clinic.

126
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:33,766
Action.
There are people outside.

127
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:37,366
Let's do it again.

128
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,600
This take wasn't intense enough.

129
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:40,766
The rhythm in the middle was very good.

130
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,633
I think the beginning wasn't intense enough.

131
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:45,300
Right.

132
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:46,466
The rhythm in the middle was very good.

133
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,633
The beginning needs to be more intense.

134
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:48,400
Like this.
Yes.

135
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:56,066
Stop.
Hey, that was intense.
That's good enough.

136
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,566
This take was very intense.

137
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,066
Very intense.

138
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,633
Right, just act according to this.

139
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:03,466
Should this be recorded too?

140
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,500
Cut.

141
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:07,266
I think you can move your position.

142
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,833
It's so weird.

143
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,633
What's up?

144
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,900
Turn over.

145
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:13,333
Come on.
Cut.

146
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,266
The moment he goes for your neck, you have to panic.

147
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:18,800
This is the office.
Right.

148
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,200
I should be more panicked.

149
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,266
Yes.

150
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:21,800
And then you pull him again.

151
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,333
The door is locked.
Come on.

152
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,400
Alright.

153
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,733
Let's go.

154
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,000
Wait a minute.

155
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,400
These pants...
The pants button.

156
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,200
What would happen if I undid one more button?

157
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:37,300
It's hard to unbutton.

158
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:39,200
Every time you rip my clothes off...

159
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,733
it feels like you're peeling off a layer of my skin.

160
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:53,133
Undo a couple more buttons.

161
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,200
You're about to peel my skin off.

162
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:58,533
It's hard to imagine what it'll be like when we really let loose later.

163
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,200
That's good enough.

164
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,733
Very good.
Looks good.

165
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:02,233
Looks very good.

166
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:02,866
Okay.
Come on, get your clothes back on.

167
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:04,566
Get dressed.

168
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,133
Alright, we're going to start shooting the dialogue scene.

169
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,500
After the action scene comes the dialogue scene.

170
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,933
I have a feeling of having been "played with."

171
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,066
It looks so damn good.

172
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:21,333
"However simple you want it to be, that's how simple it is."

173
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:25,200
"That's the philosophy my mom told me."

174
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,133
My mind is full of you.

175
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,166
My heart is full of you.

176
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,766
I'm not leaving.

177
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,233
I'm calling a designated driver.

178
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:36,066
Let him finish his scene.

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,066
I don't care.

180
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,266
This is fine too.

181
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,500
Yeah, it works.

182
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,700
This move is pretty good, right?

183
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:49,133
"Can we, can we ever meet again?"

184
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:53,300
"I pleaded before the Buddha for thousands of years."

185
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,200
"Willing to trade lifetimes for our one life of love."

186
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,633
"Hoping to move the heavens."

187
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:04,333
I'm not leaving.

188
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,966
I'm just making a phone call.

189
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,700
Don't go.

190
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:11,600
Don't worry.

191
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,133
Then I'll sing a song for you.

192
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:18,433
Go on, sing.

193
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:22,966
"The ends of your dark hair are coiled into a circle..."

194
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:26,433
"entwining all my attachment to you."

195
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:28,633
"Through the translucent door curtain..."

196
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:34,233
"the words spoken from my lips hold no deceit."

197
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:39,033
"The gray tiles on the roof coiled into a circle..."

198
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:51,400
Okay.
So sweet.

199
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:52,700
Okay.
So, so sweet.

200
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:54,366
So sweet it's killing me.
I was screaming.
