1
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:04,900
Chi Cheng enters.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,666
Elizabeth walks with her mother and sisters.

3
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:09,500
She thinks about what she just heard.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,066
Maybe she could share it with the others.

5
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:13,500
Just then,

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,400
Sir William Lucas appears.

7
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:19,033
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,800
I knew you'd be here.

9
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,833
Watch your mouth.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,333
This is a civilized place.

11
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:30,733
Civilized place.

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,200
Sorry, my bad.
Let’s do it again.

13
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,100
I said the word wrong.

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,733
It’d sound really strange that way.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,766
Sorry.

16
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:37,033
I’m not leaving tonight.

17
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:38,900
Huh?
Why not?

18
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:45,433
Huh?

19
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:47,700
Ok.
Cut.

20
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,000
Don’t make it too forceful at the start.

21
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,800
Don’t make it too forceful at the start.
Right.

22
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:54,400
3, 2, 1...
Action.

23
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,133
I’m not leaving tonight.

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,433
Huh? Why?

25
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:02,433
You’ve already trapped me.

26
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:03,966
How could I leave?

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,200
Let go.

28
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,066
Let go.

29
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,233
Good.
Cut.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,366
That one's fine.
Good.

31
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,666
Get up!

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,933
Why is this bed so short?

33
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,700
Just put your feet outside.
Right.

34
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:23,033
You’re insulting me.

35
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:24,600
I made you a promise.

36
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:26,700
And I’ll keep it.

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,400
Hmph.

38
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,633
Is this a good shot?

39
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:35,066
This is kind of tricky.

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,433
Let’s switch sides.

41
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:39,966
Me sleeping on the inside doesn’t make any sense.

42
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:40,500
Right, exactly.

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,600
You sleeping inside makes no sense at all.

44
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:44,666
Are you mad?

45
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,133
What would I be mad about?

46
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,333
Just look at me.

47
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:52,766
What’s there to see?

48
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:00,533
Don’t pull that trick on me.

49
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,666
Isn’t that what works best on you?

50
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:03,500
Chi Cheng,

51
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,666
I only panic when you’re upset.

52
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,700
I made you a promise,

53
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,200
and I’ll definitely keep it.

54
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,700
Stop pushing me.

55
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:33,100
Cut.

56
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,766
Not the right time to put down your leg.

57
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:36,266
But it felt really comfy.

58
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:38,066
It feels strange to keep my leg up the whole time.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,433
Right?
When he’s talking, I just...

60
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:42,033
Wrong leg?

61
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,033
It's not how you should keep your leg up.

62
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:47,000
Of course it’s uncomfortable.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,733
No, it's...

64
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:48,633
Right.
This way.

65
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:50,766
Press against him.

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,933
Push against him to stop him from squishing you.

67
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:56,166
Like you’re about to kiss him.

68
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:56,966
Show me.

69
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,266
Don't kiss.

70
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,633
Yes, this feels right.

71
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:07,800
Right.

72
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,633
Um,

73
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:10,400
Suowei, lift your chin a bit.

74
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:11,800
Not too much.
Right.

75
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,166
Or else there’ll be...

76
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,500
Right.

77
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:18,733
Ok, cut.

78
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,333
What are you doing?

79
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,266
I thought the shooting was over.
