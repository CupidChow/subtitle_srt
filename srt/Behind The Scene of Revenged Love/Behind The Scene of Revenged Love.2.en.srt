1
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:08,883
The certificate?

2
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:18,852
The certificate?

3
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,659
The certificate?

4
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,497
I'm asking you a question.

5
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:43,710
Good.

6
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:44,669
Cut!
That's a wrap.

7
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,047
That's a wrap.
Everything's okay.

8
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:52,552
I tried to hold it in.

9
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:55,847
Couldn't hold it in at all.
When I saw your...

10
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,475
Why did you want to laugh?

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,018
Trying to hold back a smile is harder
than controlling an AK rifle.

12
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,314
Walking over with such a swagger.

13
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:05,648
The certificate?
Cocky, huh?

14
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,233
I'm asking you, are you feeling cocky?

15
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,072
Hey.

16
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,157
Don't use your feet.

17
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,742
A diamond...
A diamond bracelet.

18
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,535
The bracelet is digging into my arm.

19
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:18,328
It hurts.

20
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,038
Sorry.

21
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,544
Are you using a stapler on me, sir?

22
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,962
Giving you a tattoo.

23
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,715
Look at this move.

24
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,928
Bitten by a snake.

25
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,513
Hey.

26
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,560
It hurts.

27
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,565
Gangzi.

28
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,362
Don't start my car.

29
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,738
And you can't be too high.

30
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,240
It will block your faces.

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,034
Take off that damn chain of yours.

32
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,327
It's okay, I'll be careful.
Don't worry.

33
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,162
I'll be careful.

34
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,165
What, I have to hold this pose?

35
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,125
Just letting you try it.

36
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,042
3, 2, 1, go.

37
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,837
Hey, what are you doing?

38
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,337
Hey!
Don't move.

39
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,674
Ah, my ear!

40
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,426
It's become the warehouse department again.

41
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,220
Wasn't it something else before?

42
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:17,804
No.

43
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,806
Just say it's become the warehouse department again.

44
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,015
It's become the warehouse department again.

45
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,142
That's not hard to say.

46
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,434
It's become the warehouse department again.

47
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,353
It's okay, that part is a voice-over.

48
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,105
Just don't break character and laugh, okay?

49
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,731
And then, "It's become the warehouse department again."

50
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,983
And then, "Pay up."

51
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:30,817
You say, "I don't care."

52
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,318
"Pay up, I don't care about the rest."

53
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,403
"How much?"
Right.

54
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:34,988
5 minutes.

55
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,200
Gangzi.

56
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,994
Pay him 5K.

57
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,037
Pay him 5K.

58
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:44,706
I forgot about this part.
I almost forgot.

59
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,207
Come on, let's do it again.

60
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,208
3, 2, 1...

61
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:47,709
Action!

62
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,128
Hey!
Gangzi.

63
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,506
Open the door.

64
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,344
Hey, you can't drive that car.

65
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,804
Not even God himself can drive it.

66
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,139
What are you yelling about?

67
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,807
I am God himself.

68
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,107
Good.
That's a wrap.

69
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:16,237
Come on.
3, 2, 1.

70
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:17,655
Action!

71
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,035
Get up.

72
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,536
Are you okay?

73
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:25,747
Thanks.

74
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:26,956
I'm fine.

75
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,754
You faked that fall.

76
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,632
You dared to fake helping me, why can't I fake a fall?

77
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:39,761
Okay.
Cut!

78
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,641
Is it raw?

79
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,850
Let's roll.

80
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:48,770
3, 2, 1.

81
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,562
Action!

82
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,232
Are you okay?

83
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,867
You faked that fall.

84
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:04,535
Cut!

85
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,750
Are you hurt?

86
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,217
Action!

87
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,095
You faked the fall.

88
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,388
You faked helping me.

89
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,472
So I can't fake a fall?

90
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:26,933
I'm really not a thief.

91
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,935
I'm just a lowly videographer.

92
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,687
I'll give the phone back to you.

93
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,272
Your phone.

94
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,568
Believe me now?

95
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,778
I'm really not a thief.

96
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,125
Thank you for your hard work.
Mr. Ziyu.

97
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,502
It hurts so much, so much.

98
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,006
Let's roll.

99
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:58,506
3, 2, 1.
3, 2, 1.
Action!

100
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,929
Why did you splash me with that sugar figure the other day?

101
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,807
So that was you?

102
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,100
No, bro.

103
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,935
I didn't mean to splash you.

104
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,020
I was trying to splash the person next to you.

105
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,313
No.

106
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,231
Actually, I wasn't trying to splash anyone.

107
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,024
My hand slipped.
I'm sorry, bro.

108
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:21,863
You didn't use much force, did you?

109
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,658
Guo Cheng Yu, try not to actually smoke the cigarette.

110
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,035
Just hold it in your mouth.

111
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,162
And when he throws a fry at you,

112
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,539
you can put the cigarette down then.

113
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,749
Try not to let the smoke get on your face.

114
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:34,751
Hey.

115
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,835
Come on.

116
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,627
Let's adjust.

117
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,131
This isn't working.

118
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,343
It's okay.

119
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,303
Happy even when I lose.

120
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,222
Okay.

121
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,223
That's a wrap.

122
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,141
Good.
That's a wrap.

123
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,117
Am I in this take?

124
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:08,826
Isn't that obvious?
Of course.

125
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,244
You can't escape.

126
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,329
Where are you trying to run?

127
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,831
I've been drinking Wang Zhenlong's water all day.

128
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,957
How could I let you get away?

129
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,720
Are you nervous about the first day of shooting?

130
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,846
I think it's fine.
Not that nervous.

131
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,473
Because the scenes for the first day...

132
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,852
don't have a lot of intense emotions.

133
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,565
Can you share your first impression of your CP (on-screen partner)?

134
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,818
Very tall.

135
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,071
A 1.9-meter-tall giant.

136
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,906
I always have to look up at him.

137
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,619
He's very tall and quite handsome.

138
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,412
Mhm.

139
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,706
Are you looking forward to your first scene with Chi Cheng?

140
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,376
The eye contact we just had...

141
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,294
Does that count as our first scene?

142
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,214
Or do we have to have a proper conversation?

143
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,757
A more formal one.

144
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,093
Then I'm really looking forward to it.

145
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,887
After all, we'll be seeing each other every day
for the next two months.

146
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,765
Dozens of scenes.

147
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,560
How many times have you read the script?

148
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,312
At least twice.

149
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,564
Almost three times.

150
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,150
Do you like the character Wu Suowei?

151
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,734
I think Wu Suowei is a lot like me.

152
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,696
Because in real life, I'm also a pretty frugal person.

153
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,947
I'm someone who...

154
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,117
if I don't have to spend money, I won't.

155
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,785
Uh...

156
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,621
I can't really say I'm a loser...

157
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,457
But I'm quite a homebody.

158
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,918
Whatever happens, I usually feel...

159
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,296
I usually feel pretty "whatever" about it.

160
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,797
Not the character's "Wu Suowei" (meaning 'doesn't matter').

161
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,257
But I genuinely feel "whatever."

162
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,926
Besides that,

163
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,637
is there any other specific reason you like this character?

164
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,223
Mainly, I think Wu Suowei has this quality...

165
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:59,103
of being willing to achieve his goals...

166
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,356
with a determination and willingness to sacrifice everything.

167
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,066
He's a very resilient person.

168
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,028
Including later on when he falls in love with Chi Cheng.

169
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,905
His relationship with Chi Cheng...

170
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,616
It's not that he just suddenly turned gay.

171
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,034
It's that I turned gay "for him".

172
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,161
And I only turn gay for him.

173
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,496
Only he can make that happen.

174
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,625
So, just now with Chi Cheng...

175
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,627
in your first shot together,

176
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,545
the first shot of the first scene, that eye contact...

177
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,796
How did it feel?
A bit far.

178
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,882
To be honest, I couldn't see his eyes clearly.

179
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,343
Alright, okay.

180
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,597
Are you nervous about the first day of shooting?

181
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,806
Not nervous.

182
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,683
Not nervous at all.

183
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:44,106
Second, tell me your first impression of your CP.

184
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,692
My first impression...

185
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,946
During the script reading...

186
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,074
He's really cute, honestly.

187
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,244
Do you know what Wu Suowei said about you?

188
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:56,786
What did he say about me?

189
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,954
He said you're very tall.

190
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,790
I thought he was going to say I have a resting bitch face.

191
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,584
Next one.

192
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,669
Third.

193
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,380
Are you looking forward to your first scene

194
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,257
with Wu Suowei?

195
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,676
Of course I'm looking forward to it.

196
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,556
Fourth.

197
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,766
How many times have you read the script?

198
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,434
Twice.

199
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,896
Including the script reading?

200
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,481
With the script reading, about that many.

201
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:26,482
A little over two times.

202
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,650
Sometimes I'll glance through it.

203
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,277
Like, sometimes I might look at a scene and then...

204
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,403
flip back and forth a bit.

205
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,404
Flip through it again.

206
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,574
Do you like the character Chi Cheng?

207
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:35,575
Yes.

208
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,867
Why do you like him?

209
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,202
Because he has a lot of tension.

210
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,287
A whole lot of tension.

211
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,667
Last question is...

212
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,669
Because it's the first day,

213
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,005
and the first shot was the one where you two made eye contact.

214
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:49,589
Mhm.

215
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,881
That scene...

216
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,967
You mean how it felt?

217
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,135
Yes, how did it feel?

218
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,387
Honestly?

219
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,972
We haven't connected yet.

220
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,307
For real.

221
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,142
We need to keep working on it.

222
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,185
Wu Suowei gave a similar answer.

223
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,646
He said it was too far, and he couldn't see anything clearly.

224
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,273
We really haven't connected yet, we haven't.
