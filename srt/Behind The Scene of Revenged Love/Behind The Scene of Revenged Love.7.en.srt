1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,233
Do you want to...

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,966
take things a step further?

3
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:11,900
How is it?
Delicious, right?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,200
Okay.

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,533
Is it necessary to walk that far away?

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,400
You're about to fly away.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,866
A medium close-up or what?

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,300
Do you want...

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,100
a deeper relationship?

10
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:33,600
Okay.
Cut.
That was great.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,200
Great.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,733
See?

13
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:37,800
Awesome.

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,400
The way we interact in real life...

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,900
is actually more like these two in the show.

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Like, I'm always teasing him.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,500
You two can just be yourselves then.

18
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,800
He was definitely nervous for the first scene.

19
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,600
But it's okay, because this scene itself is...

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,000
I just told him,

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,300
I said, "I would fall for you in real life."

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,900
Just imagine it.

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,000
He imagined it and got scared to death.

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,200
Just kidding.
Oh, so that's the feeling.

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,600
No.
OK.

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,900
He washed his hands, they're very clean.

27
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:05,200
Right.

28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,466
Even if I didn't, he wouldn't mind.

29
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,566
Right. Come on.

30
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:09,400
I've already placed two pillows.

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,600
Yeah, that's what I mean.

32
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,700
Give me some personal space.

33
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:14,800
Okay, that works.

34
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,000
Don't move your head.
Right, where's your position?

35
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:26,966
Now you're lecturing me, huh?

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,800
Lower it.

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,100
Hey, you.
Xiao Shuai, come forward.

38
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,000
Xiao Shuai, forward.

39
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,300
I feel like I have Parkinson's.

40
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,066
Lower it a bit.

41
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:49,900
Slower.

42
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:55,833
I don't want to eat it.

43
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't rush, hold still.

44
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,100
Try your best to hold steady.

45
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:18,766
Good take.

46
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,966
You're laughing at me here, aren't you?

47
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:26,666
Laughing again, huh?

48
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:28,566
Come on.

49
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:30,566
Give me some pillow.

50
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:33,966
Woke up?

51
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:35,166
Not yet.

52
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:44,166
Why are you putting your leg on me?

53
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:53,766
And then hold back from kissing.

54
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,366
He moved out of the way.

55
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:01,366
Let's do it.

56
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,766
I finally get to be on top of him for once.

57
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,366
Put the folding screen here and...

58
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:10,666
the bedside table back in place.
