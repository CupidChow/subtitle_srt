1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,400
Take a bite.
One bite.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Just one bite.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,200
These two are different things.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,100
Let me try.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,633
It's not cooked, sir!

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,300
Did you eat the skewer from his hand?

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,100
I didn't eat that one.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,300
I'm done for.

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,500
It's over for me.

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,466
Quick, protect me!
Shuai Shuai.

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,500
Director: Everyone's quieting down.

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,800
Director: Slowly settling down now.

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,700
Settling down...

15
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,266
Stop hitting me!

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,400
What's this?

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,466
This is a designer brand.

18
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,066
I don't care.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
That outfit costs a fortune.

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,466
It holds its value well.

21
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:48,166
You two good-for-nothings.

22
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:51,166
Button it up.

23
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:54,666
I can't seem to button it properly for you.
My hands are too slippery.

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,866
You guys, stop fighting.

25
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:02,866
If you're going to fight, go do it in the dance studio.

26
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:05,566
Hey!

27
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:09,966
Give it to me.

28
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,166
Don't play.

29
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,266
What are you doing?

30
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:20,966
Okay, come on.

31
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:21,866
Come to hit me.

32
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:23,066
Come to hit me and annoy me.

33
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:23,866
I'm tired.

34
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:25,466
I'm tired.

35
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:26,666
So tired.

36
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:30,066
You can put it inside.

37
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:33,966
Smaller.

38
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:42,366
Chi Cheng.

39
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:43,166
Ouch!

40
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:47,566
You almost scratched me.

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,600
Hey, it's surprisingly not that scratchy.

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,200
I shaved today.

43
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,400
I have a standard

44
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,600
V-shaped face.

45
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,500
Ah, so you're like this.

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,266
Right.
Okay, come.

47
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,400
Let's do the next take.

48
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,200
Wu Suo Wei, turn your face a bit more.

49
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Turn and get closer to him.
Yes, like that.

50
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,000
Now look back here.

51
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,000
Right.

52
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,200
And then, a big smile.

53
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:29,866
Broad shoulders.

54
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:44,866
I drew

55
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:47,266
the costume that you often wear.

56
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:47,966
The deep V-neck.

57
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:49,566
I'm done drawing.

58
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:53,100
Come and show it to everyone.

59
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,500
Can we have a "BE" song?

60
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,166
Do you still love me?

61
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,700
Why are your eyes reflecting light?

62
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,900
Because you are in my eyes.

63
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:36,666
How did you do that?

64
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,866
How should I know?

65
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:39,166
Don't stand on your tiptoes.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,366
We need a bit of a height difference.

67
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:43,566
It's not like I...
What's your height?

68
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:44,966
I don't know.

69
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,400
Guo Cheng Yu, your hand a little lower.

70
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,900
Yes, yes, like that.

71
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:54,966
Good, hold that pose.
Let me see.

72
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,366
Do you still love me?

73
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,066
How come there's another camera here?

74
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm a cool and aloof person.

75
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,800
Please edit this part out, thanks.

76
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:13,766
Ta-da!

77
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:14,300
We're rolling!

78
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,400
Stop with the "ta-da."

79
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,066
Let's try it.

80
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,666
Right.
Okay.
Guo Cheng Yu, come on.

81
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:20,066
Bring your face over a bit.

82
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,366
Higher.
Tip of the nose.

83
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:24,400
Right.
Good.

84
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,800
Losing all of this is a sin.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,766
But I can't watch you leave.

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,566
He's getting shy.

87
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:38,700
I can't look at you.

88
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:41,566
Xiao Shuai, don't move.

89
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,300
Xiao Shuai's gaze...

90
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,600
Guo Cheng Yu, move a little closer and up.
