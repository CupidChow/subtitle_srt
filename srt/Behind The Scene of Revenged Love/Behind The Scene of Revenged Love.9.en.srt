1
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:04,600
Let me tell you...

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,000
any "snake" that Chi Cheng has...

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,633
CEO Guo here has a copy of it.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,200
Can you sell this snake to me?

5
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:16,900
Are you kidding me?

6
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:19,800
How could I take your money?

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,733
Li Wang.

8
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,300
Find a glass tank.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,400
Put this snake inside.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,000
And send it to his clinic.

11
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:32,400
Aren't you going to ask me why I want to buy this snake?

12
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:37,600
As long as you need it...

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,133
As long as you need it...

14
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:45,900
Wait a second.

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,900
Ah.

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,833
I don't need a reason to give you things.

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,400
I don't need a reason to give you things.

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,700
As long as you need it.

19
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:55,633
OK.
Let's do it.

20
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:56,900
Go.

21
00:00:58,233 --> 00:00:59,100
Just walk off?

22
00:00:59,300 --> 00:00:59,900
"I'll give you things."

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,400
Release the snake.
Come on.

24
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,533
Release the snake, right?

25
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:07,666
Now that we've run through the lines...

26
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,000
let's go through the blocking.

27
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:11,166
I have never been so...

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,466
Your way of expressing love...

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,000
is truly direct.

30
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:22,066
Okay.
Good.

31
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:24,266
Come on, let's walk through it again.

32
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:25,800
Should I give him an elbow strike?

33
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:28,400
Later, when you're sleeping, you elbow him, right?

34
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:29,866
Yeah.
There's no elbow strike.

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,966
You can give him one if you want.

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,800
Up to you.

37
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:40,800
"Your way of expressing love..."

38
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:42,200
"is truly direct." And then...

39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
After "...truly direct," turn around.

40
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,700
And then you just grab him...

41
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,600
Yank him back.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,100
Hey, hey, hey.

43
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,166
This leg position doesn't look good.

44
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:48,800
Doesn't look good.

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,400
Turn him more that way.

46
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,700
Scoot your butt over.
Look.

47
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:52,900
No.
His leg...

48
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:54,400
No, when he holds you...
Look, like this...

49
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:56,266
You still need to be slightly to the side.

50
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Turn your leg that way.

51
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,066
Turn his leg towards you.

52
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:00,866
Right.

53
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,566
Handsome.

54
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:03,966
You're a grown man.

55
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,166
What's the damn use of me saying those sweet nothings?

56
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:06,500
Right.

57
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,066
That's about it for the details.

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,800
It's fine.

59
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:12,766
That's it.
It ends here.

60
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,400
Then it's time to take a shower.

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,066
That's it. It's over.

62
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:19,266
Your way of expressing love...

63
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,600
is way too direct.

64
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:22,700
And he's secretly smiling over there.

65
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,000
We're all grown men.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,566
Hey.
Looks really good.

67
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:29,766
Okay, good, just like that.

68
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:30,466
Okay, let's go.

69
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,766
So comfortable, continue.

70
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:41,500
We're all grown men.

71
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,600
What's the point of that bullshit sweet talk?

72
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,066
Give a smile.

73
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,266
Good.

74
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,266
Cut.
Very good.

75
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,366
You stole my line!

76
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:00,866
Come on.
Ready to roll.

77
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:02,966
3...
2...
1...
Action.

78
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,866
We're all grown men.

79
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:08,666
Okay, good.

80
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:11,666
OK.

81
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:14,466
No...

82
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:15,600
You're so annoying.

83
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:21,066
Ready.
3...
2...

84
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:22,100
1...
Action.

85
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, cut.

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,466
Don't go for the neck.

87
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:26,666
Your hand wasn't on the neck.

88
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,666
It was only on the sofa.

89
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,066
Don't go for the back of the head.

90
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:31,666
Let's roll.

91
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,900
Your way of expressing love...

92
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:37,266
is too direct.

93
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,966
We're all grown men.

94
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:45,466
Is there any point in me making up sweet talk to trick you?

95
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,500
Okay, let's go.

96
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,066
I flubbed my line.

97
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,466
I swallowed my words.

98
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,700
Why would I make up sweet talk to trick you?

99
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,766
Okay.
Cut.

100
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,766
Let's get pickups for two spots.

101
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,000
We're all grown men.

102
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,466
Is there any point in me making up sweet talk to trick you?

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Good.

104
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,500
The way that ended just now was quite good.

105
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,166
That's good enough.
That's a wrap.
