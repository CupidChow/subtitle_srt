1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,300
Yes, that looks really good.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,666
Come on, give the camera a little more.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,600
Yes, yes, yes.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Hey, yes, this angle looks really good.

5
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,566
We're both about to fall asleep.

6
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,500
Sorry to trouble you, Chi Cheng, let's get one more angle.

7
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:45,966
Are we done?
This is quite tiring.

8
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:49,833
Okay, that's good.

9
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,200
Thanks, Chi Cheng.

10
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:53,933
Every single move is meticulously designed.

11
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:55,733
Every angle.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,900
You have to constantly change your poses.

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,833
I believe in you.
Baby.

14
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:00,800
This one.
Yes.

15
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:02,300
You're usually so...

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,033
Right. Come on.

17
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,800
Just be yourself.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,200
What do you mean, "be yourself"?

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,733
Come on.
Let's do it.

20
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,700
Come on, let's get a good one.

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,733
Let's shoot a sultry one.

22
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:12,066
Let's go.

23
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:13,600
3, 2, 1.

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,466
Action.

25
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,700
Is Dr. Jiang off work yet?

26
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:25,200
I miss you a little.

27
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,500
Ready, 1, 2, 3, go.

28
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,600
Start walking.

29
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,100
Alright.

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,900
I was the one who slept on the floor yesterday.

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,600
Go.

32
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:12,766
Hey!

33
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,700
Can you do it or not?

34
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,400
I slept on the floor yesterday.

35
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,300
Useless.

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,866
Ride as far away as you can.

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,400
Give me a push with your foot.

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,700
Hey, where are you going? Who's looking for you?

39
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,600
One more take.

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,966
Da Wei, don't fall out of frame later.

41
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,666
About the posture for the kiss...

42
00:02:58,266 --> 00:02:59,933
Hmm, let me think about what it should look like.

43
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:00,866
The main thing is, if you're sitting here...
you're not that tall.

44
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,066
There's no feeling of you overpowering him.

45
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,733
She said you're not tall.

46
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:06,266
If you're sitting.

47
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:10,766
Ah, so delicious.
I haven't finished eating.

48
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:13,766
You want to feed him?

49
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:15,166
Here, you can continue feeding him.

50
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,500
I won't fight you for it.

51
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:19,966
What's wrong? Feed which one?

52
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:22,366
These peanuts are so good.

53
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,666
Salty and roasted.

54
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:25,733
But you didn't stand up.
Let me think.

55
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:27,466
Eat it.

56
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:28,666
Hold on, let me think about how to stand up.

57
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:29,766
You must eat it.

58
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:31,466
Let's see if we can give him...

59
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:32,933
Aren't yours loose like this?

60
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:34,166
Hmm? Like this?

61
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:36,166
Scoop them into his arms here.

62
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,366
Let's see if that works.

63
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,633
Quick, scoop them.

64
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:42,366
Yes.
Just scoop them up for him.

65
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:44,766
Just a small scoop.

66
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:48,066
It feels like it needs to be a little sweeter.

67
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,866
When you kiss him, you need to straighten up.

68
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:51,666
Don't hunch your back.

69
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:55,366
Or maybe we can prop you up on something from the start.

70
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,166
It won't be visible anyway.
