1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,766
The moment I saw him...

2
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:02,400
in our first scene together...

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,533
I forgot what my lines were.

4
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:06,200
Just say, "Does your neck still hurt?"

5
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:07,466
Does your neck still hurt?

6
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:10,000
It's alright.

7
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:11,400
It's just my chest...

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,133
There's also the matter of his chest.

9
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:16,000
He said his chest hurts a little.

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,933
It's fractured, of course it's going to hurt.

11
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:19,133
It's really fractured?

12
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:19,700
It's fractured.

13
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:20,800
How could it not be?

14
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,966
Give me a fracture right now then.

15
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:23,566
Of course a fracture is going to hurt.
Then he doesn't say anything.

16
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,166
He just looks pitiful.

17
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,366
Pout your lips a little.

18
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:27,333
Give him a reaction.

19
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,500
Then you say, "I'm sorry." Right.

20
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:30,666
You have to give him a reaction so he can deliver his line.

21
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,400
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:35,966
If I had acted sooner...

23
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:38,733
you wouldn't have been hurt so badly.

24
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:41,333
"After all, he is your beloved pet."

25
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:42,666
Don't look at him for that part.

26
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:45,633
Just mumble it to yourself.

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,433
"Well, he is your beloved pet after all."

28
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:50,333
Weiwei.

29
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:54,600
I promise I won't let you get hurt again.

30
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:56,566
What's wrong?
Is he sitting on you?

31
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:58,333
It's fine.

32
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:01,866
Cut!
Wu Suowei.

33
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:03,433
You can't turn your head back and forth.

34
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:04,433
Your neck is broken.

35
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:06,066
Right.
Come on.

36
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,600
You're too lively.

37
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,500
What are you doing?

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,000
It's nothing.

39
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,900
Okay, okay, okay.

40
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,633
Are you going to sleep or not?
If you're not sleeping, I'm leaving.

41
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:18,166
Don't go.

42
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:20,233
I'll sleep.

43
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,133
I'll sleep.

44
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:23,100
Okay? I'll sleep.

45
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:24,933
Then let's sleep.

46
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,466
Okay, cut!

47
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,666
Come on, let's adjust the overall vibe.

48
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:29,533
You two are a bit too...

49
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,933
You two are relatively a bit...

50
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,633
You're a bit too much like an old married couple in the beginning.

51
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,166
Right.

52
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,800
Let's adjust the vibe a little.

53
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:42,533
It's eleven o'clock.

54
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,366
Time for bed.

55
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:46,466
Alright.

56
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:48,266
Time to sleep.

57
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:49,200
Cut.
Good take.

58
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:54,933
The leg thing is fine, but...

59
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,333
Cut.
Good take.

60
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,700
"I was the one who got too deep into character..."

61
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,033
"but the ending is me all alone."

62
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,900
You hit me too hard.

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,433
This camera angle can capture the relationship with the snake.

64
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,000
And then look at the dagger.

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,500
Look at the dagger.

66
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,166
Hesitate.

67
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:47,666
Until...
Right.

68
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:48,800
Good.
That works.

69
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,333
You need to grab his hand a little.

70
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,200
Ah!

71
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,566
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,833
Ah!

73
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,133
I'm sorry.

74
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:00,200
Kiss.

75
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,433
Chi Cheng.

76
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,866
You paused for too long.

77
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,766
I'll take you back first.

78
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,200
You can come back tomorrow morning.

79
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:36,266
No, I want to stay here and watch over him.

80
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,566
It's enough for me to watch over him alone.

81
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,233
No.

82
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:41,933
I want to be the first person.

83
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:42,966
Da Wei sees when he wakes up.

84
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,600
Then that's all the more reason I can't let you stay here.

85
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,266
Let's go.

86
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:19,400
Okay.
Cut.

87
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,533
Good take.

88
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,400
The ambulance is parked outside.

89
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,666
No.
It's okay.

90
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:29,166
Hold steady.

91
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,400
Baby.

92
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:33,900
Why don't you switch places with him?

93
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,766
Weren't you two having a good time just now?

94
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:38,233
I'll switch with you.

95
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:39,233
Go on, get over there.

96
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:41,133
Their chemistry is so good!

97
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:46,633
Beg me.

98
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm begging you.

99
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,433
Let's start with a classic, "Suyan" (Bare Face).

100
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:02,733
You definitely know it.

101
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:04,900
You definitely know it.

102
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:07,266
You hurt my Xiaoshuai.

103
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:10,000
There was a period of time when I'd cry listening to "Suyan."

104
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,566
I'd cry the moment I heard the chorus.

105
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:13,333
Tears streaming down my face.
You've got a story to tell.

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,700
No.

107
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,833
It's because I was thinking about it quite deeply.

108
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,300
Because there's a lyric in it that goes...

109
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,633
It must have touched you.

110
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,500
There's a lyric that's something like...

111
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:23,933
What?

112
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:25,933
Something like "secretly laughing at others' smudged makeup."

113
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,600
"Without any performance."

114
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,733
What was it again?

115
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,966
It says something about being able to go out without makeup.

116
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:33,500
What I was thinking at the time was...

117
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,533
I felt that... no...

118
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,566
I felt that as I get older...

119
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:37,833
in this world...

120
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
I have already put on a mask of hypocrisy.

121
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,700
I can't be myself.

122
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,000
Whatever I do, I have to consider the consequences.

123
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,233
I can no longer walk down the street with a "bare face" (suyan).

124
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,966
So I thought really deeply about that lyric.

125
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:49,900
And I just cried.

126
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,033
Really.

127
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:53,100
You've got a story.
Really.
