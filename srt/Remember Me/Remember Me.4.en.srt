163
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,460
Try putting on an act while we're doing SOTUS

164
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,280
Why?

165
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,450

166
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880

00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,320
Aren't we from the same place?

345
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,870
What's up with this guy?

346
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,140
Hey

347
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,830
Take this

348
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,300
You look miserable

349
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,270
Are you alright?

350
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,080
Don't act like an old man

351
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,140
Nuck-Nan

352
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,000
Hm

353
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,300
Don't you think you welcomed me too hard?

354
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,390
You made a silly face

355
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,720
It irritated me

356
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,320
You're too serious about teasing me

357
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,270
When it comes to the girls, you let them pass easily

358
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,460
Stop nagging me

359
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Apply to be the cheerleader next week

360
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,020
What?

361
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,820
No way

362
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,260
I'm about to die with just today's activity

363
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,660
And what about you? You also don't have to go

364
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,350
Hey

365
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,220
I've already been the faculty star since I'm so handsome

366
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,730
I don't wanna go

367
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,450
Studying is busy enough

368
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,790
Don't talk back

369
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,990
I'm leaving

370
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,990
Please Nuck-Nan

371
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
I don't want to

372
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,270
Name!

373
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,210
What's up?

374
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,210
I'm exhuasted

375
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,880
How's life in BKK, is it alright?

376
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,500
Name, I have a new way to communicate

377
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,450
I want to try

378
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,820
Can I come in?

379
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,710
Em's calling, not sure what he wants to talk about

380
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,860
Hello, Name

381
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,460
I discovered a new way to communicate

382
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,900
From now on, I'll call you

383
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
You can response in MSN

384
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,510
So, I can tell you more detail about my life at BKK

385
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,600
Is it good?

386
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,300
Yes

387
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,090
See? only me can discover something cool like this

388
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,180
Is that right?

389
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,520
Yeahhhh

390
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,730
How was your day?

391
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,730
Hmmm..

392
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,550
Which stories you want to hear

393
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,030
All of them!

394
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
Then you have to pay for my phone bill

395
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,990
I'm so exhausted

396
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Nuck-Nan was hard on me

397
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,020
You talked?

398
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Don't you want to response?

399
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,670
I want you to move on from the past

400
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,140
Or should we go see Dr. Kamol?

401
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,670
Maybe he has some advice

402
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,670
If you need help, you can tell me

403
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,250
Oh! how was the new computer I bought for you?

404
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,250
Do you like it?

405
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:21,480
(People's talking)

406
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,220
Everyone!

407
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,970
Professor can't come today

408
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,150
He asked you to do Thai drawing in pair

409
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,190
You can choose whoever you want

410
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,640
Are you two a pair?

411
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,380
We've been pair for a long time

412
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,970
I have to go

413
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,000
Focus on this assignment!

414
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,820
Yess

415
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,840
(People's talking)

416
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,690
Golf

417
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,280
Have you got a pair?

418
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,650
Do you want to pair up with me?

419
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,780
Sorry, Dream

420
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,120
I already made a deal with Korn, if we have pair work, I'll work with him

421
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,910
I'm sorry

422
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,840
You haven't made any deal with me

423
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,240
I made it few minutes ago

424
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,570
I'd better pair with you because we're from the same province

425
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,460
Ahh, finally finishing class

426
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,110
Let's go eat!

427
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,550
Where do you want to eat?

428
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,550
Wait a second

429
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,550
Ok, I'll follow

430
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,500
Hey / Huh?

431
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,050
How was you accounting girl?

432
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,270
It was good

433
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,200
Damnnn, that means you continue talking in MSN?

434
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,290
Definitely

435
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,270
But she's already had a boyfriend

436
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,580
It's ok

437
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,360
Do you know "One night stand"?

438
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,000
That's it, my boy

439
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,210
Let's pack our stuff and go eat

440
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:35,910
What's it?

441
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,550
If you good enough,

442
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,870
You have to get this girl

443
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,440
I say this because you're my friend

444
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,850
This is Chompu, star of Social faculty

445
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,750
Why do I have to flirt her?

446
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,320
Because if you don't,

447
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,000
That means you're a coward

448
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Or you don't confident huh?

449
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,650
Huh, never say I'm a coward

450
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,020
Let's see

451
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,020
That's it!

452
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,230
Let's go eat

453
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,620
Hello, who are you?

454
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,220
Hello

455
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,390
I'm Nuck-Nan

456
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,390
Senior Law student

457
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,050
Where did you get my email?

458
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,140
I got it from my friend

459
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,530
Because I have to...

460
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,380
Do the research about human's need

461
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,100
I'm not familiar with it, so my friend gave me your email

462
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Because you study about this

463
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,060
Maybe you can help

464
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,930
Really?

465
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,770
Yes

466
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,660
Okay

467
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,010
I'll charge 100 baht per hour for the consult

468
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,040
Hahaha

469
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,530
You're not respone, I'm just kidding

470
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,580
You can ask me

471
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
I'll help if I can

472
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Actually, I'm not that good

473
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,380
Just have some knowledge

474
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,700
Thank you

475
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,760
Hey, bro

476
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,260
What?

477
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,260
You shouldn't have told me to apply

478
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,350
Why?

479
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,430
So tired

480
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,470
Did you know I have to dance all day?

481
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,470
Damn it

482
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,410
Like I'm gonna die

483
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,410
Don't complain so much

484
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,650
Just do it as an exercise

485
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,390
Nuck-Nan?

486
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,590
Can I ask you something?

487
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,660
What?

488
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,840
Please bring me to resign

489
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,210
Please

490
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:53,430
Let's say I have an F or something

491
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,430
Please

492
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,470
Don't touch me

493
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,430
Leave me alone

494
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,000
You smell bad

495
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,560
I'll take shower

496
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,430
Help me

497
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,430
Don't you have to text Name?

498
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,540
That's right!

499
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,929
You're right

500
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,000
I'd better take a shower

501
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,150
Thank for reminding me

502
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,750
Smell bad

503
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,670
Please talk to them for me

504
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,679
I'm sorry, Name

505
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,679
I went to cheer leader practicing

506
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,270
So tired

507
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,110
It's ok

508
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,460
I feel bad

509
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,900
I said I'll talk to you

510
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,040
I know you were waiting for me

511
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,630
I'll call you

512
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,830
Too tired to type

513
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,290
You can text me

514
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:38,610
Ok

515
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,150
Hello

516
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,840
Lonely huh?

517
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah, lately you've been busy

518
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:05,480
Yeah, I'll visit you on the school break

519
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,210
I'll buy you stuff

520
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,940
Lately, there're tons of assignments

521
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,340
Even though, it just a general subject

522
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,540
I'm also pratice cheer leader

523
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,760
I feel like I'm gonna die since the beginning of this

524
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,440
Hello, can you hear me?

525
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,640
Yes

526
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,180
Studying is so hard

527
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,770
Tomorrow I have a quiz

528
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,480
You can do it

529
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,290
Can you study for me instead?

530
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,740
How're other friends?

531
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,630
I haven't seen them

532
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,930
Gun might have a lot of work

533
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,880
He's an architechture student

534
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,690
And Champ lives far away from me

535
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,310
So, you rarely meet them then

536
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,250
Everyone's busy right now

537
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,000
Are you still there?

538
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Let's hang out with them later

539
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,520
Good night

540
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,530
I want to eat pickled fish

541
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
You're so loud, bro

542
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,920
What're you complaining?

543
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,160
Be quiet please

544
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,740
You look bad

545
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,220
Where are you going?

546
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,780
Study!

547
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,930
Do you have a night class?

548
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:03,380
Look at the clock! it's 8 AM

549
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,540
I'm not funny

550
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,700
Shit!

551
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,000
8 AM!

552
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,460
Why didn't you wake me up?

553
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,160
Am I you dad?

554
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,840
Wait for me, bro

555
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,700
Let's go

556
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,700
Wait a sec!

557
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,270
You already wear a uniform

558
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,290
What should I do?

559
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,590
Wait for me!

560
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,400
Alright

561
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,090
Hello

562
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:32,440
[The story of love]

563
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
[that once happened]

564
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,930
[was filled with smiles and tears]

565
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,370
[It's like the stars]

566
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,370
[so beautiful]

567
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:49,340
[and filled with fond of memories]

568
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,960
[It's like the season]

569
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
[that our heart felt lonely]

570
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,310
[You're the breeze I missed in summer]

571
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:04,630
[The warmth that was there every times I wished for]

572
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:09,160
[It made me wet on a rainy day]

573
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:14,840
[Please let me escape from here]

574
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,060
[from those good memories that I still remember]

575
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:26,320
[Please let me disappear]

576
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:33,380
[Because you stay and don't go away]

577
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,840
[Be a flower as lovely as a shining star]

578
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,230
But I want to get to know Chompu more

579
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,210
I want to meet you in person

580
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,460
Hey

581
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,940
Are you alright?

582
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,000
Yes

583
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,040
Whether you have or not have time to talk to him, at least you should tell him

584
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,040
Not letting him waiting for you

585
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,590
If it was me who have to wait, I would run away

586
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,160
How are you doing, grandson? Is studying make you tired?

587
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,640
People have to live their lives!

588
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,450
You can't stay in your room forever!

589
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,650
I want you to speak

590
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:23,040
[Writing until it becomes stories]

591
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:29,190
[before the day we shall be far apart]

592
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:37,300
[Keep our memories all along]

593
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:43,820
[knowing how precious they are to my heart]

594
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:52,060
[That familiar embrace]

595
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:58,460
[I can still remember it]

596
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:05,670
[The picture of you still look the same,]
