1
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,930
I have to go to volunteer camp, Name

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,990
I don't have time to call

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,610
so I text you

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,260
I can't use phone for 7 days

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,540
So,

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,450
I'll be gone for a week

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,830
It might feel lonely

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,380
but I know you can get through it

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,460
I'll come back ASAP

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,240
You have a new friend

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,800
Facing the reality maybe difficult,

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,000
but if we fear it,

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,950
we may have to put up with the pain

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,900
that gradually increases

15
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,480
[The story of love]

16
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,960
[that once happened]

17
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,810
[was filled with smiles and tears]

18
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,900
[It's like the stars]

19
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,229
[so beautiful]

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,310
[and was filled with fond of memories]

21
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,770
[It's like the season]

22
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,600
[that our heart felt lonely]

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,450
[You're the breeze I missed in summer]

24
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:58,580
[The warmth that was there every times I wished for]

25
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,030
[It made me wet on a rainy day]

26
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,820
[Please let me escape from here]

27
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,250
[from those good memories that I still remember]

28
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,280
[Please let me disappear]

29
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:27,160
[Because you stay and don't go away]

30
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,980
[Be a flower as lovely as a shining star]

31
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,310
[and still live in the dark lonely planet]

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,190
[It always has me, a keeper]

33
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,280
[who never walked away]

34
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:56,930
[The story of love]

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,000
[that once happened]

36
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,940
[was hidden even after a long time]

37
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,870
You remember the me in grade 4 that clearly?

38
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,180
Of course, you're quiet

39
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,290
I saw you in HI5 so I want to talk to you

40
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,140
It's been a long time. I miss you

41
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,030
We have many things in common

42
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
You'll be surprised when you find out

43
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,430
We're very similar

44
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,750
Is that so?

45
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:49,750
Let's talk again later. I'm going to have lunch

46
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,010
Roger that

47
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,580
And... please don't disappear

48
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
Where could I go? I'll be here

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,140
Look at you

50
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,260
full with happiness

51
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
Are you hungry? I'll make you something to eat

52
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,730
Wait a moment

53
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,380
Gun

54
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,670
Hey! Be quiet

55
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:05,880
Gun

56
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,850
Coming

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're so slow

58
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,330
I BB you many times

59
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,280
but you didn't reply even once

60
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,500
Is that so?

61
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,230
See for yourself

62
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,590
See?

63
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,740
Oh

64
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,010
My bad

65
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,490
I was too immersed in drawing

66
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,010
Eh?

67
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,390
How did you get up here?

68
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,480
Outsiders are not allowed in this dorm, you know?

69
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:36,780
Ha

70
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,450
Idiot

71
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,440
I walked up, obviously

72
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,180
And no one scolds me, don't you see?

73
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,409
Fine

74
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,760
Then why are you here?

75
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,060
Oh

76
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,220
Champ want us to eat out together

77
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,880
He told me to come ask you and Nuck-Nan

78
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,240
Wanna go?

79
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,680
Yeah. Good idea

80
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,680
It appears I want to pickled fish

81
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,000
Ha

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,610
Miss your hometown?

83
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,520
Like the Chachoengsao boy you are

84
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,710
I know

85
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,160
And you're a Chachoengsao boy too

86
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,910
Hehe

87
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,250
Should we go now?

88
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,130
Yep

89
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,210
Let's go. I'm hungry already

90
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,210
Let me tell Champ first

91
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,850
Hurry up

92
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,250
Okay, let's go

93
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,180
I'm done

94
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,370
Oh, Nuck-Nan may not come

95
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,370
He has to prepared for a test

96
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,570
He said he read it many times, but still couldn't remember

97
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,230
No idea when will he remember it all

98
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,380
What're you doing, Champ?

99
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,470
Don't you eat?

100
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,710
I'm working

101
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,980
This Facebook right here

102
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,900
Um

103
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,270
How do you sign up on Facebook?

104
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,300
Hey

105
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,730
It's so easy!

106
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,780
You just fill in the blanks/ Hm

107
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,490
A piece of cake

108
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,460
What?

109
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,110
Isn't Hi5 good enough?

110
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,920
Why the sudden change?

111
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,820
Em

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,650
You have to follow the trend

113
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,430
We already have 3G

114
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,780
Well

115
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,770
How about you?

116
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,540
How is it?

117
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,860
Did you pay the meal for us today...

118
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,679
because you want something?

119
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,679
Are you going to introduce us to your lover?

120
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,370
For sure! I know it!

121
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,299
Hey!

122
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,390
What lover?

123
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,620
I'm working!

124
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,400
I work 24/7

125
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,000
How could I find a lover?

126
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,200
Really?

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,310
Alright. Fine

128
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,950
It's good that you asked

129
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,990
I completely forgot

130
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,930
I treat you guys today because...

131
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,850
What is it?

132
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,690
This!

133
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,300
I won the Marketing competition for 2 years straight!

134
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,300
Look. Look. Look!

135
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,520
Hahaha

136
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,360
Am I great?

137
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,540
You're very clever!/ Wonderful!!!

138
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,470
You're amazingg

139
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,070
Mr. Champ, the marketer

140
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,040
Woww

141
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,400
You're the best!

142
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,620
Why don't you show it to your family?

143
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,420
Hm?

144
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,390
Um

145
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,200
Why did you show it to us?

146
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah

147
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,730
Sigh

148
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,000
I also want to do that

149
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,500
These awards and prizes

150
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,160
I want to make them proud

151
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,210
But I don't even have time for doing so

152
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,070
I have to study on weekdays

153
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,610
and do coursework on weekends

154
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,210
I'm tired with just the thought of it

155
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,560
We understand

156
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,770
But

157
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,280
Don't pressure yourself too much, Champ

158
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,780
Um

159
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,000
It'll be tiring

160
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,130
Yeah

161
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,780
Btw, Gun

162
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,300
How's your Mr.8?

163
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,270
Ah

164
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,000
What's wrong with you?

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,010
What? I can't hear you

166
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,640
How's your Mr.8?

167
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,760
I don't have that

168
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,780
Oh, you don't?

169
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,600
Yess

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,750
Is that so?

171
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,600
Yeah

172
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,580
Who's Mr.8?/ I have no clue

173
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,860
Hahaha

174
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,370
Gun./ What?/ do you know Mr.8?

175
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,300
NO

176
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,610
Well. Stop it

177
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,770
Oh, do you know we'll go home soon?

178
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,270
Huh?

179
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,590
Yeah! We're going home

180
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,440
Have you heard about the big assembly at Ratchaprasong?

181
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,390
My mom said it's very dangerous!

182
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,610
Yeah

183
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,050
You haven't, have you?

184
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,640
Btw, Champ

185
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,270
Huh?

186
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,490
There's also a flood

187
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,830
Won't you go home and see if it's safe?

188
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,740
We're going to do it

189
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,790
Wanna join?

190
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,120
Come with us

191
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,300
Come

192
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,140
Will you?

193
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,450
I'll answer you later

194
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,810
If possible, tell me before you go

195
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,420
Sure

196
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,040
Em

197
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,400
How is No Name?

198
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:46,700
Wait

199
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,880
Is my food not tasty?

200
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,680
I thought it was fine

201
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,780
It's tasty

202
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:52,960
The bone

203
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,060
There's a lot of fish bone

204
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,230
Be careful

205
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,480
Well, so...

206
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,460
How's Name?

207
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,550
I don't know

208
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,730
We rarely talk these days

209
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,250
Wait

210
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,290
What's wrong with you guys?

211
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:04,790
Hm?

212
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,790
Your faces are all red

213
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,480
One choked on water

214
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,050
and the other choked on fish bone

215
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,050
What's wrong?/ You asked in bad timing

216
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,710
See?

217
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,600
Is there something I don't know?

218
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,230
Let's eat, shall we?/ Yeah, let's eat

219
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,860
Come/ Eat this

220
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,680
Fine/ Hurry

221
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,540
It looks really good/ Of course

222
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,540
Come on, Champ

223
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,970
How is it?

224
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,840
I told you the weather is nice

225
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,150
The breeze is cool

226
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Didn't you say you want to run?

227
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,580
You may go

228
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,470
No way

229
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,480
It's not that I want to run

230
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,580
I run every day, so today I want to sit and relax with you

231
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,060
Hm?

232
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,150
That can't be

233
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
If you don't want to run, why would you wear the workout suit?

234
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,710
Hm?

235
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,490
Just go

236
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,570
I'll read a book and wait here

237
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,310
If you say it like that...

238
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,310
then I guess I'll have to go

239
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Wait here and don't go anywhere else

240
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,850
I'll be right here and not go anywhere

241
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,450
Wait for me

242
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,680
Awww

243
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,060
I'm done

244
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,780
Are you tired?

245
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,800
Thank you

246
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,730
It's 200 baht

247
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,480
I can pay more than that

248
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,560
Err

249
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,180
Suddenly quiet

250
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,430
Will you be my girlfriend?

251
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,580
What did you just say?

252
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,190
Please be my girlfriend

253
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,050
Are you sure?

254
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,790
Being with me it's....

255
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,000
Not like being with other normal girls

256
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,390
I'm sure

257
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,640
You don't have to say you're sure right away

258
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
We'll try this out together

259
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,450
Then later on, you can tell me that you're sure or not

260
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,730
If we never try, then we'll never know, right?

261
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,910
Umm

262
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,160
I hope you won't find me boring too soon

263
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,250
I won't

264
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,880
I'll wait to see

265
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,450
Have time for everyone, except me

266
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,110
I have time for you

267
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,430
Don't worry too much

268
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:08,590
If he's busy, you just do something else

269
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,500
What am I gonna do?

270
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,910
Talk to someone close to you

271
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Your family, maybe

272
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,200
No, I don't like talking

273
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,310
Then go visit your friends at Bangkok, surprise them

274
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,940
No, I better stay here

275
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,450
You must be lonely then, try reading Harry Potter, it's fun

276
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,130
There's new movie coming in: Hello Stranger

277
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,099
Why don't you go watch it. It's fun

278
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:24,490
No, I just wait to buy the CD instead

279
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,710
Ok, then just relax

280
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:37,410
You have to be strong, trust me

281
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:58,960
Thank you, by the way, I still have no clue about your look

282
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,550
It's better this way

283
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:15,830
Ok, talk to you later

284
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,040
Are you sleep yet?

285
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,500
I bring you the milk

286
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,400
May I get in then

287
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,030
Here you are

288
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,300
Drink warm milk before go to bed so you'll have a good sleep

289
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,960
I'll go to bed now

290
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,370
Yes

291
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,030
He called when you were asleep

292
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,740
He said he's fine, don't worry

293
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,000
Right now

294
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,980
He's busy

295
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,520
Has a lot of friends

296
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,860
And also a lot to handle

297
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,460
If...

298
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,000
You want to know

299
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,160
You may talk to him

300
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,860
Just waiting for his MSN won't make you get a chance to talk to him

301
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,730
I have to go to bed now

302
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,980
Shit!!

303
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,750
I'm late

304
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:57,060
The class has been canceled due to a protest at Ratchaprasong. For your safety, the class will be canceled all week.

305
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,610
I almost go to the class

306
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,200
I'm at the classroom

307
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,180
General instruction building

308
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,570
I'm going to study, wanna go?

309
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,890
Nope

310
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,310
I'll go eat out with Chompu

311
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,110
Hello, Chompu

312
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,830
Hello

313
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,790
Why don't you take her to study together

314
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,050
Better not

315
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,360
You guys can go

316
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,720
You can go with your friends

317
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,810
I'm ok

318
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,020
No

319
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,020
I want to be with you

320
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,130
Damn you

321
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,680
We'll go now

322
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,950
You can go with your friends

323
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:26,830
No

324
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,080
I haven't seen you for couple days, I miss you

325
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,070
Let's go

326
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,250
Find something to eat

327
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,470
Before the restaurant close

328
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,520
Umm

329
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,180
Golf

330
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,360
Eat this

331
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,110
No, I'm full

332
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,690
What are you doing?

333
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,260
I vote for Tono (Thai singer)

334
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,870
He'll be the winner of The Star Contest for sure

335
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,920
You'd better save your money, I guess

336
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,110
It's not your business

337
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,300
These two are drawing all the time

338
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,560
I agree

339
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,420
You drew landscape, house and then temple

340
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,380
Just keep drawing

341
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,180
Practicing yourself

342
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,350
Yes, hard worker boy

343
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,560
First class honor student to be

344
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,830
Which temple do you want me to draw?

345
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,580
Recently,....

346
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,290
I saw our senior work

347
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,570
they were so cute

348
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,080
Who?

349
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,150
It's Baseball and Pukpao

350
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,150
These two are adorable

351
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,130
I've seen them

352
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,960
Hey Golf, why don't you talk to me?

353
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,380
Who do you talk to?

354
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,130
My friend from faculty of Arts

355
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,290
You have girlfriend now?

356
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,290
Why don't you tell us

357
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,290
No, not like that

358
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,510
Um, what do you want me to draw at a temple?

359
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,420
Crematory

360
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,440
He's gone

361
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,190
I'm hungry

362
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,710
What do you want to eat?

363
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,210
Shabu

364
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,790
I want to eat something else

365
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:22,930
What?

366
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,390
Can I say it?

367
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,000
Say it

368
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,450
Are you alright?

369
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,060
Yes

370
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,440
I'm just moody

371
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,790
Because the weather is hot

372
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,690
Ahhh, I just wonder

373
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,650
Why don't you introduce me your girlfriend?

374
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,010
Huh? Who?

375
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,220
That arts student

376
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,760
That's my sister from Chachoengsao, not my grilfriend

377
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,660
Ah, I see

378
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,400
Me having girlfriend? Nonsense

379
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
By the way, where do you going to draw the temple?

380
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,690
I still have no idea

381
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,020
I'll think later

382
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,620
Let's go together then

383
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,260
I don't want to go alone

384
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
Ok, I'm also scared

385
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,750
Ok, see you tomorrow

386
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,200
Um

387
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,440
Alright, Straightened your arms

388
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,400
Hold on

389
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,510
Just a sec....ond

390
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,020
Alright...stop

391
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,410
Cool

392
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,270
Have a rest

393
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,840
then practice

394
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,800
Don't be lazy!

395
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,180
Well

396
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,720
Hey, Em

397
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,990
Here's the water

398
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,020
You guys should have it

399
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,960
You're all tired

400
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,260
Oh

401
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,730
You've used your voices so hard

402
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,690
You should drink it

403
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,770
Your throat must be hurt

404
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,560
Er..Ok

405
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,660
Thank you

406
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,160
Oh, Em

407
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,350
How was the practice

408
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,800
when you were a cheerleader?

409
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,540
Oh oh

410
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,770
I don't wanna be exaggerated

411
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,150
At that time

412
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,000
It was much more freaking harder

413
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,830
My seniors who taught me

414
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,450
were freaking strict

415
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,530
Really?

416
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,520
I can't compare them

417
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,040
You guys might die

418
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,500
Oh

419
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,000
Stop it right there

420
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,490
You won't feel your arms

421
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,150
This is so easy

422
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,880
It's a piece of cake

423
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,840
You practiced so hard

424
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,690
Studied hard

425
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,510
So how do you manage your relationship?

426
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:41,960
Why?

427
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,100
Why do you ask me?

428
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,660
um...well...

429
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,300
I can find the way to manage

430
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,600
Go Go Go

431
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,810
Go practice with your friends

432
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,650
They've come so far

433
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,260
Don't be lazy

434
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,010
If you do it wrong

435
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,760
I'll let you run alone

436
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,800
My eyes are on you!

437
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,310
Guess I'm nothing to him

438
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,100
N: You are priceless, don't let yourself down

439
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,150
N: Did you talk to him?

440
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,330
N: so you'll know what's going on, right?

441
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,850
N: Quit imagining things. Trust me

442
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,520
NM: Um

443
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,120
Dad

444
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,670
Dad

445
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,520
I haven't seen you for long, Lucky!

446
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,030
Do you know where are they?

447
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,150
You know?

448
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,370
Oh Champ!

449
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,100
When did you come?

450
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,630
Auntie!

451
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,909
Sa Wad dee Krub [Hello]

452
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:33,860
Er

453
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,139
I'm just arrived

454
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,040
Oh

455
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,270
Hey Auntie, Do you know...

456
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,179
Where are my family? Here's so quiet

457
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,790
They're at the provincial hospital.

458
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,230
Hospital?

459
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:46,940
Who's sick?

460
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,500
Oh

461
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:49,530
Your grandpa is admitted there

462
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,530
No one tells you?

463
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:55,880
Grandpa...

464
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,620
is admitted?

465
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,120
Don't you think you should tell me?

466
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,140
Champ/ Champ?

467
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,750
How do you come here?

468
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,910
Why don't you tell me he's sick?!

469
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,760
If I didn't come myself, so I'll never know?

470
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,580
Champ/ Why I have to be the freaking last one who knows?

471
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,540
Or I'm nothing to you?

472
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,160
No...

473
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,190
Everything I did...

474
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,510
I wanna let him see

475
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,910
I wanna make him be around of me

476
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,360
But, look at this!

477
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,720
My family conceals everything from me!

478
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,340
Just tell me

479
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,740
Everything I did seems useless!

480
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,060
Because he know you studied hard!

481
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,540
And you're overthinking, so we haven't tell you

482
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,470
It isn't like that

483
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,490
Why you kept it secretly?

484
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,010
Son...

485
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,570
Let's talk at home

486
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,620
Dad, you wanna tell something?

487
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,350
Champ, back home/ come home

488
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,590
No

489
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,670
Say it, Dad

490
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,170
Champ!

491
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,060
Come home/ Come home

492
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,720
Sh..I wanna surprise you guys, but I got a big surprise back

493
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,060
Champ...

494
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,740
Champ...

495
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,760
Do you understand me?

496
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,740
Well

497
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,280
You can't help anything

498
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,350
if you're here

499
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,900
so mom tells you to take the exam first

500
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,120
but I'll keep in touch about him, don't worry

501
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,190
Champ, think about it

502
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,060
If you're here

503
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,290
and he knows

504
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,910
that you won't take the exam

505
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,470
he might be so sad

506
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,360
Hello?

507
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,350
Champ?

508
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,440
Champ, Hello, Can you hear me?

509
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,110
[Keeping our memories all along]

510
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,880
[knowing how precious they are to my heart]

511
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,670
[that familiar embrace]

512
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,280
[I remembered them all]

513
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,050
Your grandpa's cook was so good!

514
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,510
Of course! [I still]

515
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,590
remembered them all

516
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:49,840
Your GPA is all fine. It's the taste of life

517
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,860
I'm afraid that you'll mess up

518
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,160
It's the first time you're staying alone

519
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,780
