1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,620
It might be destiny

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,940
Or something has destined

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,010
Our relationship

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,250
Hello, number 8

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,610
Let's meet on Sport day

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,430
I'll wait for you

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,340
We've been writing to each other for many years

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,080
MSN is trending right now

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,620
Would you like to exchange e-mail?

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
Because I already have MSN account

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,360
So we can talk more often

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,360
I've attached my e-mail within this letter

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,950
Or else...

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,690
You can give me your phone number instead

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
I would love to hear your voice

16
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,720
Is it ok, number 8?

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,950
Shit!

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,320
Damn it!

19
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:15,150
[the story of love]

20
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,260
[full of smile and tear]

21
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,420
[if it's love, it will be beautiful]

22
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,240
[full of memorable stories]

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,060
[being alone]

24
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,450
[you're a summer breeze that I think of]

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,039
[the warmth that I ask for]

26
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,450
[when the rain drops, I get wet]

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,180
[please let me run away from here]

28
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,460
[from these memories I still kept]

29
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,500
[please let me disappear]

30
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,640
[because you're still here, the same spot]

31
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,550
[you're sparklingly beautiful]

32
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,760
[I'm still waiting in the gloomy star]

33
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,210
[taking care and never disappear]

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,000
[the story of love]

35
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:51,150
[that was hidden]

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
[the old photo]

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,770
[that was pictured by dream]

38
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,550
[we still have each other forever]

39
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:27,950
Hello

40
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,150
Number 8

41
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,829
Gotcha!

42
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,440
It's me, Em

43
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,940
Damn you

44
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,000
What are you doing?

45
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,130
Talking with friends

46
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,340
I thought you were waiting a text from someone

47
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,860
You know MSN, too?

48
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,800
I'm on trend

49
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,970
Yeah, I know

50
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,680
I even know that the person you're waiting for

51
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,520
Seems to be the same person as in the letter

52
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,570
Mommm

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,209
No one

54
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,670
What?

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,790
I'd better go

56
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Seems like somebody is blushing

57
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,400
I need to tell you that

58
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,000
Don't forget to go see your father

59
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,860
He complained to me that you're addicted to computer

60
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,580
Ok

61
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,570
Go now

62
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,850
Go go go

63
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,260
Don't look!

64
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,460
Go

65
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,440
Hello

66
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,640
Number 8

67
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,340
I'm Golf

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,730
Champ!

69
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,720
Can I copy yours?

70
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,090
Sure, I just finish

71
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,970
Well, well

72
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,350
Won't write a letter today, huh?

73
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,570
Keep blushing all day

74
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,409
Acting strange like this

75
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,920
What's going on?

76
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,820
Nothing

77
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,950
I'm acting normal

78
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,540
Looking from that way to here

79
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,380
I can tell that you're acting strange

80
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,280
And lately...

81
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,830
You go home early every day

82
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,600
I think...

83
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
MSN addict!

84
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,300
No, I'm not

85
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,340
We'll be having a quiz right?

86
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,470
I must study

87
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,360
So, today...

88
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,730
Let's play Counter Strike

89
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,120
I'll invite Nucknan and Name

90
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,560
Ok?

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,240
Interesting

92
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,650
Maybe next time

93
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,880
This is what they called

94
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,040
MSN addict

95
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,460
Yeah, I know

96
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,120
Don't laugh at me

97
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,070
You'd better hurry up

98
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,710
Do it now

99
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,480
Hurry up or else we'll miss the morning assembly

100
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,290
What? Look at yours not mine!

101
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,970
Em, share with Gun

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,820
What are you doing?

103
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,270
Number 8

104
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,110
Writing a report

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,990
What about you?

106
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,320
What are you doing?

107
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,280
Listening to music

108
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,600
Who would be productive like you?

109
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,260
Do you think...

110
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,170
When we are in high school

111
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,720
we'll continue talking?

112
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,220
I'm still wonder

113
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,570
How was your drum major audition?

114
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,870
Is everything alright?

115
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,470
I got selected

116
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,480
I got to be a school's drum major

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,660
Congratulation!

118
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,930
But...

119
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,480
I think I might reject it

120
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,370
Why?

121
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,220
My friends said I got it bacause of beauty priviledge

122
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,370
So I think I might reject this role

123
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,430
But you did an audition, right?

124
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,210
It's what you wanted to, isn't it?

125
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,640
I think you'd better not give up on what you want

126
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,860
Thank you

127
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's change the topic

128
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,880
You must come to my school's Sport day

129
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,350
I'll wait for you

130
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,730
We'll finally meet each other

131
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,630
Ok

132
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,490
I shouldn't have said that!

133
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,840
How is the new song?

134
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,360
Do you know MSN, Name?

135
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,430
It's being used for communication... by texting

136
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,610
Do you want to try?

137
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,910
Then I'll teach you, ok?

138
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,480
So, I'll teach you at your room, ok?

139
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,700
Right, ok!

140
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,820
Let's go!

141
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,330
Come in! I'll teach you

142
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,080
Woah!

143
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,430
Your room's full of book!

144
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,960
Woah!

145
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,640
and so clean

146
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,100
if you see my room, it's very messy

147
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,030
Well, let's play MSN

148
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,120
Sit here

149
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,160
Today, I'll teach you MSN101

150
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,040
I'm sure you would love it!

151
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,480
Let's start by signing E-mail

152
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,620
think of any name

153
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,180
try

154
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,950
Why MN?

155
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,160
Here, do this

156
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,680
Confirm!

157
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,570
Just that!

158
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,660
I'll be right back!

159
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,040
Hi name!

160
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,720
Hi

161
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,790
I ran back home to text you!

162
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,660
Impressive

163
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,510
ok, ok. This will let us talk more

164
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,460
I'll ran back to you to teach you more. Just a minute

165
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,340
Who are you talking with? Such a good mood

166
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,350
No one

167
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,350
I'm talking with friend

168
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,950
with friend

169
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,070
about?

170
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,070
about paper bird

171
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,070
paper bird?

172
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,380
I'm making a paper bird for Big

173
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,400
I see

174
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,370
Right

175
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,400
I see

176
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,960
So continue making, I'll use the computer

177
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,620
Can I have 10 minutes more?

178
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,910
acting weirded

179
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,610
ok, ok but this time you need to tech me

180
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,400
Sure, my beloved brother

181
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,970
Go away now!

182
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,270
Go!

183
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,550
I'll call you

184
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,880
Don't turn off the computer

185
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,080
I'm using

186
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,530
I know

187
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,770
Ok!

188
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,490
Dad! Mom! She has a boyfriend!

189
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,490
You crazy! I don't!

190
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,810
delicious!

191
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,190
more delicious than your dad's. It's suck!

192
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,920
Guys!

193
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,910
Why you are so serious? It's just a midterm.

194
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,660
What about you? Don't you need to read?

195
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Don't you want to pass the university entrance exam?

196
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,590
I do, but if not, it's ok

197
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,670
I'll study around here

198
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,670
with my cherished boys...

199
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,560
and Joy

200
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,550
Are you crazy?

201
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,460
Actually, you can go farther

202
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,060
Why are you leaving your future for just love?

203
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,640
Right, don't you want to live your life in Bangkok?

204
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Do you remember that once we watched TV together...

205
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,619
our dream was to walking around Siam (shopping area in Bangkok)

206
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:24,020
grabbing some good foods, holding a glass of bubble tea

207
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,020
and getting into a subway

208
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,020
Don't you want?

209
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,550
I think it's cooler flirting Bangkok girls

210
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,650
I do want

211
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,650
but do you really think I can pass the exam?

212
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Sure!

213
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,070
Look at Gun, even he looks stupid, he still study well

214
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Damn you!

215
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,590
Try it. It's better than being regret

216
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,270
Thanks

217
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,070
Huh?

218
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,360
Thanks

219
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,200
What?

220
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,770
Thank! Enough?

221
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,770
Yes, sir

222
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,100
You know? We'll try to make it to high school

223
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,920
And you have to make it to college. Got it?

224
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir

225
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,350
You treat me like a child

226
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,130
Even my dad isn't this strict

227
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,840
Just eat and read your book

228
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,710
Oh, right

229
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,360
Hm?

230
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,950
The school near ours will host a Sport day on the day after tomorrow

231
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,970
I heard that...

232
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,610
Their cheerleaders are so hot

233
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,770
Wanna go?

234
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,920
Nah

235
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,440
Eh?

236
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,120
All 4 rooms of my heart

237
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,020
belongs to Joy alone

238
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,880
Eww

239
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,240
Whatever

240
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,870
How about you, Gun? Wanna go?

241
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,530
Can I not go?

242
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,740
Is it because Mr. 8?

243
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,670
Huh? Nooo

244
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,820
Then is it Joy?

245
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,710
There's only Joy that doesn't let me go to the Sport day

246
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,760
Are you having an affair with Joy?

247
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,210
What? What are you saying?

248
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,260
It's not like that! Fine. I'll go!

249
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,340
Please eat

250
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,000
What's up with you?

251
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,580
You look suspicious

252
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,840
I got it. I'll go

253
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,820
Eat!

254
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,450
I know it

255
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,320
Champ

256
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,050
You make me got a headache

257
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Drink some orange juice. It'll make you feel fresh

258
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,670
and be smarter

259
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,490
I guaranteed

260
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,480
I'm fine

261
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,890
Look over here, grandpa

262
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,020
I got 13 out of 20 in the last test

263
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,320
But I'll get full score on this Midterm

264
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,060
Champ

265
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,050
Sometimes...

266
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
You have to let it be

267
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,940
Do your best

268
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,530
In the end, you'll have to let it go

269
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,010
Be wild like your friends

270
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,330
I'm happy

271
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,330
to have a smart grandson

272
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,150
But if being smart means you have to stress out all day

273
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,160
I'll prefer having a normal grandson

274
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,750
You don't have to be smart. Just be good

275
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,670
Just this

276
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,450
and I'm satisfied

277
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,740
You only missed 7 points

278
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,630
It's still good

279
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,930
That's life, you know

280
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,760
What's got into you?

281
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,350
Other parents all want their kids to get good grades, unlike you

282
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,460
7 points are still a lot, gramp

283
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,940
Champ

284
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,100
You see

285
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,740
At least you still have Lucky

286
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,680
You don't need to focus on studying alone

287
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,910
Try to be more relax, Champ

288
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,950
Talking with you so long makes me hungry

289
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,350
I'm going to help your mom cook

290
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,290
(Fans' bustling sound)

291
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,130
Can I take a photo with you?/ Yes

292
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,410
Can I take a photo with you?/ Yes

293
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:39,590
Is that him?

294
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,730
Go ahead

295
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,460
No

296
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I think I better go back

297
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,090
No way. You've come this far

298
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,660
Just go

299
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,810
I can't

300
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,930
Trust me

301
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,100
Don't be afraid

302
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,110
I think I should go back

303
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:12,700
No, Gun. Trust me

304
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:13,870
Hey, Em

305
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,000
What?

306
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Is that Som, the cheerleader you mentioned?

307
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
Where? Around that pole?

308
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,040
Yes

309
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,510
Oh, right!

310
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:25,740
I'm sure it's her

311
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,950
Let's go! Hurry up

312
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,810
Em

313
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,350
Som, the cheerleader girl is so pretty!

314
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,530
Right?

315
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,260
She's okay for me

316
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,490
What's up with you, Em

317
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,740
Hey, what's wrong?

318
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,650
Someone is spacing out and couldn't see the beauty!

319
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,180
No, I'm not

320
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,860
See? You really are

321
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,640
It's true. It's nothing

322
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,770
Has he gone to see you today?

323
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,860
No

324
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,270
Come to think of it. You're so good

325
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,220
Gun, You've talked with him for years

326
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
And you'll have to do it again in high school

327
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,230
How could you manage to endure that?

328
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,890
It's fine as it is, right?

329
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,600
Alright. Let's stop teasing

330
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,390
whatever you want, we'll support you

331
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,210
True

332
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:08,840
From now on

333
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Let's return to serious mode

334
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,300
For our high school!

335
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,390
Gun

336
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,740
Let's roll!

337
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,520
Hello, mom

338
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,520
You're late today

339
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,300
It's Sports day

340
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,110
Can you attend these events less?

341
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,290
Your dad wants you to read books

342
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,160
Books about  pharmacy or dentistry

343
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,270
Understood

344
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,270
Good. Go take a shower

345
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:23,990
Mom

346
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,990
Hm?

347
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,840
I'm hungry

348
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,610
Open the fridge and find something to eat by yourself

349
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,680
Kid like you

350
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,070
I'm hungry

351
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,450
What's the meaning of this?

352
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,510
To have you remove the fishbone for me

353
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,870
You're old enough that dogs can't even lick your butt

354
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,880
Why don't you try to do it by yourself?

355
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,920
Why?

356
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
It's taste better when you do

357
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,960
Love my food, huh?

358
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,920
Please

359
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,870
Please?

360
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,130
I'll wash the dishes

361
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,610
Great. Then, wash it all

362
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,870
You come prepared

363
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,000
Em

364
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,950
Have you ever...

365
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,420
miss your dad?

366
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,820
Umm... No.

367
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,290
Why?

368
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,230
Because in the past...

369
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,020
your dad is the one who cooked pickled fish with rice

370
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,300
So I asked in case it's not the same

371
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,600
Dad passed away for a long time. Maybe he reborn already

372
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,720
Who knows

373
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,820
The guy that you're dating might be dad

374
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,660
Em, you brat! That's your father!

375
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,530
Bastard

376
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,330
Just kidding/ You better are

377
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,330
Why did you mention him, Mom?

378
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
Because you never make me feel like lacking anything

379
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
Even in Father's day at school

380
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,550
You were there

381
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,300
Having you as my parents is the best

382
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,040
To be honest

383
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,140
I can cook

384
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,280
but if it's your food

385
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,640
To see you remove the fishbone one by one

386
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,000
It's telling me how much you care

387
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:10,770
Here

388
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,680
Wear it so you won't get hurt

389
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,640
This kid. You just compared your dad to pickled fish?

390
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,240
Eat up your dad

391
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,790
I'm going to eat my dad/ Go ahead

392
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,760
Bye, dad

393
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,080
Dad is delicious

394
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,760
leave it here

395
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
It may be famous in Bangkok

396
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,760
Oh?

397
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,970
Hello, Aunt Lek/ Hello

Thanks a lot and please tell your friends I appreciate them too

400
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
For being my son's friends

401
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,420
It's nothing

402
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
We get along pretty well

403
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:23,900
And

404
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,940
Did my son tell you anything?

405
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,340
No. He likes to listen most of the time

406
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,540
ok, you may go upstair. I'm going to the market.

407
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,680

414
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,870
Since we have been talking on MSN...

415
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,820
It's good

416
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,000
I'll go... bye!

417

Get in!

418

The teacher finished class so late today

419
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,270
yup

420
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,100
Gun, we have an exam tomorrow, right?

421
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
Yea, right

422
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,730
What subject?

423
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,000
I don't know. Don't you know?

424
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It's Math!

425
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,070
Mr. omniscient!

426
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:18,540
How can you don't know? We're in the same class!

427
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:23,469
Why do you seem uncomfortable?

428
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,500
Who is uncomfortable? I'm normal

429
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,050
Nothing

430
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,530
Gun!

431
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,080
What?

432
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,460
What are we eating?

433
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,360
anything, just eat

434
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,010
Normally, you're so picky but today you said 'anything'?

435
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,219
Why are you being loudly?

436
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,219
You blame me again

437
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,350
heavy traffic

438
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,440
yea, heavy traffic

439
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,580
Hey

440
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,500
Hey! You stepped on my foot?!

441
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,830
No! Don't say it!

442
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,850
Sorry

443
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,940
Are you with me, Gun?

444
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,310
No...I...

445
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,120
You seemed weird.

446
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,690
I'm good. I just take a sight.

447
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,050
It's you. Not me.

448
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,500
I'm totally fine. You guys are weird.

449
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,920
Look at you

450
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,630
Why you keep looking on me?

451
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,570
[chatting about drama series]

452
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:44,000
They just had a daughter then suddenly... I fell asleep.

453
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,820
Whattt Woahh

454
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:50,870
They had a lot of babies, but all of them are daughters!

455
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,060
I felt pity on Mei.

456
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,800
More importantly, she died last night.

457
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,900
She died??

458
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,860
D-E-A-D

459
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,950
The actress played sooooo well.

460
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,490
The actor did so good as well.

461
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,620
I was so much in the mood then I cried.

462
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,260
They matched their role playing.

463
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,220
Yeah

464
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,130
Nid!

465
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,790
Come in!

466
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,390
Come here first!

467
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,620
What did you cook for your child?

468
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,760
Today?

469
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,350
Um...just a clear soup as it was

470
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,100
I can't cook much

471
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,180
Ah...Oh!

472
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,990
You can take my food, okay?

473
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,610
Em and I might not finish them.

474
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,740
Thank you!

475
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,520
Alright

476
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,910
Did your son wake up?

477
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,960
He was with Em last night

478
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,140
until late night, don't know when he got back home.

479
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,500
ummm// He woke up already

480
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,410
umm// He woke up early to have a homeschool study

481
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,580
Oh I see

482
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,450
Does he need anything?

483
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,460
If you need one, tell me. I will get it from Gun's stuff.

484
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,380
Thank you very much!

485
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,510
Alright

486
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,180
Talking about study

487
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,290
Is Homeschool work?

488
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,900
Is it similar with Non-Formal education?

489
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,790
I'm from urban, I know only NFD.

490
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,190
Umm...well

491
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,580
It's quite similar, but

492
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,420
Homeschool is pretty harder

493
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,940
because I have to teach him everything

494
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,970
Teach by yourself...

495
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,110
She is graduated so that she can teach her son

496
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:11,340
Try me, he might only know how to cook

497
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,000
Hahahaha

498
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,930
Ah, when you want him to go to school, just tell me

499
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,630
I have the connection with the principal

500
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,940
Thank you so much!

501
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,680
That's alright

502
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,090
Well, actually...

503
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,520
I gotta go working now

504
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,350
I'll come back when I'm done

505
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,900
Alright

506
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,570
If you need any help, just tell me then

507
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,740
I will

508
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,780
Thank you so much

509
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,340
This year

510
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,790
my grandpa turns 70 yrs old

511
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,140
Everyone says

512
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:06,540
He's wealthy, happy. But who knows...

513
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,310
he used to be struggling

514
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,010
Grandpa!

515
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,250
Hey!

516
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,640
Hey!

517
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,680
You complimented me so much

518
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,940
I smiled from ear to ear!

519
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,500
What? This one...

520
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,350
was just the assignment

521
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,880
I'm in hurry so I write about you

522
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,900
Really?

523
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,630
Gotta take a shower and study

524
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,200
Ahehehe

525
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,260
I'll tell your mom to treat everyone's meal in the village!

526
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,820
What?! No That's nonsense

527
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,190
Woah

528
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,290
I couldn't be more proud of him

529
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,880
That boy can make me cry.

530
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,240
Hm

531
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:13,010
What're you doing, Em?

532
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,400
Just finished studying social textbook

533
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,110

534
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,580

535
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,140
I wanna take a rest. I'm done

536
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,320
I feel dizzy

537
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,180
Wanna play guitar for couple hours then continue

538
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,040

539
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,600
No

540
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:01,070
I prefer listen to music

541
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,410
Wanna watch a movie?

542
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,340

546
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,750

547
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,790
That's fine

548
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,220
Just the two of us

549
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,550
so we can come back early

550
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,400
Champ has to study

551
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,950
and Gun can't stand with the ghost!

552

553
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,000
The ring was freaking scary!

554
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,790
What a ghost!

555
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,520
We

556
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,840
We're almost be in that place in the scene!

557
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,660
Good to have you here. I might die watching alone

558
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,010
That's freaking scary. What a crazy movie

559
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,320
Wanna watch again after the exam crisis?

560
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:40,520
[the story of love]

561
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,640
[once in my life]

562
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,800
[full of tears and smile in my eyes]

563
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,990
[as if like the stars]

564
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:56,830
[full in the sky like the memory in my mind]

565
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:02,310
[as if like the lonely weather]

566
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:07,130
[you're the hot wave in the summer like]

567
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:12,510
[all warmth I asked you every time]

568
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:17,000
[in the shower rain that makes me feel drained]

569
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,560
[Please let me go along with the flow]

570
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,930
[take me away from memory I stayed]

571
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:32,220
[Give me time to be gone that's all I want]

572
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:38,430
[Cuz you're still here]

573
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,930
[stay still and never fled away]

574
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:45,710
[blooms shiny and beautifully]

575
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:51,040
[blooms in the dark empty world]

576
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:57,930
[still got me to take care and never be anywhere]

577
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:07,700
[never disappeared]

578
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,710
[when there's a story of love]

579
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:17,640
[even it's hidden throughout all years passed]

580
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,690
[the old pictures will run again by the dream pen]

581
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:26,780
[saying we will be together forever]
