Damn it. We won't go to Oscar's dorm for sure

Fortunately I'm with you, Name

Will you...

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,920
watch movie with me again after the exam period?

I'm too lazy to read books

You're reading books for the exam, aren't you?

had diarrhea, so I can't go

84
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,260
I gotta go

85
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,710
Um ok. Bye

86

89
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,680
Good

90
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,650
Tell me. What product you use?

91
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,140
No way. Just go back already

92
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,740
Go go

93
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,570

98
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,220
I'm excited for you, you know?

99
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,990
Are you ready?

100
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,010
Yeah. Let's go!

101
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:32,830
Shit

102
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,669
Hm?

103
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,809
The website is down

104
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,090
Why is that?

105
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,429
Champ

106
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,000
The website is down!

107
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,250
What?

108
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,750
How is this happening?

109
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,310
You checked it almost 10 times

110
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,180
Why is the first year of admission has to be this hard?

111
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,780
Back then,

112
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,470
I just took an exam, choose a faculty, then apply

113
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,090
That's it

114
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,550
I got accepted to Chiangmai University like I want

115
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,020
I don't have to anticipate it like this

116
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,910
Don't even mention that it includes O-NET and A-NET scores

117
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,200
It gives me a headache

118
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,900
Sister

119
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,180
The exam system has some development, alright?

120
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,700
How is this be a development, Champ?

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,530
All I see is loop of errors

122
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,600
You called this a development?

123
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,390
Hey

124
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,360
You can checked it again at night

125
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Or if you're sleepy, go to sleep

126
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,000
We can checked again tomorrow

127
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,840
That's right

128
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,700
So, grandpa will go to bed

129
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,460
If you have any issues, come find me

130
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,210
Mom

131
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,280
But I don't know how to fix it

132
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,680
Okay, mom

133
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,810
I'll tell dad, so he won't have to be worry

134
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,100
What will they get from consulting with you? You're not an expert in this matter

135
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,480
It's good even if it's just listening to them

136
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,980
Enough

137
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,220
Let's go to sleep

138
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,370
Then I'll go pack my things

139
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,840
I have to go back to Chiangmai the day after tomorrow

140
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,020
Let me know the result no matter it's good or bad

141
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,680
Stop! Don't say it

142
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't say no matter good or bad

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,820
It's a bad omen

144
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,980
So I can only say that it'll be good, then?

145
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,480
Yes!

146
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,120
You'll get a good result!

147
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,230
See you

148
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,120
See you

149
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,030
You can do it! Amen

150
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll go first

151
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,510
Blow his head as a blessing before you go

152
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,490
Blow his head

153
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,310
I wish everything goes well for you

154
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,680
Good luck

155
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,620
I wish you get what you want

156
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,190
Yes, mom

157
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,520
Bye grandpa. Bye mom

158
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,060
Bye

159
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,550
Let's continue

160
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:22,990
When will it work?

161
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,770
I don't know

162
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,250
Do you want to stop now? Or continue?

163
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,180
Let's do it. We've come this far

164
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,420
Trust me

165
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,090
Hey

166
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,170
It's Latte of Dek-D

167
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,610
He said that your chance of passing admission is zero

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,880
Champpp

169
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,860
Haha

170
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,950
Em, I'm nervous right now

171
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,510
Let's call it a day

172
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,090
We can't see anything since the web is down

173
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,470
Yeah, I think so too

174
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,460
Let's go home, Name

175
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,210
Anyway

176
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,110
let me know tomorrow

177
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,220
Yup

178
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,450
See you

179
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,650
I'm excited

180
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,850
Will the website goes down, sister?

181
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,940
Will it crash that often, Champ?

182
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,450
Well. Did you pass the exam?

183
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
I don't know, so I'm asking whether it'll crash or not

184
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,250
I don't know either

185
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,080
I'm not NIETS

186
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,550
Do you want to look at this catalog with me first?

187
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,850
Is it a fragrant fruit scent for me?

188
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,480
Is it cute?

189
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,360
This one

190
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,880
Don't do this. I'm serious

191
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,800
You feel bad and blame it on me again

192
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,420
Then I'll go

193
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,210
Let's go, Lucky

194
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,570
This is an announcement from NIETS

195
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,640
The score evaluation is delayed because of the first year admission's instability

196
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Now, the system is back to normal

197
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,110
We deeply apologize for this matter

198
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,950
Mom! I passed!!

199
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,180
Really? Which faculty is it?

200
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,540
Grandpa

201
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,930
Dad! Mom! Sister!

202
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,650
I passed the entrance exam!

203
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,010
What?

204
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,730
You passed!

205
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,000
Let me see

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
That's Champ's name!

207
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,910
Champ's name!

208
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,690
You're amazing!

209
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Faculty of Business Administration of Walaithani

210
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,850
The number 1 university in Thailand!

211
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,850
Champ! You're so good!

212
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,510
Superb!

213
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,530
Is it by luck?

214
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,680
Gramp

215
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,370
How can it be luck? I worked so hard reading all the books

216
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,270
But it's the top uni. Will the teaching be difficult?

217
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,160
Bloodshed, mom

218
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,870
Is it?

219
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,290
Many people are fighting over it

220
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,720
But you guys can rest assure

221
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,940
Students who graduate from here all have bright futures

222
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,310
Great

223
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,240
For me,

224
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,100
Having 2 kids passed the entrance exam in this life

225
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,370
is the best

226
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,300
Woohoo

227
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,450
Wait and see

228
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,330
I'll study hard because I chose to learn it myself

229
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,440
You're magic, bro!

230
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,460
I'm so happy

231
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,720
so happy

232
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,130
How about your friends?

233
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,560
Will they go to the same university as you?

234
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,890
Em!

235
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,280
Em?

236
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:28,980
Hey

237
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:29,870
Yes

238
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,550
Did you pass?

239
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,520
No

240
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,840
I know it!

241
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,250
Didn't I tell you to read, not play guitar!

242
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,980
No university accepts students based on musical talent

243
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,670
Where could you go, if you're being like this?

244
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,170
Huh?

245
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,080
What should we do?

246
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,820
Listen

247
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,490
What?

248
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,280
I was joking

249
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,160
Huh?

250
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,790
What are you smiling for?

251
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:57,970
I passed!!

252
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:58,640
Really?

253
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,510
What faculty?

254
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,320
Law!

255
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,430
Is it true?

256
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,080
You're amazing!

257
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,280
Good grief

258
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,880
Like mother, like son

259
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,730
I'll tell our neighbors

260
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,520
How is it, Em? Did you pass?

261
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,740
It seems... no

262
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,180
Check it thoroughly

263
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,120
Refresh the website again

264
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,320
Maybe the system is unstable

265
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,050
Name

266
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,340
Do you think that I... passed?

267
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,610
Sri Siam university, faculty of Law

268
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,010
I finally got to be Naan's junior

269
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,940
See? I told you

270
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,099
Finallyyy

271
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,319
Woohoooo

272
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,090
Law! Law!

273
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,440
Name! I passed!

274
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:54,720
I passed

275
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,250
I PASSED!

276
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,000
Passsss

277
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,700
Can I go upstairs?

278
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,580
Here, mom! I got into Faculty of Architecture

279
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,050
Wow! Architecture!

280
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,200
Hooray!

281
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,550
Woohoo!

282
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,900
I passed! Mom!

283
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,460
Darling

284
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,920
Em passed the entrance exam!

285
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,000
Which faculty?

286
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,880
Architecture

287
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,180
Yes!

288
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,640
Woohoo! I passed

289
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
I got accepted into Faculty of Law!

290
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,060
Thank you so much, Name

291
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,240
Thank you

292
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,370
You have to send me off the day I go to Bangkok

293
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,680
Okay?

294
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,890
You must come

295
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,090
I passed. And it's Law!

296
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:16,900
Jeab?

297
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,510
Why're you spacing off?

298
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,540
Jack

299
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
You drank beer alone as always

300
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,970
Who could I drink with?

301
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,200
My wife ditched me

302
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,960
My child went to study

303
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,580
If Nuck-nan had been here

304
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,970
I would have let him buy ice for me

305
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,170
Mix drinks, peel the beans, and chat with me

306
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,990
Your life is so good

307
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Being abandoned by your wife is good?

308
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,790
Come and sit with me

309
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,400
Do you have another bottle? I wanna join you

310
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,050
Of course. Here. In the box

311
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:48,840
Don't worry

312
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,800
We're good

313
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,320
How's things?

314
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,580
I just see you drink every day

315
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:55,630
Jeab

316
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,890
Why do you have to worry so much?

317
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,910
Your face tells that you're stressed

318
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,000
Jack

319
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,420
How happy were you when you knew your son passed the entrance exam?

320
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,400
How happy was I?

321
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,780
You're making me embarrassed with this topic

322
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,000
Let's say

323
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,140
Normally

324
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,810
I drink 3 bottles a day

325
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,210
But that day, I drank 3 crates

326
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,720
Do you think I was happy? Haha

327
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,190
I was freaking drunk

328
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,590
It's normal

329
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,970
Drink

330
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,620
Do you want Nan to study Law?

331
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,350
No

332
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,420
Then what do you want him to study?

333
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,220
For Nan?

334
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,650
Whatever

335
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,800
It's his life, not mine

336
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,330
Don't you worry about him?

337
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,300
Of course, I'm worry

338
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,060
He lives alone in Bangkok

339
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,120
I've worry up until now

340
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,410
Actually...

341
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,220
I believe he could survive on his own

342
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,720
I believe that

343
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,610
he's strong enough

344
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
to try out everything by himself

345
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,650
I don't know when will I pass away

346
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,360
But the things my son likes

347
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,980
will be with him for his whole life

348
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,360
But if we're still here,

349
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,170
shouldn't we tell him

350
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,830
People our age

351
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,410
Jeab

352
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,600
Who says 60 is the ending?

353
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,000
I think

354
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,260
We can't predict

355
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,210
the exact time for our ending

356
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,810
Even you,

357
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,300
me,

358
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,000
or my son

359
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,270
No matter who passes away first,

360
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,490
If that person cannot pursue their dream

361
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,560
I think they don't achieve the meaning of life

362
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,060
To raise a child

363
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,130
You just have to teach him how to walk

364
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,220
Then let him figure out how to walk by himself

365
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,760
Then he'll be proud of being born

366
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,290
Got it?

367
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,000
Let's drink

368
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,890
It's been a long time

369
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,340
Isn't it?

370
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,200
Hold on, let me put on speaker phone

371
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,790
Congratulation!

372
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,570
If you come to Bangkok, I'll buy you treat

373
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,630
Here you are

374
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
What a pity!

375
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,990
This meal is on me but I can't be there with you

376
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,260
You can eat for me though

377
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,630
Hey Nuck-nan, why it's so loud there?

378
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,370
Oh

379
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,590
I'm outside

380
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,170
Partying

381
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,250
Flirting with girls for sure

382
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,280
Umm yeah a little

383
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,910
Hey, by the way

384
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,740
Em is staying with me

385
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,480
Where are you stay at, Champ?

386
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,050
Umm Gun stays at dormitory

387
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,640
For Champ, his mom wouldn't allow him to stay at dorm

388
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,650
His family already bought apartment for him

389
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,670
Stop making that face, Champ

390
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,060
Ok ok

391
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,760
Hey Name!

392
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,160
You must me lonely then

393
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,430
But don't worry

394
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,000
When Em move in to my room

395
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'll let you guys MSN each other all night

396
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,520
If I don't forget though

397
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,060
No answer as always

398
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,490
I'll continue partying now

399
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,240
See you

400
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,640
Congratulations to you guys

401
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,200
See you

402
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,410
By the way

403
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,850
I wonder where Gun at

404
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,210
I invited him but he can't come

405
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,370
He might be overjoy

406
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,430
He keeps chasing for friends' signatures

407
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,430
He said he affraid he might not collect them all

408
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,740
I don't know what's wrong with him

409
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,300
Here you are

410
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,000
Picket fish! (Chinese-Thai diaclet)

411
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
My recipe, very yummy

412
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,310
It's pickled fish, grandpa

413
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,310
I already said it correctly

414
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,150
Pickled fish

415
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,070
Picket fish

416
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,040
Pickled fish!

417
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,400
Yeah, whatever

418
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,620
Why you have to start this conversation?

419
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,110
Alright, grandpa

420
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,500
Can I eat now?

421
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,110
Are you ready?

422
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,320
Ready since birth!

423
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,800
Let's eat!!!

424
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,710
I'll eat first

425
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,540
Delicious!

426
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,030
That girl is on fire

427
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,700
Which one?

428
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,270
Damn you look so cool today

429
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,230
Absolutely

430
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,950
Let's cheers!

431
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,090
Refill for him

432
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,790
Who wants a refill?

433
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,910
So refreshing!

434
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,510
Damnnn, you're so cool

435
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,750
What?

436
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,610
That girl is a like a princess in faculty of Accounting

437
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,520
Accounting's princess and Law's prince, what a perfect couple!

438
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,890
So full of yourself!

439
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,380
I'm not only full of myself

440
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,630
But I can make girls' hearts full with love too!

441
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,620
You guys can leave before me

442
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,490
I can take care of myself, no worry

443
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,610
Calm down

444
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,300
I'm begging you

445
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,240
You can go beg your dad instead

446
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,620
Excuse me

447
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,890
How would a little drink like this makes you drunk then

448
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,830
So I can stay longer

449
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,310
I see, how long have you been here?

450
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,750
A little while

451
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,870
Can I have your email?

452
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,000
I would love to MSN you

453
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,240
Yeah, sure

454
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,440
I don't have paper

455
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,480
You can write on my hand

456
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,120
Hey Gun, back home already?

457
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,520
Yes, mom

458
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,350
Wanna watch drama together?

459
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,000
It's at its peak now

460
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,800
ErMom

461
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,440
Write this for me, please

462
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,290
What is it?

463
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,720
This is a blessing wrting mom

464
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,000
I let me friends write this for me before I move to new school

465
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,870
Alright, give it to me

466
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,090
I'll write a dramatic blessing quote

467
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,000
I leave a space for you and dad

468
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,050
Here

469
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,890
You can choose a color

470
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,310
I'll have pink

471
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,830
Your dad come home already

472
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,860
Hey, come write a blessing quote for Gun

473
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,460
So he'll have motivation to study

474
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Write what?

475
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,440
It's a blessing quote

476
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,300
So he'll have motivation to study

477
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,890
Nonsense

478
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,910
Passing exam...

479
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,240
doesn't have anything to do with blessing

480
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,010
I'll go to bed

481
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,200
It's ok

482
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,450
I'll write for you

483
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,850
And leave no space here

484
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:45,340
Keep fighting, my good boy

485
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,360
Err...

486
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,620
Let's do this

487
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
If you'll write for me

488
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,340
Choose a different color

489
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,940
So he'll know

490
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,710
Whose blessing quote is it

491
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,570
I'll go to bed now

492
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,720
For you dad, I'll draw a fierce face

493
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,260
So when you see it, you'll have to read a book

494
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,040
Read a book now!!

495
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,780
How are you, number 8?

496
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,440
I finally got it university

497
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,320
How about you?

498
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,250
I got in too

499
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,770
Let's celebrate by watching a horror movie

500
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,550
There's a new movie coming in

501
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,140
Nahhh

502
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,200
I'm scare

503
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,350
You're the most strange friends I have

504
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,310
We've been talking for almost 10 years

505
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,780
But haven't seen each other in person

506
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,010
And we're going to be apart

507
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,320
Let's meet when we're in Bangkok

508
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,870
By the way

509
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,110
What faculty did you get in?

510
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,850
Architecture

511
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,850
Couldn't be him

512
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,160
Which university?

513
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,500
You always ask me first

514
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:52,900
It's Sil-Siam

515
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,210
What about you?

516
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,730
Damn it

517
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,010
What's wrong?

518
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,220
Nothing, mom

519
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,240
I got in Valaithani University

520
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,920
[The story of love]

521
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,500
[that once happened]

522
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,680
[was filled with smiles and tears]

523
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,670
[It's like the stars]

524
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,840
[so beautiful]

525
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,760
[and filled with fond of memories]

526
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,430
[It's like the season]

527
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,430
[that our heart felt lonely]

528
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,160
[You're the breeze I missed in summer]

529
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,130
Mom!

530
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,260
I got in the university

531
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,230
[The warmth that was there every times I wished for]

532
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,020
[It made me wet on a rainy day]

533
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,400
2 months later (University move in day)

534
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,950
So heavy

535
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,710
Champ! Champ!

536
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,720
Move away!

537
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,470
Dad, isn't it too much?

538
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,830
Why do we bring so many things?

539
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,550
Things are expensive there

540
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,210
We already have it

541
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,440
Better save up money

542
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,960
So, I don't have anything in Bangkok, right?

543
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,020
Who said you don't?

544
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:31,720
Your grandpa told the crew to clean your room

545
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,730
And bought so many things for you

546
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,730
Is that right, grandpa?

547
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,760
Why don't your friends come with us?

548
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,250
Grandpa, look at all these things

549
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,600
We could barely put ourselves in the car

550
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,870
They're already left

551
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,350
I affraid you might act silly

552
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,350
And this is your first time living alone

553
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,450
People might complain you

554
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,260
Just tell me you're worry about me

555
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,260
Stop talking, get in the car

556
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,870
Today I'm free

557
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,230
And there's still have space

558
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,230
I'll go with you guys

559
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,880
Saying your worry about him without saying you worry about him

560
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,230
You know me too well

561
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,930
Got you!

562
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,880
You can ride a shotgun

563
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,540
Cha-Aim, will you come with us?

564
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,730
I'm coming

565
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,909
Wait for me

566
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,610
Lucky, come here

567
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,620
Stay at home, alright, Lucky?

568
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,909
Hurry up

569
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,360
Let's go

570
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,860
You sit here

571
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,699
I don't sit in the middle

572
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,010
Alright

573
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,080
See you, Lucky

574
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,550
Hey, Golf

575
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,050
Yes?

576
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,520
Are you sure you don't want to stay at my apartment?

577
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,429
Yes, I'm sure

578
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,429
Your apartment is far from my university

579
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,300
Up to you

580
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,320
But if you stay at dormitory, I think...

581
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,390
It seems fun

582
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,240
Is that right?

583
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,370
Would you want to stay with your son?

584
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,090
By the way, did you pack all your stuff?

585
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,530
Yes, I did

586
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,270
Alright

587
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,520
Good luck

588
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,630
Dad, mom

589
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,440
Did you mad at me for choosing architecture?

590
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Instead of being a doctor like you

591
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,500
Don't worry, Golf

592
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,280
Study whatever you want

593
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
And at least graduate with a degree

594
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,690
You're always encouraging him

595
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,070
If you're happy, we're happy

596
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,680
Don't worry

597
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,510
Thank you so much

598
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,080
By the way, you're going to live in Bangkok

599
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,760
I miss you already

600
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,370
It's ok, you can hug me instead

601
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,980
You ruined my mood

602
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,250
Let's go

610

611

Champ won't come with us?

615
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,300
I passed his house when I left my house

616
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,380
I thought his house was robbed

617
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,640
It's like he bring entire house with him

618
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,000
What an overexcited boy

619

620
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,810

No

What about you?

629
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,090
I told them not to come

630

I can go with you

631
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,050
Clearly our mom don't love us

632

690
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,120
[because it means nothing to my heart]

691
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,470
I'll MSN you

692
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,480
How's it?

693
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:31,440
Lately, there are assignment

694
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,650
You haven't go out these couple days

695
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,240
That's weird

696
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,260
I feel a little bore

697
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,970
I'm busy right now, grandpa

698
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,750
So, I call you in the evening

699
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,760
I'm late already, bye

700
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,900
Hello

701
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,900
[The story of love]

702
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,110
[that once happened]

703
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:47,990
[was filled with smiles and tears]

704
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:51,410
[It's like the stars]

705
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:53,410
[so beautiful]

706
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:58,110
[and filled with fond of memories]
