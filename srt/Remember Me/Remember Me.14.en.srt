Hey, Name

63

A bit

64
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,760
Why are you now smoking cigarettes?

So...

you're stressed?

68
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,760
Can I ask you something?

69
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,760
When I refused to talk

70
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,460
Were you uncomfortable?

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,060
Why?

72
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
Umm I wanna know

73
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,450
To be frank,

74
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,780
Yes

75
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,380
I was very uncomfortable

76
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,909
You talked to no one

77
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,600
And I...

78
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,050
felt uncomfortable for you,

79
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,000
for everyone around you,

80
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,450
and for myself

81
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,050
What did you do when you have trouble?

82
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,240
Like...

83
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,330
Did you keep it to yourself?

84
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,360
So frustrating

85
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,150
How could you do that?

86
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,660
Yeah

87
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,660
That's it

88
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,130
When I chose to overcome my fear

89
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,140
and finally talked

90
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,220
It's very relaxing

91
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,650
Had I chosen again,

92
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,960
I would have talked long ago

93
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,659
I know it's difficult

94
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,420
For some problems,

95
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,230
we don't know where to start,

96
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,690
what to tell,

97
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,930
and will the responses be positive... or negative

98
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,350
But after I thoroughly pondered about it

99
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,640
I...

100
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,410
chose to start talking

101
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,510
because I didn't know

102
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,930
how long I will live

103
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,230
When will...

104
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,150
the one I love passed away

105
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,030
It would be a pity

106
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,060
If the last day comes,

107
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,380
and I...

108
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,680
miss the chance to express how I feel

109

112

I want you to choose wisely

00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,000
sister Aim,

177
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,300
or idiot Aim

178
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,240
I'll always be the same towards everyone,

179
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,430
my parents,

180
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,610
Champ,

181
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,000
and grandpa

182
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,500
I was born in a big family

183
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,730
that is full of laughter and happiness

184
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,360
To the point that...

185
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,800
we almost didn't know what sorrowfulness is

186
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,610
Until the day our grandpa passed away

187
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,670
He also couldn't make it to Champ's graduation day, right?

188
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,790
Not long after that,

189
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,530
we lost Lucky too

190
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,280
Can you remember...

191
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,150
that little Pomeranian that likes running around and barking loudly?

192
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,660
Even so,

193
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:52,550
Our family always fights against hardships with "It's alright"

194
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,600
Like today that I'm getting married

195
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,430
I know mom and dad will be looked down on

196
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,750
since I got pregnant before the wedding day

197
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,420
But you know what? The day I confessed to them,

198
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,690
They said...

199
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,950
Never mind!

200
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,470
You're good

201
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,000
I know they try to keep me and Champ away...

202
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,170
from regret and sorrow

203
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,410
Try not to let our family fall in despair

204
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,790
Try to...

205
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,430
make Aim and Champ happy

206
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,670
Thank you

207
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,590
for your kind words

208
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,560
for saying "It's alright"

209
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,410
I'll never forget

210
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,070
what grandpa always say...

211
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,930
"You should smile often, Aim"

212
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,970
"Every cloud has a silver lining"

213
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:41,780
[No matter how sweet the messages are,]

214
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,220

Even though

220
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:20,320
from this day on, I'll move to a new house

221
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,890
that's very far away from here,

222
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,890
start a new family,

223
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
and use a new last name

224
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,180
But I'll never forget this family

225
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,520

226

Dad say: I'm so proud of my 2 kids

240
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,890
Champ joined the group

241
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,540
Cha-aim say: All family members are here

242
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,380
Take more

243
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,870
Oh mom

244
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Champ, are you hungry?

245
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,150
Come. Take a seat

Mom

248
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,530
I... want to eat pickled fish

249
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,540
Can you cook it for me?

250
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,650
Of course

251
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,620
I wanna eat it

252
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,160
But... it may not be as great as grandpa's

253
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,320
It's alright. Your food is always tasty

254
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,150
Actually, I already made it, but I forget to bring it out

255
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,020
Will you...

256
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,610
stay here for a while?

257
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,290
Umm

258
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,360
I asked for only 2 days leave at first

259
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,360
But...

260
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,080
I still have a lot of leave

261
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080

262

514
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,190
'Why?'

515
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,540
'Because love... is written by love'

516
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,260
We eat the same thing today

517
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,050
Um

518
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,720
Um, Golf/ Huh?

519
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,660
Are you done with the homework assigned yesterday?

520
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,080
Not yet

521
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,070
But I did more than a half of it

522
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,020
Gun!

523
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,170
Yes?

524
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,640
Hey, your name is Korn!

525
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,640
I called my friend at that table, Gun

526
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,200
You're Korn, aren't you?

527
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,250
Oh...

528
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,530
I was hearing things

529
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:13,860
I understand

530
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,520
You must have loads of homework as a sophomore student

531
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,640
I feel you. Really

532
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,280
Oh wait

533
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,770
Do you have the 2009 influenza?/ Ahhh that's scary

534
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,360
Woahh the pandemic is here

535
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,590
You're hearing things!/ I just misheard you

536
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,000
Oh, okay

537
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,720
Be careful then, it's risky right now because of the pandemic

538
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,720
Enjoy eating

539
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,860
Gun!

540
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,180
Ah, Korn/ Huh?

541
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,420
I've something to show you

542
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,770
I bought BB already!

543
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,000
At Ma Boon Krong

544
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,780
You're quite up to date

545
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,560
So

546
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,080
Can I have your pin?

547
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,030
Sure

548
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,540
This pin thing is pretty good

549
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,480
How so?

550
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,890
Because once you have it, it can't be deleted

551
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,890
If we remember someone's pin

552
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,950
and they haven't changed the phone

553
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,970
They'll never disappear from our life

554
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,540
Your pin is the first one in my phone

555
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,930
Really?

556
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,120
I'm the first?

557
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,090
Let's eat

558
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,310
Or else we wouldn't finish our work

559
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,550
It's a lot

560
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,710
Why don't you eat?

561
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,430
Ah

562
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:08,830
Right?

563
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:16,140
Hey guys, did you watch Kaeo, the Olympic boxer, last night?

564
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,380
I did!/ How is it?/ It's very stressful

565
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:21,910
He won! Right? He got the Olympic gold medal!

566
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,460
It's like... Phew! Baam!

567
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,460
Did you watch it? I didn't

568
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,820
Is it exciting?/ Yes!

569
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,760
The match is a legend/ Right? He's so cool!

570
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,050
Here/ Thank you

571
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,010
You guys...

572
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,360
When did you get so close?

573
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,040
Haa

574
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,560
It's been a while

575
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,090
Heyy

576
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,000
Are you close like...

577
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,410
our faculty's imagined couple?

578
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,020
Don't tease them!

579
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,620
See? They're embarrassed

580
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,420
So... what do you think?

581
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,140
Hmm

582
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:07,320
It's already 2012. I think it's normal if you are together

583
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,160
Um

584
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,410
Yeah, we're together

585
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,530
Hey

586
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,020
Shit!!!

587
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,570
Keep it down!

588
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,570
You're overreacting

589
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,440
I'm happy that you admit it

590
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,110
But you need to keep fighting

591
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,110
There are two sides of the same coins

592
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:32,330
More people have begun to accept, but some may not

593
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,060
But as a friend...

594
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,880
I understand you two

595
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,760
Thank you so much, guys

596
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,410
I'm happy that you understand us

597
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,190
We're friends for 4 years

598
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,640
since the day we dance "Row the boat" together

599
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,200
It's only the two of them in their world

600
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,520
How do you know?

601
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,070
Aaaargh

602
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,070
It's written all over your face!

603
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,140
Is it?/ I don't know

604
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,940
Ah/ I'm hungry again

605
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,940
I'm hungry so often lately

606
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,640
The child in my womb is very hungry/ Your child or you?

607
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,640
Fine, it's me/ Okay

608
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,820
Let's go find something to eat

609
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,820
See ya/ Bye

610
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:20,000
Let's leave the couple alone

611
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Woohoo

612
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,680
You're going to leave me like this?/ Yes

613
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,920
Let's go

614
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,080
I'm so relieved

615
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,560
How?

616
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,730
It's just...

617
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,810
Dad knows, mom knows and friends know

618
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,810
The only thing left...

619
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,500
is the law

620
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,830
Why are you laughing?

621
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:02,120
If it's hard in 2012,

622
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,440
how about 10 years later?

623
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,960
Who knows? we might have a Same-sex marriage law

624
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,290
Um

625
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:10,880
I'll wait and see

626
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,250
Let's go

627
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,560
Huh? Go where?

628
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,200
Watch a movie

629
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:24,210
Good idea. We didn't watch it together for a while

630
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,760
But it's a horror movie

631
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,220
I'm not going

632
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,450
Just kidding!

633
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,920
A love story, of course

634
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:33,910
Um

635
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:36,180
Go go/ Yeah

636
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,600
[The story of love]

637
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,600
[that once happened]

638
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,980
[was filled with smiles and tears]

639
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,370
[It's like the stars]

640
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,370
[so beautiful]

641
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:36,720
[and was filled with fond of memories]
