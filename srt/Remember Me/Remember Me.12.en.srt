1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,670
The conclusion of a relationship

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,060
is our decision

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,640
to let it go

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,570
or to buy some more time

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,070
because we want to keep our feelings

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,850
The chance of having a relationship

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,530
begins again

8
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,590
I'm backkk

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,110
Woahh

10
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,080
You surprised me?

11
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,910
So lovely

12
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,010
Woww the food!!

13
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,750
Looks so yummy!

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,260
Hm

15
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,570
Today was so tired

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,440
The boss gave me more responsibility

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,220
But I'm back home seeing yummy food!

18
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,100
Golf

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,850
Huh?

20
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,000
I have something to tell you

21
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,420
What is it?

22
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,750
Let's break up

23
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,060
[Expressing love through the last message]

24
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:18,270
[Apparently, every breath...]

25
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,350
[is meaningless without you by my side]

26
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,750
So

27
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,850
I'm exhausted

28
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,290
Before,

29
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,180
when we wrote letters

30
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,410
It's really nice

31
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,150
No matter how hard it was,

32
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,300
we still exchanged letters

33
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,710
and were happy together

34
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,590
But right now,

35
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,260
It's much easier to communicate

36
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,140
but our relationship...

37
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,320
is only getting worse

38
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,690
So

39
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,550
I don't want to put up with it anymore

40
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,780
It's tiring, Golf

41
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,020
It's tiring

42
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,460
I guess...

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,210
breaking up

44
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,750
is what's best for us

45
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,659
[Writing until it becomes stories]

46
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,220
[before the day we shall be far apart]

47
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,470
Okay

48
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,460
[Keep our memories all along]

49
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,020
I understand

50
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,750
[knowing how precious they are to my heart]

51
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,750
You can stay here

52
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,140
[That embrace]

53
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,140
I'm going to live at my relative's house

54
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,370
[so familiar]

55
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,520
[I can still remember it]

56
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,830
[No matter how sweet the messages are,]

57
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,070
[It couldn’t be compared to]

58
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:43,000
[when you smiled at me beautifully]

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,950
[Expressing love through messages repeatedly]

60
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,590
[cannot make us fell in love]

61
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:59,150
[because it means nothing to my heart]

62
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,300
[The story of love]

63
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,300
[that once happened]

64
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,640
[was filled with smiles and tears]

65
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,110
[It's like the stars]

66
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,330
[so beautiful]

67
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,420
[and was filled with fond of memories]

68
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,420
[It's like the season that our heart felt lonely]

69
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,380
[You're the breeze I missed in summer]

70
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,380
[The warmth that was there every times I wished for]

71
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,420
[It made me wet on a rainy day]

72
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,560
[Please let me escape from here]

73
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,120
[from those good memories that I still remember]

74
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,330
[Please let me disappear]

75
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:35,000
[Because you stay and don't go away]

76
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
[Be a flower as lovely as a shining star]

77
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,260
[and still live in the dark lonely planet]

78
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,120
[It always has me, a keeper]

79
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,000
[who never walked away]

80
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,820
[The story of love]

81
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,130
[that once happened]

82
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,090
[was hidden even after a long time]

83
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:17,130
[The photos from the past were drawn upon by a dreamy pen]

84
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,130
[We will be together...]

85
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,480
Let's break up

86
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,330
It's what's best for us

87
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,110
Before,

88
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,909
when we wrote letters

89
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,679
It's really nice

90
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
It's only getting worse

91
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,670
So

92
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,610
I don't want to put up with it anymore

93
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,470
It's tiring, Golf

94
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,100
Let's break up

95
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:15,390
[No matter how sweet the messages are,]

96
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:24,560
[It couldn’t be compared to when you smiled at me beautifully]

97
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,780
[Expressing love through messages repeatedly]

98
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,220
[cannot make us fell in love]

99

[because it means nothing to my heart]

100
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,180
Ha

101
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:48,190
[If we could turn back time]

102
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:54,700
[I would love to go through everything with you again]

103
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:02,890
[Those familiar words]

104
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,900
I just...

105
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,340
come to get my stuff

106
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,240
I'll leave right away

107
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,780
[The photo of you still look the same]

108
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:25,040
[But we can’t go back again]

109
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,980
[To the time when we were close]

110
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
This is Green Curry

111
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,090
So tasty, isn't it?

112
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,610
Hm yeah

113
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,590
Green Curry is Chompu's favorite hehe

114
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,370
Hey Pooh/ Huh?

115
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,480
Can I bring Chompu to travel out of town?

116
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,330
Please?

117
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,700
Where?

118
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,090
Chachengsao

119
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,520
To see my father

120
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,260
Nan!

121
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,880
Sure thing

122
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,840
But I'll go with you

123
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,230
Give me a tour

124
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,850
Alright

125
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,850
I'll show you all around/ Um

126
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,140
I heard there's a temple. What's the name?

127
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,480
Sao Thong temple

128
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,010
We'll need to use boiled eggs. Let's buy it when at the temple

129
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,240
I'm full. Let me put my dish away/ Um

130
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,070
Do you need help?/ No worries

131
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,480
What's wrong, Chompu?

132
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,660
Are you afraid of my dad?

133
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,240
No, I'm just...

134
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,580
nervous

135
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,470
Don't be

136
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,840
My dad isn't mean

137
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,840
He just likes nitpicking

138
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
Nan!/ Hahaha

139
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,050
Just kidding

140
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,900
I don't know if your family will accept me

141
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,530
Hm

142
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
You just have to be yourself

143
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,000
Believe me

144
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,800
I'll try

145
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,260
Then I'll make you realize

146
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,490
how beautiful Chachengsao is

147
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,690
Oh

148
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,740
But it can't beat you for sure

149
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,870
Hahaha

150
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,890
Nonsense

151
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,000
Don't worry

152
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,030
It's nothing

153
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
If I compliment you in front of Pooh, you'll be embarrassed

154
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Hahaha

155
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,150
The night is young

156
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,840
Hm

157
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,380
You guys are gonna drink again?

158
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,030
Yeah, from time to time

159
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,130
Then I'll take a shower. Have fun

160
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,810
Then I'll go too

161
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,680
Can you keep me company?

162
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,960
I brought it for you

163
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,230
Finee

164
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,380
Hmm no ice?

165
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,700
You drink like a German/ Hey, Nan

166
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,980
Cheers!

167
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,970
Nan/ Yes?

168
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,130
I have a question

169
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,520
Huh? What?

170
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,190
Your hairstyle is really cool/ Hehe

171
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,830
Hey

172
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,620
Why don't you copy me? I'm serious

173
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,090
What in the world is this hairstyle?

174
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,210
Heyyy

175
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,640
It's since Golf - Mike trend

176
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,290
I also wanna cut it off

177
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,620
But I'm busy/ Who are Golf - Mike?

178
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,630
Whaaat? Their songs are popular!

179
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,520
Is that so?

180
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,190
You have no idea. It's in MP3

181
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,320
Okay?

182
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,550
Keep up with the trend/ Fine

183
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,710
Don't play hard to get

184
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,700
Nan/ What?

185
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,530
Do you really love my sister?

186
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,720
I've come this far

187
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,330
If not love, then what is it?

188
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,620
Really?

189
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,190
When I saw her trying to do something,

190
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,580
you'd never help her

191
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,020
Is this what you called love?

192
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,040
Hm

193
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,050
Huh?

194
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,620
Because

195
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,940
I see her as a normal person

196
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
She's like everyone else for me

197
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,570
If there's something she's able to do by herself,

198
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,570
I want her to do it by her own

199
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,230
Hm

200
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,850
I believe

201
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,850
that she wants to keep her dignity

202
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,780
and don't want to be a burden

203
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,910
or ask for help

204
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,740
But Thailand is not ideal for people like her

205
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,120
It's hard to go around

206
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,510
which only humiliates her

207
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,330
But I have faith

208
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
that one day when things get better

209
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,970
and she's able to take care of herself like everyone else,

210
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,190
she'll love herself

211
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,190
and see her worth more clearly

212
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,790
And I love her the way she is

213
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,450
Really? Thanks a lot

214
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,800
Come. Bottoms up

215
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,420
Roger that

216
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,030

218
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,190

00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,850

220
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,110
Oh! You little piece of sh*t

Awww hello!/ You've gone for quite some time

I miss you

223
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,050
You're gone for long and now say you miss me?

224
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,660
Hmm/ Shh

225
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,940
Don't be fussy here. I'm embarrassed

226
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,910
And hereee

227
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
This is Chompu and Pooh

228
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,570
Hello/ Hello

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,870
How's things?

234
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,530
You're not here so I'm lonely, of course/ Ohhh

235
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,930
Old man tends to sulk/ Mom is also not here

236
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,180
My dad is crazy about cars

237
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,180
Look... It's car, car and car

238
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,630
Full of cars

239
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Ta-daa

240
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,040
Water for you

241
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,760
Thank you

242
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,140
I give it to the guests

243
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,700
How about your son?/ None/ What?

244
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,200
Bcos you have work to do

245
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,990
Go change the light bulb in the back for me

246
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,330
I'm too short to reach it

247
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,330
And you think I could reach it?/ Yes

248
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,900
I'll call the electrician tomorrow/ No need

249
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:15,970
Right?

250
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,130
He's our guest!/ Hey

251
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,870
Don't worry, I'll help you

252
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,200
See? A real gentleman

253
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,630
A gentleman would help an old man

254
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,190
I'll go with you, Pooh

255
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,580
Good luck

256
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,220
Hehe

257
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,660
How are you?/ Yes?/ Are you okay?

258
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,370
Yes, I am/ Hmm

259
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,950
Can I help you with anything?

260
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,800
Umm

261
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,270
Why... do you like Nan?

262
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,100
Sorry?

263
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,930
I'm asking

264
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,900
what did you see in him

265
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,240
Nan is very sincere

266
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:59,200
I can completely be myself when I'm with him/ Um

267
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,730
Even though

268
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,840
he's too playful sometimes,

269
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,370
he makes me happy

270
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,350
And

271
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,630
more importantly,

272
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,750
He never look at me pitifully

273
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,780
He loves me the way I am/ Um

274
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,360
But... if you think I'm unfitting

275
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,840
Say no more

276
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
For me, you're...

277
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,950
too good for my son

278
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,760
Yes?

279
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,530
I raised him alone

280
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,720
so I know very well how sloppy he is

281
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,890
and I know

282
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,400
that he can be a better person now

283
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,680
because you always stay by his side

284
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,830
Thank you so much

285
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,200
Thank you for loving him with your pure heart

286
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,220
And I believe that it's because of you...

287
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,640
that Nan can live a good life

288
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,420
I heard about your story lots

289
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,970
from him

290
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,000
I feel relieved even we are apart

291
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,190
Oh well, Uncle.

292
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,760
So, from now on...

293
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,930
You can't call me UNCLE

294
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,050
You should call me DAD

295
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,260
I will

296
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,810
Dad

297
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,330
Let's cook dinner

298
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,750
Alright/ Chompu

299
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,540
What's your favorite fooood?

300
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,820
Green curry of course!/ Hahaha

301
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,480
How can you hear me?

302
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,380
I always hear you!/ Hahaha

303
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,010
Ah! Dad, we should eat now

304
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,380
After eating, I will take them to the hotel in downtown

305
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,460
What? We got many rooms here

306
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,080
Let them sleep over. No need to go anywhere!

307
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,850
Ummm/ Shh

308
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,710
Ummm/ It's fine, uncle. I don't wanna bother you

309
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,160
Bother? NO! Let's ask Chompu

310
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,290
Where do you wanna sleep?

311
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,920
Well, here is fine. It's late night now

312
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,720
Well...well...well!

313
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,170
What're you gonna do?

314
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,420
Let's say you're all AGREE

315
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,130
and don't think that you're bothering me. Make yourself at home

316
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,320
Umm

317
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,470
Well...and then

318
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,940
It's much easier for talking about the engage

319
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,330
but if I may...

320
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,670
Can we do the engage after the mourning time?

321
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,800
Hm?

322
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,500
So...Alright!/ Okay

323
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,420
Hmm

324
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,840
Hey! Still working?

325
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,490
Yes I am

326
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,820
Wow. Your family's gonna love you so much

327
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,530
Gotta go. See you!

328
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,190
Hello?

329
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:28,590
Yes. Since you're always support us. We got the promotion for you...

330
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,560
Yes, madame. The special price...

331
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,250
Yes, madame

332
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:52,140
Of course. Are you coming tomorrow? Very nice, I'll make an appointment

333
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,820
Yes, madame

334
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,660
I'll take care of it

335
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,750
She's gotta be surprised, Name

336
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,360
Are you done?

337
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,790
Almost

338
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,660
I'm not sure about that...

339
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,170
Don't be scared...

340
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,040
You can do it

341
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,490
but...I'm scared

342
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,410
It's fine

Why it's so dark?

352
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,030

and how about Golf?

435

He's fine

437
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,540
Um...

438

and why do you pack things?

439
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,740
Oh I...

440
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,590
I just arranged things

441
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,240
so I kept some

442
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,030
You two don't forget to come visit me

443

and I will leave the day after

451
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,250
Um

452
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,300
I just makes sure if everything's alright

453
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,560
That perfume

454
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,700
That anniversary

455
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,260
You were willing to give this to me?

456
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,270
Um

457
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,840
I miss when we wrote mails to each other

458
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,570
That we drawn to each other

459
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,660
We lived in a different place

460
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,420
but it's really mean to me

461

the first day we met?

464
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,620
That time...

465
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,810
You fooled me that your name was Korn

466
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,470
What's your name? My name is Golf

467
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,900
I'm...Korn

468

This BB

469
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,820
It would be a retro now

470
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,370
but that time was so trendy

471
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,230
as I told you

472
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,190
I can't delete my first BB pin contact

473

You'll always be my first contact

474
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,790
Woahhh

475

Good luck bro!

478
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,610
Can you remember this bag?

479
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,150

480
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,520
Since we first met

481
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,780
no matter how old it is...you still used it

482
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,360
because it meant something to you, right?

483
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
Your dad wrote on it

484
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,300
your mom either

485
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,220
and me as well

486
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,770
I want you to keep this

487
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,740
so...can I sign on it?

488
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,510
of course. Here

489
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,240
Where can I sign?

490
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,870
It's all signed./ How about here? The center is for you

491
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,480
Sure

492

This temple

493
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,370
You taught me how to draw it

494
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,080
and you bought the pen with me

495
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,760
It's true that...

496
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:37,470
two heads getting lost are always better than one

497
