So,

49
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,010
The doctor said that she just didn't get enough sleep

50
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,840
that's why she passed out

51
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,500
and collapsed like that

52
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,850
She's getting better

53
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,110
Right now,

It should be finished soon

56
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,270
Then...

57
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,060
How did you come here?

58
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,720
Uh

59
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,130
My mom called and told me

60
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,140
So I rushed here

61
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,660
I thought...

62
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,590
I should be here for you

63
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,320
As for what my friend said...

64
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,580
He wants to apologize

65
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,700
He knows

66
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,350
that I've been talking to you since the first year

67
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,960
I told him about you

68
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,420
and that you're quiet

69
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,990
But he had no malicious intent

70
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,420
He was just joking around

71
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,340

76

Aunt Nid really cares about you

77
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,350
When I first bought a phone

78
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,190
Aunt Nid...

79
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
always called me

80
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,690
She liked to ask...

81
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,220
How is Name?

82
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,960
Is Name feeling okay?

83
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,060
Does Name want to eat anythig?

84
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,340
She called me more than my own mom

85
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,570
But I'm fine with it

86
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,090
because I know...

87
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,480
that she wants you to overcome your fear

88
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,880
Can you remember that comic when we were young?

89
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,590
Actually, it's Aunt Nid...

90
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,040
who bought it and asked me to give it to you

91
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,210
She was afraid that...

92
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,570
if she give it to you by herself, you'll not keep it

93
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,000
You see

94
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,990
Aunt Nid really cares about you

95

that you can talk

97

98
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,750
that you just chose not to do so

99
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,670
I believe that you have your reason

100
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,440
So, whenever you're ready

101
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,760
you can tell me any time

102

103
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
How about that person named "N"?

104
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,350
Aren't you curious?

105
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,670
As soon as I disappeared,

106
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,370
that "N" suddenly came

107
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,330
Aunt Nid told me

108
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,280
that she envied me

109
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,290
because

110
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,160
I'm the only one

111
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,300
who you're willing to talk to wholeheartedly

112
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,910
In fact,

113
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,620
it's like Gun's letter

114

00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,150
I'll work hard and get a good grade for you

178
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,980
So...

179
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Please wake up quickly for me

180
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,480
I miss you

181
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,580
so much

182
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,680
I miss your pickled fish

183
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,660
and your complaining voice

184
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,190
Please wait for me just 1 more year

185
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
I promise that

186
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,030
I'll show you my degree certificate as soon as possible

187
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,430
Ah

188
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,540
You came this early?

189
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,460
Doctor, how is my grandpa?

190
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,820
He's still not getting better

191
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,660
But don't worry

192
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,570
I'll help him to the best of my ability

193
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,860
Please take care of him for me

194
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,850
Then I'll be going

195
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,670
Come

196
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,540
Huh? Champ?

197
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,080
Hey

198
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,620
You came so early

199
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,630
I have a test in the afternoon

200
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:30,990
Oh

201
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,240
Then I can go with Champ

202
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,040
You don't have to send me off

203
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,210
I'm fine

204
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,690
Do you still have many things to read?

205
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,650
No, I just have to review some parts

206
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,640
Um

207
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,230
Uncle Somchai also recovered very slow

208
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,760
But he can even run after regaining conciousness, isn't he?

209
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,940
But our case is more severe

210
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,270
Oh, Champ

211
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,420
Hello

212
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,500
Why don't you tell us that you're here?

213
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Have you eaten anything yet?/ Um

214
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,900
Don't you have class today?

215
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,830
I have to go. There's a test in the afternoon

216
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
I don't want to miss it. Bye sis

217
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,090
I'll go first

218
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,240
Hello/ Hello

219
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,100
Please take care of Champ/ I will

220
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,360
Wait for me, Champ

221
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,780
Let's take a bus

222
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:49,320
[The picture of you still look the same]

223
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,830
[but we can’t go back again]

224
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,380
[To the time when we were close]

225
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,330
2 tickets to Bangkok

226
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,330
Thank you

227
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,610
Um

228
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,900
Are you okay?

229
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,290
Um

230
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,190
Hi, mom

231
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,810
Champ

232
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,810
Grandpa just... passed away

233
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,220
You can attend the funeral after finish taking the exam

234
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,380
Mom and dad are going to take care of it

235
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,390
The officer is calling me

236
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,090
Yes?

237
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,490
I'm the daughter of the deceased. Yes

238
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:41,810
Passengers heading to Bangkok, please be ready for departure

239
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,060
Hey

240
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,840
Are you really alright?

241
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,890
How about not taking the exam?

242
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,810
I'll take the exam

243
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,510
I'll do it for grandpa

244
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,840
Okay

245
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,500
Let's go

246
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,000
Ugh

247
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:40,320
[That memorable table in that same spot]

248
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:46,460
[is what we used for doing homework and watching TV]

249
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:53,710
Champ, today I prepared all things you like

250
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,100
[Ran, crashed and cried]

251
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,920
Hey, what a compliment

252
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,520
I'm flattered

253
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,650
[Trampled the ground and blowed up the dust]]

254
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,980
You need to be more relaxed, Champ

255
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,420
[The motorcycle that was parked beside the wall]

256
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,830
[I once fell on it and had to bring it back on my own two feet]

257
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,690
You are seeing your friend, aren't you?

258
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,590
Just go. I water them every day

259
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Easy-Peasy. I'm very strong

260
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,270
[I can still recall our past clearly]

261
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:43,340
[Even though time is taking us elsewhere]

262
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,660
[Sometimes the reality is just too cruel]

263
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,660
[Hoping one day I go back home]

264
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,180
Cry it out

265
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,270
[Suffering will be relieved]

266
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,550
I'll be by your side

267
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,990
Thank you all for coming today

268
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,320
Hm

269
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,290
No problem

270
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,110
How about you? Are you okay, Champ?

271
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,440
A little bit

272
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,010
You still have us. Tell us if you need anything

273
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,520
Don't be too upset, Champ

274
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,350
You've already studied  hard

275
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,240
I don't want you to grow old too fast

276
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,450
Ah

277
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,830
Since the sob story has ended

278
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,660
now it's time to celebrate

279
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,110
Here

280
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,800
Haha

281
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,610
Welcome a new member to our gang

282
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,700
I'll be in your care

283
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,010
Haha

284
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,620
Hey

285
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,220
The legend of 8's love story

286
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,880
Make it a novel. I bet it'll be a best seller

287
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,900
Heyyy Nuck-Nan!

288
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,230
I can be your informed source, Name

289
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,670
That's enough. Both of you

290
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,490
Don't tease them too much

291
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,800
Aren't you going to Nakhon Nayok tomorrow?

292
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,080
Yeah

293
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,890
I have to give it a go

294
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
I hope you can find Chompu

295
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,970
Thanks

296
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,840
Hey. How's your mom? Is she doing fine?

297
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,540
Good

298
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,790
Hmm. Do you want to go home already?

299
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,430
Then let's go

300
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,150
Let's call it a day, guys

301
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,220
See you in BB group

302
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,380
Oww

303
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,100
What year is it, Nuck-Nan?

304
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,100
Everyone uses Line nowadays

305
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,600
I'll buy IPhone right away. Is that fine for you?

306
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,800
Uh

307
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,020
Go go

308
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,320
Let Champ get some rest

309
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,590
Good luck

310
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,110
See you/ See ya

311
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,130
Go home

312
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Are you leaving tomorrow?

313
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,490
Be honest with me, Dad

314
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,570
Do you think I'm doing the right thing?

315
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,310
Postponing the exam for a girl

316
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,050
Then if you spend a year taking the exam,

317
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,760
will you be at ease?

318
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,150
Umm

319
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,810
No

320
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,900
Ha

321
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020
Between an exam and your heart,

322
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,660
what's more important for you?

323
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,600
Hehe

324
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,900
You're speaking like a lawyer

325
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,350
I remembered it from TV

326
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,970
But if you know your answer,

327
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,350
just do it

328
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,460
Follow your heart, Nuck-Nan

329
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,450
Um

330
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,220
Thank you

331
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,720
You can do it, Nuck-Nan! Whoa

332
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,550
Okay

333
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,490
I'll read my essay about my idol

334
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,430
My idol

335
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,710
Yes

336
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,340
My grandpa is almost 70 years old this year

337
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,930
Everyone said he is happy and wealthy

338
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,050
But who will know that he overcame hardships

339
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
for more than 40 years

340
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,310
That's right

341
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,260
Even though I was not yet born in that difficult time

342
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:32,080
Dad always told me how hard grandpa's life was

343
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,920
A Chinese man carrying goods for sales in Chachengsao

344
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,410
wandered from one place to another place

345
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,310
I can feel it when I heard this that...

346
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:45,720
it would be so hard that if it were me, I know I couldn't do it

347
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,210
I'm lucky to be born in the time...

348
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,630
when my family is doing great

349
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,380
Apart from our wealth,

350
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:02,090
I'm more proud to be born as dad's son and grandpa's grandson

351
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,040
For me,

352
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,580
Even the word "Brilliant" cannot properly describe my grandpa

353
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,420
He taught me a lot since I was young

354
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,360
Even though he likes to tease me while teaching,

355
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,880
all of that made me who I am today

356
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:27,560
To be a man who loves and cares for his family

357
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,780
Although I'm still not good enough right now,

358
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:36,030
I believe I can do it better in the future

359
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,060
This is my grandpa. My idol

360
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,370
Thank you

361
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,730
[But we can’t go back again]

362
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:03,850
[To the time when we were close]

363
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,990
[No matter how sweet the messages are,]

364
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,160
[It couldn’t be compared to]

365
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,410
[when you smiled at me beautifully]

366
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,310
[Expressing love through messages repeatedly]

367
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,810
[cannot make we fell in love]

368
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:33,980
[because it means nothing to my heart]

369
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,700
Granpa, I miss you

370
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,510
[It couldn’t be compared to]

371
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:48,440
[when you smiled at me beautifully]

372
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,830
[Expressing love through the last message]

373
00:35:53,990 --> 00:36:01,040
[Apparently, every breath...]

374
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,990
[is meaningless without you by my side]

375
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,110
Oh. Hello, Aunt Nid/ Hello

376
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,150
Did you guys help Champ's family?

377
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Yes, we just finished

378
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,820
Um, good

379
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,910
Hey. Name

380
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,620
That Maruko comic I mentioned

381
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,790
Can I borrow it? Please go get it for me

382
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,100
Thank you so much

383
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,600
Aunt Nid, can we have a talk?

384
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,260
Sure. What's wrong?

385
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,770
So

386
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,980
I told Name everything

387
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,310
I really appreciate your help, Em

388
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,320
for everything

389
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,280
Yes. This one

390
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,350
Thanks, Name

391
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,290
I'm sorry

392
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,860
Em has already told me

393
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,420
I'm sorry that I have to do this

394
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,680
because if I don't

395
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,240
There's no way I would know

396
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,050
how scared you were

397
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,420
I'm so sorry

398
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:41,750
S...

399
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,530
Sorry

400
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:47,950
mom

401
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,360
This is what I want to hear most

402
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,020
Thank you

403
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,670
Let's go inside

404
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,510
Don't worry

405
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,290
Um

406
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,310
But

407
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,350
It may be hard

408
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,770
What is?

409
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:29,890
Eh

410
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,300
My family is quite unique

411
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,520
It'll be fine. We've come this far

412
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,000
Okay. Are you ready?

413
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,600
Yes!

414
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,510
Let's go

415
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,740
Surprise!

416
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:14,240
Hello/ Golf! My son, hello

417
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,090
Whoaa

418
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,020
Dad's turn

419
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,570
Heyy

420
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,230
Hello

421
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,560
You're Gun, right?

422
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,560
Hello/ Hello

423
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:33,140
Whoa you're quite good looking

424
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,230
I heard you're smart

425
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,280
just enough to survive

426
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
Well said. I like you

427
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,650
Hahaha

428
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,620
Let's talk later. You guys sit down first

429
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,620
You came a long way

430
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,860
Let's go get water and fruits for them/ Yes

431
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:48,900
Wait a minute

432
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,880
Yes dad

433
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,640
Let's goo

434
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,610
Hard, isn't it?

435
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,660
No, the opposite

436
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,030
My family is like this

437
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,030
We don't have that many problems to think about

438
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,110
We're back!

439
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:12,140
We're backk. Here is cold water for you

440
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,280
This one's for Golf

441
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,510
Thank you

442
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,510
Sure thing

443
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,610
I'm so thankful that you help Golf all this time

444
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,050
From teaching him about letter

445
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,680
to helping him in the university

446
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,970
Thank you very much/ Thank you

447
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,020
Thank you, Gun

448
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,940
Golf, why don't you take a good care of your BOYFRIEND?

449
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,370
When I flirted with your mom,

450
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:39,370
I treated her much better than this

451
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,900
Is that so?

452
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,610
They know about us for quite some time

453
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,900
I told them when I moved to the condominium with you

454
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,240
They're so excited to meet you

455
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,650
So

456
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:01,200
Aren't you angry that we're together?

457
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,630
It's not important, Gun

458
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,440
What's more important is...

459
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,100
how much we trust each other

460
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,060
I'm happy to have another son

461
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,450
Hahaha

462
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,790
Yeah, thank you

463
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,810
Hehe

464
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,670
You can hold hands/ Hey, dad!

465
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,100
No can do

466
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,780
Hold hands ~

467
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:30,960
Here

468
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,160
Are you done, dad?

469
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,490
Almost

470
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,630
Really?/ Mom cooked pickled fish quite good today

471
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,270
But there's oil splatter

472
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,460
Hm. Come quickly

473
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,810
Ah

474
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,160
Are you going back to Bangkok already, Champ?

475
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:53,950
What?

476
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,760
Aren't you going to eat first? I made your favorite dishes

477
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,320
I'm not hungry

478
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,960
Really?

479
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,390
It's late

480
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,180
Traveling at night is dangerous

481
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,870
I have work to do, dad

482
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,360
I'm leaving

483
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,770
Why? Isn't it a semester break now?

484
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,580
Bye mom, dad

485
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,540
Name, do you want to watch a movie together?

486
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:59,090
Have you heard about the new movie?

487
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,010
The name is SuckSeed. It's a famous one

488
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,160
Have you been living under a rock?

489
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,890
Shall we watch it together?

490
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:11,870
Um

491
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,280
Do you really want to watch it?

492
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,720
Umm

493
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,570
See?

494
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,960
It's much better when you talked

495
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,140
You know what?

496
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,500
My friends accused me of hearing things

497
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,660
No one believes me

498
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,160
Next time... you must show them you can talk

499
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:40,770
We'll see

500
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,580
How surprised they are

501
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,380
From now on,

502
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:48,510
if you need anything, you can tell me right away

503
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:04,610
But

504
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,530
if you don't want to tell me

505
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,400
That's fine

506
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,200
I understand

507
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,800
At that time,

508
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,040
I...

509
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,350
was five

510
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,510
I heard a loud noise

511
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,650
So I took a peek

512
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:04,030
My dad

513
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:07,090
My mom

514
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,010
They had a fight

515
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,560
What I saw...

516
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:16,640
is that

517
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,700
dad was trying to

518
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,330
point a gun at himself

519
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,220
And,

520
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:38,020
mom said that

521
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,690
If you want to shoot, go for it

522
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:49,460
After that,

523
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:51,920
I heard a gunshot

524
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,200
Then,

525
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,180
I neither want to know

526
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:02,120
nor talk anymore

527
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,090
Until,

528
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,530
the day...

529
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,930
mom collapsed

530
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,050
But you know what?

531
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:41,910
I had to... overcome my fear

532
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,400
Otherwise,

533
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:51,710
I would have lost mom

534
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,800
And

535
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:57,760
I might...

536
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,710
lose you too

537
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:10,840
I won't leave you

538
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:16,710
You're not alone, Name

539
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,740
You have me

540
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:22,900
Aunt Nid

541
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,840
and our gang

542
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:33,950
From this time on,

543
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,240
live your life to the fullest

544
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,130
You have overcome your fear

545
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:49,680
[The picture of you still look the same]

546
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:57,660
[But we can’t go back again]

547
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,590
Let's go home

548
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:03,620
[To the time when we were close]

549
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,200
You came just in time. I'm cooking this

550
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,110
Huh?

551
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,640
Mom

552
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,060
I feel sorry for Name

553
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:36,400
[Because it means nothing to my heart]

554
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,060
[If we could turn back time]

555
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:02,240
[I would love to go through everything with you again]

556
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:10,020
[That familiar words]

557
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:16,500
[I can still remember them]

558
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,570
1, 2, 3!

559
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,840
That's true

560
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,560
It's been a long time

561
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,970
Hey!

562
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,450
Bro! Haven't you already left?

563
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:33,520
It seems so
