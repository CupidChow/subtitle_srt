1
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:08,730
Ah

2
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,660
What? A happy family group?

3
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Wow, you finally joined!

4
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,000
Here you come

5
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,510
[The story of love]

6
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,210
[that once happened]

7
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,360
[was filled with smiles and tears]

8
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,229
[It's like the stars]

9
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:43,229
[so beautiful]

10
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,170
[and was filled with fond of memories]

11
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,920
[It's like the season]

12
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
[that our heart felt lonely]

13
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,370
[You're the breeze I missed in summer]

14
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,390
[The warmth that was there every times I wished for]

15
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,280
[It made me wet on a rainy day]

16
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,550
[Please let me escape from here]

17
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,390
[from those good memories that I still remember]

18
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,020
[Please let me disappear]

19
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,320
[Because you stay and don't go away]

20
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,950
[Be a flower as lovely as a shining star]

21
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:42,540
[and still live in the dark lonely planet]

22
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,240
[It always has me, a keeper]

23
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,420
[who never walked away]

24
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,470
[The story of love]

25
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,300
[that once happened]

26
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,060
[was hidden even after a long time]

27
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,540
[The photos from the past]

28
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,240
[were written upon hopefully with a pen]

29
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,240
[We will be together forever]

30
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,829
Golf, you're back?

31
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,300
Um

32
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,210
I'm going to pack my stuff,

33
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,890
take a shower and go back to work

34
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
Aren't you going to take some rest?

35
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,329
I did

36
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,520
Boss booked a hotel room for me last night

37
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,850
Is that so?

38
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,310
Um

39
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,690
Why does the seniors want to see us?

40
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,010
Ah

41
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,470
They're

42
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,860
getting married

43
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
So they want to invite us

44
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,930
That's cool

45
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,400
Getting married

46
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,010
Will we meet at 8 pm?

47
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,980
Yeah, there's no way I would forget

48
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,380
It's our anniversary after all

49
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,060
How could I forget it?

50
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,290
Okay

51
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,830
Then I'll take a shower

52
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,600
Um

53
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,300
It's so much better

54
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,730
What do you think?

55
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,640
Let's use organic fertilizer

56
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,540
If we use the chemical one.../ Knock knock

57
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,280
Your order is ready

58
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,740
Thank you, Dang/ Thank you

59
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,960
Ha

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,220
You prepared food only for Nan? How about mine?

61
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
There's food in the kitchen, Pooh

62
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
You can get it yourself

63
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,170
Hahaha

64
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,530
Hey, Nan. Thank you so much

65
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,530
It's much better

66
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,060
My pleasure

67
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,670
Nan seems very happy being a farmer

68
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,650
Then,

69
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,090
What do you think if I become a farmer instead of a lawyer?

70
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,400
Hahaha

71
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,120
What're you laughing at?

72
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,370
I'm serious

73
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,620
It's the first time...

74
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,750
that I see you being your real self

75
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,820
For some people, it takes a long time to figure out what they like

76
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,610
And some get a job that's not related to what they've studied

77
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,440
Speaking of studying,

78
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,490
I miss the time you asked for my help with your research

79
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,680
You can still remember it?

80
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,980
Of course

81
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,980
I'm hungry. I'll take my leave

82
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,060
Do you wanna eat with me?

83
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Never mind. I'll find something else

84
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,880
Haha he's jelly

85
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,300
Why did you mention the research? I'm embarrassed!

86
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,300
Hahaha

87
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,630
I'm so embarrassed about it

88
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,450
Anyway, let's eat/ Alright

89
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,290
Watering should be done in the morning

90
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,930
Yes sir

91
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,240
because it'll be too sunny in the afternoon

92
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,350
Hmm

93
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,520
How old is it?

94
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,120
About 10 days

95
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,630
This is hot

96
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,800
And the fertilizer... It sure is

97
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:26,960
Do you want this hat?

98
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,820
No, thanks

99
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,180
Organic vegetables/ Yes

100
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,440
We use no toxic chemical

101
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,480
Hmm

102
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,800
The way to distinguish chili is to see if it's red or not

103
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Um

104
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,190
This one is edible

105
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,630
Another one

106
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,370
I'll show you that side

107
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,520
[The story of love]

108
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,300
[that once happened]

109
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,230
[was filled with smiles and tears]

110
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,600
Chompu!

111
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,500
What are you doing?

112
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,360
I'm reading a book

113
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,360
I'm so tired right here

114
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,790
Keep fighting!

115
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,450
Nan, you came? Are you tired?

116
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,040
I'm achy all over

117
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,620
Is it harder than a law exam?

118
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,070
They're hard in their own way

119
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,880
Taking a law exam requires critical thinking

120
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,960
while farming needs a lot of physical strength

121
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,210
I like it though

122
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,690
It's relieves me of stress/ Um

123
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,800
But my body is aching

124
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,900
Then, why don't you do both jobs?

125
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,230
Just do the case that piques your interest

126
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,920
and go to farm when you're stressed

127
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,350
2 jobs?

128
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,730
Will you be fine? Hahaha

129
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,360
Sounds great. If it's possible

130
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,700
I'll make it 3/ Um

131
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,440
And another job is to take a bath. I feel so hot

132
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,440
Let's go

133
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,660
Are you done?/ Yes

134
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,530
Wanna come with me? I'll help you

135
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,440
Sit still

136
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,040
Ding

137
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,650
Ding

138
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,930
Next, please

139
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,700
Hello/ Hello

140
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,300
I'm quite interested in your work

141
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,920
Good grade. Good university

142
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,150
And you got a first class honor

143
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,280
That's right

144
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,590
You can answer that call first

145
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,620
Never mind

146
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,240
I want you to work in our marketing department

147
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,530
I would love to

148
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,340
Please continue

149
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,010
If you passed, Can you start the job immediately?

150
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,660
Of course, I do.

151
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,230
Actually, I can even start tomorrow

152
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,600
Alright

153
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Welcome to our company

154
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,840
Really?

155
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,930
Yes

156
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,000
Thank you/ Congratulations

157
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,220
Here you are

158
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,270
We have Rice with roasted red pork and Rice crispy pork

159
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,100
Thank you/ Pleasure

160
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,870
Woahh

161
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,690
Again?/ Hm

162
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,500
Why does Name's have an egg?

163
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,700
Don't be picky

164
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,930
He didn't want fried egg that day, but now he want boiled egg

165
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,660
How could you be this picky?

166
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,620
Ha

167
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,790
Fine!/ What?

168
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,290
Stop nagging me

169
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,390
You nagged me from high school to university

170
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,300
I won't stop

171
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,530
Have you found a good spot for opening your shop yet?

172
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,640
No, you haven't

173
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,390
The world is changing, but he continues to play guitar at home.

174
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,510
You understand me, right?

175
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,000
Haa

176
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,540
Who in the world wants to stop playing guitar?

177
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,190
Here

178
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,040
Did you really do it or is it just for show?

179
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,510
Boo

180
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,070
I'm not sure if you really get it

181
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,000
Either way, you have to find a good location this afternoon

182
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,950
Got it?

183
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,100
I'll told him about this

184
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,920
About what?

185
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,920
Name. Are you free this afternoon?

186
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,520
Yes, I am

187
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,040
You're cute and polite

188
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,040
Can you go with Em?

189
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,240
Yes/ Great

190
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
See? This is what you called a good boy

191
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,480
and you're the nastiest boy ever

192
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,500
Eat/ I get it. Just go

193
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
Wait. Call me if you need anything

194
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,810
"Call me if you need anything"

195
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,000
What do you think? Is this a good place for my shop?

196
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,080
It's... good

197
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,720
It's more developed

198
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,530
and many people are passing by

199
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,820
Okay

200
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,150
I choose this place

201
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,710
Now I can tell mom

202
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,090
Hey

203
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,490
Why did you decide that easily?

204
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,340
Why? Aren't you the one who suggest it?

205
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,700
I trust you

206
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,400
And

207
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,520
What if it's a bad decision?

208
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,030
I'll have you pay for it

209
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,000
Just kidding

210
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,020
Hm. It'll be great

211
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,450
Why are you so confident?

212
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,450
Um

213
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,710
Because it's you

214
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,620
Hehe

215
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,350
Here

216
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,940
I brought this

217
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,450
What is it?

218
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,190
What? It's the thing we played as a kid

219
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
Mom didn't want me to go fishing

220
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,370
So I gave balloons to the fish

221
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Come on. You take this one

222
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,540
[The story of love]

223
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,540
[that once happened]

224
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,380

[It's like the stars]

226
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,160
Try harder

227
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,630
Hahaha

228
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,550
[and was filled with fond of memories]

229
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,950
[It's like the season]

230
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,960
[that our heart felt lonely]

231
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,580
[You're the breeze I missed in summer]

232
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,520
Not balloons! It's a very big fish

233
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,430
It was fish in the past

234
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,590
Oh, you're back/ Yes

235
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,330
Did you have fun?/ Yes

236
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,540
Can you tell me about your work, Em?

237
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,120
I'll the exam for Lawyer's license

238
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,000
so I'm reading many books

239
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,610
You know what? I have to read a pile of book. It's a lot

240
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Being a lawyer requires a lot of reading

241
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,760
but I know you can do it

242
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,170
Thank you

243
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,900
How about you? How was the exam?

244
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,810
I did well

245
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,710
Excellent

246
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,930
I have some work to do tonight

247
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,980
Why don't you sleep here and keep Name company, Em?

248
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,760
Will do

249
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,310
I'll take care of Name

250
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,740
Thank you

251
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,420
Don't worry

252
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,740
Let's go upstairs

253
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,730
Okay

254
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,170
Make yourself at home

255
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,290
Are you going to sleep already?

256
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,200
Nah

257
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,839
I know you're tired from fishing

258
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,760
Are you done?

259
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,830
Um

260
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,170
Can I hang it here?

261
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,080
Um

262
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,350
Have you told your mom that you'll be here tonight?

263
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,970
Yes

264
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,890
Are you going to sleep now? I'll make bed for you

265
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,210
Oh, no worries

266
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,080
Is it this one?

267
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,250
Let me do it myself

268
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,000
Hold it for me

269
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,540
Thanks. Ahaa

270
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
Can you sleep like that?

271
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,370
Hey

272
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,000
This is fine

273
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I like sleeping on the floor. It's not a problem

274
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,060
Arghh

275
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,880
Oh. So soft

276
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,390
The floor here is quite soft

277
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,310
Arghh

278
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,090
Hm

279
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,620
We have fun today, right?

280
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,770
It makes me miss our childhood

281
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,110
Um

282
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
My mom

283
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,180
didn't allow me to play in the water

284
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,480
or go fishing

285
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,340
So I used balloon as a fish

286
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,080
Hm

287
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,210
I'm all grown up

288
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,030
But she still won't let me

289
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
It's good I got to play with you

290
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,190
Otherwise I would be so bored

291
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,870
Hm. Let's sleep

292
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,590
Good night

293
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,620
Um

294
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,200
Can't sleep?

295
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,540
Um

296
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,240
Normally,

297
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,500
if I can't sleep,

298
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,480
mom will squeeze my hand

299
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,550

I'll let you know later

334
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,600

So we can go

336
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,330

Hm...

Why did you bring a guitar?

346
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,900
You'll see it

347
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,440
Give me iPad

348
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,780
Why you bring me...here?

349
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,670
Well...

350
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,120
Your Birthday is coming soon

351
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,480
I want you to try things you never done before

352
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,640
I want you to sing

353
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,770
I wanna hear that

354
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,810
No way

355
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,520
I can't sing well

356
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,510
How do you know?

357
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,200
You've done before?

358
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,030
Nooo

359
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,400
Do you have anyone to sing a song for?

360
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,190
Actually...I'm looking for the gift... for mom

361
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,350
but...I've got no idea

362
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,240
What?

363
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,660
You have it now

364
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,660
Sing a song for your mom

365
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,250
I'll play the guitar

366
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,370
but...I never sing

367
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,340
never sing or fear to sing?

368
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,250
Hm?

369
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,630
Well...

370
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,640
both...

371
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,310
You were about to sing for many times

372
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,130
Since I...started playing guitar

373
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,340
You know what?

374
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,660
You wanted to sing so bad that time

375
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,430
Really?

376
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,620
Um

377
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,380
Come on

378
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,920
I'll let you choose a song

379
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,700
Let's sing...

380
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,090
another day?

381
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,290
Choose what you wanna sing for her

382
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,050
Um

383
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,620
If you say it's good, I'm in

384
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,460
Here...choose your song

385
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,800
Um

386
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,420
Hey

387
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:49,820
Cool

388
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,050
I think it's nice

389
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:54,800
but...

390
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,530
I don't know chords

391
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,400
Let's do this

392
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,830
You go practice it

393
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,190
I will practice either

394
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,160
Okay

395
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,150
I don't sing today

396
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,520
I'm shy

397
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,970
Don't be shy!

398
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,510
Um...

399
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,170
So...

400
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,030
I still got one more mission

401
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,650
You gotta watch movies with me

402
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:36,850
Hey

403
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,270
We haven't watched movies together for 4 years!

404
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,870
be like...we were children

405
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,160
Wanna watch?

406
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,210
I do...so bad...

407
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,960
See?

408
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,620
The world shines so bright when you talk

409
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,130
Really?

410
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,210
Well...

411
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,370
and then?

412
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,050
Is it good?

413
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,210
Of course

414
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,990
So good

415
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,140
[The story of love]

416
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,660
Wanna watch the movie after the test?

417
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,840
Yes

418
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,210
[was filled with smiles and tears]

419
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,950
Go!

420
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,010
Come on

421
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,610
But you gotta treat me popcorn!

422
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,230
Come on!

423
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,020
I wish him were here

424
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,600
Um

425
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,820
So we don't tell him about this?

426
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,230
I tried to tell him many times

427
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,150
So how's is his LINE?

428
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,640
I don't get it

429
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,660
His LINE must be in a problem, mom

430
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,600
so...it means he won't get any messages I sent?

431
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,040
I'll take a look at it

432
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,050
Will he know about this?

433
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,770
I'm back, grandpa

434
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,200
First day is freaking hard

435
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,780
But your grandson nailed it!

436
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,640
Ahh

437
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,650
Look at this!

438
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,100
Let me check the latest version

This is your table...Well, welcome to the marketing department

441
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,360
Hi, sister

442
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:37,670
I wanna tell you something

443
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,720
I got a job!

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,070
Yeah!

445
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,170

447
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,470
Listen

448
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,610
I got a keyboard

449
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,970
Um

450
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,750
Good to hear that

451
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,970
Why did you call me yesterday? I was on an interview

452
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,530
I see you posted RIP. Who's dead?

453
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,770
It's not a person, Champ

454
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,470
Hm?

455
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,020
Not a person? then, what?

456
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,380
Champ...

457
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,520
Lucky went to the rainbow bridge

458
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,210
Huh?

459
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,090
Lucky's gone. He can take a rest now

460
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,970
Champ...

461
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,580

Hmm

472

He's gone for many days

473
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,080
Lucky has been on the rainbow bridge

474
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,600
So why...

475
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,620
no one tells me?

476
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,930
I tried to tell you

but, you left the LINE group

478

You didn't read any private messages as well

479

[It can't make we go back in love again]

520
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:28,130
[It's nothing for you now]

521
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:15,240
[We can never go back to the past]

522
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,390
[When you smiled to me]

523
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,490
When I first met you, I didn't like you

524
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:22,250
Do you really love my sister?

525
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,170
Sorry for coming in this late night

526
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,390
I have something to tell you

527
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,390
[The story of love]

528
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,910
[that once happened]

529
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:12,260
[was filled with smiles and tears]

530
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:17,440
[It's like the stars that so beautiful]

531
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,820
[and was filled with fond of memories]
