1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,310
Sometimes loneliness makes us depressed,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,520
happy,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,640
strong,

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,320
and weak

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,760
"Loneliness may let our heart be weak or let it be strong when he left"

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,760
Sometimes we yield to our heart

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,050
But if one day he's gone,

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,790
we need to learn to live by ourself

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,740
Oh

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:25,950
Hello

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,970
Hi

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,880
How could you get up here?

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,740
I just... asked the security guard

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,630
Really?

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,350
Then,

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,880
How do you know my room number?

17
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,260
I asked if he know who came from Chachoengsao

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,010
And he said you're in this room

19
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,100
Correct?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Yeah

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,670
Have you eaten yet, Korn?

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,870
Do you want to eat something before the afternoon class?

23
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:54,710
I'm so hungry

24
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,960
If you're not done preparing yourself, I can wait inside

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,590
No, it's alright

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,590
I'm done. Just give me a second

27
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,530
You don't have to hurry

28
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,900
Wait

29
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,770
Let's eat something

30
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,560
Now?

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,450
Yep

32
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,930
[The story of love]

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,110
[that once happened]

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,810

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,080
[so beautiful]

37
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,740
[and was filled with fond of memories]

38
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,280
[It's like the season]

39
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,570
[that our heart felt lonely]

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,140
[You're the breeze I missed in summer]

41
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,260
[The warmth that was there every times I wished for]

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,050
[It made me wet on a rainy day]

43
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,460
[Please let me escape from here]

44
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,150
[from those good memories that I still remember]

45
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,460
[Please let me disappear]

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,960
[Because you stay and don't go away]

[Be a flower as lovely as a shining star]

48
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,160
[and still live in the dark lonely planet]

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,260
[It always has me, a keeper]

50
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,120

00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,870
First year, second semester

56
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,710
Hello, grandpa

57
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,680
How are you doing?

58
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,140
Lately? I'm doing great

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,630
But I have to study quite hard

60
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,550
Can I call you back tonight? I'm late now

61
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,750
Tell everyone I miss them all, bye

62
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,460
Hey, don't you have classes today, Chompu?

63
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,089
I only have the afternoon classes today

64
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,260
How about you, Nuck-Nan?

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,420
If I remember correctly, you have classes today, right?

66
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,760
You memorize details about me so well

67
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,490
Is it because you have feelings for me?

68
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,909
You're imagining things

69
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,590
Should I answer your call?

70
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,890
Sorry, my hand slipped

71
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,650
Lol, you're too good at flirting

72
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,160
Hahaha

73
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,780
We've been talking for weeks, but you never ask me about the research

74
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,290
Have you forgotten about it?

75
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,730
The professor is staring at me, Chompu

76
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,000
Let me pretend to study. I'll text you again at night

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's make a video call this time

78
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,400
Changing the subject, huh?

79
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,890
I'll do that if I'm free

80
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,990
Alright, students. That's it for today

81
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,990
Let's meet again in the next class

82
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,480
Hm

83
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,620
Hey

84
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,500
What should we do tonight?

85
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,600
Wanna hang out and dance with us?

86
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,720
Not tonight

87
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,030
Why? What happened?

88
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,640
Yeah, you were not going anywhere these past few days

89
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,080
It's weird

90
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,310
I just...

91
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,270
Just what?

92
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,650
I'm tired of going out

93
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,450
Is that true? I bet it's because of a girl

94
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,880
What? Do I know her?

95
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,070
Hey! What girl? It's not that

96
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,420
I'm sure of it!

97
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,370
No

98
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,120
Let's go eat. I'm hungry

99
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,520
Booo

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm certain it's a girl

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's find out who it is

102
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,800
Can I eat fish?

103
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,380
Golf? Are you going to eat?

104
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,220
Yes

105
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,920
Do you want fish?

106
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,440
Yeah

107
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,600
Whoaa

108
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,380
Is it good like the pickled fish in our province?

109
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
How could it be that good?

110
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,870
That's true

111
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,460
Look

112
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,470
Now, there's a new constitution for people

113
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,130
This change nothing

114
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,280
They will revise it anyway

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's better than having no hope at all

116
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,850
Golf

117
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,560
Huh?

118
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,650
About our assignment...

119
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,179
Do you wanna do it at the faculty building at night like always?

120
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,140
I think today...

121
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,530
we should work in your room

122
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,390
I want a change of mood

123
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,480
Um

124
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,320
Sure

125
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,750
My room?

126
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
Yeah, you room. What else?

127
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,000
So I can look at something new

128
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,590
Hurry up. We have to go to our class

129
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,570
I don't want to be late

130
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,380
The professor gave us lots of homework today

131
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,400
We just met only a few times,

132
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,410
but he gave us a month load of work

133
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Well. Just do it

134
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,190
It's hard

135
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,360
Korn

136
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,660
Can I use your internet?

137
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,050
I want to search for something

138
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,210
Go ahead

139
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,200
You didn't leave any work unfinished, right?

140
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,610
I'm gonna try doing question 8

141
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,480
Hey

142
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:23,910
Wait

143
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,510
Are you okay?/ Just a moment

144
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,350
Ehh

145
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,940
You can continue

146
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Here is the internet

147
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,290
Right here

148
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,880
This one

149
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,990
Here

150
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,310
Okay. So I can use it now?

151
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,170
Yes

152
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,830
[Please let me escape from here]

153
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,680
[from those good memories that I still remember]

154
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,270
[Please let me disappear]

155
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,470
It's connected. Champ!

156
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,040
Hehe

157
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,090
Hi, everyone

158
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,330
How is it, my granson? Does studying make you tired?

159
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,470
I'm fine

160
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,530
But...

161
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
It's like what sis told me... it's a lot

162
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,910
Speaking of sis...

163
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,300
Why are you there?

164
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,080
You're still not graduate, aren't you?

165
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,210
No. I'm here for the internship

166
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,910
Internship?

167
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,300
Is there any places for that near our house?

168
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,040
Cool, right?

169
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,140
Well

170
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,330
Is it me or Champ looks thinner these days?

171
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,440
A little bit

172
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,180
Yeah

173
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,310
I rarely have time to eat

174
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,390
Because

175
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
I have to wake up and do everything by myself

176
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,060
It's...

177
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:25,590
That's it

178
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,750
I think I'm doing good

179
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,140
Hahaha

180
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,690
Good boy

181
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,020
By the way

182
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,740
Lucky is healthy, don't worry about it

183
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,680
But it waits for you in front of our house every day

184
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,430
It misses you

185
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,090
Where is it?

186
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,210
Lucky! Stop it!

187
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,910
Lucky! No!

188
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,220
Are you sick?

189
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
It's just a normal cough

190
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,410
Grandpa

191
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,450
You're old. Please take a good care of yourself

192
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Avoid fried foods

193
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,540
Champ

194
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,810
Living there,

195
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
you must be exhausted

196
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,120
All of us

197
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,680
are always by your side

198
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,080
If you're tired,

199
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,490
you can come home and relax at any time

200
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,850
Champ

201
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,800
No matter what happens,

202
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,980
you have to be strong, got it?

203
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,980
And no matter where I am,

204
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,200
I'll always cheer you up

205
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,950
What's that?

206
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,980
You make me get emotional

207
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,420
I have to go

208
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
There're a lot of assignments I have to submit tomorrow

209
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,590
Then

210
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
I'll end the call. Let's talk again next time

211
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,990
[The pictures of you still look the same]

212
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:13,430
[But we can’t go back again]

213
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:19,650
[To the time when we were close]

214
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:43,860
[If we could turn back time]

215
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,000
[I would love to go through everything with you again]

216
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:58,310
[Those familiar words]

217
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:04,380
[I can still remember them]

218
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,260
Hello

219
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,010
How is it?

220
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,800
Do I look the same as my photo?

221
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,160
You're pretty, Chompu

222
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,850
You're exaggerating

223
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,200
Hey, Nuck-Nan

224
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
So what I want to ask is...

225
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,760
Nuck-Nan

226
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,290
Nuck-Nan!

227
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,360
Hey!

228
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,400
What?

229
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,720
Who is it?

230
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,460
You keep smiling all week

231
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,160
Is it your new girl?

232
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,640
Fuxk you

233
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,830
Let me talk to my brother first

234
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,830
Let's talk again next time, bye

235
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,850
Do you really have to scold me?

236
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,330
Just you wait

237
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,260
There's a law for Computer-related crime 2007

238
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,110
I'll sue you. Just wait and see

239
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,330
You once cursed me in Hi5

240
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,530
That's the end of you

241
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,600
You're going to use law against me?

242
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,910
How dare you?

243
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,590
Take care of yourself first

244
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,790
How many times did you stand Name up?

245
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,860
More than 10 times

246
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,230
You're the one who will be sued

247
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,470
Nuck-Nan

248
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,080
Huh?

249
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,590
Can I borrow your computer?

250
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,940
I'm tired for real

251
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,480
Go ahead

252
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,730
New mic and new camera. Try it out

253
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,130
I'll go pee

254
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,960
You have unread messages

255
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,900
Sorry, I didn't have time to use computer

256
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,150
Sorry, I was busy studying

257
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,330
I'm sorry, Name. Let's talk later

258
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,780
What are you doing?

259
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,150
I'm really exhausted. I didn't intend to ignore you

260
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,340
Let's wait for this period to pass

261
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,850
Let's talk later, Name. I don't want to pick up a fight with you

262
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,660
Food is ready! You can come get it

263
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,100
Come here

264
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,370
Can I come in?

265
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,130
Let's eat

266
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,330
What's wrong? Did you have a quarrel with Em?

267
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,810
Em is studying

268
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,620
It's normal to have new society and friends

269
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,850
But he didn't break your promise

270
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,300
He still talks to you

271
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,460
Just less than before

272
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,620
He has to live his life!

273
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,810
And you have to live yours too!

274
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,480
You can't stay in your room forever

275
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,570
I tried everything I can to help you

276
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,800
Every way that is possible

277
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,410
But you never try to help yourself

278
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,050
If you still be like this,

279
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,840
You'll be the one who loses

280
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,240
I'll let you figure it out yourself

281
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,270
And if you don't want to eat,

282
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,030
then don't

283
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,000
Em

284
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,410
Em

285
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,570
Em

286
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,810
[If we could turn back time]

287
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:44,030
[I would love to go through everything with you again]

288
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,270
[Those familiar words]

289
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:59,030
[I can still remember them]

290
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,100
Em

291
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:01,990
Huh?

292
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,690
This is for you

293
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,610
Thank you

294
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,120
Whoa

295
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,150
Good thing I was around, so I bought it for you

296
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,360
Yeah

297
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,790
You see,

298
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,240
I studied very hard

299
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,960
and joined extracurricular activity

300
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,660
Hm

301
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,000
Damn it

302
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,890
I have a quiz today too

303
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,110
Can I ask you something?

304
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,630
Um

305
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,230
Are you fighting with Name?

306
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,200
You got the news quicker than ITV

307
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,510
Ha

308
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,830
You fool!

309
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,110
It's not ITV, but TITV nowadays

310
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,500
You're old-fashioned

311
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,260
Oh

312
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,490
How is it, then?

313
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,510
What are you arguing about?

314
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,060
Is it because you don't have time?

315
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,300
Yeah

316
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,350
You know

317
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,230
I don't even have time to eat

318
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,520
And I have to read books

319
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,210
Lots of them

320
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,190
I think...

321
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,540
You haven't tried hard enough

322
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,840
I understand Name

323
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,310
He is the one waiting

324
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,570
I understand his reason

325
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,090
How so?

326
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,490
So...

327
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,930
Think about it

328
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,460
Whether you have time or not,

329
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,460
at least you should let him know

330
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,460
But you just let him wait and feel neglected

331
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,380
If it was me, I would run away

332
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,700
I'll surely leave you

333
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,300
There, there

334
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,150
I said it because I mean well

335
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,020
Alright

336
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,340
I'll figure this out

337
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,190
Let's talk about you

338
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:28,600
About what?

339
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,430
What?

340
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,120
Of course it's about how you lied to Golf

341
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,610
that your name is Korn

342
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,350
not "Gun"

343
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,640
Keep it down!

344
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,680
You bastard

345
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,570
How do you know?

346
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,170
Whoaa

347
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,350
Sir Gun

348
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,370
How long have we been friends?

349
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,870
I asked you classmate if they know Gun

350
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,130
And no one knows

351
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,330
There's only Korn and Korn alone

352
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,030
Be quiet!

353
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:03,980
Shh

354
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,980
I don't have the guts to tell him

355
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,440
I'm scared

356
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,450
Okay

357
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,640
Get a grip on yourself

358
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,200
Tell him the truth when you're ready

359
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,750
Don't lie for too long

360
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,720
It'll be a problem later

361
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,480
Um

362
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,700
I knoww

363
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,540
Hey

364
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,140
Why the sullen face?

365
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,420
Stop it

366
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,200
I'll buy you a drink

367
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,250
Um

368
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,760
But you have to buy me food next time

369
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,680
Deal?

370
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,900
What?

371
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,480
What kind of bullshxt is that?

372
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,000
I already bought you this sandwich

373
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,790
Come on

374
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,330
No, you fool

375
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,130
What?

376
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,010
I already treated you

377
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,040
Do you want me to shout?

378
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,160
I'll shout out your name

379
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,420
G... G

380
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,150
Read!

381
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,000
Korn

382
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,750
Hey

383
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,340
I said the right one

384
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,240
Shut up

385
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,000
Hi, mr. 8

386
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,810
Long time no see

387
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,620
Hello there

388
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,410
Yeah. It's been a long time

389
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,290
There's many things to change when you went to university

390
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,940
How have you been?

391
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,370
Well, I have to adjust a lot

392
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,670
Fortunately, I have a good friend

393
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,000
Is that friend better than me?

394
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,090
Mr. 8, you're always number one

395
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,930
Mr. 8

396
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,480
There's...

397
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,230
something I want to tell you

398
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,560
What is it?

399
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,870
Actually,

400
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,290
I...

401
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,370
I...

402
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,850
I may not be available these days

403
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,830
because I have lots of work to do

404
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,120
No, you're good

405
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,180
Just text me when you're free

406
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:32,960
Hey

407
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,070
Do you want to eat mango with me?

408
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,730
Oh, right

409
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,340
Em told me he won't be online in MSN for a whole month

410
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,880
Why did he tell you?

411
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,220
He is like in a different time zone with you

412
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,910
So he asked me to tell you

413
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,740
But that's all

414
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Why didn't he tell me?

415
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,630
He's acting like normal people

416
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,560
And you should do that too

417
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,820
Why did it turn out like this?

418
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,210
You chose to live like this yourself

419
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,350
and you should accept it

420
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,199
Why?

421
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,679
I don't understand

422
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,730
Are you really not going to talk to me?

423
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,220
I talked to the doctor

424
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,010
She said you can talk

425
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,570
But you chose to use sign language

426
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,270
Now you're going as far as writing it down

427
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,210
Why?

428
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,180
Are you really don't want to talk to me?

429
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,260
Or do you want to be mute for real?

430
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,120
[If we could turn back time]

431
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,790
[I would love to go through everything with you again]

432
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:00,990
[Those familiar words]

433
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,330
[I can still remember it]

434
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,080
Nid?

435
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,500
You're staying up late and doing the laundry like me!

436
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,840
Nid?

437
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:03,880
Are you alright?

438
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,130
You can tell me anything

439
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,030
It's nothing

440
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,680
Forget it

441
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,660
Hey

442
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,660
Although I'm not your family member,

443
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,190
if you're facing any trouble that I could help,

444
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,840
you can tell me right away

445
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,390
So

446
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,270
We're single moms. I understand you

447
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,330
We have almost no one to rely on

448
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,020
When Em's dad passed away,

449
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,380
Em was still a little kid

450
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,490
I had to work hard like you

451
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
Even though we're now a mother

452
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,890
there's still a little girl inside us

453
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
I never understood my mother

454
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,930
Until I became one

455
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,040
I missed her

456
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,260
If she was still here,

457
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,680
I would be scolded for doing the laundry so late at night

458
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,120
I'm sure of it

459
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,540
Nid

460
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,420
If you're really tired

461
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
and your mother is still there,

462
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,910
you can ask her for good advice

463
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:53,700
Alright?

464
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:54,840
Yes

465
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,710
I'll go to sleep

466
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,590
Thank you so much

467
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,480
Hello

468
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,290
How are you, Nid?

469
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,030
Hello, mom

470
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,310
Are you still up this late?

471
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,800
I already slept

472
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,680
How about you?

473
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,630
I answered your call as soon as I saw it

474
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,700
What's wrong?

475
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,900
Can I ask you something?

476
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,700
Sure

477
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,320
When I had a fight with you

478
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,380
and refuse to talk to you,

479
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,300
does it hurt?

480
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,730
Of course

481
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,550
But you are my daughter

482
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,930
I'm fine the second you smile at me

483
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,070
Then, when I was pregnant before graduate,

484
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,720
were you mad at me?

485
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,950
No

486
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,960
But I was afraid...

487
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,430
that people would look down on you

488
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,900
I don't want you to overthink it

489
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,950
I was afraid you were not ready

490
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,100
But for me, I'm always ready

491
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Ready for every problems that come at you

492
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,190
At that time, instead of the graduation gown,

493
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,610
you saw me in the maternity clothes

494
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,170
In the past, no matter what problem I had,

495
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,800
I always vented my anger on you

496
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,960
I never understood you

497
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,500
But you always try to understand me

498
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,260
If I could go back in time,

499
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,100
I wouldn't do that

500
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,610
I'm really sorry, mom

501
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,000
Never mind. I understand

502
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,140
Even though you're now a mother,

503
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,030
you'll always be a little girl in my eyes

504
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,600
You can call me whenever you want

505
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,710
Okay

506
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,190
It's late. You should go to sleep

507
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,680
Okay, bye

508
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:26,090

Hi, mom

513
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,730
What's up? I'm practicing cheerleading

514
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,680
It's almost midnight and you're still practicing?

515
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,680
Are you applying for world cup or something?

518
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,260
Don't die before me

519
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,530
Ehhh

520
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,040
Em

521
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:22,000
So... I want to ask you something

522
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,370
Um

523
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:26,880
What is it?

524
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,310
The thing is

525
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,360
So

526
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:47,790
Look at this

527
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,530
What's that?

528
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,420
My academic record

529
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,170
Look

530
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:55,520
And...

531
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,840
why are you showing me this?

532
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,030
Because

533
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,700
I want to show how good Tutor Chompu is

534
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,780
Ever since you tutored me

535
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,790
and I stop going to night club,

536
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,090
My grades have improved a lot

537
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,450
So I'm not only your friend, but your tutor too?

538
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,450
Then

539
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,820
Do you want to be anything else?

540
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,040
Stop daydreaming

541
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,500
Thank you, Chompu

542
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,630
Don't mention it

543
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,230
You're good at it too

544
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,280
Chompu

545
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,250
What?

546
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:38,900
Can I ask you something?

547
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,320
Soo

548
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,770
We've talked for quite some time

549
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,000
And see each other's faces several times

550
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,700
I would like to meet you in person

551
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,450
Sure

552
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:05,540
But before that,

553
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:10,450
I want you to know something

554
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:15,970
What is it?

555
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,440
[Writing until it become stories]

556
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:59,270
[before the day we shall be far apart]

557
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:07,830
[Keep our memories all along]

558
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:14,260
[knowing how precious they are to my heart]

559
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:17,760
[That familiar embrace]

560
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,000
You got a spaced-out look

561
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,120
I just think aimlessly

562
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,480
Sorry

563
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,250
Is there any way, professor?

564
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,000
Surprise!

565
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,790
Sis!

566
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,400
How did you get here?

567
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:36,880
Why are you stressed?

568
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,290
Hello, Chompu

569
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,500
Hello, Nuck-Nan
