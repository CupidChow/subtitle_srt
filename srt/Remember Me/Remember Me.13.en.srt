They're here

Just check what's yours

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,260

[and was filled with fond of memories]

11
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,540
[It's like the season that our heart felt lonely]

12
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,199
[You're the breeze I missed in summer]

13

[The warmth that was there every times I wished for]

[from those good memories that I still remember]

17
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:35,020
[Please let me disappear]

18
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:42,120
[Because you stay and don't go away]

19
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,960
[Be a flower as lovely as a shining star]

20
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,300
[and still live in the dark lonely planet]

21
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:58,890
[It always has me, a keeper who never walked away]

22
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,120
[The story of love]

23

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,190
[If I could imagine and draw it with the pen]

26
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,470
[we'd still stay side by side]

27
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,829
Hello, Mr.8

28
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,690
My name is Golf

29
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,240
I'm at grade 5 class 4

30
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,030
C.L.C School

31
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,850
But different school

32
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,920
Nice to meet you too

33
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,890
Hope this semester

34
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,880
we can be good friends

35
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,730
I give my picture as well

36
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,440
so, you'll figure out in person

37
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,510
I don't know how many letters

38
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,800
that I wrote to you

39
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,740
but it might be the last letter

40
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,920
if I don't tell my secret to you

41
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,410
Gun

42
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,010
Since I first met you

43
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,089
from writing letter in Thai class

44
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,700
You know what?

45
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,120
I really appreciate of your mails

46
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,050
because I see the way you are

47
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,190
I believe we might have seen each other before

48
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,310
but you're too scared

49
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,490
and I'm too shy

50
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,770
However, I'm pretty sure of my feelings when I met you

51
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,630
Hello, Mr.8

52
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,200
Don't forget to meet me in Sports day

53
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,830
I'll wait for you

54
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,130
We've sent letters for many years

55
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,080
and MSN is in trend

56
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,670
Do you wanna use email instead?

57
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,570
so we can talk more

58
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,170
I wanna hear your voice as well

59
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:21,710
Cool?

60
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,080
Mr.8?

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,080
What's your name?

62
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,140
My name is Golf

63
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,470
I'm...Korn

64
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:35,990
Here

65
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,990
Salted Sprite

66
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,130
Hey!

67
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,420
How do you know I love Salted Sprite?

68
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,470
No matter how many letters you wrote

69
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,240
saying by words

70
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,370
I can feel the way you are...you're sincere to me

71
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,720
It doesn't matter that you don't tell your feelings

72
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,800
You know what?

73
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,180
The day you revealed you're GUN not Korn

74
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,530
I was really happy

75
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,630
It's like I finally found the one I always looking for

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,430
and that one is...you

77
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,170
Who stands in front of me

78
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,700
and I believe so

79
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,690
that's why I ask you to be my man

80
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,420
Thank you for all messages

81
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,150
that make us getting closer

82
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,530
Knowing each other

83
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,990
Even now they make us apart and I lose you

84
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,040
I used to think that you'll always be close to me

85
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,510
so I abandoned you

86
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,560
Everything seemed easy so I forget how hard it was

87
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,680
I thought that I could work hard for you

88
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,510
but I actually abandoned you

89
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:41,290
I forgot how hard I try to talk to you through mails

90
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,470
MSN

91
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,520
BB

92
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,290
LINE

93
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,600
and you're the one I wanna say

94
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,860
that...

95
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,450
Do you wanna marry me?

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,350
[No matter how sweet the messages are,]

97
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:04,890
[It couldn’t be compared to when you smiled at me beautifully]

98
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,570
[Expressing love through messages repeatedly]

99
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,920
Do you wanna marry me?

100
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,700
[cannot make us fell in love]

101
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,540
[because it means nothing to my heart]

102
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,450
Still kept it?

103
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,030
Yeah, every letters

104
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,659
Ah so...

105
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,130
How about the unsent letters?

106
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,470
Why're you still kept it?

107
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,120
Well...

108
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,900
I kept it for the wedding day

109
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,190
Can I ask you something?

110
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,140
Why do you ask me to marry you

111
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,500
meanwhile we're breaking up?

112
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,920
Um...

113
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,920
I don't know

114
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,570
I just...

115
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,580
follow my heart

116
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,610
Actually that day...

117
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,580
If I don't come so late

118
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,730
I might change that broke up word

119
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,890
to "MARRY ME", don't you think?

120
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,480
Probably

121
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,630
I have the family that understands me well

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,960
They didn't tell me to do anything

123
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,520
Sometimes I might abandoned one's feelings

124
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,150
Actually that day...

125
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,570
I don't have to join the conference

126
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,230
but I thought

127
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,590
It wasn't that late

128
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,940
so I joined the conference

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,100
and that day

130
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,850
I came home late

131
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,250
I'm sorry, Gun

132
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,350
that I abandoned you

133
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,100
Actually...

134
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,830
the reason why I work so hard

135
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,770
because I wanna keep money

136
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,090
for registering Green cards to USA together

137
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,620
to get married with you

138
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,270
to be happy with you

139
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,600
You said you want a marriage certificate

140
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,880
I...

141
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,140
look more on the future that sometimes...

142
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,470
I forget the present

143
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,410
Thank you, Golf

144
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,100
for working hard for me

145
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,370
but from now on...

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,220
When you have something in your mind...

147
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,490
we need to talk...clearly

148
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,110
and then we...

149
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,210
start over again, right?

150
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,510
for marrying

CHAMP Says: No. Too crowded

157
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,430

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,740
I wanna tell you something

173
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,400
I'm getting married

174
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,700
You are?

175
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,490
Um

176
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,870
I wish you would come if you're free

177
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,650
to congratulate me

178
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,170
and...

179
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,500
your grandson

180
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,910
Here

181
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,690
Drink first

182
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,850
Thank you

183
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,370
How's everything?

184
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,780
Good

185
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,470
How's your work?

186
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,180
These days?

187
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,930
It's...hard

188
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,330
High Responsibility

189
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,200
I haven't seen you for 2 years?

190
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,050
Um....

191
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,070
Don't you think about having a lover?

192
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,970
What a question!

193
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,470
How can you be a single with this good looking?

194
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,080
Too Picky?/ Enough

195
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,980
By the way why you're in BKK?

196
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,590
sending wedding cards?

197
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,760
or what?

198
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,700
um...

199
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,630
sending wedding cards

200
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,680
fitting the dress...souvenirs

201
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,560
Well...sis

202
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,950
Why you're getting married?

203
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,240
I'm pregnant

204
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,830
and It's time

205
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,510
I think it's a perfect time

206
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,150
Are you okay with that?

207
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,100
Yeah

208
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,350
I'm OK

209
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,390
and...

210
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,660
Do you have to move in to husband's?

211
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,730
Yeah

212
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,980
It's at SongKhla

213
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:42,750
so far

214
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,100
Um

215
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,730
He has the business there

216
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,970
Don't you wanna come home, Champ?

217
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,079
We're talking about you

218
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,200
How many weeks of pregnancy?

219
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,160
About 8 weeks

220
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:23,990
Pheww

221
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,579
and...

222
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,630
Did mom and dad...

223
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,650
At first they were shocked

224
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,240
but after that they're fine with that

225
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,400
I thought they're happy

226
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,000
You still mad at them about grandpa?

227
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,670
Mad at me about Lucky?

228
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,500
No

229
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,500
I know they're not okay about me

230
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,150
about grandpa

231
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,500
They're still sad

232
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,900
but they pretend they're fine

233
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,570
Pretend it's nothing

234
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,910
even it's not at all

235
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,390
We worried about you, Champ

236
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,900
I know you grow enough

237
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,920
but believe me

238
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,800
we still remembered your smile when you were young

239
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,880
You know what? I...

240
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,400
used to eat a pickled fish that way more delicious than grandpa's

241
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,560
Pickled fish

242
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,700
can fried anywhere

243
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,290
but it can't compared to our grilled pickled fish at home

244
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,180
If you miss pickled fish

245
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,390
then come eat at our home

246
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,700
I gotta go

247
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,100
CHAMP Says: so, I gotta home this NewYear

248
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,610
NAME Says: [Smiley face]

249
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,070
EM Says: Who changes your mind? Grandpa is on your dream? LOL

250
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,730
GUN Says: Anyway, that's great. See you soon

251
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,750
NAKNAN Says: Time to sleep, jerks

252
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,220
CHAMP Says: See you soon

253
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,820
Awww

254
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,640
Making merit in the morning...

255
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,970
is kinda relieved and feel good

256
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,880
What's going on?

257
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,500
um

258
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,150
I'm just overthinking

259
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,120
Of what?

260
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,130
About our parents meeting

261
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,680
or...

262
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,430
About saying to them we're getting married

263
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,090
well...Both

264
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,650
We've been through a lot

265
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,650
This is a piece of cake

266
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,930
Let's get through this

267
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,630
um

268
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,200
Let's see them tomorrow

269
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,720
um

270
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,850
but now...

271
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,120
Let's find something to eat first

272
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,680
Okay

273
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,450
Hurry up

274
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,200
Are you sure?

275
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,080
that you want me to wait here?

276
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,700
I'm okay. It's fine

277
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,420
Oh!

278
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,180
Gun?

279
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,030
Can't believe!

280
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,730
Why don't you tell me first? Hello!

281
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,110
Aww you didn't tell me first

282
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,440
Sawasdee krub [Hello]

283
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,290
Ah!

284
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,020
At first I thought I'd eat outside, but the plan has changed

285
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,750
Let's eat inside. I'll cook for you

286
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,820

00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,020
Everything there is always hurry

347
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,900
Unlike here

348
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,900
No need to hurry and be happy

349
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,360
I can do what I like

350
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,750
How about you?

351
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,750
Are you working?

352
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,820
and the money I gift each month...Is it enough?

353
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,050
You don't have to give it to me

354
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,110
Alright

355
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,690
Listen...I don't mean to be rude

356
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,090
It's a lot of money

357
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,670
I want you to keep it for you

358
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,720
We don't have to use that much here

359
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,400
Whatever...I still want to do for you

360
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,260
At least

361
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,060
you'll know

362
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,360
I can take care of myself

363
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:04,990
Good

364
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,510
I know you can do it

365
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,560
Staying there is hard

366
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,030
Take care of yourself

367
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,440
I will

368
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,430
Um...so...

369
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,140
About Golf

370
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,530
How long you seeing each other?

371
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,030
f...five years, dad

372
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:33,760
um

373
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:34,830
but...

374
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,890
We know each other more than that...

375
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,460
Are you okay with that?

376
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,710
Why not?

377
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,980
I raised you by myself

378
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,680
Whatever you do in your life...just know that I'm proud of you

379
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,520
Thank you

380
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,780
You know what?

381
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,660
Since you were young...

382
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,500
like a little kid

383
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,050
When you fell out

384
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,740
Crying out loud

385
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,420
You'll looking for me first

386
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,890
Wherever I go

387
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,680
You'll always stuck with me

388
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,890
Every time I come back home

389
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,050
You'll run to me and asked for a hug

390
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,180
Sometimes I scared

391
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,910
Scared too much that I can't let you do this

392
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,310
Can't let you do that

393
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,380
I'm too worried

394
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,900
and I'm sorry

395
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,570
that I compared you to the others

396
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,610
and I think

397
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,980
if you study just like I want you to

398
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,260
It must be good for your life

399
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,470
and you won't get bullied just like me

400
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,300
but in fact I forgot that...

401
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,930
It might not be your true happiness

402
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,510
No matter who you're with

403
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,700
how do you spend your life

404
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,070
It's all your rights

405
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,540
I might not be in front of you

406
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,990
when you're happy

407
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,370
but I will always got your back

408
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,130
Whenever you get tired

409
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,300
just turn back

410
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,640
and you'll always find me

411
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,760
Dad

412
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,110
I've been thinking all night

413
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,390
Since you were born til now

414
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,310
I never give you a supportive hug

415
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:08,410
[No matter how sweet the messages are,]

416
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:17,610
[It couldn’t be compared to when you smiled at me beautifully]

417
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:22,990
[Expressing love through messages repeatedly]

418
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,440
[can not make us fell in love]

419
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:34,240
[because it means nothing to my heart]

420
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,290
Woahhhh

421
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,770
Are these foods for all villagers?

422
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,070
No Don't tease me

423
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,800
It's an occasion. You've seen us for long

424
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,320
Yeah/ They're all your favorite!

425
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,200
Thank you, mom. They're a lot

426
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,040
Ummm

427
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,840
Eat them all. Don't hold it

428
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,520
Eat eat eat

429
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,460
Yeah

430
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,150
Son/ Yeah?

431
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,110
How's everything between you and Gun?

432
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,220
Well...

433
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,790
about 3 months from now...

434
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,900
I will try to do the work permit

435
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,850
in USA with him

436
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,540
Are you okay with that?

437
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:20,640
Well

438
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,980
Why not okay, Golf?

439
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,510
so...

440
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,060
Are you sad with that?

441
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,400
with what I choose

442
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,250
Um/Ah

443
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:44,610
I understand that social is now open MORE for LGBT

444
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:49,200
and I do understand that SOME is NOT open

445
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,440
Starting new life there is good as well

446
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,160
Right?

447
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,090
umm...and what's more

448
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,400
You're grow enough

449
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,150
I believe that

450
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,550
you choose what's the best for you

451
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,080
Um

452
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,340
but Social nowadays

453
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:17,420
we can communicate remotely

454
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:22,440
that sometimes we forget who stay close to us

455
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:26,360
Which means... if you're free

456
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,510
Just keep in touch, and then we're good

457
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,790
Okay?

458
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,540
and don't care about others that much

459
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,290
Get it?

460
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,250
Don't follow social media that much

461
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,220
Care of people you should care

462
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,790
I'm so glad that I'm you guys' son

463
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,380
um...We're glad either

464
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,010
You're so cute

465
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,310
We'll keep visiting you in USA

466
00:33:59,310 --> 00:33:59,810
um

467
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:04,110
Social media might keep us closer, but looking in person is much better

468
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,340
Right, mommy?/ Yeah, so I can hug you, too!

469
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,270
Yeah daddy, but It's USA

470
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,250
I can hug you in USA/ No!

471
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,429
I mean the price of 2 tickets to USA/ Oh

472
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:18,639
I don't scared of the price, I have the gold to exchange/ Woahh

473
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,330
I'll see you guys in USA

474
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,570
Okay!/ Let's eat, son

475
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:24,810
Ah

476
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,699
Tonight, my friends and I are having party

477
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,679
Um/ Oh

478
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,630
Can I go?

479
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,860
They said they have good news

480
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:32,929
Yeah, you should go

481
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,360
Then come tell me after

482
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,639
I wanna know either!

483
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,320
Wow! You're the big fan of them/ Of course

484
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,429
Hahaha

485
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:44,580
I'm glad for you. Alright, eat eat

486
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,840
Can I have two more pork loins? My boyfriend loves it

487
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:57,080
Thank you

488
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,090
Hahahaha Hey!
