00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,840
Thank you for everything

178
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,730
But I understand

179
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,870
If you don't want to be my friend anymore

180
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,940
I'm fine

181
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,400
Um

182
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,270
I'm okay

183
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,920
I finally found you

184
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,960
Mr. 8

185
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,010
Uhuh

186
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,260
Thank you

187
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,000

Whoa

197
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,400
This is your neighborhood?

198
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,650
Umm

199
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,760
Here's the entrance of the soi

200
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,190
You drew so close to reality

201
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,000
Of course

202
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,470
Whoa

203
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,940
The river near our house

204
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,260
Seeing these make me miss this place

205
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,530
Do you miss it?

206
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,620
Yeah

207
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,240
So...

208
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,680
Your name is Gun, right?

209
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,980
Yeah

210
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,140
Then...

211
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,980
Why you said your name was Gorn?

212
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,900
Well...

213
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,340
I was nervous

214
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,880
And also...

215
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,200
My full name is actually Gorn

216
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,730
You're smart

217
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,160
You've tricked me that your name was Gorn for many years

218
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,320
So...

219
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,870
Why you didn't want me to know your real name?

220
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,870
That you're Number 8

221
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,920
Well...

222
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,950
I don't know

223
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,030
Just like what I told you

224
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,950
I just didn't want to disappoint you

225
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,310
And...

226
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,390
I was afraid that you won't want to talk to me

227
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,290
I could only secretly watch your drum major practice

228
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,830
Did you ever think that I interest in you?

229
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,000
No

230
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,120
Actually

231
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,430
I think I knew

232
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,410
Knew what?

233
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,010
Since when?

234
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,750
Since...

235
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,560
Sport day

236
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,040
What?

237
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,410
Seriously?

238
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,590
I just wasn't sure

239
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,030
But I thought I was correct

240
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,660
I also have other clues

241
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,700
What?

242
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,210
Sprite with salt,

243
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,050
You forget to response when I called you Gorn,

244
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,970
And suddenly Number 8 said he was busy

245
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,640
Also, you were jealous of me

246
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,080
Jealous??

247
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,460
Who got jealous of you?

248
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,160
About the Arts friend

249
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,650
Nonsense

250
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,840
Then why weren't you ask me since then

251
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,460
I want you to tell me yourself

252
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,160
But today, seeing your drawing,

253
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,360
And your lined pattern

254
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,760
I can't stay silent

255
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,120
If I wait for you to talk,

256
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,140
I might have to wait until next life

257
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,330
Such a stubborn person!

258
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,010
Nonsense

259
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,520
It quite weird that we're talking about this

260
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,520
In a good or bad way?

261
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,920
Good

262
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,110
Really good

263
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,790
Then... you have to stick with me forever

264
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,680
How?

265
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,100
You are...

266
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,560
the person I've been looking for

267
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,670
Can we skip from being a good friends...

268
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,790
To be a lover instead?

269
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,440
Yess

270
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,490
Your heart's beating like a drum, I can hear it

271
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,580
You're exaggerating

272
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,830
Nonsense

273
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,790
Well...

274
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,660
Don't you want to touch my heart?

275
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,030
You're heart's beating so loud

276
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,040
What?

277
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,770
Tomorrow I have morning class again

278
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,470
Yeah

279
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,250
You don't have to walk me home

280
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,130
It's near

281
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,810
What about your wound?

282
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,680
It's ok

283
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,180
I'm fine

284
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,950
My dorm is near

285
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,220
Gun

286
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:15,200
Since now that we're together

287
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,900
Do you want to move out of collage dorm to live in apartment together?

288
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,660
Hmm?

289
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,270
It will be more convenient

290
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,690
I mean...

291
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,860
More convenient for us to work together

292
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,330
The security guard here is scary

293
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,000
Ok

294
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,830
Apartment

295
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,930
Deal?

296
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,760
So...

297
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,330
[The story of love]

298
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,760
I have to go

299
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,210
[was filled with smiles and tears]

300
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,850
What?

301
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,670
You can go now

302
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,090
Bye bye

303
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,600
Walk carefully

304
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,470
Damn it!!!

305
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,070
God damn it!!

306
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,650
I passed!

307
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,070
I'm so tired

308
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,240
Congratulation

309
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,000
Now you can do the famous car accident case, right?

310
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,470
What the hell? I just passed criminal law

311
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,630
Are you stupid?

312
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,830
I was just kidding

313
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,770
Hey, Nan

314
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,240
I think...

315
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,320
You should change your phone to iPhone

316
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,310
It has Facebook

317
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,930
Maybe you can find some hot girls

318
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,350
True, BB is out now

319
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,550
Trust me

320
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,450
It's ok

321
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,640
I'm not in a hurry to catch a new trend

322
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,920
You don't want to or you're still can't get over with Chompu

323
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,770
Are you texting Chompu?

324
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,600
Umm

325
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,010
Err...well

326
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,420
We're sorry

327
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,340
To prank you to flirt with Chompu

328
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,660
We don't think that...

329
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,960
Play boy like you...

330
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,680
will actually like her

331
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,860
Our lives is different from hers

332
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,850
You guys, let bygones be bygones

333
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,490
Let's go drink tonight

334
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:11,950
Won't stop till we're drunk

335
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,920
Anyone interest??

336
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,040
Good idea

337
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,900
Let's celebrate for passing exam

338
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,870
Let's go

339
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,280
Ok, go

340
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,520
That's it

341
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,850
You guys pay for me

342
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,090
Sure

343
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:26,880
Let's go

344
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,770
I'll put this in the bin first

345
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,820
Good boy

346
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:39,850
Today, I have so many assignment

347
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,840
A lot to listen, so I fell asleep instead

348
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,590
Nan?

349
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,390
Drop me here

350
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,640
Why?

351
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,460
Don't you want me to take you to classroom?

352
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,570
It's ok

353
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,940
Go finish your assignment

354
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,790
So...

355
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,600
I'll be back soon

356
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,190
You can stay with your friends after you finish

357
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,920
It's ok

358
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,150
I'll get back to you as soon as I finish

359
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,760
Nan...

360
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,560
Are you tired for doing this?

361
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,400
Why did you ask question like that?

362
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:33,970
Sometimes I feel like you try so hard

363
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,210
Like you're not yourself anymore

364
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,730
But...

365
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,440
I'm me

366
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,200
I ask you seriously

367
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,590
Do you really like me?

368
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,380
Or you just pity me?

369
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,490
You should go back to be your own self

370
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,330
Hanging out with your friends

371
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,210
Do whatever you want to do

372
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,790
But...

373
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,340
But I'm...

374
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,620
Trust me

375
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,440
If we continue to do this,

376
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,670
We won't be happy

377
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,120
I have to go

378
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,340
[The picture of you still look the same,]

379
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,030
Do you need my help?

380
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,950
It's fine

381
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,150
I can go by my own

382
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,960
[but we can’t go back again]

383
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:54,220
[to the time when we were close]

384
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:01,500
[No matter how sweet the messages are,]

385
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,790
[it couldn’t be compared to]

386
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:10,430
[when you smiled at me beautifully]

387
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:15,920
[Expressing love through messages repeatedly]

388
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,990
[cannot make us fall in love]

389
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:26,310
[because it means nothing to my heart]

390
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,870
Let's cheers

391
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,250
Come on

392
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,830
Bottom up!

393
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,410
Wait, I'll add more ice

394
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,630
I'll be right back

395
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,940
Nan, what's wrong with you?

396
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,760
So quiet

397
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:03,960
I don't know

398
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,490
I don't feel enjoyed as it was

399
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,690
Why?

400
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,470
I don't know

401
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,300
I think...

402
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,230
It's like...

403
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,200
I lost something

404
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,830
What the f***/ Nan Nan Nan

405
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,900
Why the f*** you slapped me?

406
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,900
That was hurt

407
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,970
Hey! Is it like...

408
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,730
Are you falling in love?

409
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,590
Right?

410
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,610
No answer?

411
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,530
I guess it's true!

412
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,120
No way! It's nothing

413
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,350
Really? / I'm falling in love? Nah

414
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
That could happened. You can fall in love if you find the one

415
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,120
but you... don't need to scared of anything

416
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,100
Who? Chompu?

417
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,880
Yeah

418
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,840
Chompu

419
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,210
I...

420
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,580
When I was with her...

421
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,620
Go on

422
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:57,940
I feel like

423
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,830
I don't feel myself

424
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,310
and did you... did you try to be yourself?

425
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,250
when you're with her?

426
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,120
listen

427
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,980
Don't mad at me

428
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,260
I wanna tell you that

429
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,880
She's just paralyzed

430
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,240
Look at the past

431
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,970
Did you see her as Chompu or a paralyzed lady?

432
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,610
Relax, dude

433
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:39,730
Hey

434
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,850
Can your phone surfing on Facebook?

435
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,260
Ah Yeah

436
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,430
Can I...

437
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,990
use your phone looking for her Facebook?

438
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,650
Here

439
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,120
What's her full name?

440
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,290
Chonticha

441
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,430
and her last name?

442
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,620
I don't know

443
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,470
Hey

444
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,800
Type her name in English

445
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,050
I told you I don't know her last name!

446
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,630
Oh! That's tough

447
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,780
Here

448
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,310
Thanks

How about this?

450
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,550
If you don't feel enjoyed

451
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,780
you should back home, dude

452
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,030
It's fine

453
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,910
We'll take care of ladies behind

454
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,550
I don't mind. I'm not in a mood

455
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,890
Hahaha ...Awww

456
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,630
Don't be stressed

457
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,070
Hey

458
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,080
Oh, Nan

459
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,140
Have you tried...calling to her?

460
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,820
Let's try

461
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:19,910
How was it?

462
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,830
She might blocked me

463
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:47,400
Faculty of Law's freshy star of 2005

Did you watch football last night?

471
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,409
That was bullshit

472
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:26,980
What a shame!

473
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,510
Hey bro!

474
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,909
Can I borrow your Civil Procedure Code?

475

Hey! Nan!

What?

Sorry

Are you... the dorm's owner?

This is for women only. Men can't rent here

Her name's Chompu

486
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,350
Chompu?

487
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,720
There were many Chompu(s) here

488
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,360
Ah...the one who...

489

Ah...who's also cute, right?

491
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,590
Yeah

492

You know her?

493
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,590
Could you take her to see me please?

494
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,420
Oh, I'm afraid not

495
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,400
Why?

496
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,620
She has moved to another place for long

497
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,650
She moved already?

498
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,160
Um

499

How can I contact her?

501
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,290
I can't either

502
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,000
Oh

Will you be my girlfriend?

506
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,060
Don't you feel ashamed when people look at you?

507
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,990
What to be shame of?

508
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,570
shame of having me...

509

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,310
Stop talking to that mute guy

526
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,240
Hey, I'll come after

527
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,500
NM says: Are you having fun?

528
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,870
Hm? What, Name?

529
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,250
What fun?

530
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:53,130
NM says: Why she called me a mute guy?

531
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,800
Huh

532
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,220
Wait, Name! It's...

533
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,870
It isn't like that, Name

534
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,070
It isn't what you heard. It's...

535
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:07,280
NM says: If you're with me because of pitying, then stop it

536
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,410
NM says: It's hurt

537
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,800
Why don't you say anything? A mute guy!

538
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,240
Why don't you say anything? A mute guy!

539
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,970
Say it!

540
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,660
Say it!

541
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,290
A mute!

542
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,110
Say it!/ Yeah, say it!/ Say it!

543
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,780
Say!

544
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,950
or you wanna be muted for real?

545
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,070
Stop talking to that mute guy

546
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,370
[Writing until it become stories]

547
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:42,260
[before the day we shall be far apart]

548
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:50,730
[Keeping our memories all along]

549
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:57,480
[knowing how precious they are to my heart]

550
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:04,930
[That familiar embrace]

551
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,920
[that I...]

552
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,070
[still remembered them all]

553
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:19,390
[You still the same]

554
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:27,610
[but we can't go back to the past]

555
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:33,550
[when we were together...again]

556
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,860
[open the lit]

557
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,530
M...

558
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,760
M...

559
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,520
...om

560
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,430
Mo...

561
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,140
Mo...

562
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:19,500
[telling me, texting me that you love me]

563
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,200
Mom...

564
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,590
[but It can't make you love me now]

565
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:26,360
[Every breath]

566
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:26,860
Mom...

567
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,390
[must be nothing without you]

568
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,880
Are you okay?

569
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,610
Um

570
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:09,200
Are you sure?

571
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,880
Whatever...you still got us

572
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,060
You can tell us anything

573
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,420
Don't be overthinking

574
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,940
but...It's a little bit hard

575
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:36,470
What kind of hard?

576
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,720
Well...

577
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,220
My family isn't alike the others

578
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:47,850
Sorry

579
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,240
Are you...Preaw?

580
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:00,570
[The story of love]

581
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,790
[that once happened]

582
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:07,800
[was filled with smiles and tears]

583
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,900
[It's like the stars, so beautiful]

584
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,960
[and was filled with fond of memories]

585
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,350
[It's like the season that our heart felt lonely]

586
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:28,080
[You're the breeze I missed in summer]

587
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:34,830
[The warmth that was there every times I wished for]

588
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:38,290
[It made me wet on a rainy day]

589
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:43,280
[Please let me escape from here]
