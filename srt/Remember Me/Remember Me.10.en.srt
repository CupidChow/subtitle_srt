1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,690
Then,

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,180
I neither want to know

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,280
nor talk anymore

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,200
When relationships end,

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,690
some may end because of boredom

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,910
or negligence,

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,820
while others may end

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,170
due to a lack of courage to exppress love

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,810
Until,

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,140
the day...

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,760
mom collapsed

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,000
But you know what?

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,780
I had to... overcome my fear

14
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,150
Otherwise,

15
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,400
I would have lost mom

16
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,900
And

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,540
I might...

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,250
lose you too

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,470
I won't leave you

20
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,730
You're not alone, Name

21
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,410
You have me,

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,740
Aunt Nid

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,600
and our gang

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,590
From this time on,

25
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,840
live your life to the fullest

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,780
You have overcome your fear

27
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:58,170
[The picture of you still look the same]

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,560
[But we can’t go back again]

29
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,370
Let's go home

30
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:13,720
[To the time when we were close]

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,360

[It's like the stars]

35
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,210
[so beautiful]

36
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,180
[and was filled with fond of memories]

37
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,750
[It's like the season]

38
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,750
[that our heart felt lonely]

39
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,500
[You're the breeze I missed in summer]

40
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,510
[The warmth that was there every times I wished for]

41
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,210
[It made me wet on a rainy day]

42
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,550
[Please let me escape from here]

43
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,390
[from those good memories that I still remember]

44
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:44,400
[Please let me disappear]

45
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:51,280
[Because you stay and don't go away]

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,850
[Be a flower as lovely as a shining star]

47
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:01,250
[and still live in the dark lonely planet]

48
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,160
[It always has me, a keeper]

49
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,040

[was hidden even after a long time]

53

[The photos from the past]

54
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,060
[were written upon hopefully with a pen]

[We will be together forever]

56
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,530
You came just in time. I'm cooking this

57
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,710
Huh?

58
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,830
Mom

59
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,860
I feel sorry for Name

60
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,750
Em

61
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,310
You can feel sorry

62
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,940
but do aware that nobody wants to be pitied for the entire life

63
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,100
Look at you

64
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,150
Our job is trying to understand him

65
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,670
and be by his side

66
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,870
Got it?

67
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,560
And if you could get him to love himself more,

68
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,210
it would be ideal

69
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,409
Can you do that?

70
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,000
Hm?

71
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,510
Be careful, Champ

72
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,780
It happened near your condominium, so mom is worried

73
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,860
Don't go around that place

74
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,060
Hey, let's go to our class

75
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,690
Um

76
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,850
What time do we start?

77
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,909
10 a.m.

78
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,170
I'm looking for a friend

79
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,670
Excuse me

80
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,180
Are you Preaw?

81
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,880
Preaw

82
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,170
Yes, I'm Preaw

83
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,510
So very much Preaw (you're hot)

84
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,680
Can I sit here?

85
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,750
Oh, please do

86
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,159
Nuck-Nan

87
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,330
You look better in person

88
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,360
And you're...

89
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,390
as pretty as your picture

90
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,850
Awww

91
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,200
You flatter me, Nuck-Nan!

92
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,290
Oh, should we order something?

93
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,250
Excuse me

94
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,080
No, there's no need

95
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,340
Let's continue what we talked earlier

96
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,140
Um

97
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,000
Actually,

98
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
about that...

99
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,640
I sympathize with you

100
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,900
It sounds like a drama

101
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,950
Finding someone you have no information about

102
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,950
I'm very sorry for you

103
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,760
Thank you

104
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
She deleted all her social media/ Um

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,390
The only clue left is the BB that you bought

106
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,130
Could you please let me see your BB?

107
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,340
Ah

108
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,450
Yes

109
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,440
This one?

110
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,420
Yes, it's this one

111
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,110
Oh

112
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,660
Ohhh

113
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,940
The thing is

114
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,580
it's originally too plain

115
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,100
so I added colors and decorations

116
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
to make it match my style

117
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,360
Where did you buy it?

118
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,410
A mobile phone shop in town. It's located near here

119
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,420
Can you guide me there?

120
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,390
Yeah sure

121
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,090
Then, let's eat something first

122
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,270
Never mind! Let's go now

123
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,710
How can we get there?

124
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,200
Ummm so...

125
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,070
A sexy girl like me likes to use a motorcycle

126
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,860
Let's go. I'll wait outside

127
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,860
But you'll have to ride on the back

128
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,690
That's fine

129
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,290
I'll come back and pay later

130
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,830
You'll need to hold onto me tightly/ I will

131

[Mobile phone repair service]

132
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,980
Here. This shop

133
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,940
It's closed

134
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,940
So, do you have anything to do next?

135
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,800
Actually, I have a test

136
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,670
Oh, do you want to go back to the university first?

137
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,670
I can drop you off

138
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,720
What do you think?

139
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,310
I want to wait here

140
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,000
If you wanna wait, should we hang out in town for a while?

141
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,050
No, thank you. I'll wait right here

142
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,430
Alright

143
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,270
But I have to go. I'm seeing my friend

144

How is it?

Sounds good, thank you/ Pleasure

Yes

152
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,610
I finished watching movie and came back

153
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,860
So

154
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,190
What are you going to do? Sleep here?

155
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,020
I guess so

156
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,760
In case they come back at night

157
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,880
Do you want to sleep at my house tonight?

158
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,720
No, thanks

159
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,000
No?

Fine

Hey

165
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,130
What?

166
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,120
You're still here?

167
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,640
Is it morning already?

168
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,060
Yes

Ha

170
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,570
I give up one you

171

You really are willing to do everything for love

But I'm not sure if the person I'm looking for wants to see me

173
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,820
I promise that all my life

174

I'll fight for you

Hey, the shop is opened. I bought BB from him

176
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
Excuse me!

177
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,860
What is it?

178
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,160
Hi bro! Can you remember me?

179
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,540
Wait a second

180
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,620
Ahhh/ Ahh

181
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,310
You're familiar/ Ah

182
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,440
I cannot remember you like this

183
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,140
Now I can see you

184
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,530
You can remember me, right?/ A little

185
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,040
What's up?

186
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,920
Do you want to change battery or buy a new phone today?

187
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,360
I'm not buying a mobile phone. I'm finding someone

188
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,730
What was that?

189
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,390
The thing is...

190
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,520
Can you remember who you got this from?

191
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,340
Whoaaa

192
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,240
How could I remember since it's decorated like this?

193
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,040
Hey! Stop!

194
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
My shop didn't have a phone like this

195
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,250
Fine! fine

196
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,690
It was originally in plain black like this

197
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,690
These pink flowers match my style

198
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,440
Who could remember if you make it like that?

199
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,080
For real? You can't remember?

200
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,250
No

201
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,900
Nothing else?

202
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,590
Wait

203
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,760
Are you the one who has a good voice?

204
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,640
whom I had to stop by and listen when you sang

205
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,030
Hey/ Right?

206
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,260
Uhuh

207
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,170
Haha

208
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,400
Yes, it's me

209
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,390
I know it

210
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,780
His voice is so good

211
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,310
Yeah, I agree. I heard it when you arrived

212
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,810
I'll see what I can find

213
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,290
Wait here

214
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,770
Thank you

215
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,440
Oh. I found it! I brought it here

216
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,980
Ohh

217
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,520
Here!

218
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,270
Ta-daa

219
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,460
Let's see

220
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,420
Ahhh

221
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,000
His name is Chonlathorn

222
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,640
lives in

223
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,980
Farm...

224
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,200
Can you read this?

225
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,640
Farm uhh

226
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,970
What is it?

227
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,390
Chonticha!

228
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,860
Ban Na district

229
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,640
Huh?

230
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,970
Ban Na!?

231
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,600
Yeah/ Why?

232
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,400
It's very far from here. Very very far

233
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,560
How do I get there? Is there a bus or anything?

234
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,150
Yeah, there's.../ Wait wait

235
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,460
Don't worry, Nuck-Nan

236
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,070
I'm always here to help you

237
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,980
So

238
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,680
Get on my motorcycle and let me drop you off

239
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,250
Thanks a lot

240
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,550
I have to go. Bye

241
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,700
Hey! I'm good at singing, right?

242
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,930
Hehe

243
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,950
Hello? Who is it?

244
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,890
Are you awake?

245
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,360
Name?

246
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,950
Um

247
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,290
Did I wake you up?

248
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,950
Yeah, but it's a good thing

249
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,230
I want you to wake me up every day

250
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,330
Hurry up and go to class

251
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,650
Yes sir

252
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:45,840
Oh

253
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,150
Is this your BB number?

254
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,300
Um

255
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,830
But

256
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
I've changed it to iPhone

257
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,000
Mom said

258
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,530
so that I could talk to you

259
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,300
Haha

260
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,560
Okay okay

261
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,490
I'll call you often

262
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,030
Study hard

263
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,710
Yess

264
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,690
Then I'll go. Bye

265
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,380
If I had known you could talk like this,

266
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,780
I would have bought your iPhone since last year

267
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,310
I'm so glad that you're this lively

268
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,770
Mom/ Hm?

269
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,860
Are you happier?

270
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,360
Of course

271
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,370
We only have each other

272
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,810
If you're happy,

273
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,130
then I'm also happy

274
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,680
Let's eat

275
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,270
You have an online class later, aren't you?

276
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,890
Yes

277
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,920
Hehe

278
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,730
This restaurant is very popular

279
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,160
I have to wake up at 5 in the morning to wait in line

280
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
It's normally sold out no later than 8

281
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,070
Ahem

282
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,910
Hi, bro. Do you know where's Chonticha farm?

283
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,510
That way?

284
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,110
How far is it?

285
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,540
500 meters. Turn left

286
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,000
Okay, thank you/ Thank you

287
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,990
Bye

288
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,450
Ow. Hold on tight, Nuck-Nan/ Yes

289
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,750
Be careful. We might fall

290
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,100
You may stop here

291
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,320
Alright

292
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Eh, excuse me

293
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,660
Is this... Chonticha farm?

294
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,220
Yes, what's the matter?

295
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,570
I...

296
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,320
Let me explain. Nuck-nan is...

297
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,650
Darling

298
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,200
Yes

299
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,530
Ehh

300
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:51,670
I'm almost there. I'm just out for a little while

301
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,150
I'm buying food for you

302
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,170
Wait a moment. I'm almost there

303
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,560
I'll be right back

304
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,440
Okay. Yes

305
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
XOXO

306
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,830
My boyfriend is calling me

307
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,490
I have to go

308
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,950
Keep fighting, Nuck-Nan

309
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,010
I wish you a big success!

310
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,050
Thank you

311
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,000
And you... I'll come back in the evening

312
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,350
I gotta go

313
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,050
Ahhhh

314
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,770
So?

315
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,860
I'm...

316
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,030
NakNan

317
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,410
I'm looking for Chompu

318
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,200
How do you know my sister?

319
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,160
I like her

320
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,300
I wanna see her and talk to her

321
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,050
Are you sure?

322
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,000
You like her?

323
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,940
Er...

324
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,990
I know...

325
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,930
at first...

326
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,560
I feel pity for her

327
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,840
but when I know her more

328
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,620
I just like the way she is

329
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,960
Now I know my feelings

330
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,970
that's why I came here

331
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,410
If you really love her

332
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,220
I'll take you to her

333
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,690
Thank you

334
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,950
Where's she?

335
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,990
[The story of love]

336
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,720
[that once happened]

337
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,850
[was filled with smiles and tears]

338
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,650
[It's like the stars]

339
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,150
Chompu

340
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,950
[so beautiful]

341
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,910
[and was filled with fond of memories]

342
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,050
[It's like the season]

343
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,330
[that our heart felt lonely]

344
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,340
Finally, I found you

345
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,260
[You're the breeze I missed in summer]

346
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,200
[You're the warmth I wished for]

347
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,990
[and you're also the rain that makes me feel sad]

348
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:46,720
[Please let me go away from here]

349
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,440
You're cheating

350
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,140
You ran away from me so far

351
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,370
You said you'll be gone for a while

352
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,820
but it was so long

353
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,740
I'm sorry, Nan

354
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,220
It's me, not you

355
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,580
Sometimes I just...

356
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,850
It's fine

357
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,260
When we were apart

358
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,470
I don't feel myself

359
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,970
When I passed the exam

360
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,800
You know? I was so glad

361
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,150
but I wish you were there with me

362
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,750
I wish you texting me like

363
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,420
Have you eaten something yet?

364
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,680
How was reading books?

365
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,800
It might be a simply text

366
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,870
but it means a lot to me

367
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,800
Can we try it again?

368
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,780
Chompu?

369
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,030
Nan

370
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,890
Are you sure?

371
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:07,930
Um

372
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,160
Of course

373
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,910
Thank you for everything. You've done a lot

374
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,870
You either. Thank you

375
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,350
This is my old room

376
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,780
You can sleepover here

377
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,320
Thank you

378
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,060
Is it alright for you?

379
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,110
C'mon

380
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,360
Here's so comfy

381
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,670
Can I apply the farmer position after I graduate?

382
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,030
Sure

383
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,100
but it's a no pay

384
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,520
so...have a good dream

385
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,260
Good night

386
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,520
Ah

387
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,920
You can use my clothes in the wardrobe

388
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,060
Thank you so much

389
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,060
1 year later

390
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,850
Alright

391
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,870
1...

392
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,280
2...

393
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,490
3!

394
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,010
Let me see!

395
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,040
Here

396
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,760
Woooo

397
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,560
I love the camera of Iphone4!

398
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,300
Gotta get one

399
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,300
I'm so handsome/ Woahh

400
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,110
Hey! Name

401
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:46,710
I think we have the room to put NakNan in the pic

402
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,520
He might be so upset

403
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,210
Okay

404
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,350
Name

405
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,630
You can speak!?

406
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,950
Hey guys...

407
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,220
He can speak!

408
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,190
It's the first time I hear your voice!

409
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,540
Let's go to Karaoke!

410
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,780
So you can speak as much as you want

411
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,300
Okay?/ Hmm

412
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,220
Okay or not?

413
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,450
Don't tease him, Champ!

414
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,800
Woahh/ Hahaha

415
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,600
Golf

416
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,590
I'm wondering

417
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,410
Why don't you wear the uniform?

418
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,830
Well...it's time for Gun's friend

419
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,110
I can take a pic with him later

420
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,910
Wooooo

421
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,350
What're you saying?

422
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,030
Wow. A couple photo

423
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,030

Hahaha

Wowwww

426
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,150
Alright

427
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,340
I'll take a pic for you guys, okay?

428
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,060
Well

429
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,410
Should we take at Thai study room?

430
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,330
You guys have written letters for years

431
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,370
Stop it/ Shhhhh

432
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,840
You kept writing and not going anywhere!

433
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,580
Em!/ You were like...

434

Bye!/ Come back!

445
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,060
Woah Dad! Why did you keep cold?

446
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,120
Smile. Yeah, smile

447
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,360
Let's do it again

448
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,100
Okay, mom

449
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,020
Ah. Let's take a pic again

450

Alright, everyone! Smile

451

Good

459
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,860
Hey

460
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,800
Dad, make a wish for your son

461
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,950
He gotta go working at BKK

462
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,210
You're great, son

463
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,370

Cool

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,020
Same place is better

481
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,280
Alright

482
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,450

Wanna eat something?

Wanna stay for a while?

No, I'll leave this evening

490
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,700
Champ, I invited you in a family line group

491
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,700
Um

492
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,410
Hm

493
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:35,710
Ah, Gun

494
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,850
Have you watched this one?

495
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,400
A funny clip

496
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,330
It goes viral now

497
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,310
I put it here but just a sec, it's gone!/ Hahaha

498

Have you watched?/ Yeah, I have

499
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,780
It goes viral as you said

500
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,740
Say it/ Where's my sticky rice?!

501
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,790
It's not sticky rice!

502
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,680
Hahaha/ Enough!

503
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,540

We have to see Pao and Baseball tonight

507
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,970
I'm sorry

508
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,800
I totally forget it. I have a conference

509
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:06,870
But

510
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,960
You still go?

511
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,800
Um

512
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,340
Hmmm

513
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,720
You did it again

514
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,000
Last time you left me at the theatre

515
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,260
I'm sorry

516
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,790
Ummm

00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,440
Um I know it

522
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,460

00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:32,760

575
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,390
It's just a small wedding at Phuket

576
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,600
I love warmth and comfy atmosphere

577
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,310

578
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,680

579
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,510
Can I ask you something?

580
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,350
Does it have any effect?

581
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,520
after you get married?

582
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,080

Nothing happened

584
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,310
It effects on our heart

585
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,060
There's no LGBT marriage law support in Thailand

586
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,110
Um

587
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,120

588
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,500

Hm

592
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,380
but the social still don't accept us

593
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,480
no eligible law

594
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,070
so...

595
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,790
What you're gonna do with you guys' asset?

596

I think we trust each other

598
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,670
If one day...

599
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,790

603
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,430
as a lover status in law

604
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,680
Um/ I do hope...

605
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,980
One day... Thailand will have an equal marriage

606
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,540
Hm/ It must be good/ Hm

607
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,350
