1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
A new beginning might be better than bearing with something old

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,730
Although, a new beginning might be hard

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,470
Hey, Chompu

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,380
What?

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,160
Can I ask you something?

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,660
Well...

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,760
We've been talking for a while now

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,210
And also video calling with each other

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,880
I want to meet you in person

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,580
I know my reputation is quite bad

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,900
But I want to get to know you more

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,720
And you to get to know me more

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,710
Sure

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,950
But before we meet in person

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,420
I want to show you something first

16
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,810
What?

17
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,250
I can't walk

18
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,110
I had a car accident 10 years ago

19
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,640
And...

20
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,080
I have to use wheel chair since then

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Really?

22
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,140
I'm sorry

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,770
I didn't intend to hide or lie about this

24
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,660
But I can't find a chance to tell you

25
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,160
Er..it..it's not like that. I just...

26
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,100
I was chocked

27
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,110
I don't know what to do

28
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,740
I understand that you might chock about this

29
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,930
Or you don't want to talk to me anymore

30
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,930
It's ok. I understand

31
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,680
So, I have to go and do my paper

32
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,350
[The story of love]

33
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,720
[that once happened]

34
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,750
[was filled with smiles and tears]

35
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,040
[It's like the stars]

36
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,050
[so beautiful]

37
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,959
[and was filled with fond of memories]

38
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,690
[It's like the season]

39
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,420
[that our heart felt lonely]

40
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,200
[You're the breeze I missed in summer]

41
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,159
[The warmth that was there every times I wished for]

42
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:39,070
[It made me wet on a rainy day]

43
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:44,320
[Please let me escape from here]

44
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,060
[from those good memories that I still remember]

45
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:56,620
[Please let me disappear]

46
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,170
[Because you stay and don't go away]

47
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,900
[Be a flower as lovely as a shining star]

48
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,130
[and still live in the dark lonely planet]

49
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,180
[It always has me, a keeper]

50
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,500
[who never walked away]

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,360
[The story of love]

52
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,680
[that once happened]

53
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,690
[was hidden even after a long time]

54
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,600
[The photos from the past]

55
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,240
[That was pictured by dream]

56
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,790
At a club, don't wait for me!

57
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,690
Where is he?

58
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,900
Sorry, I was writing diary

59
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,030
I'll call you

60
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,000
Umm

61
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,060
Hello

62
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,650
Don't mad at me anymore?

63
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,850
Maybe

64
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,180
I know you love to write

65
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,000
So, writing a diary might make you feel less lonely

66
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,810
Writing and talking are not the same

67
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,180
If one wants to forget both writing and talking won't help

68
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,920
Hey Name!

69
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,850
It's not like that

70
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,030
Lately, I have a lot of work to do

71
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,000
Also, the studying will get more intense

72
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,450
And also cheer leader practice

73
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,860
I don't want to make any promises for you to wait for me

74
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,290
We'll talk to each other less

75
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,230
But If I have time, I'll call you

76
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,180
I might seem distant from you

77
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,000
But...

78
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,550
You don't have to wait for me every day

79
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,240
You might forget to give me your time

80
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,300
Hey Name!

81
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,330
It's not what I meant

82
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,950
Name? Hello?

83
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,000
Hello

84
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,720
Um yes

85
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,290
Just like what you said

86
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,580
Umm yes

87
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,610
Lately, I have to study more than I was before

88
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,110
Because I finished all general subjects

89
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,000
Also cheer leader practice

90
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,940
Yes

91
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,050
Alright

92
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,980
So, do like that we discuss today

93
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,350
Yes, goodbye

94
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,240
Shit!

95
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,540
You're shit

96
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,270
What're you doing in here?

97
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,910
You said you were at a club, didn't you?

98
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,740
I was going to

99
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,000
But I was lazy

100
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Then why're you in here?

101
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,680
Just to randomly thinking

102
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,520
What's it about?

103
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,760
Are you thinking about whether Obama will win or not?

104
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,370
Nonsense

105
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,110
Why do I have to think about other people's businesses

106
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
I can't even handle my problems

107
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,310
Is it about Chompu?

108
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,580
Spill the tea!

109
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,530
You know I've been talking to her for a while right?

110
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,000
Also video calling

111
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,080
I like her

112
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
So, I want to meet her in person

113
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,370
But when I asked, she....

114
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,260
She said she has to use wheel chair for the rest of her life

115
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:23,960
Chocked story!

116
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,710
Yeah

117
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,690
I was like...

118
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,270
I don't know what to do

119
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880
Can I be with her?

120
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,650
Then don't be with her

121
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,420
See? You like her

122
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,860
Then what're you worry about?

123
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,840
It's...it's her legs

124
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,140
That I worry about

125
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,900
Can she eat out with you?

126
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,730
Yes, she can

127
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Can she watch a movie with you?

128
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,920
Then she's not different from you

129
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,180
She's a human just like you

130
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,710
You're worrying because you think she's different

131
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,600
But trust me

132
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,810
She would like you to see her as a normal people

133
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,480
Because she can do everything that me and you can

134
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,880
Bro, you like her for her heart...

135
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,010
Or her legs?

136
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,500
Go away! I'll take a shower

137
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,460
You can keep contemplating outside

138
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,650
What're we studying next?

139
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,020
Korn!

140
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,500
Korn!

141
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,900
What makes you zone out?

142
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,020
Well, I just randomly thinking

143
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,410
Sorry

144
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,120
Where're you going?

145
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Wow

146
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,270
You have BlackBerry

147
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,750
You're on trend!

148
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,110
My friends use it

149
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,590
But no one reply to my text

150
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,480
I'm going to buy some colors at Somjai (stationery shop)

151
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,280
I heard teacher said the price is affordable

152
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,230
I see

153
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,430
Do you know where Somjai is?

154
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,840
No

155
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,260
But I'll try to find it along the way

156
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:57,760
Then,

157
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,640
Can I go with you?

158
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,150
Uhh

159
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,060
Don't worry!

160
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,270
I can go there by myself

161
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,860
No

162
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,640
I also have to buy colors

163
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,560
So you know where it is?

164
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,700
No

165
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,280
But it's better to get lost together than to get lost alone

166
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,060
By the way, wait for me, Korn

167
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,400
Let me go get my stuff first

168
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,990
Wait a minute. Don't go without me

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,020
[so beautiful]

174
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,760
[and was filled with fond of memories]

175
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,200
[It's like the season]

176
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,440
[that our heart felt lonely]

177
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,020
[You're the breeze I missed in summer]

178
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:38,200
[The warmth that was there every times I wished for]

179
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,080
[It made me wet on a rainy day]

180
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,240
[Please let me escape from here]

181
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,160
[from those good memories that I still remember]

182
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,920
[Please let me disappear]

183
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,960
[Because you stay and don't go away]

184
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,690
[Be a flower as lovely as a shining star]

185
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,220
[and still live in the dark lonely planet]

186
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,980
[It always has me, a keeper]

187
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,690
[who never walked away]

188
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,940
[The story of love]

189
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,980
[that once happened]

190
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:44,030
[was hidden even after a long time]

191
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,170
[The photos from the past]

192
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,040
[that was drawn upon by a magical pen]

193
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:54,450
[saying we'll be together forever]

194
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,320
[It's like the season]

195
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,320
[that changes habitually]

196
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,950
[You're still the breeze I missed in summer]

197
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,380
[The warmth that was there every times I wished for]

198
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,930
[You're like the rain that drenches me wet]

199
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,920
[Please let me escape from here]

200
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,800
I'm somewhat tired

201
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,220
But it's fun

202
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,880
Like we had a city tour

203
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,410
Haaa

204
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,050
It'll only take 5 minutes if we're in Pad Riew

205
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,160
But it's Bangkok here, so we spent half a day

206
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,070
That's true

207
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,160
It took so long

208
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,310
Can I ask you something?

209
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,000
Um

210
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,500
Why did you chose the Faculty of Architecture?

211
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,930
Do you like drawing since childhood?

212
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,500
Um

213
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
I like to draw since elementary school

214
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,640
Whenever there were events or contests,

215
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,710
I was always the school representative

216
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,130
And

217
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,240
Have you participated in other kinds of activities?

218
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,140
Nope

219
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,620
I'm ugly

220
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,020
Is it relevant?

221
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,970
Everyone can look good

222
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,540
with make up

223
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,960
No, my face is not that good

224
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
And I had a lot of pimples before

225
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,760
So

226
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,330
Have you ever been jealous of anyone?

227
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,720
No

228
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
I didn't compare myself with anyone

229
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,060
How so?

230
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,200
Like...

231
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,510
For me,

232
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,010
Those who look better than me,

233
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,880
cannot choose their faces too

234
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,380
Hmm

235
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,650
For example,

236
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,760
Nowadays

237
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:49,410
people want to choose a beautiful lover

238
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,710
Yeah

239
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
I feel like they're pressured too

240
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,930
Because

241
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
they're chosen by their looks

242
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,130
so most people will think they have privileges

243
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:05,680
Um

244
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,160
That's why

245
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,120
they have to try their best

246
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,490
to let people know they're more just  pretty face

247
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,970
But still,

248
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,000
I pity them

249
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,410
Because when they do something good,

250
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,230
it'll look normal

251
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,800
But if they do bad things,

252
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,130
they'll be criticized to death

253
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,190
Right?

254
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,870
Exactly

255
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,010
I agree with you

256
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,950
And

257
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,480
Didn't it hurt you?

258
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,000
No

259
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,330
I love myself

260
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,880
If I compare someone with me,

261
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,880
it's like I devalue myself

262
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,560
Cute

263
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,990
Huh?

264
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,610
Your way of thinking, I mean

265
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,750
So cute

266
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,320
Really?

267
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,000
And...

268
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,690
What did you do at school, Golf?

269
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,090
Were you a drum major?

270
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,160
How do you know?

271
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,790
I just guessed it because you're tall

272
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,790
It's suitable to be a drum major

273
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,030
Well

274
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,560
Forget it

275
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,560
I'm tired and the weather is nice

276
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,170
I'm sleepy. Let me sleep for a moment

277
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,000
Here

278
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,640
What?

279
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,680
A tall guy like me can lend you a shoulder to lean on

280
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,570
Lean on me

281
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,770
Okay

282
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,550
I'll sleep then

283
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,950
Surprise!

284
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,810
Sis?

285
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,570
How did you get here?

286
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,730
You think I can fly?

287
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,910
I drove here of course

288
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,000
Dad, mom and grandpa asked me to give you food

289
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,220
Let me have one

290
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,740
Thank you

291
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,090
Umm, how're they doing?

292
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,750
Everyone is fine

293
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,590
Especially Lucky

294
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,490
What's wrong?

295
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,310
Nothing

296
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,510
Don't lie

297
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,930
What the heck

298
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,790
It's just...

299
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,180
I'm worry

300
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,330
Let me put these stuffs away

301
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,490
Hey

302
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,220
You can rest here tonight

303
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,950
and go back tomorrow

304
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,700
I also thought that

305
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,410
I want you to show me around Bangkok

306
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,270
I can't do that

307
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,820
I either stay here or go to the university every day

308
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,210
And rarely go anywhere else

309
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,030
Hm

310
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,710
Do you still enjoy studying, Champ?

311
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,290
Well

312
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,950
Just so-so

313
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,370
I have to study hard

314
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,380
and it pressures me a bit

315
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,790
Let's eat

316
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,410
Give me a second

317
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,590
Let me smoke first

318
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,380
You smoke?

319
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,770
Um

320
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,450
It clears my mind when I think about work

321
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,290
Midterm score is 40%

322
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,860
So it's nearly impossible for you to get an A

323
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,190
And it'll affect your chance of getting a first class honor

324
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,890
Is there any solution?

325
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,820
Umm

326
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,620
You can try harder in the final exam or drop off and regrade

327
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,670
Choose wisely

328
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,970
Yes

329
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,010
But...

330
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,220
I don't know what should I tell my family

331
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,120
I understand

332
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:44,930
Anyway,

333
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,150
you still have time to decide

334
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,730
Knock knock

335
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,070
Is Chompu here?

336
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,690
Yes, I didn't leave

337
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,230
Can we open the camera?

338
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,140
Sure

339
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,870
But I'm quite shabby today

340
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,030
Don't be surprise

341
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,610
Whoaaa

342
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,300
You're overacting! Haha

343
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,630
Hi

344
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,200
Are you free this Saturday?

345
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,150
Yeah. Why?

346
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,110
Do you want to meet me?

347
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,000
Why?

348
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,160
Why not?

349
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,330
Why do you want to meet me?

350
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,830
Because

351
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,720
I want to know you more

352
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Can I?

353
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:35,750
Yes

354
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,240
If you're determined, then let's meet

355
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,860
Okay

356
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,160
See you

357
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,160
Now I have enough energy for reading books

358
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,500
Read properly and don't fall asleep

359
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,590
See you. Bye

360
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,330
[The story of love]

361
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,190
[that once happened]

362
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,130
[was filled with smiles and tears]

363
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,440
[It's like the stars]

364
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,530
[so beautiful]

365
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:27,240
[and was filled with fond of memories]

366
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,260
Yeah, dad. I'm worry about him

367
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,740
Champ

368
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,370
Huh?

369
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,830
Come talk to dad, mom and grandpa

370
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,010
Wait! Give me a second

371
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,370
I'm not dressed properly

372
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,690
Hey, it's cool. Come on

373
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,460
Everyone is waiting

374
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,340
Wait

375
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,340
How cute

376
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,520
Stop it!

377
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,000
Are you wearing it backwards?

378
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,640
Oh, it's the right side

379
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,360
Okay

380
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,030
You're all here

381
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,230
Hi, everyone

382
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,350
Hi

383
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,060
How are you? Is it hard studying?

384
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,070
Hm?

385
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,760
Tell me if you can't stand it

386
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,550
Don't worry

387
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,270
It's...

388
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,810
quite busy

389
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,960
But I'm fine

390
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
You know what, Champ?

391
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,380
When you're lying,

392
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,910
your eyes tell everything

393
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
If you have a lover,

394
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,680
don't lie to them

395
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,570
They can catch your lies right away

396
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,480
Grandpa!

397
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,140
Don't talk about a lover

398
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,320
I'm embarrassed

399
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,470
Champ

400
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,340
If you don't feel like it,

401
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,640
then don't force yourself too much

402
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,070
Just do what you want

403
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,340
Actually,

404
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,460
I...

405
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,520
I'm scared I'll make you guys disappointed

406
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,960
Or I'll make you hurt

407
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,150
If I...

408
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,000
If I choose the new path, I'll have to restart

409
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,700
Champ

410
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,870
No one is disappointed

411
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,100
It's only you

412
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,810
that put too much pressure on yourself

413
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,060
If you can't do something,

414
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,410
you can let it go

415
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,560
One day,

416
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,520
if you faced with something more sorrowful,

417
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,020
you have to keep going

418
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,760
Let your heart be free

419
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,100
Just choose for what you love

420
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,560
Hey

421
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,350
I have to sleep

422
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,080
It's time to sleep

423
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,600
Yeah/ Let's go

424
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,220
Yeah

425
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,270
Let him sleep, son

426
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,190
Good luck, boy!/ Good luck

427
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,360
Champ

428
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,290
Keep fighting

429
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,780
Thank you sister

430
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,260
Hi

431
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,450
Chompu

432
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,010
Hi, Nan

433
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,850
Ah

434
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,700
You look

435
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,360
even prettier in person

436
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,200
That's exaggerating

437
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,390
What about me?

438
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,740
How was me in person?

439
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,940
I think...

440
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,560
I might ask you instead!

441
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,830
I told you...

442
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,490
You're prettier than in the camera

443
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,090
You look even fresher

444
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,180
and You are...

445
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,300
look like in the camera

446
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,330
Hahaha/ Whoaa What?!

447
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,720
Any special?

448
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,210
I set up my hair for today

449
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,830
Did it take so long? Hahaha

450
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,260
Hahaha/ Hahaha

451
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,929
I'm glad to meet you

452
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,850
I'm glad to meet you too

453
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,949
Wanna go inside?/ Yeah

454
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,449
Let me help you

455
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:25,650
How to do that? Like this?

456
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,739
Okay...

457
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,780
I'm very busy, Name

458
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,199
Sorry

459
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:41,200
Being alone sometimes make you getting stronger

460
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:50,440
[Phone ringing]

461
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:53,820
Champ

462
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,930
You look fresher!

463
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,950
Don't sneak out anywhere!

464
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,150
Whoa

465
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,180
Grandpa

466
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,050
It's you!

467
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,020
Are you alright? You looked pale

468
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,870
umm...He has a fever, son

469
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,100
Hey, Champ

470
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,010
Do not sneak out to any clubs, you know?

471
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,690
I heard about Santiga pub. I feel insecure.

472
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,010
Dad, I don't have time to sneak out!

473
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,910
I studied so hard to death!

474
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,180
Whoa

475
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,370
Um I know, son

476
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,610
How was the new major? Is it better?

477
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,790
umm...

478
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,670
It's...

479
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,340
I studied hard but...

480
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,070
It's much better!

481
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,010
Well Well... studied happier...

482
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,210
How was your GPA?

483
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,010
Yeah... How was it?

484
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,880
I'll show you!

485
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,750
Here!!! How was it?

486
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,610
Woo!

487
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,010
You got straight A?!

488
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,420
Every subjects!/ Wow!

489
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,070
Brilliant!/ Wonderful!/ Wow!

490
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,270
You're very clever!

491
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,900
Next time

492
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,720
I'll send you fried pickled fish as a reward

493
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,850
then share with your friends, Champ

494
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,480
Um! I will. Grandpa

495
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,800
Thank you!

496
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,870
I'll come visit when I'm free!

497
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,720
Hehe. Take care of yourself

498
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,530
Um I will

499
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,670
Oh Champ! Give me your BB Pin via MSN

500
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,590
Okay, sister

501
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:23,240
Bye Bye/ Bye/ Good luck, son!

502
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,090
Woohoo Woohoo

503
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,160
Nan

504
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,780
Why here is so slow? No one comes.

505
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,660
You...reserved all here?

506
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,000
Haha/ Haha

507
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,170
Of course!

508
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,820
You gotta be special

509
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,290
if you're staying with a freshy star!

510
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,090
Yeahhh Mr. Freshy star

511
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,680
so

512
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,840
If you're graduated...

513
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,950
you'll be a lawyer?

514
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,730
um

515
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,040
I wanna try testing

516
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,110
I wanna start with Santiga Pub case

517
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,880
How can it happen? Think about that!

518
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,050
How could it be!

519
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,320
I wanna help them

520
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,570
