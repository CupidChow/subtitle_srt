1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,150
The beginning of relationship

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,380
Past is a past

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,000
Some are remarkable

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,670
Yet some are traumatized

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,450
Behind every stories that happened

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,070
Are our memories

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,840
Those stories

8
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,850
Seemed to be

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,360
Happen yesterday

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,460
Hey, it was fun skipping school today

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,390
Yeah

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,820
We played game

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,560
Did you have fun?

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,570
Hey, you guys

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,970
Meet at our spot at the same time, alright?

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,740
Last time I was hit by my mom

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,230
My dad said I might be drowning

18
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,590
Gun, we just used ballon as a fish

19
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,870
We didn't actually catching any fish

20
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,760
We won't be drowning

21
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,380
Alright, alright

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,660
I'll get home to bring some ballons

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,790
Let's go

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:29,270
[writing until it becomes stories]

25
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,500
[before we are apart from each other]

26
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:44,220
[keep memories all along]

27
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:50,840
[Just to know how precious it was]

28
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,900
[a familiar hug]

29
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,530
[I still remember it]

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,920
[the picture of you still looks the same]

31
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,510
[but I don't want to come back again]

32
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:26,870
[to that time when we were close]

33
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:34,060
[no matter how sweet the message is]

34
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,660
[couldn't be the same]

35
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,360
[as precious as when you smiled at me]

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,430
[saying that you love me through messages]

37
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,210
[couldn't make we fell in love again]

38
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:59,150
[because it means nothing to my heart]

39
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,150
Hello dad

40
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,530
See ya

41
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,640
Hey!

42
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,550
Don't you have any homework to do?

43
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,440
Why don't you not study hard like when you play?

44
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,110
Be careful

45
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,600
Hello mom

46
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,410
Hello

47
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,829
Mom, I'll be hanging out at my friend's house

48
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,510
Be careful when playing near water

49
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,130
Be careful for the cars!

50
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,680
Hello mom

51
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,890
I'm leaving now

52
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,190
Damn it

53
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,160
Didn't you just get back

54
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,460
Hello grandfather

55
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,440
Hello dad

56
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,520
Hello mom

57
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,420
Hello

58
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,480
Champ

59
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,300
Today's meal is all your favorite

60
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,940
Thank you

61
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,960
I'll be right back

62
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,110
Alright

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,330
So hurry huh?

64
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Look!

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,440
Look how he place his bag

66
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,020
What?

67
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,000
Forgot the ballons

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,400
Forgot the ballons?

69
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,380
I can't pull it

70
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,659
Then how?

71
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:59,320
Hey Champ! you go like this!

72
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,790
Don't get wet

73
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,790
I'll hit you

74
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,520
Alright

75
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,110
Champ, if you get wet, I'll hit you

76
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,159
[the story of love]

77
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,520
[full of smile and tear]

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,060
I'm the most far

79
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,580
No, it's me

80
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,710
It's me

81
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,810
It must be me

82
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,200
What are you doing?

83
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,990
Nothing

84
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,400
We haven't done anything

85
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,210
For sure

86
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,900
Grandfather sends you this

87
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,670
What is it?

88
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,130
Pickled fish!

89
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,680
Amazing

90
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,700
Your grandfather's cooking is the best

91
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,790
Indeed

92
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,640
Hey Em!

93
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,150
I heard your new neighbor moved in already

94
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,900
Same age as you

95
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,030
Have you guys talked?

96
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,909
How could I, his mom seems fierce

97
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:39,800
And he seems noiseless

98
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,440
Barely talk

99
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,510
I heard he moved from Bangkok last week

100
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,460
You know so much for someone who hasn't talked to him yet

101
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,200
Em, bro

102
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,430
Make him join our gang

103
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,030
Our gang needs Bangkok boy

104
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,080
What if he doesn't want to?

105
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,620
It's Em's job

106
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,550
Em, you must make him join

107
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,830
It's your duty

108
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Ok, I'll try

109
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,060
But I'm not confirm

110
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,530
Good!

111
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,760
Let's eat

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,930
So windy

113
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,990
I heard grandfather will buy you a gift

114
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,560
What is it?

115
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,820
Digital camera

116
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,460
Can I borrow it?

117
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,000
Please

118
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,250
No

119
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,500
Hey, it's ok

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
Let me handle this

121
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,250
Let's go

122
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,000
(Making sound)

123
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,740
Hurry!

124
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,000
Hey

125
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,590
Yes, I'm talking with you

126
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,380
You're new here, right?

127
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm Em. How about you?

128
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,760
If you don't tell me

129
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,110
Then I'll call you

130
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,679
B.. B...

131
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,360
Bird Thongchai (A famous Thai singer)

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,990
Not this one?

133
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,230
Then how about...

134
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:55,820
Louis!

135
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,710
What should I call you?

136
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,350
Oh, right!

137
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,990
James Ruangsak! Cut it off snip, snip, snip

138
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,790
If you don't tell me

139
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,790
I'll just call you No Name

140
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,300
My house is located near yours

141
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,990
Good. So we can be friends

142
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,180
I'll bring you to my friends

143
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,790
You must feel lonely being alone

144
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,240
Wow!

145
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,520
You like to read Maruko-chan like me!

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,850
Fine, fine

147
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,020
No more thinking

148
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,260
Trust me, it'll be fun

149
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,630
Pickled fish of Champ's Grandpa is so tasty

150
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,780
It's nice meeting you

151
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,380
I'll pick you up tomorrow

152
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:52,890
Bye

153
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,430
Who's that?

154
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,640
Your friend?

155
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,530
Come get it back, Mute

156
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,530
Catch me if you can

157
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,620
Why don't you speak, Mute?

158
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:39,030
Speak, you mute! Speak!!

159
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,120
Let's go before teacher come

160
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,100
What do you think about moving?

161
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,790
Try to be in a new place, new society and new friends

162
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,620
What about him refusing to speak, Doc?

163
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,270
I believe that...

164
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,120
His state of Selective Mutism

165
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,570
needs lots of time to recover, Mrs. Nittaya

166
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
If I would recommend

167
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,280
If he is still under this much pressure

168
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,290
and still stays in this bad society

169
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,260
It'll be hard to recover

170
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,730
If you can't change his social circle

171
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
I will advise moving out

172
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,590
And if you're still worry

173
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,100
that he won't be able to adapt

174
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,750
You can try letting him study in NFE first

175
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,390
And let's follow up every months

176
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,910
I don't recommend sending him to Auditory Oral School

177
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,400
Because he's normal, not disabled

178
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,780
You said it'll be good to move

179
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,510
So I'll move

180
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,410
How was that boy, Em?

181
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,610
Of course

182
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,200
I'll bring him to meet this evening

183
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,170
I'm sure he would get along well with us

184
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,720
Good

185
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,910
Let's see what's currently on trend in Bangkok

186
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:18,970
And then what?

187
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,810
Would you be able to afford?

188
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,680
Sure

189
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,990
I'm rich

190
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,690
I don't think so

191
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,690
You still borrowed my stuff yesterday, didn't you?

192
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,090
What are you talking about?

193
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:30,990
Don't wing it!

194
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,400
What?

195
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,010
I don't believe

196
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,640
You just borrowed my eraser yesterday

197
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,580
Nah. I bought it myself

198
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,340
Don't wing it! It's mine

199
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,020
You wing it! I bought it myself

200
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,560
Be quiet children

201
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,440
Please stand up

202
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,640
Good morning teacher

203
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,830
Good morning students

204
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,800
Please sit down

205
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,760
Well, do you know what's in my hand?

206
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,230
A letter

207
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,720
Good job

208
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,380
Today, in Thai language period...

209
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,520
I will have you all write a letter to St. Richart School

210
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,600
You will write to a friend that have a same number like you

211
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,690
For example, Kornsaran

212
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,590
Which number are you?

213
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,200
Number 8, ma'am

214
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
OK. Then Kornsaran will address the envelope here saying:

215
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
The letter Number 8

216
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,700
Do you understand?

217
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,450
Yes

218
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,850
OK. Ready when you are

219
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,290
Hello number 8

220
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,500
From number 8

221
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,530
grade 5

222
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,520
Thai language subject by teacher Somjit

223
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,640
This is the first letter I write to you

224
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Nice to know you. I will write to you every semester

225
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,640
Oh! Do you want to go to the library when I finish my work?

226
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,250
Do you want to talk about new friend?

227
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,450
How was it?

228
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,450
is it better than in Bangkok?

229
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,110
Will you go with them this evening?

230
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,360
Hmm... then let's go to the library next time

231
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,830
Hey boys! snack

232
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,570
Thank you

233
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,680
Are you writing the letter from teacher Somjit's subject?

234
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,370
How do you know?

235
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,600
Sure! I have passed this subject

236
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,790
At first, I paid attention to it a lot

237
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,000
thinking that I was writing to girl

238
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But the number was boy so I can't flirt girl

239
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,180
Do you know which school the letter will be sent to?

240
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,160
Sure. the opposite school, across the street

241
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,560
I think i'd be better to talk face to face

242
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,970
Writing is fun, however

243
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,680
I don't see it fun. Boring

244
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,500
waste my time reading a book

245
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,130
Where is Em?

246
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,930
He is on duty that you have assigned him

247
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,930
Let's see

248
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,930
Guys!

249
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,460
This is my gang, Nucknan

250
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,460
This is Gun, and this is Champ

251
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,180
Hi

252
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,970
How can I call you?

253
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,590
His name is No Name. He rarely speaks

254
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,940
That's alright. You can just listen

255
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,940
Well, let's eat

256
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,940
This restaurant is the most delicious in Chachoengsao province

257
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,430
It's my mom's

258
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,430
If you are my gang, you will have a lot of fun

259
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,589
Let's eat

261
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,920
[full of smile and tear]

262
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,920
[If it's love, it will be beautiful]

263
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,920

264
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,620

265
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,210
[you are a summer breeze that I think of]

266
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,650
[the warmth that I ask for]

267
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:24,640
[when the rain drops, I get wet]

268
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,390
[please let me run away from here]

269
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,060

270
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,920
[please let me disappear]

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,280

[You are sparklingly beautiful]

273
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:58,720
[I am still waiting in the gloomy star]

274
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,720
[taking care and never disappear]

275
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,360
[The story of love]

276
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,100
[that was hidden]

277
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,360
[the old photo]

278
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,360
[that was pictured by dream]

279
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,360
[We will have each other forever]

280
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,900
[Changing...]

281
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,000
What are you playing?

282
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,570
Do you wanna join, dad?

283
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,320
Why don't you play football with Em?

284
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
Nah

285
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
Then read a book

286
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,200
Mom, I don't want to

287
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm tired from school

288
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,220
I didn't say a word

289
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,590
but your dad...

290
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,200
No, you have to.

291
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,200
you promised to me that you will read a book for 1 hour after school

292
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,800
You are a man, you need to be patient

293
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
OK then

294
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Good job. You'll have a good future

295
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,280
Hello number 8

296
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,250
My name is Golf, grade 5/4

297
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,240
but from a different school

298
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Nice to know you too

299
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,160
Hope that we will be good friends this sem

300
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,050
I attached my photo here

301
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,670
in case you can greet me when we meet

302
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,460
Let's meet Gun

303
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,550
What are you doing?

304
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,870
What is that?

305
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,380
Nothing!

306
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,200
It's champ being suspected

307
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,700
Huh?

308
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,160
You are being suspected

309
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,160
What is it, Champ?

310
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,480
Or... today your grandfather cooks pickled fish again?

311
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Stop it! My face is nearly to be pickled fish already

312
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,030
Tada!

313
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,030
Woah!

314
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,030
It is digital camera!

315
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,030
Super cool!

316
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,030
I secretly stolen from CHa-Em, my sister

317
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,030
Let's take some shots!

318
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,030
who will take for us?

319
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,090
No way!

320
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,080
We are friends so we all need to be in the photo

321
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
True! How can you be a photographer?

322
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,820
Hey there? would you please take a photo for us?

323
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,590
Sure

324
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,810
Anyway, how to use it?

325
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:29,800
Open here and press this button

326
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,730
Of course

327
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,390
One two three

328
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,130
Is it OK?

329
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,060
Is it OK, uncle?

330
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,060
My gum's dry

331
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,460
Press here, the centre

332
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,610
OK. retake

333
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,360
One two three... smile!

334
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,070
Let's see

335
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,070
Perfect!

336
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,430
I look like Naruto!

337
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,430
Thank you, uncle!

338
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,320
Someone is writing

339
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,640
What?!

340
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,190
Do you still write a letter, Gun?

341
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:26,700
Right!

342
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,000
I am sick writing this

343
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,760
How can you still write for 4-5 years?

344
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:40,760
Don't you think that it feels good when we open it or keep it?

345
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,500
It feels good, isn't it?

346
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
You see? He agrees with me

347
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,320
Don't you want to know who are you writing to?

348
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,320
Right! If I were you, I would really want to know.

349
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,220
Look at this

350
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,220
Do you have photo?

351
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,830
How long have you kept it?

352
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,340
Here you go!

353
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,320
I told you I have seen him!

354
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:14,750
Stupid Gun! How has his face changed now?

355
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,320
I would feel frustrated!

356
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:24,850
I know him via letter. This is enough I think

357
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
I won't let you see now

358
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,000
Gun!

359
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,930
Are you going to see him?

360
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,930
Can you ask him for a new photo?

361
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,510
He is chubby

362
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,710
Or is he talking with himself?

363
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,710
What's wrong with him?

364
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,030
Are you crazy?

365
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,120
Right? I don't think he is.

366
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,610
Hello, number 8

367
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,730
who never reveals himself

368
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,310
who I haven't met before

369
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,350
Whatever...

370
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,900
I still be happy

371
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,150
that it's been 5 years now talking to you.

372
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,010
Oh!

373
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,940
Next week, there'll be sports day in my school.

374
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,480
I'll go for the drum major selection.

375
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,600
Please cheer me up!

376
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,450
I'm easy to see.

377
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,390
Wish I could finally see you.

378
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,360
"number 8"

379
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,380
Hey dude!

380
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,990
Time to practice the show now.

381
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,850
Okay, go.

382
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,140
Huh,

383
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,260
When do you guys think "SARS"

384
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,730
will be gone?

385
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,570
Its name look like "SOON"

386
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,220
but when will it be "SOON"?!

387
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,700
Don't worry man! I gotta tell you this...

388
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,130
You've been through a lot more than this.

389
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,350
so, everything will be fine! You've been through the worst!

390
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,170
SARS is a piece of cake.

391
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,630
What a nice motto.

392
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,490
Blasts.

393
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,830
But, I'm so scared.

394
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,960
Heyyy

395
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,160
Just think about

396
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,870
the homework from Mr.Patchara

397
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:09,920
Whoa

398
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,390
Shit

399
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,180
That's annoying.

400
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:12,780
Yeah

401
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,690
What the heck with Patchara

402
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,260
he was just demanded too much. Have you done?

403
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,620
We have homework?

404
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,840
Whattt!

405
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,270
That's my man!

406
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,510
Now, I won't feel alone.

407
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,140
At least I've done it!

408
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,280
Good for you, then.

409
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,560
Hey! Zip up!

410
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,830
Oh!

00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,740
Don't say it loud, Em!

412
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,490
Hahaha

413
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,420
Zip up! [whispering]

414
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,490
Em!

415
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,890
Can I copy your homework?

416
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:56,980
Alright.

417
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,090
How about you? wanna?

418
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,240
Hm? Yeah

419
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,180
Yeah Yeah

420
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,340
But you two! don't make it look like mine that much, Okay?

421
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,500
Ahh.

422
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,280
If Mr.Patchara knows, he must kill me!

423
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,840
Alright, Mr.Honored student!

424
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,070
Alrightttt

425
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,220
Huh, Are you reading textbook?

426
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,660
I don't want to make teacher gets mad.

427
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,060
He'll be fine!

428
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,500
Not for me!

429
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,210
He..He was... just... stared at me all time!

430
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,530
Haha. Really?

431
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,520
He didn't do with you?

432
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,800
I don't think so. I'm paying attention on studying.

433
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,650
Really? You don't even do any homework.

434
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,510
You're nerd.

435
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,340
I just...

436
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,320
What're you doing, Em?

437
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,860
Reading books, mom!

438
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,470

How could you read book in that way?!

00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,220
Ahaha

442
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,110
Huh

443
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,120
Hmmm

444
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,740
Hi Name! Wanna see Em?

Hmmm

448
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,170
I can feel it from your voice.

449
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,660
I know you love him more than me.

450
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,620
Of course! He's a good guy. Just be like him!

451
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,610
Right, my little boy?

452
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,210
Alrightttt

453
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,290
Good!

455
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,450

Don't change the topic. where will you go today?

458
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,390
Whenever you go, just take care of him. Got it?

459
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,240
Alrightttt

460
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,860
We're gonna go reading book with Champ.

461
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,990
I'll be back soon.

462
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,100
Let's go.

463
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,090
We're late. He might wait too long.

464
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,950
Whoa

465
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,500
You rush him while you're also late?

466
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,830
Whattt?! Just go. I don't wanna hear her muttering.

467
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:55,890
Oh!

468
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,170
Nan got something to show you.

469
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,680
Hurry up!

470
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
Finally

471
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,430
No matter how much I muttered, he's still stubborn.

472
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,250
What is the 'reading' if he doesn't have any book with him!

473
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,070
Huh!

474
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,980
He was just too much monkey around!

475
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,330
Dadd~ I gotta go.

476
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,070
Um

477
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,490
Hey!

478
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,490
What the hack are you doing with your look?

479
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,140
You're not following the trend

480
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,470
The band is in trending!

481
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,660
[Save you tears]

482
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,020
[Then, look at me]

483
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,100
I'm looking

484
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,910
[Who's Nucknan?]

485
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,140
My boy's crazy.

486
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,070
[Do you lose your mind?] Hahahaha

487
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,500
I wanna lose my mind now.

488
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,780
I gotta go, Dad. I'll see Champ.

489
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,170
Okay. Just go.

490
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,920
Beware

491
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,130
of the other gangs around bazaar.

492
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,030
Hey

493
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,340
Did you wait long?

494
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,620
Yeah, quite a while

495
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,590
Where's Nan?

496
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,710
There he is

497
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,270
Are you really Nan that I know?

498
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,900
Where's that shy kid from the past?

499
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,200
I was once shy, but now my smile can take your heart

500
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,370
If you don't hurry, I'll go first

501
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,520
Something special is waiting

502
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,530
Go go

503
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,560
Quickly

504
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,470
Grandpa, let me help

505
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,770
Wait

506
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,080
What make you be this kind today?

507
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,430
A sense of gratefulness

508
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,350
I see... but this is just watering plants though

509
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,870
I wonder what you'll do with something else

510
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,430
Don't tease me

511
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,270
Please go play with Lucky and let me handle it

512
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:29,080
Wait... Are you really worried about me?

513
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,290
Of course! I want to be a good grandson

514
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,100
Don't worry

515
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,620
Aren't you going to hang out with your friends?

516
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,760
You can go

517
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,450
I do this every day. I'm strong

518
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,020
It spills!

519
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,150
See?

520
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,440
Please sit down. Lucky, come here!

521
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,830
It's an accident./ I'll help.

522
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,830
You're my lovely grandson. I can do it

523
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,000
It's done!

524
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,450
Hello Grandpa

525
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,570
Do you see what I'm seeing?

526
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,460
You dressed up so fancy, Nucknan

527
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,640
Are you going to flirt a girl somewhere?

528
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,170
I'll flirt with city girls

529
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,170
But I wanna eat your food first

530
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,110
Is that so?

531
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,000
But if I were a girl and see your hairstyle

532
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,320
I would not choose you

533
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
Grandpa. Don't say that

534
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,760
Are the three of you doing well?

535
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,720
Yes

536
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,000
Go study and we'll prepare food after that

537
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,410
Roger that! I'll do my best tutoring them

538
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,350
So don't worry

539
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,390
Great

540
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,120
Right? Champ?

541
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,180
Oh yes! Right? Gun?

542
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,650
Y.. yes! Right?

543
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,190
Of course! Right? Name?

544
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,030
Wait a minute

545
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,600
I'm curious

546
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,690
Which devil told you to do this haircut?

547
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,140
Grandpa! You don't understand!

548
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,310
It looks really fierce

549
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,500
Bye Grandpa

550
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,250
Just kidding. Good luck

551
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,250
Pay attention, okay?

552
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,130
Then come eating food together.

553
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,450
Hey, Lucky. You grown up beautiful.

554
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,590
Hmm? Wanna get married? I can find for you.

555
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,540
Hehehehe

556
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,200
Champ's home is the best!

557
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,050
He got the video player!

558
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,920
Let's have the seat, everyone!

559
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,060
Here!

560
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,560
Cannibal Holocaust

561
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,120
Wow

562
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,370
Whoaaa

563
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,860
Oohhhh

564
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,110
That's badass.

565
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,770
Hm. Nucknan. Where did you get it from?

566
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,590
It's my dad's.

567
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:49,350
Hmm, but... If my parents know... I might get into trouble.

568
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:52,540
Hey, Champ! This is an extra class!

569
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,030
We're almost there/ We're almost there

570
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,420
Hehehehe

571
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,750
Are you sure doing this?

572
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,770
Sure!

573
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,930
Trust in me!

574
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,920
What do you think, Champ?

575
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,170
Yeah. Of course!

576
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,290
Right? Name?

577
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:13,130
[Men giggle sounds]

578
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,270
Hmmm. Look at this nerd guy.

579
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,770
He's so brave!

580
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:17,630
Yeahhh

581
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,520
Alright! Let's watch it!

582
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,469
Then...

583
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,159
how can we watch it?

584
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:23,670
Oh man

585
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,330
We gotta use this player!

586
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,230
Don't be silly.

587
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,810
Yeah

588
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,150
But we have to move forward

589
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:39,310
I think...

590
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,290
I found more silly guy than you, Gun

591
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,320
Ah...

592
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,219
I thought it's broke.

593
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,060
Alright, let's say this

594
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,620
We can watch by the new player tomorrow.

595
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,610
Meet here. Same time.

596
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,850
Okay?

597
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,770
Okayyyyy

598
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,810
What an annoying!

599
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,070
Let's go flirting.

600
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,310
With this hairstyle?

601
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,310
flirting?

602
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,390
[save you tears]

603
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,640
[then look at me]

604
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,460
What a nice rock&roll style.

605
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,180
Hehehe

606
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,280
Huh

607
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,740
This is what teenagers do.

608
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,410
Look at this hairstyle.

609
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,340
Hey. Believe me they like it.

610
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,130
Hehehe

611
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,500
You look like a hedgehog.

612
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,780
You look soooo cool, man.

613
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,920
Ah. Did you shower with perfume?

614
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,240
Hey, stop it! Don't bully me.

615
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,110
If I can flirt with someone, I'll show all-of-you!

616
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,880
Ah Where's he going?

617
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,910
Alright! Let's go eating!

618
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,740
Go go go!

619
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,010
Grandpa, let's eat!

620
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,210
Hurry up!

621
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,850
You all miss it!

622
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,020
I'll tell you

623
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,820
If you can watch it...Ohhh

624
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,000
It justttt

625
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,960
I don't wanna spoil it!

626
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,360
Um I wanna tell you guys, but

627
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,530
It's like documentary.

628
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,870
Many people have been arguing if it's real.

629
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,480
But...

630
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,990
Champ, you make us disappointed.

631
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,080
You miss it!

632
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,840
What an annoying!

633
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,870
I need them to watch!

634
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,170
Well. I gotta go.

635
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:16,960
Hm?

636
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,620
Where are you going?

637
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,310
I...will...Try to bump into Joy

638
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,620
Mrs.Jaew's daughter

639
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,520
Huh? Haha

640
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,990
Yeah. Make it look like it's the coincidence!

641
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,490
I gotta go. See you.

642
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,130
Good luck

643
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,130
Hey! Nan!

644
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,790
Huh

645
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:32,700
What's wrong with him?

646
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,700
Ah

647
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,540
What about you?

648
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:36,720
What happened?

649
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,830
Nothing

650
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,430
Don't say it.

651
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,020
I know.

652
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,830
How do you know?

653
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,430
How long we're friends, Gun?

654
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,980
It's obvious from your face.

655
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,620
Well

656
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,110
Golf wanna see me

657
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,340
He said he's also a drum major.

658
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,600
Golf.

659
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,890
Your number 8?

660
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,180
Um.

661
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,590
Go, then.

662
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:09,940
Why not?

663
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,090
Look at my face.

664
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,770
I got a lot of acne.

665
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,050
He might not wanna see me.

666
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,170
Are you silly?

667
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,440
Why don't you go? It's just meeting.

668
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,990
I don't wanna make him feel disappointed.

669
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,740
Let's do this...

670
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:33,830
I've got a plan

671
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,900
You said he's a drum major, right?

672
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,610
It means he's practicing the show.

673
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:40,380
Right?

674
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:41,740
I guess.

675
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:43,500
Alright.

676
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,170
Let's go spying.

677
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,540
Hey!

678
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,370
Yeah!

679
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,660
Trust me!

680
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,860
But...

681
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,530
Nooo. Look at my face!

682
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,030
Just sneak.

683
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,660
He might not see you.

684
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,120
Just cheer him up far away.

685
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,270
I don't wanna go.

686
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,100
Trust me. It works.

687
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,560
Right? Name?

688
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,280
Go go go!

689
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,620
Noooo I don't wanna go.

690
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,300
Let's go!

691
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,160
Come on!

692
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,930
1...2...3...4...5

693
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,920
6...7...8...

694
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,770
Go ahead?

695
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,510
[Do it again]

696
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,050
No

697
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,740
Being here is enough.

698
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,720
Are you sure?

699
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:48,820
Um

700
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,010
Gun

701
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,030
Take this

702
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,920
Give it to him

703
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,250
What? No! Take it back!

704
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,180
I just wanna help

705
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,030
But...

706
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,500
Thank you though

707
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,300
My pleasure

708
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,460
But now

709
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,760
Let's go

710
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,830
Too much mosquitoes here

711
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:35,970
Fine

712
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:36,800
Go

713
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,150
What make you smile like that, Em?

714
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,910
It's MSN. You don't know what it is, right?

715
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,710
What is it?

716
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,880
It's a Chat program

717
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,160
Hey! You're paying too much attention

718
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,610
Most Bangkok kids use it

719
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,970
Soon you'll know

720
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,800
Really?

721
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:31,530
Then...

722
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,420
Can you teach me?

723
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,810
Okay, but can it be tomorrow?

724
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,810
I'll talk with my friends today

725
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,360
Hey! I can't see it!

726
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,550
Looking that close, are you shortsighted?

727
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,060
Fine. I won't bother you anymore

728
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,250
I asked you so nicely

729
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,740
Don't forget to teach me tomorrow

730
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,140
I know!

731
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,670
So mean

732
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,450
Hello, number 8

733
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,840
We have to meet each other on Sport day

734
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,390
I'll wait for you

735
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,270
We've been writing to each other for many years

736
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,270
MSN is on trend right now

737
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,030
Would you like to give each other e-mail?

738
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,840
Because now I already have MSN account

739
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,220
So we can talk more often

740
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,620
I've attached my e-mail within this letter

741
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:47,870
Or else...

742
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,720
You can give me your phone number instead

743
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,840
I'd love to hear your voice

744
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,830
Is that OK, number 8?

745
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,430
Shit!

746
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,880
Damn it!

747
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:25,430
[the story of love]

748
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,710
[full of smile and tear]

749
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:36,110
[if it's love, it'll be beautiful]

750
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:40,830
[full of memorable stories]

751
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,810
[being alone]

752
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:51,410
[you're a summer breeze that I think of]

753
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:56,510
[the warmth that I ask for]

754
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,200
[when the rain drop, I get wet]

755
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,730
[please let me run away from this]

756
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:10,990
[from these memories I still kept]

757
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:16,510
[please let me disappear]

758
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:25,610
[because you're still here, the same spot]

759
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:29,490
[you're sparklingly beautiful]

760
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:35,280
[I'm still waiting in the gloomy star]

761
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:42,090
[taking care and never disappear]

762
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,680
[the story of love]

763
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,980
[that was hidden]

764
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,580
[the old photo]

765
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,730
[that was pictured by dream]

766
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:12,370
[we still have each other forever]
