1
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,119
Honey.

2
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:24,876
Do you

3
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,712
know me?

4
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,386
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,598
I thought we knew each other.

6
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,187
I felt bad about not recognizing
those I'd met before,

7
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,315
so I've gotten into the habit
of pretending to know.

8
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,536
I'm sorry. I must've caused
this misunderstanding.

9
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,669
Let's go inside.
I can't wait to see your work.

10
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,963
-Let's go.
-Okay.

11
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,849
Where is Woo-jae?

12
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,394
The Woo-jae we used to know…

13
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,063
He is long gone.

14
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,735
That Woo-jae is dead.

15
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,375
I couldn't believe it at first either.

16
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,710
Gu Hae-won… No.

17
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,423
Ms. Gu.

18
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,801
What are you scheming--

19
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,428
Country code 353.

20
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,514
That was all I had,
so I searched all over Ireland.

21
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,268
Meanwhile, Woo-jae was hospitalized.

22
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:09,314
Thankfully, someone had been paying
for his hospital bills.

23
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:13,943
Guess what I found
at the end of my digging?

24
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,573
Taerim Academy's Social Service Team.

25
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,707
Now, tell me.

26
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,462
What happened to him?

27
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,529
I'll be back. Look around first.

28
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,530
Okay.

29
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,090
Are you doing all right?

30
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:26,641
Showing my work to others doesn't seem
to get easy with time.

31
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,895
If it did, you wouldn't be able
to come up with such great work.

32
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,941
Right. Have you two said hello yet?
She's Gu Hae-won.

33
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,901
-She's Mr. Seo's--
-I know.

34
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,695
Back in the day,

35
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,198
I took drawing classes from them.

36
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,201
You're her teacher?

37
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,662
That's embarrassing to hear.

38
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:51,374
She's become this successful
while I've just wasted my time.

39
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,171
I heard his work is being received well.

40
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,506
Have you sold any?

41
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,300
Not yet.

42
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,845
We don't plan on lowering the prices
of his first batch of work,

43
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,722
so I'm afraid it'll take some time.

44
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,015
Good thinking.

45
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,642
To an artist,
money shouldn't come before their work.

46
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,352
I agree.

47
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,605
Excuse me.

48
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:22,071
You can say such a thing
because your work sells well.

49
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,868
Enjoy your time here

50
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,953
although you're not welcome.

51
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,044
You must not be interested in what I know.

52
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,159
So was this what you meant
when you said he was dead?

53
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,088
I didn't know you could call someone dead

54
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,548
when they are alive and well.

55
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,675
Sure.

56
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,097
To me, he'd already been dead once.

57
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:43,820
Were you startled?
I was just like you at first.

58
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,617
What are you guys doing down there?

59
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,163
Hey, we were just about to go up.

60
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,501
Woo-jae, let's go home. I'm tired.

61
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,191
Please?

62
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,278
She's content
with the quality of your work.

63
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,071
-Walk slowly.
-What do you think?

64
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,574
I agree. They're marvelous.

65
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,535
That's good news.

66
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,455
Oh, thank you.

67
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,665
You have nothing to worry about.

68
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,543
She'll take great care of your work.

69
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,551
What were you and Ms. Gu
talking about back there?

70
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,053
What?

71
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,182
About her husband.

72
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,810
I didn't know he was also an artist.

73
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,897
Did you?

74
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,609
I didn't. I also didn't know
she'd come uninvited.

75
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,778
You're right.

76
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,492
I know she came because of her husband,
but she's got some nerve.

77
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,536
She's really something.

78
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,371
You call that being brazen.

79
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,498
Why did you bother speaking with her?

80
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,209
I was just curious.

81
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,379
Her husband seemed a bit strange.

82
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,798
I heard he had an accident.

83
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,675
Have you heard the details?

84
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,429
If you were that curious,
why didn't you ask Ms. Gu?

85
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,271
Be careful.

86
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,231
We can take the next U-turn. Slow down.

87
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,748
What are you thinking about?

88
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,794
Ms. Jeong's painting.

89
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,770
Strangely,

90
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,815
I could hear sounds.

91
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,944
That's impossible.

92
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,406
I'm serious. The sounds came
from the painting.

93
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,489
SEDATIVES

94
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,669
Thanks.

95
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,505
What is it? What's wrong?

96
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,589
It's nothing.

97
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,676
I dropped these.

98
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,346
Ho-su just went to bed.

99
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,722
I'm sorry.

100
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,518
The curator called.

101
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,603
-Is she coming?
-Yes.

102
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:14,483
Despite being a new gallery,
I'm sure she'd like to be in charge of it.

103
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,444
She has excellent intuition.

104
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:20,030
She writes the catalogs too.
She'll be quite helpful.

105
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,991
I believe you.

106
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,660
By the way,

107
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,913
shouldn't you tell
the director in advance?

108
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,293
She knows this is your last exhibition,
but I doubt she knows

109
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,336
that we're taking the curator.

110
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,630
Curators move galleries all the time.

111
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,340
You should still tell her.

112
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,050
People tend to feel betrayed

113
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:44,513
when they find out
about something too late.

114
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,394
Okay. Thank you for helping.

115
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,065
I'm not helping you.
I just want to succeed together.

116
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,236
Go to bed first. I'll join you later.

117
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,321
Okay.

118
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,545

-Hello?
-Ms. Jeong.

123
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,956
After today's signing event,
we're going to have a Q-and-A session

124
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,041
with a few people from the audience.

125
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,671
-Hello.
-Thank you.

126
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,798

Your name?

130
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,642
Seo Woo-jae.

131
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,989
Let me take a photo for you.

132
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,327
Stand over there, please.

00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,295
Ready? One, two…

00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,714
HAE-WON

136
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,134
You're getting a call
from someone named Hae-won.

137
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,053
You can reject it.
I can call her back later.

138
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,848
One, two, three.

139
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,272
We all have a window in our hearts.

140
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,525
You can either stay indoors
or open it and step outside.

141
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,819
That's up to you.

142
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,200
Do you have any questions or want to…

143
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,080
Come forward, sir.

144
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,131
He's Mr. Seo Woo-jae.
He had his exhibition here last month.

145
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,762
I'm curious about something.

146
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:33,974
That painting.

147
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,479
May I know where that is?

148
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,821
It's just a grassland.
Why are you curious about where it is?

149
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,498
The breeze feels nice.

150
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,214
I was wondering…

151
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,551
if I knew that place.

152
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,397
Probably not. It's from my imagination.

153
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,110
We'll take the next question.

154
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,655
Yes, the person in the back. Ask away.

JEONG HUI-JU'S SOLO INVITATIONAL EXHIBIT

156
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,016
Where is she?

157
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,103
Where is Gu Hae-won?

158
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,564
I came here alone.

159
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,818
I'm sorry.

160
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,155
I must've made you feel uncomfortable.

161
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,745
Are you okay?

162
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,291
Excuse me. Can we take a photo with you?

163
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,002
Sure.

164
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,175
Good work today, Ms. Jeong.

165
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,343
How about we go eat something?

166
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,014
I'm sorry, but let me step out
for a minute.

167
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,280
Does Hui-ju know about this?

168
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,534
Is this why you called me over?

169
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,540
How do you always pick
the shallowest women?

170
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,293
-Mom.
-She's that problem teacher, isn't she?

171
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,046
I told you to get rid of her,
not hit on her.

172
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:16,220
CHIEF DIRECTOR PARK YEONG-SEON

173
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,431
Your father bought those tickets

174
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,101
when he was barely able to walk.

175
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,894
TICKET
SEOUL TO ULSAN

176
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,938
Even in his 70s,

177
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,441
he couldn't forget her
and wanted to go see her.

178
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,362
Apparently, he kneeled and begged
his caregiver

179
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,738
to take him to her.

180
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,407
How disgusting.

181
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,702
Don't pretend you didn't know that.

182
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,331
I lived 40 years
with that empty shell of a man.

183
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,503
I won't condone cheating
even if it's my son.

184
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,881
That will never happen,
so don't worry about me.

185
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,425
Be wary of that useless person
who showed you this.

186
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,803
How's the gallery going?

187
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,098
It's going well.

188
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,311
Keep me posted on every detail
whether good or bad.

189
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,438
Hui-ju is an artist. She'll do--

190
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,315
Yet she knows nothing about business.

191
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,360
Painting and doing business
are clearly different.

192
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,487
Get your money's worth!

193
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,531
-Don't say that--
-Am I wrong?

194
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,618
She visited the UK to see Li-sa
and stayed for three years.

195
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,580
You stayed here
and supported her all those years!

196
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,748
Did she even see Li-sa?

197
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,042
She went to Ireland to study…

198
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,879
Hold on.

199
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,174
Ho-su was born there, wasn't he?

200
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,681
Is this why you partnered up
with that medical center in Ireland?

201
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,994
What brings you here?

202
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,290
Someone showed my mom
something she didn't need to see.

203
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,625
What was it?

204
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,252
It's not a big deal.

205
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:17,174
I told her to be careful of that person
who tried to make a big deal of it.

206
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,303
Can you give us some privacy?
I have family matters to discuss.

207
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,035
What's this about?

208
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,499
I heard you're in charge of Seo Woo-jae.

209
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,292
Not anymore.

210
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,836
Dr. Choi from Psychiatry is in charge now.

211
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,506
Psychiatry? He's not injured?

212
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,635
It seems you already know
about his condition.

213
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,682
He wants to get his memories back.

214
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,642
Is it true?

215
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,144
What do you mean?

216
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,480
He claims he has lost his memories,

217
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,941
but he could be lying for all you know.

218
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,110
Sure. That's possible.

219
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,153
But what for?

220
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,448
Deceiving others is a painstaking hassle.

221
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,078
If he seems

222
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,163
to be improving…

223
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,916
How interesting.

224
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,546
Both you and your wife want
to know what condition he is in.

225
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,095
You're making me curious about him too.

226
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,184
INCOMING CALL FROM HYEON-SEONG

227
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,187
Where are you?

228
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,482
I wanted to get some fresh air,
so I'm on my way to see Dong-mi.

229
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,859
I'm near the gallery.

230
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,528
I was going to ask
if you wanted to have some tea with me.

231
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,988
I'm sorry.

232
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:06,241
I'm almost there,
so I don't think I can turn back.

233
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,284
SEO WOO-JAE (35-MALE)

234
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,452
Is that so?

235
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,498
That's okay. Maybe next time.

236
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,417
Bye.

237
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,597
Hello.

238
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,108
I'm…

239
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,985
Right.

240
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,822
You're Ms. Jeong Hui-ju's…

241
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,283
That's right. I'm her husband.

242
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,701
It's nice seeing you again.

243
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,245
Are you ill?

244
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,122
No, it's work-related.

245
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,628
I see.

246
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,257
By any chance,
did we ever meet in the past?

247
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,718
No.

248
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,554
Why do you ask?

249
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,517
It's nothing. Goodbye, then.

250
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,319
He wants to get his memories back.

251
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:54,474
I don't think you come here to fish,
but here you are once again.

252
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,187
It's a great place to sort myself out,

253
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,731
and I like you too.

254
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,778
You don't make me feel uncomfortable
by pitying me for coming here alone.

255
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,115
Watch out. You might fall.

256
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,452
I'd like to swim in a place like this.

257
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,331
You know, in foreign movies,

258
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,751
they jump into the lake bare naked.

259
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:26,173
They swim with only their heads
above water.

260
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,134
I want to try that.

261
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,886
Not here. It's too dangerous.

262
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,931
The water is deep,
and you don't know what's in there.

263
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,601
One time late at night…

264
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,855
Why is she here out of the blue?

265
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,984
She has a lot on her mind.

266
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,076
I told you this is the perfect spot.

267
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,749
Hui-ju.

268
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,145
What's your deal?
Do you follow me around all day?

269
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,858
Are you a good swimmer?

270
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,694
What?

271
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,447
I once fell into the water.

272
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,450
I thought I was going to drown.

273
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,286
But do you know what scared me more?

274
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,624
The thought of dying
in this pitiful state.

275
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,043
It was horrifying.

276
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,922
So I frantically swam out.
I was embarrassed.

277
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,507
Cut that nonsense.

278
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,510
-Why are you here?
-Your book.

279
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,346
The Story of the Island and the Lake.

280
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,723
On the author's note,

281
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,352
you said you came here when you were
reminded of the tough days in Ireland.

282
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,272
So I wanted to check this place out.

283
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,818
I thought

284
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,822
you had only been in the UK,
visiting Li-sa.

285
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,783
I don't care what you know.

286
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,619
Woo-jae was also in Ireland.

287
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,039
So I thought

288
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,209
maybe you and he--

289
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,296
You're wrong. Like I told you before,
I never saw him there.

290
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:33,049
I was too busy studying
and childrearing to meet anyone.

291
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,636
Right.

292
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,348
And thanks to that, you finally succeeded.

293
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,767
Just admit that you're unhappy
about my success.

294
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,102
That's not true.

295
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:47,439
I truly meant it
when I said that I was happy for you.

296
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,483
Had you been a no-name,

297
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:54,446
all I went through would've
been for nothing. I truly meant it.

298
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,823
Then continue being happy for me

299
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,616
and stop following me around.

300
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,164
Had I gone abroad to study as well…

301
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,835
and had Woo-jae not disappeared,

302
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,212
would things have been different?

303
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,259
You said you'd become happy.

304
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,470
I told you not to get married,

305
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,514
but you told me
that you were going to become happy.

306
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,061
If you're miserable now,
you only have yourself to blame.

307
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,230
You were foolish enough
to solely rely on him

308
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,607
for your happiness.

309
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,526
No one stole anything from you.

310
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,861
I pity you.

311
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:42,077
You used to shine so blindly
that being poor didn't matter at all.

312
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,373
But you're still obsessing over him.

313
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,125
I truly pity you.

314
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,623
Darn it.

315
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,507
You never had any respect for me.

316
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,302
You haven't changed one bit.

317
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,738
You must be freezing. Here.

318
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,497
It suits you.

319
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:19,215
I can't believe you saw another man.

320
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,386
Sure. It's understandable.

321
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,681
You were abroad and lonely.
You could've had a fling.

322
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,185
It wasn't a fling.

323
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,937
And I shouldn't have cheated

324
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,648
out of loneliness
while my husband was supporting me.

325
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,735
What is this? You're not giving me
a chance to criticize you?

326
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,069
I regret it.

327
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,738
It won't happen again.

328
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,407
Right. At least you didn't get caught.

329
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,243
She's one fearless girl.

330
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,995
She came here intentionally?

331
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,622
Because of a guy she lost?

332
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,876
-She doesn't know about that.
-She doesn't?

333
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,796
No. I don't think she does.

334
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,923
There's no evidence.

335
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,634
Only he and I knew about this,
and I won't tell anyone.

336
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,553
And I doubt he'll tell either.

337
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,598
Who knows? Intuition is a thing.

338
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,933
Or why would she come here?

339
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,944
Do you not regret getting divorced?

340
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,488
Why would I?

341
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,534
Yes, I failed in marriage,

342
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,538
but if I hadn't divorced him,
my whole life would've failed.

343
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,498
I'm proud of myself.

344
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:38,086
I won't ever get a divorce.

345
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,089
Don't be so sure.
You don't know what the future holds.

346
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,340
I am sure.

347
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,218
I've already experienced it.

348
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:49,722
I now know very well how wrong I was.

349
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,666
Why did you film us?

350
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,960
It's not appropriate
to ask a student to do that.

351
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,628
I regret it.

352
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,298
I was just trying to dodge a bullet.

353
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,050
I didn't think
it'd be used for something petty.

354
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,511
Change his hospital.

355
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,973
I hope I'll never

356
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,893
have to see him again.

357
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,603
But weren't you eager to find him?

358
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,187
Now I know where he is.

359
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,982
Be careful of Ju-yeong's father.

360
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,693
Don't expect to be able to control him.

361
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,194
He won't get his way.

362
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,907
Then he will blame you, feeling desperate.

363
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,367
-Is this a piece of advice?
-No, a warning.

364
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,624
I envy your wife.

365
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,212
She has a husband
who'd do anything for her

366
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:08,176
even if it means
kicking people out of their homes.

367
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,847
Is marriage really that great?

368
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,434
Does it make you comrades
if you have kids together,

369
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,395
even without love?

370
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,980
I do love her.

371
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,567
Our kids are one of the reasons.

372
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,446
But I do

373
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,990
love Hui-ju.

374
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,453
That's why I'm afraid of getting hurt.

375
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,208
Why would you be afraid?

376
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,921
Doesn't being in love mean trust

377
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,049
is a given?

378
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,181
What about you?
Do you trust your husband completely?

379
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,896
There are some you can trust
even if you don't love them.

380
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,942
Then there are those you love
who make you insecure and anxious.

381
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,114
You won't be coming back to our school.

382
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,242
My wife doesn't like it.

383
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,998
I hope this helps.

384
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,643
RECOMMENDATION LETTER

385
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,755
How about we demolish everything
and start with a clean slate?

386
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,215
Let's only demolish that area

387
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,760
and renovate these buildings.

388
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:17,388
That costs more
than constructing new buildings.

389
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,557
It's a messy neighborhood.

390
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,311
You see, the current leading art galleries

391
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:28,858
started in empty warehouses
and red-light districts.

392
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,359
Even the National Museum

393
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,029
started from an abandoned tobacco factory.

394
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,533
This will be an interesting place.

395
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:44,248
Taerim Gallery…
You sure know exactly what you want.

396
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,502
I should if I want to realize it.

397
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:53,382
Taerim Academy may own
a big share of the cultural foundation,

398
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,218
but Mother is still quite influential.

399
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,678
She'll meddle every chance she gets.

400
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,099
That's okay. She has every right to.

401
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,975
You seem very confident.

402
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,394
Do you think you can handle her?

403
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,146
I do.

404
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,692
Because I know very well
how I've gotten this far.

405
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,741
Right.

406
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,702
About Ms. Gu Hae-won…

407
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,871
Sorry?

408
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:28,334
Her husband, Seo Woo-jae, is so strange.

409
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,798
My wife is his doctor. Did you know that?

410
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,844
Yes.

411
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,724
I looked into it
just in case she'd run into Li-sa.

412
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,104
I see.

413
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,441
BILLIARD HALL

414
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,948
Who was that?

415
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,667
Hello, ma'am.

416
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,836
Ma'am, this is the kindergarten.

417
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,588
Ho-su keeps vomiting.

418
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,596
Look at how well he's eating.

419
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,974
He doesn't vomit
if you feed him what he wants.

420
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,481
You and Hyeon-seong can spend
the upcoming holiday alone.

421
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,858
Leave Ho-su with me.

422
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,778
Ho-su, where should we go?

423
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,488
Should we take a plane this time?

424
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,448
Yes.

425
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,533
It will be too tiring for you.

426
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,829
And he's still too young.
He won't remember going on--

427
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,247
Of course, he will.

428
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,209
Childhood experiences
will impact him in one way or another.

429
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,503
You never traveled as a kid,
so you wouldn't know.

430
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,134
Ho-su.

431
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,679
Should we visit Ireland
where you were born?

432
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,847
But Mother…

433
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,187
Well… There will be a stopover.

434
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,233
I'm afraid the trip will be
too exhausting for Ho-su.

435
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,151
Why are you so cold-hearted?

436
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:21,113
While your husband donated
and partnered up with their hospital

437
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,615
because Ho-su was born there.

438
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,493
What do you mean?

439
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:30,164
I can't believe there's something
Hyeon-seong didn't tell you about.

440
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,667
It seems it's been quite a while.

441
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,296
Slago? Glaig? What was the name?

442
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,298
Sligo General Hospital?

443
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,592
That's where he was born.

444
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,135
Why did you ask when you knew?

445
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,346
There's nothing I like about you.

446
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,140
Hey, just leave
if you're going to ridicule me.

447
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,724
Don't tell me you were following me.

448
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,977
That's rich coming from someone

449
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:38,357
who picked this hospital of all hospitals
and my brother to be your doctor.

450
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:44,405
Hui-ju, why are you so hostile towards me?

451
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,241
-That's because Li-sa was--
-Stop using her as your excuse.

452
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,371
I admit what I did to her is wrong,
so I apologized and will repent

453
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,831
for what I did.

454
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,001
Do you think

455
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,338
this is the attitude of someone
who's sorry?

456
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,759
Attitude?

457
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,471
Okay. I'll try to fix it.

458
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,206
Wait.

459
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:39,210
Mr. Seo, remember
this is a remedial exercise.

460
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,213
You should start slowly
without feeling pain.

461
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,465
Overworking yourself
won't do you any good.

462
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,093
But I think I'm almost there.

463
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:50,388
Rushing yourself won't speed up
the recovery. So take your time--

464
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,140
Too much time has already been wasted.

465
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,896
I mean for Hae-won, not me.

466
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,025
I'm sure she'll wait for you,
so you don't need to rush it.

467
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,944
I already feel so bad.

468
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,322
I sometimes wonder if my guilt

469
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,909
is forcing me
to pretend to be an amnesiac.

470
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,538
But it's not your fault
that you fell victim to an accident.

471
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,875
To be frank, I'm not sure.

472
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,878
After you blacked out after drinking,
don't you feel like

473
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,005
you must've done something horrible?

474
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,091
It's like that, isn't it?

475
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,677
But most of the time, it's not a big deal.

476
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,805
I hope that's the case,

477
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,266
but I can't trust myself.

478
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,061
I feel like I did something awful to her.

479
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:42,690
Come on. Had that been the case,
she wouldn't be by your side now.

480
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,985
To remember anything about someone else,

481
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:49,655
you need to have
a lot of affection and concern for them.

482
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,732
Ho-su must've been exhausted.
He fell asleep right away.

483
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,984
He vomited at home as well.

484
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,862
I'll take him to the hospital
if it doesn't get better.

485
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,327
My mom must've fed him something.

486
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,832
She's planning to go to Ireland
with Ho-su this holiday.

487
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:46,462
She must want to visit
your first overseas business spot.

488
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,215
I'll talk to her.

489
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:55,012
Why didn't you tell me about it?
After all, it's Ireland.

490
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,098
You're the one who avoided
talking about Ireland back then.

491
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,726
You said it was unbearable.

492
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:05,022
You were too busy studying to visit us.
You were very strict with yourself.

493
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:10,194
Remember when we visited you
during Li-sa's break?

494
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,947
You were still so busy,

495
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,032
and your mind was elsewhere.

496
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,496
Amid all that,
you got pregnant with Ho-su.

497
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,918
You gave birth
and raised him there all by yourself.

498
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,713
I truly admire you for doing that.
And I feel sorry too.

499
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,925
Of all times to get pregnant…

500
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,138
But then again,
the thought of not having him makes

501
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,557
my heart skip a beat.

502
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,435
That's enough.

503
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:50,693
See? It's not that I kept it from you.

504
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,612
I'm going up first.

505
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,944
This is an accident-related injury.

506
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,573
Did you injure your shoulder here
before the accident?

507
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,668
What are you doing?

508
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,672
Stainless steel is too heavy,
so I'm using bamboo instead.

509
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,343
What are these?

510
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,387
They were my father's.
I found them while cleaning.

511
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,435
Why have you never told me about him?

512
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:10,272
There's not much to tell you.
He wasn't a good father.

513
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,865
I still want to hear it.

514
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,410
Tell me all the bad memories
you had with him.

515
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,705
I'd rather hear from you
than someone else.

516
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,294
Hae-won.

517
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,074
Hello?

518
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:04,910
Yes.

519
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,205
I see.

520
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,126
Thank you.

521
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:24,263
Someone bought your work.

522
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,527
We're not open…

523
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,323
You're working on the weekend too.

524
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,662
You want to go
to Taerim High School of Arts, right?

525
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,833
But do you think
you're good enough to make it?

526
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,501
Sorry?

527
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:59,047
Why did you give me your phone?

528
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,012
Let me rephrase that.

529
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,639
Did Ms. Gu tell you to?

530
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:13,020
Do you do whatever she tells you?

531
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,650
Why don't you take out your phone?
You love filming things.

532
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,904
Record what I'm about to say.

533
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,283
You can also show it to her.

534
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:37,586
ACCOUNT OWNER: SEO WOO-JAE
TOTAL DEPOSIT: 12 MILLION WON

535
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,177
Thank you for selling my work for me
even though I'm just a rookie.

536
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,138
But you don't need to try so hard.

537
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,432
I didn't have to try hard.

538
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,601
The buyer had a sharp eye.

539
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:57,147
I'd like to sell my work
only to those who will keep it.

540
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,234
Okay. You have my word.

541
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,075
Woo-jae, I need to speak with her alone.

542
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,327
Okay. I'll wait downstairs.

543
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,497
Goodbye.

544
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,297
Actually, I wanted to talk to you as well.

545
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,049
Sorry?

546
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,885
I'd like to hire you.

547
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,930
But I have no experience in this field.

548
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:33,475
-If it's because of him--
-In a way, yes.

549
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,728
But I also appreciate
your attitude towards artwork.

550
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,397
So I'm offering you this job.

551
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,400
Our curator I relied on

552
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:44,403
will be leaving with Ms. Jeong,
so I'm a bit short-handed.

553
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,032
Right. What did you want to talk about?

554
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,744
Well, it's about the buyer.

555
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,205
They paid a hefty sum.

556
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,124
They're considering it an investment.

557
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:00,836
They offered a higher price
than we had expected.

558
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,462
I'm grateful,

559
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,257
but why won't you tell us their name?

560
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:12,222
They specifically asked me
to keep it a secret.

561
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:17,227
Please don't ask. Trust is crucial
in this line of work, so I can't tell you.

562
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,672
Is your exhibition already over?

563
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:49,593
Yes, it was a special exhibition,
so it was short.

564
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,512
Then why are you here?

565
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,975
What about you?
To see your mom's exhibition?

566
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,729
What about you?

567
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,565
Are you here to see my mom?

568
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:10,030
No. Her artwork.

569
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,871
All the subjects…

570
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,043
are a doted daughter.

571
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,921
Of course. After all, she's a mom.

572
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,174
That's not a given.

573
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,761
Not all parents love their children.

574
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,210
Hey. Do you know what this is?

575
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,383
-Heath?
-Heath.

576
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,510
These wildflowers

577
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:16,471
bloom once a year in the wilderness.

578
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:22,561
It's a heath flower.
They bloom in the wilderness.

579
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,172
Should I do it instead?

580
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,176
I may be a terrible cook,
but I'm still better than you.

581
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,178
You can't cook.

582
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,805
Of course, I can.

583
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,517
When you were busy with school,
I did all the cooking.

584
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,740
No.

585
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,368
You never did that.

586
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:37,969
Hello, Mother.

587
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,639
Did you buy something again?

588
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:41,848
Sorry?

589
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,142
Or are you telling me to buy it?

590
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,853
"Seo Woo-jae"?

591
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,359
I called you
because they sent it to my office!

592
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:56,154
What is this useless thing?
How much was this?

593
00:51:56,238 --> 00:52:00,158
They must've gotten the wrong address.
I'll call them and get back to you.

594
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,746
No, Mother. You can leave it there.

595
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,540
I'll send someone over.

596
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:08,625
Okay.

597
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,639
This is Jeong Hui-ju.

598
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,100
The art piece from Hwain Gallery…

599
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:30,021
Sorry? They changed the address?

600
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,147
One minute.

601
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:33,358
GU HAE-WON

602
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,734
Did you get it?

603
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:38,864
Thank you so much for purchasing it.

604
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,317
You really came.

605
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,444
Sit down.

606
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,447
She'll have the same.

607
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,910
It's okay. I'm not a regular here anyway.

608
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,663
-I'll prepare some tea.
-Thank you.

609
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,587
I was going to pay for it,
as a thank-you drink.

610
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,423
What are you…

611
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,344
I have a knack for finding things.

612
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:47,557
For example, Woo-jae or his first buyer.

613
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,978
Why did you send it to Taerim Hospital?
What were you trying to do?

614
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,481
Goodness. Did I send it
to the wrong address?

615
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,943
I must've gotten your storage address

616
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:01,821
and the address of your mother-in-law,
a famous collector, mixed up.

617
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,617
But it's no problem, right? You're family.

618
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,788
Why did you purchase it…

619
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,417
if you were this anxious
about others finding out about it?

620
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,006
Do I need your permission
to be supportive of him?

621
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,760
Supportive of him?

622
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,513
Are you justifying yourself?

623
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,850
It's just so convenient

624
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,729
that money is a means of being supportive.

625
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,024
Why are you so twisted?

626
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,652
You're right.

627
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,823
Why have I turned out this way?

628
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:47,200
I'm so sick and tired of your sob story.

629
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,787
Don't you ever approach my family again.

630
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,331
And don't meet my husband alone.
I can't stand it.

631
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:00,755
Right. I'd feel that way too.

632
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,137
But why did you?

633
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,056
What?

634
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,519
Because he was the only thing you lacked?

635
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,482
But he meant everything to me.

636
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:31,244
Are you drunk?
What nonsense are you spewing?

637
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,874
I wish this was all just nonsense.

638
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,756
Why didn't you just come clean?

639
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,093
You two were
the most precious people to me,

640
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,804
so I would've ultimately let you have him.

641
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:59,105
What is this bullshit
you're talking about?

642
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,318
How long will you stay delusional?

643
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,780
Are you trying to get revenge?

644
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,870
Not at all.

645
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,373
Doing so won't turn back time.

646
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,377
I'm giving you a warning.

647
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,714
I won't sit still this time.

648
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,719
You're completely insane.

649
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:31,805
Snap out of it.

650
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,059
I have a question.

651
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,686
Did he ever cook for you?

652
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,653
What was his best dish?

653
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,281
You crazy bitch.

654
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,328
I wonder if Ho-su remembers

655
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,831
what his favorite dish was.

656
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,640
Gosh.

657
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:27,485
It's true that people become predictable
when they're cornered.

658
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,571
How boring.

659
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:42,227
Sir, there's some crazy woman
slamming her bag outside…

660
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,357
And here's another one.

661
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,026
You happily packed up and left for a guy.

662
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,195
What are you doing here in broad daylight?

663
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:02,288
What happened? Did you drink it
or splash it onto your face?

664
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,582
What is it? Tell me.

665
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,584
Is it that bastard again?

666
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:11,089
God, you're such an idiot.
Why did you give him another chance?

667
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,632
I told you people never change.

668
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:17,762
Fine. If you don't want to talk,
then don't. Whatever.

669
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,139
I want what she's having.

670
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,975
People can change.

671
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:31,526
Depending on the barrel you use, the same
wine can end up with different tastes.

672
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,239
People can change when they're put
in a different environment.

673
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,950
Please. You can't compare people to wine.

674
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,535
Don't be ridiculous.

675
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,663
Right? Wine is better.

676
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,375
At least the taste of wine
doesn't betray you.

677
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,961
That's true.

678
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,383
-Where are you going?
-Home.

679
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:59,554
Don't argue over me.
You'll grow on each other.

680
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,558
We weren't arguing.

681
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,893
What do you take me for?

682
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,228
He just kept--

683
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:10,273
See? You keep talking.

684
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,989
What the hell are you talking about? Jeez.

685
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,241
Damn it.

686
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,288
Did you go out?

687
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,874
She takes after me in the worst aspects.

688
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,709
She's a terrible judge of character.

689
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,503
Most men are lousy.

690
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,131
You two aren't to blame.

691
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,227
What's all that?

692
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,563
I didn't know what you liked to cook.

693
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,453
Ho-su, come sit down.

694
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,830
Have one before you go.

695
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,791
I don't want to.

696
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,960
Open up.

697
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:58,005
Good. If you eat this,
you'll become strong

698
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,341
and even hit home runs.

699
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,884
How is it? Isn't it good?

700
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:08,266
I wonder if Ho-su remembers
what his favorite dish was.

701
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:11,894
Are you okay?

702
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,105
Yes.

703
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,274
When are you coming to practice?

704
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:20,236
Why aren't you replying? Hey.

705
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,447
Li-sa, are you really not coming?

706
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,240
You could get some fresh air and--

707
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:25,533
I have practice today.

708
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:28,703
We haven't had a family outing
in a while. How about postponing--

709
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:31,164
Mom, the competition is next week.

710
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,832
Don't you know that?

711
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,297
We'll be back soon.

712
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,800
All right. Let's go.

713
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,052
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

714
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,515
-Nice!
-Nice!

715
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,350
You can do it!

716
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,645
That's it! Great job!

717
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,773
FAMILY DAY EXHIBITION MATCH WITH KIDS
TAERIM FOUNDATION

718
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,276
It's just that you're too young.

719
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,947
Everyone's like you.
No one's good from the start.

720
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:11,496
Dad will be here soon,
so you can play catch with him.

721
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,691
What are you doing here?

722
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,075
That was a nice curveball.
You're strong too.

723
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:57,834
Hi. What's your name?

724
01:03:58,793 --> 01:03:59,877
Ho-su.

725
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,046
As in "lake"?

726
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,174
What a great name you have.

727
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:07,844
I love lakes.

728
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,266
-Our Father, who art in heaven.
-Our Father, who art in heaven.

729
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:17,520
-Give us this day our daily bread
-Give us this day our daily bread

730
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:20,356
-and forgive us our trespasses
-and forgive us our trespasses

731
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,275
-as we forgive those
-as we forgive those

732
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,194
-who trespass against us.
-who trespass against us.

733
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:28,823
-And lead us not into temptation
-And lead us not into temptation

734
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:31,284
-but deliver us from evil.
-but deliver us from evil.

735
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:45,131
Lough Gill is the name
of my favorite lake.

736
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:52,179
One day, a silver bell
from a monastery in Sligo fell into it.

737
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:57,393
Even to this day,
those with pure hearts and souls

738
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:01,355
can hear the bell chiming.

739
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,214
Do you hear it?

740
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:20,977
What are you playing at?

741
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:26,190
What is that you're trying to achieve?

742
01:06:54,635 --> 01:07:00,057
EPISODE 6
THAT'S NOT HOW LOVE ENDS

743
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:36,844
They say drawing someone is
because you love them.

744
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:39,096
He fell in love with someone else
for a while.

745
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:44,101
Why do you feel the need to do this?

746
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:48,355
Can't I cheat a little to get what I want?

747
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:51,942
If we're going to die anyway,
I wanted to die in a place like that.

748
01:07:54,653 --> 01:08:00,201
Standing way up there,
who would you think of?

749
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,244
I just wanted to check.

750
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:04,997
Was there anything between us?

751
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:12,338
