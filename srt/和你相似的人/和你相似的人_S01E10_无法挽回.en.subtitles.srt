RESTRICTED ACCESS

2
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,586
What took you so long?

3
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,782
I shouldn't have told him to wait.

4
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:04,332
Had he come to the hospital right away,
they would've tried surgery at least.

5
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,878
I shouldn't have said I'd go to him.

6
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,674
Hae-won.

7
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,556
And you, if you didn't think
you could make it,

8
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,600
you should've told me so.

9
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,608
He waited for three hours at the terminal.

10
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,363
We shouldn't have made him wait that long.

11
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,076
I know.

12
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,413
It's my fault.

13
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,499
No. I…

14
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,751
So tell me.

15
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,463
Where were you then?

16
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,718
Where were you?

17
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,347
Where in the world were you?

18
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,646
Were you with Hui-ju?

19
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,827
You must be nuts!

20
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,537
How could you do this to me?

21
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,830
It's driving me nuts!

22
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't know
what the hell is wrong with me!

23
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,216
I keep seeing someone else in her.

24
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,268
You crazy bastard.

25
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,923
EPISODE 10
POINT OF NO RETURN

26
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,808
FUNERAL HOME
REST IN PEACE

27
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,529
Didn't he come to the wedding recently?

28
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,823
He looked so healthy.

29
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,950
That's life.

30
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,953
We all look well and healthy right now,

31
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,789
but any one of us can die at any moment.
You never know.

32
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,959
Please excuse me. I'll meet you inside.

33
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,554
Ms. Lee called
and asked me to come with her.

34
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,307
And I thought it was only right to.

35
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,351
I know you loved
your grandfather very much.

36
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,478
Stay strong.

37
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,105
I am

38
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,942
doing my best to stay strong right now.

39
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,864
Right, of course. I'm sorry.

40
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,366
For what?

41
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,746
There are many things
you should be sorry about.

42
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,337
I'm not here to fight.

43
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,840
What then? Are you here to comfort me?

44
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,093
Do you feel bad for me now?

45
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:50,308
I shouldn't have come and upset you.

46
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,267
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,145
That's a shame.

48
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,149
Because you no longer
have the right to be sorry.

49
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,071
When I had asked you to apologize,

50
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,950
I was still willing to forgive you.

51
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,580
-But now--
-It's not the time to talk about that.

52
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,832
I should go.

53
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:16,793
No.

54
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,045
This is the right time.

55
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,884
Because you just apologized to me
when you don't have the right to.

56
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,264
You had numerous chances
to ask for my forgiveness.

57
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,975
And you chose to do it now
when I'm at my lowest.

58
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:37,105
You sound like you're doing me a favor.
I won't accept it.

59
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,442
I'm sure you'd like to think

60
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,654
that your trivial apology
has settled all the issues between us.

61
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,407
But I won't allow that.

62
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,374
I despise you.

63
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,586
And you'll see me time after time.

64
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,051
Wherever you are,
I will follow you tirelessly.

65
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,347
It'll be a living hell,

66
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,600
so I hope you live a long life

67
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,645
and die all alone.

68
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,176
HWAIN GALLERY
REST IN PEACE

69
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,797
Leave.

70
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,635
Don't give me that tormented look--

71
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,018
If you're going to stay here like that,

72
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,395
just leave.

73
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,441
Hae-won.

74
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,111
Just leave.

75
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,323
What is it?

76
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,200
Did you have a nightmare?

77
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,202
Yes.

78
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,996
Come here.

79
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,378
Was it a scary nightmare?

80
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,131
Goodness. My baby.

81
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,959
Grandpa.

82
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,880
If I have any good left in me,

83
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,258
it's all

84
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,470
from you.

85
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,881
How are you these days? Are you busy?

86
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,258
Take care of yourself.

87
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,218
And come see me when you have time.

88
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,097
Jeong-yeon, did you have lunch yet?

89
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,058
I thought of you while eating,
so I thought I'd ask.

90
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,159
Eat.

91
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,539
I don't deserve to.

92
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,753
Eat.

93
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,507
He forgot
about all the bad things you did.

94
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,425
He only remembered the good things.

95
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,180
As if I ever did anything good.

96
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,224
You gave birth to me.

97
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,019
He said that alone was enough.

98
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,729
He was proud of you.

99
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,565
He said that many times.

100
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,694
-Really?
-Really.

101
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,198
So eat.

102
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,494
He hates it when we skip meals.

103
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:53,123
He grew these bean sprouts
to make you some hangover soup.

104
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,266
Why did you put in so much garlic?
It's so bitter.

105
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,142
So you'd turn into a human.

106
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,477
You little…

107
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,149
What's he doing? Your husband.

108
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,320
He didn't say a word
and looked miserable during the funeral.

109
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,156
I want to go easy on him
because he's handsome, but then…

110
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,659
I don't like him.

111
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,386
I didn't hate you. I liked you.

112
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,144
Do you remember?

113
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,937
No, I still don't.

114
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,649
So I need you to tell me.

115
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,653
Did I have feelings for you?

116
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,617
Briefly.

117
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,578
Very briefly.

118
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:18,834
When you and Hae-won were having
a hard time while preparing to go abroad,

119
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,128
we had a fling.

120
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,006
I didn't mention it
since it was nothing serious.

121
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,841
Are you saying I left Hae-won

122
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,135
due to a trivial fling?

123
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,432
Only you know the answer to that.

124
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,476
Then what about you?

125
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,894
Did you also

126
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,022
have feelings for me?

127
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,785
That was in the past.

128
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,454
Even if I hated you in the past,

129
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,081
I don't hate you now.

130
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,832
Actually, I'm concerned about you.

131
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,239
Sir, we had the latest model ready
like you asked.

132
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,828
-I like it. I'll take it.
-Yes, sir.

133
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,955
This will suit her.

134
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,040
This way, please.

135
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,259
He'll be released soon?

136
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,430
Ms. Gu's lawyer recently requested
a review on the legality of his arrest.

137
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,017
She also mentioned
that his young daughter was living alone.

138
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,271
She must have one competent lawyer.

139
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,983
And the agreement form?

140
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:10,112
It'll take some time
since she recently lost her father,

141
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,697
but there won't be any problem.

142
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,865
She lost her father?

143
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,327
She must have a lot on her mind.

144
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,246
Wait…

145
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,186
-Hey.
-Why aren't you home yet?

146
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,813
We're supposed to have
a family dinner every Sunday.

147
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,774
I'm on my way. It won't take long.

148
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,488
Salmon sounds great. Okay.

149
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,273
Nowadays, the parents decide
on a theme that their kids like.

150
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,234
Then the event manager
prepares everything for them.

151
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,194
How convenient.

152
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:20,200
You should still pick the party favors
yourself, so Ho-su doesn't feel bad.

153
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,703
The party favors?

154
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,914
Is that needed for a kid's birthday party?

155
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,752
At Ji-ho's birthday party,

156
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,463
Ji-ho's mom read a storybook to the kids.

157
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,924
It was nice.
You should try something similar.

158
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,636
As if she read anything
when she was little.

159
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,556
That's why I'm grateful to you.

160
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,058
My kids are able

161
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:49,271
to experience things I wasn't able to
when I was little. Thank you.

162
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,064
Stop distracting us and sit down.

163
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,158
Right. About Mr. Seo Woo-jae…

164
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,579
Why do you look so surprised?

165
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,540
You asked about him.
He's doing much better.

166
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,543
He may regain his memories.

167
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,798
I see. That's a relief.

168
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,312
Hello.

169
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,777
You should at least say hi.

170
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,948
After all, I'm Ms. Lee's assistant
for the upcoming project.

171
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,249
I'll tell her myself

172
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,793
that I'm uncomfortable
working with a married couple.

173
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,004
No one else at the gallery
has time to assist her.

174
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,464
That's why she hired me.

175
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,883
Hiring an assistant isn't difficult.

176
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,680
Right. How is Mr. An doing?

177
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,268
I'd like to thank him
for settling things with Mr. Lee.

178
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,020
Since when did you care
how my husband was doing?

179
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,732
Don't worry.

180
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,652
I won't be seducing your husband.

181
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,034
I want you to also feel the pain
of having the most precious person

182
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,953
stolen from you.

183
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,331
But I don't think that's him.

184
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,338
He's not precious to you.
You just need him.

185
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,800
Can you please stop?

186
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,552
You're the one who should stop.

187
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,431
What if Woo-jae regains his memories
while you keep feigning ignorance?

188
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,020
Why are you making things so complicated?

189
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,647
Why don't you just tell everyone about it?

190
00:21:55,731 --> 00:22:00,068
Tell them that your husband abandoned you.
Though I doubt anyone would believe you.

191
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,695
I don't want to do that.

192
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,905
It'll only become
something to gossip about.

193
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,826
Exactly. If you were so hurt
by people gossiping about that,

194
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,078
you should've stayed away from me.

195
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,123
Why the hell did you show up
with Woo-jae in front of me?

196
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,668
Do you want to turn back time?

197
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,171
What difference will that make?

198
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,591
Just tell me what you want.

199
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,801
Why waste your life like this?

200
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,345
What will you get in return?

201
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:33,435
At the very least,
you'll feel the pain I felt.

202
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,648
So you want me to be miserable as well?

203
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,860
You're really…

204
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,239
so pathetic.

205
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,885
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

206
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,263
Hey, Woo-jae. How have you been?

207
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,515
What brings you here?

208
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,478
Well… Have you been in touch
with Hae-won lately?

209
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,980
I doubt any of us are in touch with her.

210
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,317
I thought you'd know what she was up to.

211
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,486
Thanks.

212
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,364
SCULPTURE DEPARTMENT

213
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:25,964
Woo-jae.

214
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,492
What are you doing here?

215
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,380
How did you find me?

216
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,051
I told you. I'm good at finding you.

217
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,138
Answer my question.

218
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,143
I met Yeong-jae, your schoolmate.

219
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,563
I was wondering
if he knew anything about us.

220
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,233
But he said you left school
and cut ties with him,

221
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,817
and asked me about you.

222
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,361
You wasted your time.

223
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:33,490
How would they know something
that even you and I don't know?

224
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,200
Then tell me what you know.

225
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,203
You always tell me
about the good memories we had.

226
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,746
But we're human.

227
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,499
If things were always rosy,
why did we turn out this way?

228
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,878
How did we turn out?

229
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,758
We haven't seen each other in five days.

230
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,803
Shouldn't you ask how I'm doing first?

231
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,396
Let's go.

232
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,190
Ms. Lee wants to know
how much progress you've made.

233
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,045
Have you been staying here all along?

234
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,132
It didn't feel right
to go home without you.

235
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,301
So I slept here.

236
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,761
I guess you felt guilty

237
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,514
thinking about someone else
in the house we share together.

238
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,604
No excuses?

239
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,902
Do you know why we had the wedding?

240
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,076
So that I could hold you down.

241
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,622
You're officially a married man now.

242
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,085
I can't stop you
from having feelings for someone else,

243
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,504
but I will never let you go.

244
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,051
No matter how much
you pine for each other,

245
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,511
it's nothing but a filthy affair
that no one recognizes.

246
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,348
That's all.

247
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:25,727
I know.

248
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,440
You do?

249
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,787
What are you doing?

250
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,040
What do you think?
I'm getting rid of it for you.

251
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,125
Hae-won.

252
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,462
Don't yearn for something that's ruined.

253
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,049
If your life is ruined,
you just have to endure it.

254
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,301
But you can always make these things.

255
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,260
So?

256
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,390
I'm the one who ruined your life,

257
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,685
yet you want to keep me by your side?

258
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,481
What do you want me to do?

259
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,483
Can't you just tell me?

260
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,280
I'm suffocating.

261
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,993
Are you?

262
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,539
It's only been a few months.

263
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,211
It was years for me.

264
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,216
You left without saying anything.

265
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,052
I resented you,
blamed myself, and felt afraid…

266
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,013
for years.

267
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,226
What more do you want to know?

268
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,228
You vanished into thin air.

269
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,939
That's all that I know.

270
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,526
You smiled and waved goodbye as if
we'd meet the next day, then you vanished.

271
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,447
I had to piece together the rest.

272
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,075
So have the decency
to put the last piece in.

273
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,668
You're the one who made me like this.

274
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,423
Do you know what I lost then?

275
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,551
No. Do you know what we lost?

276
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:25,221
We lost something precious
that we'll never get back!

277
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,516
Do you know that?

278
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,112
SLIGO, IRELAND

279
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,444
I heard you're back in Ireland.

280
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,029
I'll wait for you.

281
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,590
-Did you change the passcode?
-My God.

282
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,675
Yes.

283
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,405
Why aren't you staying at your house?

284
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,785
I took out the security deposit
and invested it somewhere.

285
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,456
Again? What are you wasting it
on this time?

286
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,625
Why are you jinxing it?

287
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,504
The lease on this house
won't be up anytime soon,

288
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,631
and you moved out to live with him.

289
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,091
Why keep it vacant?

290
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,179
Why are you here anyway?
Did you have a fight?

291
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,271
My God.

292
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,608
You have the skin of a mom
who's been busy childrearing.

293
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:09,028
Scratch that. Even moms
take great care of their skin these days.

294
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,489
You're unbelievable.

295
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,573
It's all genetics.

296
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,410
Don't be ridiculous. Look at me.

297
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,286
It's just poor care.

298
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,206
Maybe I take after my dad
whom I've never met before.

299
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,418
This is some top-notch skincare.

300
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,253
Do you know how much this thing costs?

301
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,007
You still look so young.

302
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,510
Of course. I put a lot
of time and effort into my skin.

303
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,100
How did you think
of having me at such a young age?

304
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,727
I wasn't thinking, obviously.

305
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,395
Because I was clueless back then.

306
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,192
I can still feel the pain of giving birth.

307
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,194
I also suffered from inflammation.

308
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,197
Why bother explaining?

309
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,367
It's not like you'd understand.

310
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,246
I refuse to repeat it ever again.

311
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,124
I couldn't graduate high school
thanks to you.

312
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:09,547
I admire you
for giving up so much all for me.

313
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,467
And I'm sorry.

314
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,053
You were still lovely.

315
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,722
Even amidst all the chaos,
you were so lovable.

316
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,351
Come to think of it,

317
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,855
there's another good thing
I did for your grandpa.

318
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,109
The first one was giving birth to you.

319
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,527
And the second one

320
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,030
is outliving him.

321
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,076
When your grandma and uncle died,

322
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:43,081
I'd never heard your grandpa
bawl and cry like that before.

323
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:49,295
That's when I promised myself
that I'd outlive him at all costs.

324
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,884
So you just do those two things too.

325
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,137
Have a baby who's better off than you
and outlive me.

326
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,041
Sorry, Mom.

327
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,462
I don't think I can do either of them.

328
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,358
Due to your bad credit,

329
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,445
your compensation
will be seized immediately.

330
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,990
As soon as you're released,
open a bank account under Ju-yeong's name.

331
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,288
It's about "the type."

332
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,583
The type of person you are.

333
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:55,087
And this is also called
your moral self-image.

334
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,090
We'll talk about that next time.
That'll be all.

335
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,301
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

336
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,386
LEE JU-YEONG

337
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,064
What did you do last night?

338
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:20,238
Hey, Ju-yeong. Aren't you going to eat?

339
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,412
Today's school lunch was disgusting.
I'm so lucky.

340
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,293
I'm sorry for not being in touch lately.

341
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,670
It's okay.

342
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,589
I heard your grandfather passed away.

343
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,636
Did you get the text?

344
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,180
Your dad was discharged today.
He'll be home.

345
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,186
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

346
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,484
Is everything fine with you and Li-sa?

347
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:04,323
She goes to the dance studio
in the afternoon, so we barely meet.

348
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,575
I heard she was at my wedding.

349
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,369
Did you bring her?

350
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,415
Ms. Gu, she's a bit strange.

351
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:17,670
She took my phone and looked
at the video I took of you that day.

352
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,798
Then she cried and threw a fit.

353
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,649
Thanks for coming to my wedding, Li-sa.

354
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,860
Damn it, Ju-yeong.

355
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,990
MIMI

356
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:53,039
You should've said hi.
Why did you just leave?

357
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,253
Why did you marry him
when he had feelings for another woman?

358
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,382
It's easy to fall in love,

359
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,010
but breaking up is complicated.

360
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,601
Did you see who that woman was?

361
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,151
I did.

362
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,655
Through a painting.

363
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:30,951
A painting?

364
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,622
He drew a painting of her.

365
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,958
I could feel his emotions
through his paintings.

366
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,142
TAERIM HOSPITAL

367
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,894
Raise your arm slowly.

368
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,230
Let me know if you feel pain.

369
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,314
Okay.

370
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,361
You should cut down on work.

371
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,822
You injured the same area.

372
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,907
It's best to let it rest.

373
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,537
Since you got an injection,
I'll just do heat treatment today.

374
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,579
Okay.

375
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:20,084
By the way, how is Hae-won doing?

376
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:26,465
You should bring her with you
next time even if she says no.

377
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,884
I heard she took up

378
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,762
a lot of outsourcing work
at her previous design job.

379
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,182
I believe that's when
her rheumatism manifested.

380
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:39,395
And judging by her medication,
she must also have fibromyalgia.

381
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,939
That's the worst, you see.

382
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,567
You feel pain all over your body.

383
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:49,822
I bet she has to rely
on painkillers to sleep at night.

384
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,120
I didn't know
since I always fell asleep first.

385
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,040
If you take benzodiazepine

386
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,711
with steroids, it's worse for your health.

387
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,671
I give that to Woo-jae.

388
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,259
I'm nervous that
Woo-jae might run away while I'm asleep.

389
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,389
I'm sorry.

390
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,184
It's a force of habit.

391
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,977
I didn't mean to be nosy.

392
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,605
It's okay. I'm rather relieved.

393
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,525
At least someone knows about her pain.

394
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,913
Take care.

395
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,212
Seon-u.

396
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,428
-Hello.
-Hey.

397
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,473
It's starting this week,
so make sure you come.

398
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,063
Give it your all.

399
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,023
Strive to be a better person.

400
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:09,109
VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT
TO HELP SUPPORT EX-CONVICTS

401
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,454
For how much longer?

402
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,419
There's no end to that.

403
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,215
Have you ever seen
a bad guy striving to be badder?

404
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,259
They don't need to try.

405
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,053
It's a part of their nature.

406
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:41,850
So you should do your utmost
to become a better person

407
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,228
until your very last breath.

408
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,611
Let's go eat.

409
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,641
Darn it.

410
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,569
Li-sa.

411
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,030
What are you doing here?

412
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:39,992
What is this?

413
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,495
This?

414
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,291
After what you said last time,
I looked for the photo and found it.

415
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,170
See? We were there with your dad.

416
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,300
-Are you going to paint it?
-What?

417
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,720
Are you going to paint that too?

418
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,475
I do want to
since you were adorable back then.

419
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,517
Do it.

420
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,648
What's with you?
You hate it when I draw you.

421
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,274
I just

422
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,903
want to see the emotions you feel
when you paint it.

423
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,179
You see, vodka…

424
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,600
is a fascinating drink

425
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,312
Unlike other drinks that try to stand out,

426
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,565
this has no color, taste, or smell.

427
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,109
Less is more with this one.

428
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,197
It doesn't matter what this is made from

429
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,200
because all tastes and scents
are gone in the end.

430
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:07,413
But it mixes well with any drink

431
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,708
and tastes different
depending on what you add.

432
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:15,712
Try it.

433
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,446
Your grandfather gave me some last time.

434
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,292
Doesn't it taste smoother?

435
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,342
My wife…

436
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,890
spent all my retirement pay, savings,
and money from our home equity loan

437
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,060
on a patch of land without telling me.

438
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,650
She was scammed.

439
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:24,031
After keeping it from me
for a while, she fell ill.

440
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,783
It was cancer.

441
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,370
There was nothing we could do.

442
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,164
However,

443
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:37,294
I was too busy chasing
after those frauds to mourn for her.

444
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,342
Did you eventually catch them?

445
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,598
It was also her fault
for purchasing the land,

446
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,810
so they got away with it
without getting punished.

447
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,483
You must've been upset.

448
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,485
I was.

449
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,948
I wasted so much time chasing after them

450
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,658
and reaped nothing in return.

451
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,326
I felt guilty and was in pain.

452
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,539
I erased everything,
even the good memories I had.

453
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,002
Don't be like me.

454
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,758
Mourn as much as you need to
while you can.

455
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,178
And cherish the good memories.

456
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:29,930
Okay?

457
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,207
What?

458
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,127
How did you find me?

459
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,676
FAVORITES
HAE-WON

460
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:10,971
That?

461
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,806
Do you not trust me?

462
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,394
No.

463
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,608
It must've tormented you.

464
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,987
What is this?

465
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,198
Like you said, I ruined your life.

466
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,451
So you're holding me down.

467
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,622
I'm thinking of what I should do

468
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:38,749
to make up for it.

469
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:45,881
Let's go home.

470
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,022
RICE & BAR

471
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,409
-Here's your key.
-Thank you.

472
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,291
Can you feed him lunch
as soon as you get there?

473
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,501
-Okay.
-Let's go.

474
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,183
Why are you up already?
Get some more sleep.

475
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,603
What's all that?

476
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,940
I'm behind on my work
so I'll stay at the studio for a while.

477
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,736
I've frozen some curry.

478
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,863
Microwave it with some rice.

479
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,157
Why don't you just beg me for a divorce?

480
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,788
Don't you think it's cowardly
to pretend to care for me

481
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,124
as you leave home?

482
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:06,461
Because you already
abandoned Hae-won once before.

483
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:10,799
If you turn away from her again,
Hae-won will die.

484
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,891
I'm not leaving for good.
It's only temporary.

485
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,894
I want to do well.

486
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,233
And I didn't delete the app.

487
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,319
Feel free to check my location
whenever you want.

488
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,656
I'll get going.

489
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,342
Here. Have one bite. Please?

490
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,470
Don't you like tonkatsu?

491
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,474
I'll go order something else. Hold on.

492
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,412
Hi. We've met before, right?

493
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,125
What's wrong? Is it not tasty?

494
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:36,718
It's good.

495
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:42,349
Tonkatsu is made with pork.

496
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,600
Oink-oink, pig.

497
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,938
Pigs become as big as me
even when they're just a year old.

498
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,190
Then they get killed for meat like this.

499
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,779
Don't you feel bad?

500
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,201
Then we should at least savor it.

501
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:02,661
Here. Eat.

502
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,630
Are you also here for my birthday party?

503
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,673
Oh, my.

504
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,760
Your birthday party? When's your birthday?

505
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,345
This Friday.

506
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,139
What a great day.

507
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,268
I don't think I was invited yet.

508
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,644
Will you invite me?

509
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,231
Thanks.

510
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,067
When's your birthday?

511
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,905
I'm not sure.
I haven't celebrated it in ages.

512
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,993
What were birthdays for…

513
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,578
Don't you know?

514
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,539
It's the day you blow out candles.

515
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:51,126
Right. I see.

516
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,963
How many candles will you blow out?

517
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:59,801
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

518
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,887
Seven candles.

519
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,223
You'll be turning seven?

520
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,988
Do you seriously need
party favors for his birthday party?

521
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,324
That's how it is apparently.

522
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:26,328
Back when we were little,
all our neighbors were poor.

523
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:29,247
Birthday parties were a privilege.

524
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,749
But Ho-su is different.

525
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,751
That's true.

526
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,967
Hui-ju, do you remember?

527
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,469
What?

528
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,054
I think I was around Ho-su's age.

529
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:48,475
Do you remember
that 500-won toy in front of our school?

530
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:52,979
I came home crying about how
the store owner accused me of stealing it.

531
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,733
You bathed me, dressed me
in my best clothes, and went back.

532
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,945
"Seon-u doesn't steal things."

533
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:01,529
Did I do that?

534
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,701
And you told me to pick anything
I wanted to buy in that store.

535
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,120
I did, having no idea
that was your lunch money.

536
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:10,956
That's what you did.

537
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,084
By the way, why didn't you ask me?

538
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,294
Whether I stole it or not.

539
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,964
What for?
I knew you didn't have any money.

540
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,675
Despite knowing everything,

541
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,594
you defended me
and sacrificed your lunch money?

542
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:31,226
When there's something you want badly
enough, people will even steal for it.

543
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,063
That day,

544
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,900
I promised myself to always listen to you
and treat you well.

545
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,861
Then you can babysit Ho-su this afternoon.

546
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,657
His babysitter needs to go
grocery shopping for his birthday party.

547
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,450
Gosh, you took that favor real quick.

548
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,538
Sure. What about you?

549
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,748
I have to work.

550
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,461
I'm too stuck.

551
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,922
I'll just let Ho-su pick the one he likes.

552
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,425
-Mom!
-Ho-su, come here.

553
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,095
Ho-su, which one do you like?

554
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,391
This one?

555
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:23,403
TOP TEN BILLIARD HALL

556
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,321
WE OPPOSE THE SCHOOL OF ARTS!

557
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,498
Gosh.

558
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,215
Ju-yeong, bring me water.

559
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,259
Ju-yeong!

560
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,849
Who the hell is that?

561
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,643
-Hey. Who the hell are you?
-Hey!

562
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:57,896
-Damn it.
-Hey, let me go.

563
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,147
Stop it!

564
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,399
Don't touch that!

565
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,468
Some of the kids are allergic to seafood.

566
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,678
Yes, vegan.

567
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,722
Ji-ho's mom is a vegan.

568
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,183
Please take note of that.

569
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,392
Thank you.

570
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,481
I think we're pretty much ready.

571
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,734
Is there anything else I should do?

572
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,737
You're a quick study. Not bad.

573
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,324
You've formed your own taste.

574
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,245
It's all thanks to you.

575
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,288
Why do you think I'm tolerant of you?

576
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,835
You don't use your kids to your advantage.

577
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,170
You know your place.

578
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,799
You're not as vulgar as your parents.

579
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:11,010
Rather, you're eager to learn.

580
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,263
That's why.

581
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,348
It's not because you're good at anything.

582
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:17,934
Remember this.

583
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:21,146
You better not do anything
I don't like in the future as well.

584
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,193
Where's Ho-su?

585
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,071
His dad will leave work early

586
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,407
and pick him up from kindergarten.

587
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,909
The party will be held at my place.

588
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,619
I thought we'd have it here--

589
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,497
How will you fit
so many people in this tiny house?

590
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,583
You don't know anything.

591
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,589
SECURITY

592
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,180
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HO-SU

593
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,732
Hi. Thank you for coming.

594
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:06,858
I hope he likes it.

595
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,903
You didn't have to bring anything.

596
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,696
You must've been busy preparing.

597
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,364
-I ordered them.
-Did you?

598
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:16,159
-From where?
-I'll tell you later.

599
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,149
SECURITY

600
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,817
It's Dracula!

601
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:50,985
Ho-su, wait.

602
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,446
Hello, Mr. An.

603
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,282
Yes, we just arrived.

604
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,743
Yes, his birthday party.

605
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,663
I think someone's here to pick him up.

606
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:02,997
One minute.

607
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:04,415
Ho-su!

608
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,798
Let's go inside.

609
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,592
One by one. Slowly. Don't rush.

610
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,461
Where's Ho-su?

611
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,589
I heard he was here.

612
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:56,718
What are you talking about?
You were supposed to pick him up.

613
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,470
I was late, so I called.
She said someone picked him up.

614
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:05,351
Hui-ju.

615
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:07,687
Ho-su.

616
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,440
Ho-su?

617
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,276
Ho-su.

618
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:16,654
Ho-su.

619
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,073
Ho-su.

620
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,170
Ho-su…

621
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:40,845
Ho-su.

622
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:51,105
Ho-su!

623
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:54,275
Ho-su!

624
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,071
Ho-su!

625
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:02,742
Ho-su!

626
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:08,122
Ho-su!

627
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,713
Hi, Hui-ju. About Ho-su's birthday party,

628
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:20,176
I was invited but I can't make it.
So I'd like to send him a gift.

629
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:23,846
Where is Ho-su?

630
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,394
Hae-won, where is he?

631
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,105
Hui-ju.

632
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,608
Fine. I was wrong.

633
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,277
Let's say I committed a grave sin.

634
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,947
But that still doesn't give you

635
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:45,284
the right to touch my kid!

636
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,498
It shouldn't be, "Let's say".

637
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,000
Get that straight.

638
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:59,549
Okay, I was wrong.
I'm to blame for everything.

639
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:02,593
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hae-won.

640
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,348
I'm truly sorry, so please bring back--

641
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,183
Don't be sorry, Hui-ju.

642
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:13,896
I told you already.

643
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:17,859
You don't have the right
to apologize anymore.

644
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,320
And even more so
if you're forcing yourself.

645
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,656
That's offensive.

646
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,162
Hae-won.

647
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,123
-Yes?
-Where are you?

648
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:36,669
Answer me.

649
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:40,089
Come here right now. Give me my son back!

650
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,509
If you don't, I'm going to kill you.

651
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,845
I'll rip you to shreds!

652
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,557
Gu Hae-won! Where are you?

653
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,517
Give me my son back!

654
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,978
I'll kill you!

655
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:56,522
-Ho-su!
-What's the matter, Hui-ju?

656
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:00,318
Why didn't you pick him up?

657
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,321
You should've picked him up

658
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:05,573
as you were supposed to!

659
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:50,493
I'm so sorry to Ho-su!
Do something! Find Ho-su!

660
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,620
I'm going to find Ho-su.

661
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:55,998
I told you I'd kill you
if you touched my child.

662
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,167
What? My house isn't this way.

663
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,211
Hae-won made him do it.

664
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,587
You knew, didn't you?

665
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:05,258
I only need to watch
your life getting ruined.

666
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,759
Your husband knows.

667
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:10,429
You dare ask me again…

668
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,181
Where's Ho-su?

669
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,142
It seems you also have many secrets.

670
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,561
Even if it's a lie!

671
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,229
Just say something.

672
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,106
I guess I was right.

673
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,775
In the end, my story…

674
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,029
won't have a happy ending.

675
