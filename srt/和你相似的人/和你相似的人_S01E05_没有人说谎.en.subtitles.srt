1
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,074
A lot of people came.

2
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,201
All of our guests are here.

3
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,745
I can see
that you prepared a lot for this.

4
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,538
Sir.

5
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,571
Say hello.

6
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,491
This is Jeong Hui-ju.

7
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,409
This is Seo Woo-jae.

8
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,792
Hello. I hope you like my work.

9
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,338
Excuse us for a moment.

10
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,306
Thank you for coming.

11
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,058
Can I get an autograph?

12
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,491
Did he recognize you?

13
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,291
I thought he might get
his memory back once he saw you.

14
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,751
I guess I was wrong.

15
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,592
Since he can't recognize you,
I want you to play along.

16
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,469
What are you talking about?

17
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,431
He had an accident,
so he was unconscious for several years.

18
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,892
He lost his memories after that.

19
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,728
But he also lost some of his memories
before the accident.

20
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,188
An accident?

21
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,861
Yes. He's been stuck in Ireland
all these years because of the accident.

22
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,161
Without a passport as
an unidentified illegal alien for years.

23
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,541
Bringing him back to Korea
was quite difficult.

24
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,294
I don't believe you.

25
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:35,256
Exactly. It's hard to believe,
but that's what happened.

26
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,931
I don't know why he was in Ireland,
so far away from here,

27
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,558
and what on earth happened there.

28
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,356
I hope he gets his memories back soon.

29
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,610
I have tons of questions for him.

30
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,822
But he's not able to answer
any of them yet,

31
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,366
so it frustrates me too.

32
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,333
Is it because of his memory loss?

33
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,377
Isn't it fascinating?

34
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,673
Woo-jae hasn't changed one bit.

35
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,599
Right. Didn't you stay in Ireland as well?

36
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,960
HYEON-SEONG

37
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,593
Yes.

38
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,889
Yes. I'm about to eat now.

39
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,642
He's sleeping. Right now, the time is…

40
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,732
What about you, honey?

41
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,736
That's a relief. Is everything all right?

42
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,030
Yes.

43
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,199
Thank you.

44
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,551
I came without any attachments,

45
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,971
but why haven't you put anything aside?

46
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,475
We don't have money.

47
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,979
That's your favorite excuse.

48
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,940
-I can make money--
-Sorry.

49
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,068
I'll end it soon.

50
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,121
Let's eat. Okay?

51
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,983
I wasn't lying.

52
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,695
I did end it.

53
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,825
All these years,
you didn't look for me. No, us.

54
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,038
And I often wondered why you didn't.

55
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,438
And an accident isn't
one of the reasons I imagined.

56
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:21,667
EPISODE 5
NOBODY LIED

57
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,881
-Hello.
-Hello.

58
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,674
-Hi.
-This is the artist, Seo Woo-jae.

59
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,760
I see. Nice to meet you.

60
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,137
-I'm glad that you could make it.
-Of course.

61
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,056
-How was it?
-I thought it was excellent.

62
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,059
-Aren't you excited for his future works?
-Yes. Congratulations.

63
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,352
I'll look forward to it.

64
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,898
All of our guests love your exhibition.

65
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,235
How did you keep his artwork
in such good condition?

66
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,322
Be it artwork or human,
everything crumbles little by little

67
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,324
if they're not cared for.

68
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,744
If the damage became visible,
I wouldn't be able to fix it.

69
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,373
So I checked on them whenever I had time.

70
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,420
Are you all right?

71
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,674
I'll go get some fresh air.

72
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,551
Okay.

73
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,729
Did Mr. Seo tell you about his father?

74
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,523
Pardon?

75
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,944
-No.
-He's talented just like his father.

76
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,614
But luckily, his life doesn't seem
to be like his father's.

77
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,411
Seeing how you two
care deeply about each other.

78
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,862
Is this funny to you?

79
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,287
So should I just play along with you?

80
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,414
Then will that make our past go away?

81
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,006
What is it that you want?

82
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,181
Why are you doing this?

83
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,518
Why? I should be the one asking you.

84
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,855
Did you expect me to pass out in shock
when you showed up like this?

85
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:48,939
Are you having fun?

86
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,817
I think

87
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,363
-you got the wrong--
-Are you kidding me?

88
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,157
You still act like a kid
who doesn't know any better…

89
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,224
Did I…

90
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,770
do something wrong?

91
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,776
You…

92
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,159
Woo-jae.

93
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,334
I appreciate you looking out for him.

94
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,087
But Woo-jae isn't feeling well.

95
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,883
If you have anything to say to him,
you can talk to me from now on.

96
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,302
Let's go and get some rest, Woo-jae.

97
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,401
DONG-MI'S EX, DETECTIVE PARK SANG-HYEON

98
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,072
There's not much
I can find out at this hour.

99
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,366
It's confirmed that
he came back two months ago.

100
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,118
And ever since he got back,

101
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,412
he's been in Eunsung Nursing Hospital.

102
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,514
Yes. Hello.

103
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,766
Who is this?

104
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,603
I'm sorry.

105
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,751
Woo-jae?

106
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,301
Is that you, Woo-jae?

107
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,430
I'm late, aren't I?

108
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,017
I'm sorry.

109
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,478
Sorry for what?

110
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,650
For disappearing on me?

111
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,487
Or for not calling me
over the past four years

112
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,864
when you were alive and well?

113
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,784
For everything.

114
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,956
So you think sorry will cut it?

115
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,875
No. I'll tell you everything
once I get there.

116
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,712
I will tell you everything
and apologize to you properly.

117
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,299
So you want me to wait for you again?
Where are you right now?

118
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,886
Hae-won.

119
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,191
If I wait for you,

120
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,737
will you come?

121
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,241
I will.

122
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,114
But you still didn't come after that call.

123
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,615
I had to find you.

124
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,435
You're up.

125
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,985
You strained yourself too much.
You should get some more sleep.

126
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,363
How long do I have to stay here?

127
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,324
You'll get discharged tomorrow.

128
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,204
Should we just leave now then?

129
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,955
We can do the paperwork tomorrow.

130
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,083
But where do we go?

131
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,168
What do you mean? Home, of course.

132
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,461
Home?

133
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,880
Yes. Our home.

134
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,219
I'm sick of the hospital too.

135
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:33,028
You wanted to live here a long time ago.

136
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,905
Don't you remember?

137
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,284
I guess I did if you say so.

138
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,040
I had to look for this place in a rush
after finding you.

139
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,834
So I haven't unpacked everything yet.

140
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:51,004
Besides, I didn't want to stay here alone,
so I only moved in a few days ago.

141
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,550
I'm sorry.

142
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,097
I'm sorry

143
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,516
for leaving you all alone.

144
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,783
I haven't decided
where to put that up yet.

145
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,910
Can you pick a spot?

146
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:31,170
Did I tell you when we took that photo?

147
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,565
A 74-YEAR-OLD KOREAN MAN DIES
IN A HIT-AND-RUN

148
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,692
KOREAN MAN IN HIS TWENTIES
CAUSES DEATH WHILE DUI IN IRELAND

149
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,695
Did I…

150
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,740
do something wrong?

151
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,702
He's been stuck in Ireland
all these years because of the accident.

152
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,414
I thought he might get
his memory back once he saw you.

153
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,832
I guess I was wrong.

154
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,585
A 74-YEAR-OLD KOREAN MAN DIES
IN A HIT-AND-RUN

155
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,299
Another all-nighter?

156
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,431
You're working so hard.

157
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,475
What is it?

158
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,227
Let me borrow your car tomorrow.

159
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,854
I need to replace the brake pads
due to the noise.

160
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,398
I have to make many stops,
so taking cabs won't do.

161
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,984
I need my car tomorrow morning.

162
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,071
Use mine if you're not going far.
The pick-up is in the afternoon.

163
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,824
Okay. Leave your car key
at the entrance before you go.

164
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,285
Don't take both keys like you did before.

165
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,245
Okay.

166
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,497
-Good night.
-Good night.

167
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,852
-Ho-su.
-No.

168
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,106
It was even cut in half.
Just have one bite.

169
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,233
I won't eat it.

170
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,361
-How was it yesterday?
-What?

171
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,863
You went to a party yesterday.

172
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,866
Parties are all the same.

173
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,868
You've been to my exhibition before.

174
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,413
-Why do you ask?
-What was he like?

175
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,166
I mean, the artist.

176
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,422
I don't know much about him.
This is his first exhibition.

177
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,966
I'm going to the exhibition too.

178
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,052
I received a ticket for that.

179
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,679
From whom?

180
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,183
Mimi. She gave the tickets to Ju-yeong,
telling her to come with me.

181
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,811
She said it was pretty good.
Do you think so too?

182
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,938
-Don't go.
-Why not?

183
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,691
I'm worried about you seeing her again.

184
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,109
She apologized.

185
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,986
Even so.

186
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,864
What she did to you
mustn't be forgiven that easily.

187
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,581
Let's sleep on it.

188
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,375
No need. We decided to go this Friday.

189
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,880
Sorry. I'm late.

190
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,050
But I have to get going now.

191
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,261
You can't be late
for our dinner tonight. Okay?

192
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,683
I'm off now. Ho-su, eat a lot.

193
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,102
-Are you done, Li-sa? Let's go.
-Okay.

194
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,944
-Mom.
-Yes.

195
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,823
Don't touch that. It's dirty.

196
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,910
I'm sorry I threw up.

197
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,166
No.

198
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,086
Don't be sorry, Ho-su.

199
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,505
You didn't do anything wrong.

200
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,466
I'm sorry for raising my voice. Okay?

201
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,843
You didn't do anything wrong, Ho-su.

202
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,846
He's been discharged.

203
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,516
The patient named Seo Woo-jae?

204
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,267
Yes. He left yesterday.

205
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,895
And his guardian came
to finish the paperwork today.

206
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:22,484
Can you tell me why
Mr. Seo Woo-jae was admitted here?

207
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,446
I can't give you his personal information
unless you're his guardian.

208
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,199
She just left. You didn't see her?

I didn't change the sign yet.
I also serve food.

00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,265

-Okay.

That bottle…

219
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,456
This one? I'm keeping it
for another customer.

220
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,791
That's my husband.

221
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,585
A lot of people share the same name.

222
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,463
Families don't share some stories.

223
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,633
And in the afternoon,
I only serve drinks to my regulars.

224
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,928
-I see.
-I saw that you drove here.

225
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,473
I have delicious cabbage rolls
ready today. Just a minute.

226
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:21,645
Then do you remember
who my husband came here with?

227
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,273
He's not the type to drink at a bar alone.

228
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,026
I picked up on this habit
while running a bar.

229
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,863
I tend to forget what happens at my bar.

230
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,323
That makes things easier.

231
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,869
Excuse me.

232
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,919
AN HYEON-SEONG

233
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,719
Hello, ma'am.
This is your husband's mechanic.

234
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,554
Could I come around 2 p.m.?

235
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,849
Everything seems fine
from your electroencephalogram.

236
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,310
Take a look at your head MRI scan.

237
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,689
You'll see a 6mm lump right here.

238
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,525
I suspect that it's an astrocytoma.

239
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,361
But the lump is very small yet,
so it's hard to identify it.

240
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:14,322
You can follow it up every six months.

241
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,574
Then what's the cause for…

242
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,452
Your brain was damaged
due to the accident.

243
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:23,456
But I don't think it had anything to do
with your memory disorder.

244
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,668
You don't seem to have
any cognitive impairments either.

245
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,670
I came here because there's a problem.

246
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,880
I want to find out why.

247
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,968
Memory loss from traumas
usually improves in the first two years.

248
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:38,013
But you missed that window,

249
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,098
so I can't guarantee anything.

250
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,144
Seeing how you're losing
memories before the accident,

251
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,647
it's possible
that you have dissociative amnesia.

252
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,567
So you're basically saying
there's nothing you can do.

253
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,569
Isn't this a fancy way of saying that?

254
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,529
Woo-jae.

255
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,251
I'm sorry.

256
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,545
He must be frustrated the most.

257
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,215
He can see a psychiatrist at our hospital
if he's not seeing one.

258
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,470
He's also showing symptoms of ataxia,
so he probably needs physical therapy too.

259
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,723
Seeing all the doctors in one place
will be more convenient for him.

260
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,475
Right. I was planning to do so.

261
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,518
Then I'll see you at the next appointment.

262
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,605
Doctor.

263
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,567
He's asking me about the past.

264
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,987
Sometimes, even I'm not sure
if what I remember is correct.

265
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,365
Despite that,

266
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,244
do you think I should tell him
how I remember it?

267
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,208
Will he believe it even if it's not true?

268
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,419
He will.

269
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,550
A certain part of his life is blank.

270
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,887
It's very possible
to manipulate his memories

271
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,807
by filling the blank
with the stories you tell him.

272
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,233
The slope of your left shoulder
is at ten degrees

273
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,069
while the slope of your right one
is at 40 degrees.

274
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,988
Which means
your right shoulder is the problem.

275
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,491
Let's check your shoulder rotation.

276
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,411
Make a fist and bend it at a right angle.

277
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:28,289
Rotate it downward. Rotate it more.

278
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,543
Hold on.

279
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,588
Wait. I don't think
this is an accident-related injury.

280
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,427
Did you injure your shoulder here
before the accident?

281
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,348
All right. Let's take it slow.

282
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,281
-Why?
-Wait.

283
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,558
What brings you here?

284
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,855
It's my housekeeper's day off,
but I have a lot of work to catch up on.

285
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,067
-Are you leaving him with my mom?
-Yes.

286
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,444
No hello for your aunt?

287
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,279
Hello.

288
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,619
Our physical therapy program is excellent.

289
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,914
You'll get better if you follow through,
so don't get discouraged.

290
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,457
Okay. Thank you.

291
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,963
You need to get back to work.
Go ahead. I'll drop him off.

292
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:19,400
Did we meet at the gallery the other day?

293
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,905
-Yes.
-So we did.

294
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,450
You looked familiar,
so I was trying to place you.

295
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,915
But I don't think you fully remember me.

296
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,917
I'm sorry.

297
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,337
I've been like this these days.

298
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,174
That must be tough.

299
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,053
Yes. It's tough.

300
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,100
Right. Did you want
to say something to me that day?

301
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,853
No. There was a misunderstanding.
I'm sorry.

302
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,480
It's okay.

303
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,024
First floor.

304
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,455
-Ms. Jeong.
-Hello, sir.

305
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,292
-Yes?
-Neurosurgery had an outpatient named

306
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,878
Seo Woo-jae today.
I'd like to see his medical records.

307
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,796
Please. I need to see them.

308
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,049
-Okay.
-Thank you.

309
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,806
DOCTOR'S NOTE

310
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,641
Thank you.

311
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,190
What did you give her just now?

312
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,919
I chopped a lot of radishes that day,
so I dried them.

313
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,211
Come and take some.

314
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,524
What?

315
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,860
Hello.

316
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,447
-You don't have an appointment today.
-Not me, but a friend.

317
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,657
Who?

318
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,117
Woo-jae. Seo Woo-jae.

319
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,244
I see. Mr. Seo Woo-jae.

320
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,248
He left about ten minutes ago.

321
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,337
-He didn't wait for me?
-Pardon?

322
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,632
I told him to wait.
I clearly told him to wait.

323
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,802
Why don't you call him?

324
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,932
Hold on. Let me call him.

325
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,100
Just a second.

326
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,502
He doesn't have a cell phone.

327
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,630
His physical therapy went well,
so don't worry.

328
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,881
Is that how I look?

329
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,594
Does it look like I'm worried
and nervous to you?

330
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,223
Does it look like
I'm making a fuss over nothing?

331
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,933
No, I mean…

332
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,493
NAME: SEO WOO-JAE

333
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,163
NAME: GU HAE-WON

334
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,082
I have a husband.

335
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,585
Seo Woo-jae.

336
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,026
You're still here?

337
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,910
Are you okay?

338
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,079
I couldn't find Hae-won.

339
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,500
Did you try calling her?

340
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,460
I don't have a cell phone.

341
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,421
And I haven't memorized her number yet.

342
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,054
I think you'll keep missing her
if you stay here.

343
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,806
Why don't you wait for her at home?

344
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,141
I went there for the first time yesterday.

345
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,687
I mean, it felt like
I went there for the first time.

346
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,191
I'm so pathetic.

347
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,908
Well, get in.

348
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,704
I know where you live, so get in.

349
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,299
Why are you staring at me?

350
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,426
You feel like a stranger.

351
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,597
It's just hard to believe you are…

352
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,600
the same person I knew.

353
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,394
Did we know each other?

354
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,107
I guess Hae-won didn't tell you about me.

355
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,860
Like what?

356
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,323
You two used to teach me how to draw.

357
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,533
Pardon?

358
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,624
You don't remember that either.

359
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:00,551
The next request seems
to be even more precious.

360
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:05,014
The next song was requested
by a listener. Here it is.

361
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,116
But I remember
listening to this song a lot.

362
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,466
You can draw this today.

363

DOCTOR'S NOTE, SEO WOO-JAE,
UNIT 402, MINJEONG APARTMENT

364
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,725
MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT
RETROGRADE AMNESIA

365
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,453
I feel bad…

366
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:42,254
I feel really bad that
I keep relying on Hae-won.

367
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:46,675
But she keeps telling me
that I'm a good person.

368
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,513
I really want to be
a good person like she says,

369
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,265
but how can someone always be good?

370
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,311
I know best

371
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,897
that I'm not a good person.

372
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,639
Hey.

373
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,434
I didn't know you came back home.
I kept looking for you.

374
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:47,153
Where else would I go?
This is the only place for me to go.

375
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:54,285
I'm glad that I waited for you at home
like Ms. Jeong suggested.

376
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,370
If not, I would've been…

377
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:06,046
I felt so stupid.
I couldn't remember your phone number.

378
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,216
And I didn't know where our home was.

379
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,345
The artist we met at the gallery
gave me a ride.

380
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,515
Here?

381
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,476
Yes.

382
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,646
She has my phone number.

383
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,774
Why didn't she just call me?

384
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,363
But don't do that next time.

385
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,033
Wait for me.

386
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,037
Okay.

387
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,164
I will.

388
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:47,087
And it seemed that
Ms. Jeong and my doctor know each other.

389
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:52,426
I heard her son calling my doctor Auntie.

390
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,055
Her son?

391
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:57,806
Yes.

392
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,768
He's cute.

393
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,396
It was cute how he was staring at me.

394
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,451
I don't have anyone to call but you.

395
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,246
Exactly. Getting you a phone
will make things easier for me.

396
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,456
-Hello.
-We're here to sign up for a new phone.

397
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,958
Sure. This way, please.

398
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,462
I'll help you fill out these boxes
and go over the plan with you.

399
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,232
Why did you buy so much food?

400
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,109
I'm preparing dinner today.

401
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:53,779
The director of the gallery that's holding
my exhibition is coming over.

402
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,160
Do you have something to tell me?

403
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:04,123
You saw my patient this afternoon
at the hospital.

404
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,124
Mr. Seo Woo-jae.

405
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,337
So you do know him.

406
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,592
Yes.

407
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:19,054
I heard he lost some of his memories
due to an accident.

408
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,639
He'll get better, right?

409
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:26,520
I'm not sure how much progress he'll make,

410
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,731
but his wife really wants him
to get better.

411
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,066
So she's probably doing
everything she can.

412
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,072
-Have a nice dinner then.
-Okay.

413

-They already ate and went upstairs.

00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,370
Please dig in.

422
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,205
Even the dishes look picturesque.

423
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,375
She can cook, at least.

424
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,335
She should've run a restaurant.

425
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,845
Maybe it's because I'm such a horrible
cook, but I'm curious, Ms. Jeong.

426
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,596
How are you good at everything?

427
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,348
I couldn't have done it by myself.

428
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,267
I've had help from my husband.

429
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,190
Exactly. What good is it
if you have no one to share your skills?

430
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:38,986
And your marriage can survive
only because my son tolerates you.

431
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,071
Mom.

432
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,824
Mother, the director wanted
to treat you to a meal

433
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,617
for purchasing an art piece,

434
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,787
but I invited her over for dinner instead
to thank her.

435
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,833
Thank you for purchasing
from the gallery again, ma'am.

436
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,712
Well, I bought it because I heard
I could reduce taxes that way.

437
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,297
I don't know much about art.

438
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,966
I find modern art even more perplexing.

439
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,303
They bring some garbage and call it art.

440
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,387
I don't get it.

441
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,431
But it will be very expensive garbage.

442
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:11,768
The price of the artwork you purchased
will go up several times in five years

443
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,312
if the artist takes off.

444
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,771
Can you guarantee that?

445
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:18,567
Yes. My job is
to increase an artist's value

446
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,569
and guarantee such growth.

447
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,531
Then do you think
her art will sell well too?

448
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,202
-We spent a lot of--
-This isn't a business deal.

449
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,038
-Let's not talk about money.
-I wasn't done talking.

450
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,831
Is cutting me off fun for you?

451
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,505
I'll go and check.

452
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,547
Okay.

453
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,179
Ms. Jeong's pieces already sell well.

454
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,389
She always sells all of her pieces.

455
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,934
We don't know
how much the value will go up,

456
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:55,354
so if we could, we'd like to keep
her artwork for three years at least.

457
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,491
Hui-ju, were you having dinner?

458
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,287
How dare you show up here again?

459
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,289
You came to my house too.

460
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,588
Thank you for driving Woo-jae home.

461
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,635
-Take it. I want to show my appreciation.
-What's going on?

462
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,471
It's a package.

463
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,366
Hae-won.

464
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,342
Are you okay?
Should we sit down for a bit?

465
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,635
Sure.

466
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,315
This is nice.

467
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,068
Walking and talking with you.

468
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,616
Things I took for granted before

469
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,576
have all become special to me.

470
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,953
So I like ordinary things like this.

471
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,667
You haven't changed one bit,

472
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,795
so I feel weird when I look at you.

473
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,049
You haven't changed either.

474
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,218
No.

475
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:55,057
I've gone through all the days
that you skipped.

476
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,728
Our lives have been so different
during those days.

477
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,862
Then you can fill my days.

478
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,074
So we can be on the same path.

479
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,585
Right.

480
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:27,506
I heard I taught Ms. Jeong how to draw.

481
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,426
Is that what she said?

482
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,638
Yes. She told me when she dropped me off.

483
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,223
That's not true.

484
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,227
You didn't teach her. I did.

485
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,687
You just filled in for me.

486
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,689
When my grandpa was injured,

487
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,191
you subbed for me.
It was only for a brief time.

488
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:48,568
She implied that
I taught her for a long time.

489
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,987
She liked you.

490
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,283
She kept asking you
to give her more lessons.

491
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,745
But you said no.

492
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,498
I did?

493
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,836
I was busy then preparing
for my senior portfolio and to go abroad.

494
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,548
So I wanted you to take over.

495
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:17,222
But you were
quite uncomfortable around Hui-ju.

496
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,608
That's not a lie.

497
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,241
Woo-jae! We can apply
for the visa as spouses.

498
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:43,623
We just have to translate these documents.
What was that called?

499
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,542
Right. Apostilles.

500
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,128
We just have to get them notarized
and submit them.

501
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,633
Since we're going there as spouses,
we need a marriage certificate.

502
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,011
So as long as we take care of that…

503
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,387
You want to get married?

504
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,931
We were going to anyway.

505
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:04,686
For the initial funds,
we will need about 15 to 20 million won.

506
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,439
The money I saved from my jobs,
the deposit on my studio,

507
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,524
and the rent from this place
will be enough.

508
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,569
And in Germany, we can have part-time jobs
with student visas,

509
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,862
so if we need more--

510
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,989
Must we do all that,
just so I can join you?

511
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:20,577
Yes, we must.
I don't think I can do this without you.

512
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,497
-You've been helping me with--
-It was all you.

513
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,291
I only watched you.

514
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,210
So you should keep watching me.

515
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:33,548
Hui-ju wants to take lessons from you
since I'll be busy preparing to go abroad.

516
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,343
-With the fees from her, we--
-I won't do it.

517
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,054
-What?
-Tell her I won't.

518
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,099
Why not? That's
a lot of money for a month.

519
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:52,943
I'll figure something out
to get enough money for us.

520
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,280
But I feel uncomfortable going abroad

521
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,533
with her money.

522
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,162
It was true
that he was uncomfortable with her.

523
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:28,186
After Woo-jae saw your son,
he kept saying how adorable your son was.

524
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,939
I figured you have everything you need,

525
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,566
so I'm sending a gift for Ho-su.

526
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,623
Darn it. Why won't she pick up?

527
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,629
You've gone mad.
You finally lost it, didn't you?

528
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,508
Sir, give me a cold glass of water.

529
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:12,230
Haven't you learned anything?
How can you get back together with him?

530
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,942
I didn't get back together with him.
Legally, we never broke up.

531
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,654
-You're married?
-Exactly.

532
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,948
She registered her marriage
when she was young.

533
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,366
So shockingly, she's married.

534
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,827
He ditched you and your plan.

535
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,705
So you guys broke up long ago.
But what? You never broke up?

536
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,415
Unbelievable.

537
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,709
Hey, let me see that jerk's face.

538
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,294
Let's see how shameless he is.

539
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,546
-You've never met him?
-Exactly!

540
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,756
He ruined her life!

541
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,842
Grinding his tongue on asphalt
won't be enough to satisfy me.

542
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,305
He had an accident.

543
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,806
What?

544
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,559
He didn't disappear on me.

545
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,395
He had an accident.

546
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,732
Even so. How could he ghost you
for several years?

547
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,151
Hey, that's an excuse.

548
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,488
He was unconscious for years.

549
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,949
He couldn't have called even if he wanted.

550
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:07,452
Goodness. You fool. Did you buy that?

551
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:12,582
Goodness. How could a daughter of mine
be so foolish? Oh, dear.

552
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,257
So? What's your plan?

553
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,885
You'll look after that jerk
and waste your life again?

554
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,430
I want to do

555
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:30,976
the things I never got to do

556
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,520
and the things I should have done.

557
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,402
I'm the only one
he remembers from his past.

558
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,031
All of the things that I missed out on,

559
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,283
I'll do them.

560
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,287
I will put everything…

561
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,791
back in its rightful place.

562
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,635
THE MEANING OF SILENCE,
FROM DRAWING TO CARVING

563
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,815
I'm sure she invited you here
for a reason.

564
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,276
Take your time.
I'll wait for you at the cafe.

565
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,262
I'm so envious.

566
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:50,722
Let's go.

567
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,101
Are you here to see the director?

568
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,480
That's one of the reasons.

569
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,566
You don't usually come in.

570
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,568
All my interviews were scheduled today.

571
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:09,240
I see. What about Hae-won?

572
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,284
She's feeling under the weather.

573
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:15,455
I wanted her to rest at home,
so I put her to sleep and left quietly.

574
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,501
She must have had a lot on her plate
because of me lately,

575
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,419
but she never shows it.

576
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,379
And then, her body breaks down.

577
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,507
You must've had a lot of interviews.

578
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,759
I was surprised.

579
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,929
From what I remember, you had
a hard time even showcasing your art.

580
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,139
Maybe it's because I wasted a few years.

581
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,934
I want my career to take off.

582
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,020
I want to be successful just like you.

583
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,524
Hae-won went through a lot all alone.

584
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,901
I want to make it up to her somehow.

585
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,947
She must be so happy to hear that.

586
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,615
All right, then.

587
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,086
I'm also headed that way.

588
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,306
What would you like?

589
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,724
-Lemonade…
-Lemonade…

590
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,145
And the syrup?

591
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,688
-Half a pump…
-Half a pump…

592
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:24,858
Mom.

593
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:28,486
Hey.

594
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,749
Why did you come out so soon?

595
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,169
-Li-sa--
-It's boring.

596
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:49,132
I don't get it. And it's eerie to look at.

597
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,676
Why did she want us to see this?

598
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,220
-Li-sa.
-Who's this guy?

599
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,516
-I--
-The artist of the exhibit you badmouthed.

600
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,393
I see.

601
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:06,149
By the way, you're so handsome.
You look like a model.

602
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:08,026
-Hey.
-He is handsome.

603
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,486
You ogled at him too.

604
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,864
-Where are you going?
-The restroom.

605
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,704
Can we take a photo?

606
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,415
And can I upload the photo
on my social media?

607
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,375
He doesn't like taking photos--

608
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,460
Sure.

609
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,262
He's someone else.

610
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,306
PROMO: ART BOOK, FREE SHIPPING

611
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,267
You're not the Seo Woo-jae I knew.

612
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,765
What's Li-sa doing?

613
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,142
She's sleeping.

614
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,480
When will Ms. Gu's
disciplinary action be settled?

615
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,400
Look how much Li-sa changed.

616
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,652
Isn't Ms. Gu responsible for it?

617
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,862
It'll be done soon. Don't worry.

618
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,573
I'm worried, so do it quickly.

619
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,909
I don't want you or Li-sa
to see her in private.

620
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,705
If my relationship with Li-sa gets worse…

621
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:58,511
It's not easy
for a child to hate a parent.

622
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:04,309
She just needs some time now.

623
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,689
Sometimes, I think about my father.

624
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,528
He didn't do it often,

625
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,990
but he told me some loving words
and showed me warmth.

626
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:25,455
There are times when I miss them utterly.

627
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:29,083
Then I feel regrettable and guilty.

628
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,673
I loathed my father,
but even I miss him at times.

629
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,429
Li-sa is lucky.

630
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,392
To have a dad like you.

631
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,569
That junk car stalled
on top of the bridge.

632
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:46,494
You walked home from the bridge
in this weather?

633
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:48,955
What could I do?
I couldn't call anyone for help.

634
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,811
I really hate hearing useless sounds.

635
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,188
The creaking sound of misaligned windows.

636
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:18,192
The rattling sound of the fridge.
The sound of coughs from next door.

637
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,780
Why don't you try drawing those sounds?

638
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:29,871
As you do, they'll grow on you.

639
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,876
I don't want to love such sounds.
I'm so sick of them.

640
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:17,335
JEONG HUI-JU

641
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:27,345
JEONG HUI-JU'S SOLO INVITATIONAL EXHIBIT

642
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:29,806
-Thank you for coming.
-It was a nice exhibition.

643
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,184
Gosh. Thank you for inviting me.

644
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,936
It was my pleasure.

645
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,772
Honey. Congratulations.

646
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:41,234
I know you worked hard for this.

647
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:48,366
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

648
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,993
-You came. Thank you.
-Congratulations.

649
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,289
Hui-ju.

650
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,315
Congratulations.

651
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:25,570
I'm so happy to see that
you've become such a successful artist.

652
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:28,906
I mean it.

653
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,248
Hello. Nice seeing you here.

654
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:50,678
It's been a while. How have you been?

655
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:53,741
AN HYEON-SEONG

656
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,217
Where is Woo-jae?

657
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,928
He is long gone.

658
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:17,139
What were you and Ms. Gu
talking about back there?

659
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:22,979
Don't you ever approach my family again.

660
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,605
But why did you?

661
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,901
I can't trust myself.

662
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:32,446
I feel like I did something awful to her.

663
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,532
You never had any respect for me.

664
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,575
Are you trying to get revenge?

665
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,244
I'm giving you a warning.

666
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,454
I won't sit still this time.

667
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:44,375
Did I run away from you?

668
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:50,965
